Tom Bomdadil sounds just as I imagined he would. Sam's voice is childish, but for the most part endearing because of that. I imagine this is how he sounded at nine when he first met Frodo and you can easily hear how much he loves his master as this version includes my favorite scene from Book IV as Sam watches Frodo sleep and the light that is shining from within and says to himself, \\"I love him\\" and the loving reunion in the tower. Both are interesting inclusions because Americans usually shy away from the showing of same-sex affection so this was welcome in showing that beautiful, pure bond of theirs. The scene with the Barrow-wights is very well done and quite terrifying. You can very easily understand why Frodo would have been scared enough to want to run away. The narrator's voice sometimes gets really caught up in the action, dramatically describing the fell beast of the Ring-wraiths or especially Sauron's realization that he is doomed as Frodo puts on the Ring. I almost felt sorry for the Dark Lord there for a minute as he frantically sends his Nazgul to stop that little one, but then I crowed in delight, \\"Too late! Too late!\\" Unfortunately, the narrator is the only one that is enthused in this, except for Sam. Frodo is quite lackluster. Don't try to take the Ring away from him, but otherwise you have no idea that his soul is being torn apart. When he claims the Ring/is claimed by the Ring is done well though."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I find this book to be the best amongst the 3 books.

J.R.R. Tolkien, eminent translator and scholar, brings Middle-earth to life in The Fellowship of the Ring. A fellowship of nine companions sets out to destroy the One Ring: four naive hobbits, two valiant men, one dexterous elf, one steadfast dwarf, and the unassuming wizard Gandalf.The Fellowship of the Ring enthralls with enchanting moments like Bilbo's birthday party but chills the blood with its ghastly Black Riders. Written in the high style of ancient pre-history like Tolkien's prequel The Hobbit, once underway, Fellowship is a page-turner. Using third person limited narration, but often seen through the eyes of Ring-bearing hobbit Frodo, it recounts the first stage of the companions' journey. Tolkien's world is so real that I want to live there. The grandfather of all fantasy and science fiction, The Lord of the Rings is a must-read trilogy for all fans of those genres.

Tolkien's world and its history are painstakingly detailed. Characters and motivations are deep and complex. The descriptive writing is breathtaking.In the second and third books, the story lines divide and become more complicated. But in \\"Fellowship,\\" the plot moves forward in a powerfully continuous straight line. The only place where the action stalls is the chaper \\"The Council of Elrond\\" in which the reader is fed huge amounts of information and backstory very quickly. For those interested in the history of Tolkien's world, however, this chapter is a bonanza.The Lord of the Rings should be required reading in high school. Forget Shakespeare -- this is English literature at its absolute best."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Let me begin by saying that I adore Tolkein and love The Lord of the Rings. With that out of the way, I have to admit that of the three books, Fellowship is definitly the weakest. Because Tolkein viewed the trilogy as a single novel, book one is almost entirely exposition. The story doesn't really get moving until more than halfway through the book.Also, a lot of people have difficulty with Tolkein's language. This is one of my favourite parts of the book, but he is wordy and descriptive so it does take him a long ime to say anything. That said, reading his books is like reading epic poetry. His words flow the same way the language in a good version of The Oddessy or Beowulf does so it can be easy to get caught up in the flow of the language. I find that this helps me get through the books, as I get so immersed in the story that I have trouble coming out of it when I need to stop. Also, the flow of the words makes his lengthy description run past quickly.On a less technical note, Tolkein's characterization and plotting are magnificent. As slowly as Fellowship moves, you can feel the action building into something grand and vast. His characters are complex and vibrant, and they all have a well-developed range of actions and motivations. Even the pure, otherworldly characters have things that irritate them and make them snappish. This is traditional fantasy, so there is little depth to the evil characters, and a nearly inexhaustible supply of easily defeated minions, but it's not really noticable within the context of the story."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This is the first book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Tolkien takes the world of Middle Earth that he developed and continues the tale of the ring. The ring first appears to us in 'The Hobbit'. The hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, keeps this special ring he found on his journey to help the dwarves. This book picks up the story decades after 'The Hobbit'.Bilbo has aged and in the course of celebrating his birthday leaves the Shire. To everyone's surprise Bilbo gives everything to his nephew Frodo, including the ring. Many years go by, and the wizard returns with a warning to take the ring and leave.Frodo and three friends begin the trip. Along the way the meet the Ranger who helps them get to Rivendell, home of the elves. At Rivendell the true identity of the ring is revealed and a course of action is decided upon. The ring must be destroyed.A band of nine people (men, elf, dwarf, wizard, and hobbits) form the Fellowship and begin the journey. This book sets the stage for the coming War of the Ring. We are introduced the members of the fellowship, gives us some background on Sauron, and the rings of power. We get a sense for the evil that the group is up against and the obstacles in their way. And soon realize that this journey is near impossible and may just be delaying the rise of Sauron.At times this book is hard to read. Tolkien goes into great detail regarding the history of Middle Earth and the characters involved in the story. This may hard for some readers to get through or keep track of. I, on the other hand, think these details add to the richness of the story. The story is wonderful and has much more detail than the recent movies. If you enjoyed 'The Hobbit' and/or the films, I would recommend reading the books to get the full story of the ring."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"This book starts off with a birthday party at hobbit named Bilbo's house,Gandalf the grey has come with his fireworks and Frodo another hobbit is excited. Everyone loves Gandalf's fireworks in the shire. Frodo is recieving Bilbo's house because he is leaving, he is going through his stuff when he comes across a gold ring. Gandalf does comes in and is afraid to touch or even come near the ring, he senses evil and tells frodo with his friend Sam to get the ring out of the shire. On their way out of the shire they find Merry and Pippin stealing vegetables from a garden. They get to the town of bree and they meet an ranger fron the north known as Aragorn. Meanwhile Gandalf the grey rode to the White city of Minas Tirith to study the history of this ring. He finds its dark past and goes to the tower of orthanc for counsel from Saruman the white, he finds that he is corrupt by the power of sauron's control. Meanwhile the nine nazgul are after the group and frodo gets stabbed by one of their poisonous morgul blades. A elven wizard rode Frodo to the elven city of grey havens, in order to find to heal him. At the city Gandalf tells the counsel of the ring and decides to start the fellowship of the ring.

Followed by Legolad and Gimli the dwarf, and Merry, Sam and Pippin will go too. Thus starts the fellowship if the ring, they start off good until they get into the mines of moria. There Gandalf fights the mighty balrog and get thrown over the bridge into the firey abyss. This was a big blow to the fellowship, but after that they get canoes and head down the river.

I've heard a lot of people complain that the movies didnt' follow the books closely enough and that they could have been much better if they had done so. However, after reading this first book of the trilogy, I can honestly say that I personally enjoyed the movie more than the book.. I found it to be more exciting and awe-inspiring. It may just be that I saw the movie before I read the book (a sin, I know) and my first impression was just so great that I'll never forget it and it would be very dificult to out-do, but there are just some parts of the story in which I think were improved upon in the movie.While both the book and the movie are undoubtably two of the best pieces of art in their genres, they should be considered to be two distinct works. The movie included a few things that the book didn't and ommited a few things that the book dwelt on. While some people think that the movie should have been identical to the book as much as possible, I am glad that the director felt some degree of artistic freedom and was able to make some adjustments that he felt would make for a better movie (and which I agree with).. The book wasn't written as a movie and some of the story just wouldn't have been as good in a movie. Anyway, maybe its just by bias because of my having watched the movie before reading the book, but I thought the movie really outdid itself and was able to improve on the story.I still think that this is a wonderful book and realize that Tolkien is the Godfather of all that is Fantasy."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Frodo Baggins the Hobbit hero of the Fellowship of the ring, is the main character in this fantasy book, Frodo Baggins is given a magical ring that turns the wearer invisible and slowly takes control of the wearer. The ring was lost after the war and was found by Gollum in a river. Gollum wore the ring far too much and became a hidous cave-dwelling monster, he calls the ring his &quot;birthday present&quot;. One day Bilbo Baggins who you can read about in The Hobbit( which in my opinion is much better than this book) came upon the ring and took it away. Bilbo sensing its evil power working on him, gives the ring to Frodo Baggins in the begining of The Fellowship. This book tells of Frodo and his companions begining their quest to destroy the One Ring of Power, forge by the Master of Mordor, the land of the shadows, they must bring it to cast the ring in the cracks of doom to destroy it. Tolkien goes into paragraph upon paragraph of detail. The first few hundred pages are very boring and some chapters have nothing of importance in the story at all, like the chapter The house of Tom Bamlibado or something, this tells of how Frodo stops his quest to rest in Tom's house and listen to Tom's pointless,long, and boring stories. There are two chapters in the book that are very fun to read. The only reason you don't stop reading even when you are dieing of boredom, is the promised and hinted excitment in future chapters. The battle with the evil wolves lasts only two pages and the rest is 20 pages of how Frodo gathers fire wood and walks( oh who cares).Too much detail, so what if their walking over mountains, it doesn't take 2 paragraphs to say they walked over a MOUNTAIN! VERY BORING BOOK! If you have got the patience to read this you can probaly get through it alive.I rank all the Lord of the Rings books I've read out of 10.1. The Hobbit 102. The Two Towers 83.

Tolkien have done a truly marvellous work. What, then, is my problem with this Father of Fantasy, you ask?Look at it this way, Tolkien created a new language, a world full of creatures that have become a model to the modern fantasy. But when it comes to characterization and persona? It drops down like a rock.Elves, by all and every mean, are all-knowing and all-wise; they are forces of good, they never make a mistake, they are immortal - practically, they're one step away from being divine. Orcs and other so-called evil villians, on the other hand, are evil, savage... etc. It's a world of black and white, and that's my point. There's no twist, no intrigue, no whatever that adds depth we readers wish to see from modern fantasy authors. Aragorn, for instance, is a rightful heir to the throne, a skilled Ranger, and so forth. But does he have any flaw in character? No. And everyone knows well how boring and unlikeable a perfect character is.The way he wrote it is out of date; it may remain popular and a favourite in others' minds. But not me."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"There are some good and bad things to say about this book. The first of which is probably this. I think it's unfair that some people call this the greatest series of books ever written. Then again, in looking at some of the reviews, calling it total garbage is also unfair as well.In all, this is a good fantasy book. However, I must caution that if you are really into fantasy, this is not going to do it for you. Why? Well, really it has mostly to do with the fact that there is no one main character that can overcome everything. When the chips are down, so to speak, hope, luck, and a little ingenious intervention must be used by the &quot;good guys&quot; to escape trouble.This isn't to say the book does not have it's negatives, because clearly it does. But let's start with a positive and go from there. The first is that this is a very rich story. Of course, this is part of it's downfall too. There is a lot of history that only a Lord of the Rings scholar would be interested in or would be able to follow. The lore of the ring is one thing. But every character's history is handed down to the reader. Is it rich? Yes. Is it very hard to follow? Well, if you don't want to take notes, yes.Along these lines, one of the biggest complaints I see from people is that Tolkein should have handed this story to someone else to write, and I can see that perspective. There are a lot of flowery yet empty descriptions. But for me that wasn't too much of a turnoff. In mentally building a scene, I like to have it painted before me. Still, there were times when I was edgy to get the narrative moving. There were other times when I was downright bored by the lack of action.Bringing that thought around again, however, it leads me to proclaim that this narrative is more believable in that fashion. Classic fantasy books have balls to the wall action from cover to cover. This is not the case here. As such, this is more believable as a story that does really exist somewhere and Tolkein merely related that story to our world. The action is not overly sensational. Nothing is &quot;over&quot; anything. Of course, this is what makes people like it less.The ending of the book is dreadfully slowr. This is something that I take issue with. Someone else mentioned that there is no character development, and I think this is true. But I also think it's true that there doesn't need to be character development in what equates to a journey of a ring with a various number of escorts. The &quot;character developmet&quot; is essentially what you learn about the ring and the powers that exist to get it.One thing I particularly do not like is the excessive songs and poems. I think they add little to the story and only sevre to derail the reader who genuinely wants to see the story develop, not take another detour into history or a different tangent altogether. I wouldn't mind songs entirely, I don't think. But some are 3 pages long and read very dry.Ok, so those are my complaints, which started out as what was supposed to be a positive. Well, the positives are that the book is very enjoyable if you don't want a big strong lead character to destroy every foe in his wake. You likely will not sit down and get back up again when you're done. The book doesn't read that fluidly from cover to cover. Some things take digesting.I would recommend this book for just about anyone. Of course, you should read the Hobbit first, as it is the prequel to this series. The Hobbit is a bit more enjoyable than the first read but a tad younger in its target audience, I believe. This first part of the Lord of the Rings is a solid first step, but moves a bit more slowly and contains a fair amount of info not needed to really get at the unfolding narrative in front of you."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I searched high and low for depth in this book. I looked in the dialogue between characters, naively thinking that sooner or later they had to betray something profound in their speech, something to intellectually justify this work's existence. I looked in the actions, the adventures, the songs - and I have concluded that Tolkien's epic, while engrossing and undoubtedly creative, lacks any real substance. When I read a piece of literature, I look for richness both in detail and in relevance to the human struggle. And though a central focus of this book and The Lord of the Rings in general is the ancient struggle between good and evil, this struggle is too often lost in Tolkien's obsessive detail. For instance, the second chapter of the first book and its significance is the reason I rated this book 3 of 5; it chronicles the struggle between good and evil, and for a moment drew me in, as though I was vested in Frodo's dire business. But soon after, the narrative of the book becomes overburdened with elf-chants and adventures that are compounded by Tolkien's linguistically savvy but stylistically flawed prose. The narrative maintained my interest, but barely. I prefer literature that makes me think; but Fellowship of the Ring does not make me think - everything I would possibly need to know about it is immediately obvious at a glance."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"&quot;One ring to rule them all and bind them in darkness.&quot; In ancient times these rings were crafted by 11 smiths, another ring was crafted by zauron to rule over all of these rings. This ring somehow finds its way into the hands of Bilbo Baggins (as read in the book The Hobbit), a small hobbit from hobbiton (being that all hobbits are small). In this book it starts out as Bilbo's one hundred and eleventh birthday. At the end of a huge party he summons his nephew Frodo to his hole (where he lives), he shows and tells Frodo the powers of the ring and his mission, to destroy it!The only way this ring can be destroyed is by taking it to the place it was crafted, the cracks of doom. Frodo forms a group to accompany him on his journey (these men are later known as the fellowship). They set out across Middle Earth to the cracks of doom. Along the way they meet many evil creatures and houses of friends to stop at. The book becomes very intense and exciting. Many surprising things happen along the way.This book is very entertaining and descriptively written. One thing I did not like was how it got kind of repetitious with the fellowship being attack them someone being kidnapped then being rescued then being attack etc...The book is also quite long and some how tiring to read."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I think I'll be one of the few dissenting opinions here. The only real reason I read this was because, like so many other people, I had it drilled into my head what a &quot;classic&quot; it was. I managed to slog through the first book, after several aborted attempts, and there I stopped. I can kind of see where these people are coming from, who trumpet it as the all-time greatest thing ever. In one aspect, Tolkien was something of a genius--Middle Earth is an incredibly rich and detailed world. However, that doesn't make the books that take place there particularly good. The dialogue is less than sparkling, and the meticulous detail in which everything is described becomes really, really, tedious. The characters are incredibly two-dimensional--Tolkien's obviously more interested in showing us his world than in creating sympathetic protagonists. That's his choice, I suppose, but it really doesn't make for interesting reading. As far as characterization goes, there are two main types of characters: the pathetic little hobbit guys (Frodo, Merry, Sam, et al), and the powerful, cool, mysterious guys (Gandalf, Aragorn, Elrond, et al)--nothing too deep here. On a another note, I've noticed that there are really virtually no female characters--just Frodo's irritating relative, Goldberry, and a few elves, if memory serves. Gads, this is overrated, and the worst part is that it spawned so many even worse imitators--Terry Brooks, Tad Williams, and so on. If you want REAL classic fantasy, you should check out Fritz Leiber's Lankhmar series--it's superior in nearly every way."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I couldn't really get into this book. I'm such a big fan of the movies, and the beginning of this book is just too slow.

The action sequence in the mines, ending with the fall for Gandalf, and the dilemma, betrayal and regret of Boromir, are both done very well.Now, about the whole series.Tolkien's &quot;Earth&quot; is formed out of a mixture of various elements of European myths and superstitions, transformed to form elaborate histories and characteristics of the various groups involved. There is an undercurrent of racist ideology, but if you ignore that, the whole effect is rather charming. There is a sense of doom and foreboding and danger, which is well-done, if a bit too drawn-out.I have to confess: I don't understand the extraordinary popularity enjoyed by this book throughout the U.S. and the West. It's a charming series, and the universe described is grand and all that, but does it really deserve the biblical status it seems to have gained?The racial subtext seems to be unnoticed by Tolkien fans. The whole series is a story of the good West &amp; North (elves, hobbits, western men) fighting the evil East and South (Sauron, orcs, eastern men). The Eastern men have &quot;oliphants&quot;, evoking the image of elephant armies from India. Tolkien describing orcs is suspiciously reminiscent of Europeans describing black Africans.Maybe the correct context can be found by thinking of the psyche of a British man (Tolkien) in the early twentieth century, also involved with racist South Africa. The European history of subjugating and raping Asia and Africa, seems to such a person a gallant tale of victory. And so it is reflected in the tale of elves, men, dwarves together defeating &quot;Sauron&quot; in the past.Now, in the early twentieth century, the Asians struggle for freedom. In the mind of the racist Brit, this is an evil challenge to Western hegemony. In the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, this is reflected as the new danger from Sauron gathering power in the East.If you disregard the racial undertones, the series is a fine piece of literary work.Does it deserve all the hype it gets? Maybe not.Is it worth reading? Yes, if you can spare the time, certainly. You start to understand many cultural references after you've worked through Lord of the Rings. Next time someone says, &quot;like Bilbo Baggins ...&quot;, or refers to some bearded guy as a Gandalf, you know what they mean."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I decided to read this book because it is a classic and everyone has read it.

There is so many great characters that it is difficult to choose a favorite one,but I would probaly say I liked the hobbits,the elves,Gandalf,and Aragorn the best.Merry and Pippen are the most engaging hobbits but Frodo is the bravest and most serious. He would have to be my favorite character.Tolkien uses great imagination and description. There is not one dull chapter.Some chapters,like the ones in Lorien are very lovely while others,like in Moria and the barrow downs are terrifying.This is defiantly a great story and I recommend it along with The Hobbit and the other two in the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Is the best fantasy novel.

It is THE BEST. End of story. Once you start this or any of Tolkien's books, you won't stop until you've read them all. Believe me, I've done just that.

This is the first fantasy story I can remember reading, way back in 1973 when I was in fifth grade, and even though I know now the story inside out, I never am tired of this book.For some reason, I find it more magical than books 2 and 3, probably because there is still a sense of innocence and youth about the main characters, and we still do not realize the full horrid power of Sauron. I enjoy the many songs and stories written, the more so because it is seldom done anymore because it would sound phony or contrived by other authors. To be short: This series built the fantsasy genre as we know it today. The majority of authors out there have,conciously or not, put aspects of this tale in their books. That, I believe, is about the greatest testament to the power of this trilogy. It's wonderful"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The LOTRs trillogy, and The Hobbit are -The- best fantasy books ever written, period. Anyone who thinks that they are such an incredibly gifted reviewer as to point out &quot;these books certainly have thier flaws&quot; like I have seen in a few reviews really seems preety egotistical and ignorant. The imagery and characters of this book surpass all others and the action, suspence and humor are like the books themselves, on a level of thier own. These are the fantasy books that all others wish they were, and they were written nearly fifty years ago in a time when &quot;fantasy&quot; was not a very accepted gener, for that matter The Hobbit was written in 1938! Anyone who says this book is sluggish and borish and that 100 pages that dealt with nothing but descriptions and references to things not even concerning the books needs to give up on conquring the -Extremly Tedious- art of thinking and go back to thier TV set were everything is painted out for them bit by bit. Everything in this book is there for a reason, and builds the world for the reader.These books are hyped, and for a reason, if u go into reading them with the &quot;this better be the best book ever or else&quot; mindset you will find a reason or make on up to dislike them, instead go into the book and find out -Why- everyone thinks there so good.Long live the KING.slaybak"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The Lord of the Rings trilogy (Including the Hobbit) are absolutely the best books I've ever read. There is so much sensory and depth involved, you can't help but be sucked into the story. I don't know about anyone else, but the pictures painted in my mind of characters such as Gollum, are vivid and sometimes scary. This is DEFINATELY something every household should buy. Even my brother (age 12) loves it (although he probably doesn't understand it fully).

I do agree that the very beginning of the book is a bit trivial, but it sets up the rest of the story incredibly well. Of course, the other way is the ultimate 5 star way, which i would give to the other two books. the second half of this book is absolutely stunning while the later part of the first half gets really intersting as well. The only reason this book does not get 5 star is the slight slow start.

In the Hobbit Bilbo finds a magical ring that he takes home with him. Then around fifty years later he gives the ring to his heir Frodo. After sometime he finds out it is the ring that Sauron the evil character of the book wants. If Sauron gets the ring he can rule middle earth how ever he likes. So Frodo must take it to the one place it can be destoyed. But that place is in the center of Sauron's kingdom. So Frodo and a few friends set out on an epic journey to Sauron's kingdom. I would definenetly recommend that you read the Hobbit before you read this book.

Oh well, there might be my own life. The protagonists are classical heroes or losers, the telling is epic - it compares, somehow, to the bible. Ever read the bible as a book that tells about adventures, dreams, goals and mystery? If not, do it, if so, read about the hobbit that accomplished Sysiphus's work. There are other novels, of course.

Many think it's an amazing piece of work, it is very different from everything else, and I don't like it at all.Why I didn't like this book is after the beginning it gets extremely boring. The detail is overwhelming. The language is exausting. I'm constantly asking my self 'erm... why is Whatshisname, son of Whatshisnamewithslightchange harkithing to thy for someith reasonith'? It just seems to prattle on and on about one thing over and over again. Have you ever read a book and just became so bored with it you kept on reading but weren't paying attention to what you were reading? I had to keep going back to read over pages that I had just read over (and no I don't have ADD or ADHD).And why I gave it 2 stars and not 1 is because, HOLY CRAP, this is the most detailed book I have ever read, seen, or heard of. Just the fact that anyone could come up with this highly detailed (boring, repetitive, confusing) story is something that deserves 2 stars.I know I'm going to get a whole bunch of angry LotR fans ambush me with a bombardment of 'not helpful' votes, but oh well...Recomended books:Harry Potter seriesDa Vinci CodeAngels and DemonsThe Adventures of Tom SawyerThe Adventures of Huckleberry FinnThe Adventures of Sherlock HolmesThe Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I know everyone says Tolkien started it all...blah blah balh...Everyone else is a rip off...blah blah blah.But I read Hobbit, then I forced myself to finish Fellowship, then got half way through the next book and gave up.I've got one word for this book...BORING! Too many songs...I found myself sifting through chapter when Tolkien decides he is going to spend 50 pages on a meal or a night of talking.I read these books following my reading of the Shannara series (Sword, Elfstones, Wishsong) and there is no comparison. Terry Brook's novels are sooo much more exciting and compelling with the perfect amount of character development and scene descriptions. I don't 6 pages of a scene description like TOlkien does. The Hobbit seems like a Childs book to me, since there really isn't much of a evil force. Fellowship just bored the living hell out of me. I put the book down for several weeks at a time since I fell asleep just about every time I read it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I know this is going to rile the defenders of the novels, but the films were much better. I remember how the \\"purists\\" were all up in arms when Peter Jackson changed the plots around, involved characters in certain areas, completely deleated others, etc. Well, I have to say, Jackson did a better job in telling Tolkien's work than Tolkien did.Tolkien's problem I think is that he created such a complex fantasy world with so much detail that he spent his whole time telling us about every single minor character and the minute details of every scene and completely forgot to move the plot along.There were times when I was reading this series and I thought, \\"wait, wasn't that a part that was pretty big in the movie?\\" Such as the Ringwraith's attack on Weathertop or the battle of Helms Deep. These events were described with as much emotion and excitement as if Tolkien were describing his morning routine.And I ended up groaning when one of his characters would launch into a long speech about how he ended up somewhere or especially when one of the Hobbits would talk about the Shire. At one point in \\"The Two Towers,\\" Gandalf actually warns Theodan NOT to bring up such topics...I wonder if Tolkien himself even figured out he was spending too much time on these pointless back stories.Don't get me wrong, I love reading books that are rich in depth but this is a bit too deep.Then there are the songs and poems which are nice but...I stopped reading them after a while and went on with the story.The entire premise of the Lord of the Rings was supposed to be a conflict of good vs. evil and trying to stop evil from obtaining the one ring. Sadly, much of the book is devoted to telling us how these Elves ended up here and what happened at these ruins and who was there...again, all stuff that probably would have been better in a companion piece rather than clumsily put into the story like a concrete roadblock.The plot itself was also odd. Now I understand that Tolkien wanted to publish his work all in one giant book but was forced to divide it up. The man obviously doesn't know about climax and plot resolution and this is where Peter Jackson came in. The end of the first book just ends...Frodo dissappears and the rest of the fellowship are looking for him. The beginning of the second book starts with Aragorn finding a mortally wounded Boromir; we don't even get to read about the heroic stand of Boromir, just that he fought well but was overpowered. For the first half of The Fellowship of the Ring, we get to learn more than we cared to know about the Shire and the journey to leave the Shire and the surrounding area is just painfully slow with little or no action at all...just a long history lesson about these woods or this hedge or that village....ughhIn The Two Towers, the first half of the book is devoted to Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas while the second half is solely devoted to Sam and Frodo.I don't know, Tolkien could have worked the plotline better concerning this and made it more enjoyable. Maybe he got lost in his own world as writers sometimes do and they forgot what the reader doesn't know.As for character development...there is none. The Aragorn you meet halfway through the first book is the same Aragorn that you see crowned as king at the end of the story. Whereas in the film, he is a conflicted man, unsure about his destiny and forced to decide. The characters in the book are one dimensional and you sometimes forget they are even there.I'll say it again, the films were much better or atleast the story was told better by Jackson than by Tolkien. Had Jackson been totally true to the story, we'd still be watching the movies I write this because every single back story would have to be told and the dozens of minor characters would have to be introduced and so on and so forth. In my mind, the movies are how Tolkien would have wanted his story told. His own books are the companion piece, to give more of a history and back story on the world that he created."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"...is another man's poison.

I mean, I enjoyed &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, and, as devoted fantasy readers, it's our duty to worship L.O.T.R., right?

This is the precise situation that the people of Middle Earth had to go through in the Fellowship of the Ring the first book of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This is one of the best books I have ever read. In this epic fantasy, the reader will experience breathtaking danger, overwhelming suspense, and beautifully created worlds. From the dark halls of Moria, to the Enchanted Golden Woods of Lothlorien, the reader watches Frodo Baggins and eight companions, on their journey to destroy the one ring. This can only be accomplished by throwing it into the fires of Mount. Doom, located at the heart of the Dark Lord's territory. The Fellowship of the Ring has exceptional fighting skills, and a strong will, but neither of these are enough to ward off the evil amongst them, and it won't be long until the lust for the Ring is so great, that the members of the Fellowship cannot resist it, and crave it for themselves.

Along the way he encounters many obstacles, sometimes almost killing frodo. The ring has much power, one power being when the bearer puts it on he will become invisible.

This first book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy introduces the characters and how they came together and follows them until they are split up. This story keeps the reader in suspense as the party runs from the evil minions that chase them accross the terrain of Middle Earth. Not only does Tolkien tell a story, he weaves an intricate background of history, culture, and lore for his make-believe world. This sometimes causes the story to slow down as it breaks into song periodically. Of course, the reader may choose to skip the songs since the toon and rhythm is unknown. Overall, I rate this a 5 star story for Tolkiens brilliance in story-telling and attention to detail."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"As a rule, I tend to avoid books that fall into the \\"fantasy\\" categoy, but I decided to pick up The Hobbit & the Rings Trilogy, to see what all the hubbub was about. Any set of books that has held up as long as the LOR must have some redeeming qualities, and I figured I should at least give them a chance. So far (after the Hobbit and Fellowship), I'm glad I did. What I found was an intricate tale of friendship, duty, and the inner strengths and failings of men, wrapped in an epic quest whose goal is no less than to save the world from evil.*And no, I haven't seen the movies yet, so I went into the books blindly.The writing is fantastic, every step taken is described in tremendous detail, as first the Hobbits leave their home and gain companions along the way. I especially enjoyed the descriptions of the varying landscapes of Middle-Earth; from the mountains to the plains, Tolkien has a fantastic way of painting a picture. The struggles of the group and their wisdom and frustration are recounted in wonderful detail, as their pursuers attempt to close in on them.The plot-related minutae that fantasy fans love and most others hate is present in this book, and all but hardcore fantasy fans will find that the book bogs down a bit in the middle, where the reader is inundated with probably more detail than one really needs to enjoy the story. This is especially true during the Council of Elrond, where I was upset with Tolkien for not just getting on with the quest. The plot presented is wonderful in that the whole history of the ring and its quest are described in detail, but it gets a little slow at that point, and some may have to plow through that section.The final chapters of the book are wonderful, as the quest truly begins with the departure from Rivendell into the wild world beyond. The strengths and weaknesses of the individuals come to drive the plot to its ending and deliver a powerful message: that the seemingly weak can be the strongest among us when dire circumstances and great temptations arise, and the those who would be strong often hide great weaknesses. This lesson is slowly learned by the fellowship, and ultimately leads it to its fate.Finally, since I haven't read the next two books yet, I have to judge this book on its merits alone, and I must say it is a wonderful story, and it certainly leaves me craving the next installment."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"A Review by DillonThis is a fantasy book with many adventures. It is about the beginning of the War of the Ring. The story has 9 main characters. They are Elves, Men, Hobbits, Dwarves, and a Wizard. The book varies from the movie in a lot of ways. Most of the ways are that it introduces more characters and has more exciting events. \\"The Fellowship\\" is about a hobbit and a gang of people loyal to him, setting out to Mordor to destroy the ring of power. The story ends about a third of the way through and there are many adventures throughout the book.One of the main things that I liked about this book was the cool story. By reading the book, I could tell that the author put a lot of thought into it. Since this is the first book in a series of three, it was very well written. I also liked the exciting adventures and battles in it. There were many times when the battles in the book were very different from the ones in the movie. It is very exciting the way the author describes the events in the book and it is fun trying to imagine what he is talking about. The creating of characters was also very excellently done.

Dwarves. Hobbits. These are just a few of the many amazing creatures in this fantasy story brought to life by J.R.R. Tolkien. The first book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy is one of the best-written books I have ever read in my life. The story begins with Bilbo Baggins leaving his homeland of Hobbiton and leaving the dark, mysterious One Ring in the care of his nephew Frodo Baggins. Frodo is the main character throughout the trilogy. His friend and wizard, Gandolf the Grey, knows of the Ring and senses the danger behind it. Frodo is instructed to leave Hobbiton and take the Ring so it will be safe. He takes along his friends Sam, Merry, and Pippin. The Hobbits encounter danger in their quest to find a way to keep the Ring safe from its evil maker, Sauron, who is hunting the ring in order to rule the world. They finally reach Rivendell, the home of the elves, where the leaders of the elves, dwarves, and humans along with Frodo and Bilbo had a counsel meeting to decide what must be done with the Ring. This is the point in the book where the plot begins to thicken tremendously. Saying more would only give the best parts of the book away. The style in which this book is written has a mix of Old English in it, but the book is not hard to understand. Tolkien describes his characters in such a way that one can actually feel like they know the character. Tolkien provides such a great depth in his explanations of history and landscape. Some people may get bored saying that he drags the story on and on. However, the way that he uses description in his novel only adds more beauty and life to his epic fantasy. I strongly recommend this novel to anyone who loves to read and has a vivid imagination. The Fellowship of the Ring takes a deep commitment to stick to it and one's full attention to fully enjoy this wonderful book. The Fellowship of the Ring offers fantasy, adventure, and friendship wrapped in one extraordinary novel.

Building upon the story that was told in 'The Hobbit', this story tells the tale of the discovery by Gandalf the Gray, that the magic ring found by Bilbo Baggins on his journeys, is none other than the ring of power, the One Ring, the master ring that was created by the Dark Lord, Sauron, himself.Together with several companions, three other Hobbits, an Elf, a Dwarf, Gandalf, and two men, Aragorn and Boromir, Frodo sets off on the quest of Mount Doom, the quest to destroy the One Ring forever. This story is wonderfully done, a true masterpiece in fantasy fiction. Tolkien expands upon the world that he has only touched upon in 'The Hobbit', and we find it a place inhabbited by creatures of various kinds, some are evil, others strive for good, and others do only what they think they must. Yet now, with Sauron, the Dark Lord, rising to power once again, and gathering his strength, they find that they must choose a dreadful course, a course into peril.RD Williams, author of 'The Lost Gate'"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The guy who created D&D says he didn't draw much inspiration from the Lord of the Rings trilogy of books, but that's a load of crap, man.

It is a story of great adventure, but it is also part of a new mythology that the author developed. In the midst of writing the trilogy that people have enjoyed for fifty years, Tolkien developed two different elven languages. People talk these days about back story in writing. Writers of this time can take lessons Tolkien who was the master of it. He wrote about the past present and future of his Middle Earth, and left it for many generations to enjoy. This is a book you could read ten times and still not get everything out of it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the RingBy J.R.R. TolkienFrodo Baggins inherits a strange ring from his uncle Bilbo. It is a plain, gold ring with no visible markings on it. But it has special qualities. It can make you invisible. It lengthens your life if you have a long time. It was created by the evil wizard, Sauron of Morodor who used its power to command armies of Uruks and Goblins. He battled Elves, Dwarves and Men with his new power. Then he was defeated and the ring was lost. But a little creature called Sm&eacute;agol find it and keeps it for hundreds of years. The ring has a will of its own and Bilbo comes by it when he gets lost in a mountain full of Goblins. The ring leaves Sm&eacute;agol, now called Gollum, and Bilbo uses it on his journey for a dragon's treasure. Sauron comes to life again in the form of a large eye on top a great stone tower, but does not have his full powers back. The one thing he needs is the ring. Sauron sends his servants to find the ring and Frodo is pursued by Black Riders. Help comes from many different types of people as the quest to destroy the one ring begins. They form the Fellowship of the Ring. Led by Gandalf the Gray, the company consists of: Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin, Hobbits of the Shire; Aragorn, a human Ranger that is the Heir to the Throne of Gondor; Boromir, human son of the Steward of Gondor; Elvin prince of Mirkwood, Legolas; and the dwarf Gimli, son of Gl&#972;in.The characters in this book are incredible, good and evil. Gandalf is a wizard in a gray cloak with a white staff. He has a sword and a pointed hat. He is old but he is a very able fighter, killing many orcs with his sword and magic. The Balrog is an evil creature. It is walking darkness and evil fire in a mass of bloodthirsty orcs screaming for enemies to battle. It has an immense, flaming sword and a lash of fire. The Elves are a graceful and skillful people. They are extremely good bowmen and are quick and deadly with their swords. They also have a wide variety of spells and enchantments to hurl at their enemies. Hobbits are small and lazy creatures that look like little humans, like to eat a lot, and do not like adventures. A few of them are out of the ordinary and like to do extraordinary things. Among these few strange Hobbits are: Bilbo, Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin.The characters would have no place without a plot to follow. The plot of the story is remarkable. The quest to destroy the Ruling Ring, which could be used to supplement a great wizard's powers so he could rule all of Middle-Earth, is completely original. It has been often copied, but never duplicated. There is a story within the story. And one the people are still alive as they are Elves and they live so long. He believed that this ring of power was lost forever, but not destroyed, like its unfortunate master. The story is a truly superior read.This book is interesting, has a very good storyline, and the characters are astonishing. It is one of my favorite books of all time.D.

That all changes when he discovers that possesses the ring of power that was forged in the cracks of doom. Now he, his companion, Samwise, and the wizard, Gandalf must take the ring and toss it back into Mount Doom to destroy it once and for all. Doing so will end the war between Sauron and the free people of Middle Earth. Along the way, they will gain the companionship of an elf, a dwarf, two men, and two more hobbits.The Fellowship of the Ring is the first book in a three book series. It is a follow-up to The Hobbit, the story about how Bilbo steals the ring from the creature, Gollum, who plays a small part in The Fellowship of the Ring also. The Fellowship of the Ring is my favorite in the series so far. I like how Tolkien made such a massive world for the books to take place in.It is an epic story of adventure, war, friendship, and greed. It gets extremely detailed and if you don't read carefully, you could get as lost as the characters in it. Sometimes the detail of the book almost makes you feel like you are taking part in the story.

The author skillfully mixes a concoction of effortless lyrics, wicked monsters, and intermittent magic in a dark and foreboding fantasy.As part of an epic tale, not only does \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" masterfully addresses the responsibilities of good versus evil but also examines companionship and loyalty within the confines of a tremendously treacherous task. Suspense grows as the importance of the Ring-bearer's objective is fully appreciated as the Ring's power incites an evil influence on those nearby.Regrettably a peculiar encounter involving Tom Bombadil, a vigorously charming and unique individual, needlessly diminishes the potency of the Ring. Many readers feel the entire episode concerning Tom and Lady Goldberry is unnecessary to the progress of the menacing plot other than a silly interruption.The collection I own has \\"The Hobbit\\" along with all books of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and contains inside the final novel a comprehensive appendices and index, the ultimate standard for any author wishing to compile a comprehensive series. As with about every film-based novel, I would suggest at least not watching the movie prior to reading the book if not forgoing the movie (although it is one of the greatest movies of all time) thereby leaving the story entirely to the imagination.I highly recommend the book collection to any fan of the fantasy genre.Thank you."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I AM ONLY TWELVE, BUT I THINK THE LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY MAY BE THE BEST BOOKS I WILL EVER READ!!!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Le livre a emporter sur une ile deserte !

The story in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is tremendous, creative and truly profound. I recognize that everything in the book cannot be translated to film but there are spectacular things in this book that were left out of the movie. Some of my favorite characters and characters essential to the total story were not included. Where was the supreme Tom Bombadill? Where was the powerful elf lord Glorfindel? There are also some unnecessary twists taken by Jackson and his crew that are simple and beautiful in the book.THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING wonderfully takes up where THE HOBBIT leaves off and addresses the sinister aspects of the great ring and the true Lord of the Rings, the diabolical Sauron.But A WORD OF CAUTION: should you read THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING you won't be able to stop there. The next thing you know you'll be picking up THE TWO TOWERS and then wrapping up with THE RETURN OF THE KING. You won't be able to start with this one and stop there. And if you haven't read THE HOBBIT yet you will likely be adding that one to your library as well.The GOOD NEWS is that you will not regret a single moment!I could go on and on.

Tolkien, the first book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, would have to be my favorite book in three ways. To begin with, there is a tremendous amount of action in this book. For example, Frodo, the main character, and all of his companions set out to destroy an evil ring so the evil Sauron won't get his nasty hands on it. If they don't destroy the ring, all of Middle Earth would be doomed. They must battle their way to Mount Doom to cast the ring into its flames. But, there are many enemies on their way like, Sauroman, orcs, and Ring Wraiths. Secondly, I like how Tolkien brings Middle Earth to life by describing it so deeply. For example, I like how he describes The Mines of Moria so well. Last but not least, I love the fantasy and magic in this book. For instance, Gandalf, a great wizard, has many spells and magical powers. If you do not like fantasy, you shouldn't read this book; but if you do this book is spectacular! In conclusion, if you are looking for a great book, get The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is a great book written by J.R.R. Tolkien. It is the first book in an epic trilogy known as The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. It takes place in the third age of Middle-earth. The main characters are Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin who are hobbits. A hobbit is a creature smaller than dwarves and they are furry, but resemble humans. It is action-packed and suspenseful. I gave this book 5 stars because I really liked it and also it has a very deep-winding plot. The Character I like best in this story is Frodo. I like him because he is just like his uncle Bilbo(from The Hobbit). His uncle Bilbo had adventures just like he will have and you can only find out if you read it. I recommend this book to people who like books that keep you on your toes."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I'm a nurse who works the night shift, and I have to sleep in the day time. Although I have heavy curtains on my bedroom windows, I do not live in an isolated area and so have to deal with the noise of the \\"outside world\\" to some degree. I would periodically have a hard time getting to sleep or staying there, before I started getting these CD's. The other collection I have is the dramatization of the hobbit, which is also quite good, but much different overall, as it is only 4 discs long, and without much of Tolkien's flair, as descriptions are minimized in favor of dialogue.This product, however, I find completely rewarding. The guy who reads has a lovely voice, pronounces everything impeccably without hesitation, varies his tone just enough to distinguish between characters (but not dramatically enough to be distracting), and as it is completely unabridged, you don't miss a single word of Tolkien's masterpiece. And as for his singing, well, I don't imagine the characters in the books to be divas, if you catch my drift, so I find it quite realistic and not at all off-putting.I play a disc when I lie down to sleep, and usually listen to the same one several nights in a row until I am sure I heard the whole thing, as I find that I am asleep within 15 minutes. I have had this collection for about two months and I am on the 8th disc (of 20).

I've now read all three. Some reviewers have complained about the amount of detail in the books. Personally, after seeing the movies, I was full of questions: very curious about the history of the cultures of the inhabitants of Middle Earth, the landscapes and geopgraphy, and the lives of specific characters. The movies give you a taste of Tolkien's grand epic, but the books themselves suck you into Middle Earth. I was mesmerized and welcomed the painstaking detail. Tolkien didn't just create a landscape, races and languages. He created a universe that comes to life in the pages of the books.I attribute the epic's success to the intense emotion that it invokes. When reading, one genuinely feels the characters' hardships, fears the orchs, Saruman, the Urukai. The book is chilling and invokes terror at times.My copies of the books have detailed appendices and maps. I thoroughly enjoyed being able to refer to the maps of Middle Earth and track the fellowship on their quest. I highly ecommend using such maps when reading the books.In summary, if you long to know more after having seen the movies, you'll find yourself immersed in and hypnotized by the text. If, on the other hand, you're satisfied knowing what's given on the widescreen, you probably won't make it through the first book. The best case scenario would obviously be to experience the books first. Unfortunately for many, myself included, the first experience with Tolkien's works was on the bigscreen."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"I just type this review to warn all who have seen the Lord of the Rings movies that this does not mean they should neglect to read the book!

The movie cut out important characters such as Tom Bombadil and Lady Goldberry, characters I thought that were of a certain importance that they should have been included. The Old Forest and Bilbo play a much bigger part. Despite all this, I would not suggest this book to anyone who has not seen the Lord of the Rings movies.

I claimed there that it's not a very good book, and its true value lies in the breakthru it made.However, I have one escape: I said there that it might be the fault of the transtlation to Hebrew. Some time ago I decided to go to the original English text, thinking that if the original is bad, then it's simply not such a good book.Well, I got a lesson about the importance of a good transtlation. I have read the book from cover to cover, ceaselessly, and enjoyed it greatly.Tolkein's English is superb. You can see he's a linguistic, since his language is deep and reach. The characters are wonderfully built and the plot, although complicated and very detailed, is easy to read and fluent.After reading it in its original language I see the problem. This book is a challenge to every translator, because it is deeply rooted in the English tradition, both plotwise and in its language. It takes a skillful transtlator to pass all the different meanings Tolkein uses, and still have a readable result.So I do recommened anyone who considers to read this book in any other language other than English, to wait until you can handle with its not-too-difficult language.

Enough!! The FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is the worst book of the three. As I see, here are the merits and flaws of Tolkien's totally overrated trilogy:* MERITS:1- Someone willing to write such a long book must be respected by the enormous difficulty of the taske alone;2- TOlkien was really a respected English teacher and historian, and you can sense his joy in writing the book* FLAWS:1- The characters, all of them, are totally faceless, in the style of Frederick Forsyth's characters. We don't have any insight about heir feelings, about what's really going on inside their heads and hearts;2- Tolkien clearly copied unashamedly so many points from other fables, like the Arturian legend, for example;3- The endless descriptions sometimes makes one wonder that he is only gaining time (and pages), by repeating himself over and over again, like &quot; the sun was coming down, the air was heavy, the sun was rising, the air was clean and bright.........&quot;&quot; Irc!I really think the complete trilogy would fit in just one 500 pages book.

Like the rest of the tale, the Council could have been dispensed with quickly and with relevance. Instead, we get numerous paragraphs on the lineage of everyone present, as well as those who are to be discussed. It is a terrible reading experience.Interestingly, after the Coucil, Tolkien's characters adopt an Olde English manner of speech, which only adds more weight to an already suffocatingly heavy load.Is Tolkien clever? Yes. Is he creative? Absolutely. Is Middle Earth a wonderfully imaginative effort? Quite. But all of this fails to make the story compelling and readable and fun.I'll admit I've been spoiled by Harry Potter. The difference in eras notwithstanding, J.K. Rowling is a fun read, not a chore.I still do want to see the film version of this tale, but I'll not be reading the subsequent installments. No, not a chance!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"Tedious. Plodding. Boring. Painful. One-dimensional characters set in a ludicrously detailed, needlessly complicated environment (and lousy maps to boot). A classic? I've read soupcan ingredient lists more interesting, and product warranty cards more expertly written.As if the prose weren't painful enough, it's constantly interrupted by schoolboy poems and pseudo-mystical &quot;songs&quot;.

I will only complete the trilogy because I have never NOT finished a book...although this garbage is putting me to the test. I just hope they all die soon so I can get back to reading about interesting characters in other books.Is this really the best of the fantasy genre, as my friends seem to think? Please tell me there's some unheralded author out there whose prose dances around Tolkien's before I swear to never pick up another fantasy book again.

I have a great passion for history and can slog through textbooks with the best of them. Indeed, i even got through the Simirallion without too much trouble. But history books are supposed to be boring, and they flatly detail things that happen in the past for the most part. However, in Lord of the Rings, things are supposed to be happening RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES and it's about as interesting as watching water slooooowwllllyyy slide down a wall.When pointing this out to LotR fanatics, and pointing out better fantasy writers, i'm generally greeted by \\"yeah, well Tolkien started it all\\"Claiming that the fantasy world is completly reliant on Tolkien is utter lunacy. A great deal of Tolkien's world was taken from myths and legends (especially norse ones) that have existed for centuries.Moving on, tolkiens world is very unrealistic in a great many ways. In Gondor, there is no high court, no scheming, and everyone seems perfectly happy to be ruled by a lunatic. This is a very poor reflection of both the medieval ages and mankind in general. In Rohan, there's a bit of dissent, but that's all do to Saruman, no one in Rohan can think for themselves. Everyone's dark side is motivated by the ring, but what about the inherent darkeness in everyone's nature. Tolkien should've researched psychology a bit more before writing characters. So there you have it, I challenge everyone to read this and cast aside any preconceived notions, and you will find that the \\"beloved classic\\" is hardly lovable"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection)","review":"George R.R.

Tolkien overbloats EVERYTHING to the point where it's absolutely ridiculous, and I loose tract of the plot amidst unimportant details. Quite frankly my only thought is I DON'T CARE WHO EVERYONE'S FATHER IS, IF YOU WANT ME TO KNOW THEN WRITE A PREQUEL, JUST TELL THE STORY IT IDIOTIC BRIT! I don't know how someone who wrote something as good as &quot;The Hobbit&quot; could produce this junk. I think what happened was he had a bunch of notes left over, and wanted to cash in by writing a sequel, so he threw all the details he had onto a shallow plot, but sense it was to complicated to be called &quot;dumbed-down&quot; like most money-making sequels noone could attack it. And it was so complicated people have been trying to convince others for decades that they're intellegent because they can understand this book, but since noone understands it, noone can test them to see if they really do or not.

But all too no avale: fact is, Tolkin wasn't that much of a genius as Peter Jackon is.Sadly i must conclude this because this book was so porely written. It is tedius to read all the details of Hobits lives and all the poems are bad to. I thought it would be like the movies but Mr. Tolkin writes with no emotions, he's all about the detail but please Mr. Tolkin realise that details arent the story and they arent the characters you have to pay attention to those things to or people cant be interested in your characters, 'kay?No offense but you shoud be very glad that Peter Jackson has taken this story and made it so anyone in the world can love it. I don't know if your writing sequals to the Lord of the Rings series with Sam's kids or anything or not but if you do you should look up Peter Jackson and ask him about his characters and story skills because he *understands* these things. just a helpful suggestian, 'kay?But if you MUST read this skip the opening pages and maps and start with the first chapters which are better than the stuff that comes before it but dont say you weren't warned.

Trevelyan (1876-1962) is widely regarded as one of the most important and influential British historians of the 20th-century. Specializing in the years of Stuart rule over Britain (1603-1714), Trevelyan's books are still considered \\"definitive\\" in the historiography of Stuart England; in fact, Trevelyan's works, such as his multi-volume account of Queen Anne's reign, often document under-examined topics. In 1938, Trevelyan authors the definitive account of England's so-called \\"Glorious Revolution\\" with The English Revolution, 1688-1689. Employing a rich, clear, literary narrative Trevelyan argues that James II is a tyrant whose obstinacy and stupidity leads to James' loss of the British throne. Moreover, Trevelyan argues the Revolution, which raises the power of Parliament at the monarch's expense, sets Britain on a course of relative stability and toward ascendancy in Europe.When one looks at the historiography of the Glorious Revolution, one finds a paucity of books devoted to the Revolution itself. The sixty-six years between the publication of Trevelyan's work and today have not produced another volume so comprehensive and readable. In other works, the Revolution tends to be covered as part of a Stuart biography or mentioned as being \\"important\\" in a survey of England or America in the late 17th-century. All the while, little new information is being collected and published in book form. Oftentimes, the Revolution serves as a line of demarcation, a place to start or end a study of English history. In the past few years, revisionist historians have challenged the notion of James II as tyrant, preferring a portrayal casting James as the victim of scheming daughters and their husbands (as is most notably found in Maureen Waller's popular Ungrateful Daughters, published in 2003 by St. Martins). Nevertheless, most British historians still hail Trevelyan's work as the \\"gold-standard\\" narrative of the Revolution. In fact, the book is still in print some 66 years after its initial publication.Since the book is accessible and clear, and one of the very few books in print devoted solely to the Glorious Revolution, Trevelyan's work retains great importance to British historiography. Trevelyan's interpretation and narrative style may seem quaint and old-fashioned, but the information gathered and presented by his work serves to enlighten the 21st-century mind as to the importance of England's Glorious Revolution."},{"Title":"The English revolution, 1688-1689 (A Galaxy book)","review":"This slim volume by Trevelyan is one of the most gripping history books I have ever read. In 130 pages, the author succinctly describes the various interest groups involved, and how they interacted during the revolution and its aftermath.If you think you might be interested in the English revolution, but are concerned that some authors' treatment of the topic might be dry and unengaging, I recommend that you start with this book. Trevelyan succeeds in distilling the revolution and its aftermath into 130 pages of economic prose, without ever becoming superficial or glib."},{"Title":"The English revolution, 1688-1689 (A Galaxy book)","review":"The experiences of English government in the 1600's must be grasped to understand why the Declaration of Independence, and to a lesser extent, the Constitution of the USA contained the words they contained."},{"Title":"The English revolution, 1688-1689 (A Galaxy book)","review":"Trevelyan's English Revolution provides a good look at the reigns of Charles II and James II and how the Catholics and Protestants were struggling for superiority in England in the 17th Century. Background information and effects after their reigns is also added to give the reader a better understanding of events which are covered in the book.English Revolution is well written and entertaining while educational, a stand alone work or good companion to other books covering this era."},{"Title":"The English revolution, 1688-1689 (A Galaxy book)","review":"This book was written in the 1930s and is now coming back as a reprint. With all the revisionist history floating around (Ungrateful Daughters), it is good to read something about why James II did lose his throne. Basically James II was an inept leader who attacked his base of support (Tories) and alienated the Whigs. When William I landed and advanced on London, James II gave up and fled. If he would have stayed, he and his son would have ruled Great Britain with the consent of Parliament. Trevelyan does a good job of detailing how James II lost his throne.This is an academic read. There is little dramatic actions in this book. It is simply an explanation of how a leader should not rule. This is also a short read for someone looking to understand the Glorious Revolution."},{"Title":"How Each Child Learns: Using Multiple Intelligence in Faith Formation","review":"As a former high school teacher of theology, I wish I had read this book years ago. I would have loved to teach using its novel methods. Without a doubt, I would also have loved to experience this type of education in my own faith formation as a youth. In this book, Bernadette Stankard presents an abundance of helpful research into the nine types of intelligence. What's more impressive is her practical applications of lessons and activities for each type of intelligence, each of which builds a young person's faith in a unique way. People with true faith have usually acquired it by experience, not by merely studying it. This book offers a multitude of experiences designed to nurture the seeds of faith in many different types of young people. All of them have been tested in the classroom by the author and found successful. Do your students like nature? Try the \\"Terrarium Terrain\\" exercise. Do they enjoy math? Challenge them with \\"The Cost of Poverty\\" activity. Do they appreciate creative storytelling? Invite them to try their hand at \\"The Gospel According to me.\\" Kids will come to enjoy faith formation in a fresh and new way. Stankard reminds us that God has made each of us with different talents, gifts, and challenges and we each come to know God in different ways. This book respects and celebrates the God-given differences in each human being. Using this book will prove that faith formation in youth can truly be stimulating, challenging and very rewarding for students and teachers alike."},{"Title":"How Each Child Learns: Using Multiple Intelligence in Faith Formation","review":"Have you ever had a late Saturday night trying to come up with ideas for church in the morning?

The author opens the door to creativity in a refreshing manner.

She provides practical and fun exercises for drawing out the innate intelligences held by every child. Her style is accessible, causing the reader to feel that she's made a new friend simply by reading the book. This is a resource I can use as a public school teacher, as well as a religious educator."},{"Title":"How Each Child Learns: Using Multiple Intelligence in Faith Formation","review":"Bernadette T. Stankard is a Christian minister with over thirty years' experience. In How Each Child Learns: Using Multiple Intelligence In Faith Formation, Bernadette has specifically written a book for Christian parents and religious educators that explores how theories of multiple intelligence can be applied to creatively teach religion to children. Highly recommended reading for Christian parents and educators regardless of their denominational affiliation or background, and offering practical methods for the home and the parish, How Each Child Learns is a respectful tribute to the Christian faith and the search to better understand how young minds can come to learn about God's love."},{"Title":"The Time of Her Life","review":"As in all her novels, Dew shows a remarkable ability to get inside the minds of her main characters, letting us see the situation exactly as they see it. Here, she grapples with the effects of (unacknowledged) alcoholism on an attractive, intelligent family that should have everything going for it. She has accurately captured the juvenile narcissism and self-absorption of the addictive personality, whether it is the alcoholic or the partner who enables the problem. Even more impressive is her depiction of the daughter who has to become an adult long before she is ready and suffers acutely as a result. In this, she resembles most children growing up in alcoholic households who are forced into a premature adulthood because their parents, mired in their addictions, refuse to grow up. It is not an easy book to read, but definitely worthwhile if one wants to understand the dynamics motivating parents who make their children responsible for their own problems. Dew handles these circumstances deftly, without making judgments and letting the situation speak for itself."},{"Title":"The Twenty-First Century City: Resurrecting Urban America","review":"I PICKED UP AND READ THIS BOOK, WRITTEN BY POPULAR AND SUCCESSFUL INDIANAPOLIS MAYOR STEPHEN GOLDSMITH, TO GAIN A DEEPER, BETTER IDEA OF THE POSSIBLE APPROACH AND STYLE OF A GEORGE W.

His was a generation that dealt with how the world would be put back together after the most devastating war in history. His service includes questioning Nazi prisoners as part of the US Strategic Bombing Survey (with his friend JK Galbraith), encouraging the formation of the Common Market (Jean Monnet), and guidance in the most contentious periods of the Cold War.The author's anecdotes are invaluable. An accomplished man, he recounts intimate views of luminaries in years of service matched only by his own admirable accomplishment. The latter included early principled opposition (and resignation) over the Vietnam War.This memoir is a pleasure to read: the author is a genuine American hero."},{"Title":"The past has another pattern: Memoirs","review":"I got this because George Ball was the only person in the Kennedy Administration with access to JFK to oppose involvement in Vietnam. No one listened of course, and that ignorant hawk, Walt Rostow, whom Ball calls an amateur tactitian, prevailed with JFK and especially with LBJ. The early life of Ball is interesting, though his account is fairly bland, and the parts leading up to Vietnam and JFK are a scrapbook of minor issues in US history, except for a few pages on Speer. Ball has none of the eloquence of George Kennan, but he sure was right about Vietnam; his descriptions of JFK and then LBJ are worth the price of the book. He seems to be a wonderfully sensible, intelligent man, with a sound grasp of both the big picture and myriad details. He has no use for John Foster Dulles, and thought Ike was sagacious to stay out of Asia. His portrait of LBJ is nuanced and brief, makes a fine addition to the file on that strange man."},{"Title":"Pro SQL Server 2005 Reporting Services","review":"I began this book with limited Reporting Services experience, not really knowing what to expect.

I would definitely recommend this book for everyone new to reporting services and those who would like to get answers to detailed reporting scenarios."},{"Title":"Pro SQL Server 2005 Reporting Services","review":"I found this book to be weird quiet frankly. Chapter 2 goes off the deep-end of designing efficient queries before you've even built a report yet. That material should have been put at the end of the book. Creating a report with the report wizard is covered in Chapter 4 but probably would have been best if it was before Chapter 3 which covers creating a report manually. I didn't find anything \\"Pro\\", as the name implies, or advanced with the book. It's a broad introductory text only. Also, it only covers using the ReportViewer control for Win Forms and not the one Web Forms. The two are similar enough but coverage of both would have been better."},{"Title":"Pro SQL Server 2005 Reporting Services","review":"Loved the writing style.

Three of the line's best writers, Carla Fredd, Brenda Jackson and Felicia Mason, have contributed tales of well-meaning matchmakers aiming at their marks. It is a Valentine's Day collection that provides sweet reading throughout the year. Carla Fredd's &quot;Matchmaker&quot; takes place in the Georgia settings that have made her a favorite. It is the story of a Justin Valentio, a country sheriff, and Camille Johnson, an Atlanta professional, who are drawn together in a small Georgia town by their next-door neighbor grandmothers. Camille is immediately attracted to Justin who fights his attraction because his mother and ex-wife both found small-town life unappealing. In &quot;Cupid's Bow,&quot; Kimara has loved Kyle Garwood since she was six and he was fourteen. Their parents were best friends who perished in a plane crash several years ago. When Kyle's grandfather's will stipulates that he will lose the family fortune unless he and Kimara marry and create an heir, the two become unwilling participants in an &quot;arranged marriage.&quot; &quot;Made in Heaven&quot; is Felicia Mason's contribution to the collection. &quot;Val&quot; (Valentine) Summers doesn't believe in love at first sight, in romance or Valentine's Day -- despite the fact that her parent's were married Feb. 14 and she was born on the same date a year later. Her friends decide to help her loosen up by giving her a gift certificate for a dating service. Val's still not convinced and wants no part of it. Eric Fitzgerald is a professional matchmaker who believes in love at first sight, romance and Valentine's Day. He just doesn't believe in dating the &quot;needy&quot; women who have made him rich and successful. When Eric's partner introduces them, sparks fly. Eric knows that Val's the one and sets out to change her mind about love, romance and him."},{"Title":"A Valentine Kiss: Cupids Bow\\\\Made In Heaven\\\\Matchmaker (Arabesque)","review":"I may me bais because Brenda Jackson is my favorite author, but that means something. &quot;A Valentime Kiss&quot; is a great story about two people put in a compromising position where they are doing something for a bigger cause; where as, at first they would not think of doing something so out of this world. But love came make you do strange things! Kyle and Kimara are a fun couple to read about. I enjoy the reading a lot! If I was in Kimara shoes, I would not have thought twice about living out my dreams with my first crush! I highly recommend everyone who sees this book advertised to buy it, along with all of the other Brenda Jackson stories like the complete set of the Madaris Brothers stories, you will not regret it!

Can he let go of the past to find true love? The second story is by one of my favorites, Brenda Jackson, and is also part of the Madrais series. Kimara has liked Kyle since her teenage years but he has never paid her any attention, will the help of a meddlesome grandfather and his will bring the two together?

And, even with Justine's dislike of citified women will not put a damper on the meddling ladies plans of sharing a great-grandbaby. With Valentine's Day just around the corner, will the grandmothers' wishes come true?I took great pleasure in reading Matchmaker. This short story had a great mixture of laughter, tearful moments, jealousy, heartache and passion. The bond that developed between the couple was a joy to watch and their love scenes were spicy hot and tantalizing. Camille and Justine's grandmothers were a hoot and added enormous intriguing moments to the storyline.Cupid's Bow by Brenda JacksonKimara Stafford has been in love with Kyle Garwood her entire life. At the age of sixteen, Kimara was about to let her love be known; however, Kyle crushed her heart when he declared his love to someone else. Now, ten years later Kimara finds herself in a heated dilemma that involves Kyle and if she is not careful, she could end up losing her heart once again.Cupid's Bow was a heart-warming story that brought forth many different emotional moments throughout the plot. There was a grieving sadness, passionate sexual interludes and great despair. The attraction between Kimara and Kyle was steamy. I thought the author did a magnificent job building on their chemistry to make their love making sizzling hot.Made in Heaven by Felicia MasonVal Sanders hates her birth name and her birthday. You see, she was born on Valentine's Day and her parents thought it would be neat to name her in honor of the special day. After her latest date fiasco, her two best friends decided to give Val a birthday gift certificate to a dating service. Val feels that her life has gone from bad to worst. And then Val met Eric Fitzgerald, the co-owner of the dating service. Will Eric be able to change Val's negative Valentine's Day feelings into happy ones?Made in Heaven is a heart-warming, comical story that will keep you glued to your seat. This tale was about a woman who believed that she was misfortunate to be born on the most romantic day in the world and a man determined to prove to her wrong by showing her the wonders of being in love.Overall, I found A Valentine Kiss to be a heated, steamy, passionate anthology. This collection of stories was well written and had some wonderfully romantic, tender filled moments that will definitely put you in the mood for Valentine's Day. Each story within A Valentine Kiss was unique, yet different, and they all focused on the special day that was made for lovers.NikitaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"},{"Title":"A Valentine Kiss: Cupids Bow\\\\Made In Heaven\\\\Matchmaker (Arabesque)","review":"I love a valentine kiss all of the stories were excellence.Mary Seay"},{"Title":"A Valentine Kiss: Cupids Bow\\\\Made In Heaven\\\\Matchmaker (Arabesque)","review":"The orginal reason I got this book was because of Brenda Jackson Cupids Bow.

At times we have to analyse the motives and agendas of various media entities. These issues are addressed here.Media coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian crisis is rarely portrayed in a fair, unbiassed manner. This is the author's prime concern, whilst still stressing the right of freedom of speech and the right of varying opinions.Any personal opinions of the author can easily be checked for their authenticity if necessary.We ignore such observations as those outlined in this work at our peril. If we are indeed intent on deciphering the truth from amongst the oft-portrayed propaganda and bias in the media surrounding Middle East events, we earnestly need to keep 'an eye on the media'.May I recommend another, more recent book, written by a Christian Pentecostal Minister along the same lines, entitled'The Last War; The Failure Of The Peace Process & The Coming Battle For Jerusalem', by David Allen Lewis...."},{"Title":"Eye on the Media","review":"The late David Bar- Ilan for a number of years wrote a weekly column in the ' Jerusalem Post' exposing distorted media coverage against Israel. Among the culprits were the Guardian Reuters and AP,the LA Times the NY Times, and most of the major newspapers and media services. Bar- Ilan detected that a major anti- Israel bias had developed since the Six- Day War. He wrote fairly, always got his facts right , and time and again pointed out errors .At the time each of these struggles seemed a ' life and death' one and Bar- Ilan's writings were a source of comfort and strength to a large number of supporters of Israel. This work is excellent not only for those interested in the Middle East conflict but for anyone who wants to see how the Media may distort the news, and rewrite it in accord with its own bias and Agenda."},{"Title":"Eye on the Media","review":"Very insightful and intelligent book, an exelent reading."},{"Title":"Weapons and field equipment technical reference manual","review":"A very nice resource for fans. I'll just break it down by category:Star Wars: This is the same writer who did all of the Star Wars Technical Manuals for Starlog magazine. While George Lucas has played with his own continuity a bit since then the information is still mostly sound. This book (as I remember) focuses mostly on the light saber and has a really awesome concept on how it works. The problem is this doesn't appear to 100% coincide with newer material. Actually it doesn't seem to completely coincide with Johnson's own SW Tech Manuals. It could be they do but the approach in explanation in this book goes in such a different angle that it's hard to tell. My hope is that it is indeed official and accurate enough because the concept is really cool!Star Trek: The information on phasers seems a bit different than other books, but not entirely conflicting either. Would be nice if one detail was confirmed (transtator technology... anybody know?). However since Shane Johnson wrote Mr. Scott's Guide to the Enterprise, which ST reference guru Michael Okuda even said once was a valid reference, I like to give the benefit of the doubt. Here you get some good details also on communicators, Klingon disruptors (the ONLY book with any technical explanation I have seen to date), and even the Gorn sidearm.Battlestar Galactica: Since the book was made in the 80's this is details from the original series. It's mainly info on the blaster pistol. While it's a good amount of info I felt it just slightly lacking considering the details Shane had collected with weapons from the other shows. Still this book has better information thanScience Fiction Weapons Vol 1 (Starlog Photo Guidebook), which is the only other book I have ever seen to give any information on Colonial Blasters.Logan's Run: There is a surprisingly concise amount of information in this book regarding the Sandman weapon that's used in the movie and it ties nicely to the original novel. It doesn't stop with the gun as you also get details from other devices like the trackers and a few items I think were on the television series.Space 1999: You get some great details on the Moonbase Alpha Stun Gun and the comlock (those remote thingies they had with TV screens on them). I have found resources that have more information on these items than this book, but it's still a great resource and it does a great job presenting the technical information.Lost in Space: Again since the book was pre-1998 this is the original 60's series and not the movie. Both laser pistols and the one laser rifle are featured here with some technical specs for each. I'm surprised that this sort of information could be gleaned from a show as old as this, but Shane seemed to have some good contacts with the show considering how many blueprints and other materials he made for it.Shane Johnson did a lot of research compiling this book together talking to prop designers, writers and even producers of these shows. As far as I can tell this information should be considered as canon as you can get at the time (Star Wars and Star Trek do have a nasty habit of changing their continuity as the years go by). If you are a fan of any of these sci-fi shows or movies and like the technical stuff (even as a light hobby) this book would be a nice addition to your library."},{"Title":"Weapons and field equipment technical reference manual","review":"This Book has technical drawings for weapons as well as a few other devices in these shows and movies:Star Trek (1960s)Star Wars (up to 1984)Space 1999Logan's RunBattlestar Galactica (1970s)Lost in Space (TV)Date: 1984The TABLE OF CONTENTS lists these major topics:STAR FLEET ... 9STAR FLEET INTELLIGENCE ... 31 [Klingon weapons]DEEP SLEEP ...41 [Logan's Run]COLONIAL FORCES ... 53LIGHTSABRES ... 57MOONBASE ALPHA ... 65JUPITER 2 MISSION ... 71I am not a modeler, but did indeed find the drawings intersting and worthwhile."},{"Title":"Retiring Abroad: A Survival Handbook","review":"This book is useless.

Sparshott has given here the best modern overall commentary on Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, itself possibly the greatest of Aristotle's works. In the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle brings the perspective of a great observational biologist to bear on the observation of the human, in order to assess what our natural needs and capacities are, and what we need to do in order to have a fulfilling life. Aristotle's answer is, of course, subtle and complex, but it is summed up in Sparshott's title: we need to take our lives seriously. Sparshott's text demonstrates at every point the depth of insight developed over decades of thinking along with Aristotle (and, of course, along with lots of other philosophers) about these issues of human life. The result is a book that is simultaneously *brilliant* in its bringing together of Aristotle's texts and profound in its commentary on human experience. The first 50 pages are the most mind-blowing, and they should be read carefully by all students of Aristotle, to be sure, and by anybody else studying philosophy. Whenever I teach graduate courses in Aristotle, I assign this book as a companion text, because, (whereas I find that commentaries usually have the effect of lowering the level of initiative that the students take in studying the original books), this book always leads the students to be more probing and more thoughtful in their approach to Aristotle's texts. I recommend it very highly."},{"Title":"Taking Life Seriously: A Study of the Argument of the Nicomachean Ethics (Toronto Studies in Philosophy)","review":"This book is in itself a work of excellence and practicality.

I started reading this at work during the slow hours, and I was just freaking amazed out how great it was. I read a lot of web comics, but this one really stood out.

It was packaged to make the trip very well. I was very happy with the service and the product. I highly reccomend them, and look forward to dealing with them again.The Keen Spot version of Wapsi Square is a nice little introduction to the Wapsi Square webcomic. It has the begining of the strip, a wacky slice of life strip, that evolves into a more serious plot based story. It only just gets into where it starts to become 'paranormal'. Great characters, wonderful art, and when it's funny, it's really funny. The story is very good and plotlines deeply intertwined from years back to present day. Must be read to belive how far back he was planting seeds of the plot going on today. Highly reccomended.It also has some very welcome extras of work done by the author and artist, Paul Taylor.

The cartoon is the work of Mr. Paul Taylor, and is a joy to follow - it's the story of a group of friends and the subtle interactions between them. And then there is Dietzel, the smartest dog besides Snoopy. Wapsi Square is subtle, exquisitely drawn, sweet, imaginative, funny, lovable and original.This book contains a collection of early Wapsi Square cartoons, and a few pages of bonus illustrations where Mr. Taylor shows us various steps in the creative process. My one peeve is that the book could have been thicker, and contained more cartoons. Perhaps Mr. Taylor will consider one day to make yearly collections of his cartoons.If you're a fan of Wapsi Square, you will enjoy this book - it's a way of holding the characters in your hand, instead of just looking at them on a computer screen. If you are not familiar with Wapsi Square, do yourself a favor and go to the web site: they will put a smile on your face. And then you'll want to get this book.My one wish is that Mr. Taylor publishes a more prominent volume of this wonderful cartoon, something similar to the format of the Calvin & Hobbes books."},{"Title":"Common sense: A simple plan for financial independence","review":"Art Williams presents a clear and simple process to help you focus on putting your money in the right places.

In fact if you just need it to pass your exam at the university it can really be helpful for it has ,to my mind, an intuitive approach. But if you need to have a deep knowledge about all the mathematical subtilities it isnt the right book (for instance if you want to understand molecular modelling).

It lacks precise definitions of mathematical objects, and contains way too many absolutely ridiculous &quot;brute force&quot; exercises that are worded ambiguously or better yet incorrectly.Additionally, this book is in NO way a substitute for a real algebra text and those chemists who are interested in learning the foundations of group theory and not just the theory of one particular group (i.e. the dihedral group) ought to purchase another book or sit in on an undergraduate course in abstract algebra. After doing so you will find that Cotton's text is a joke."},{"Title":"Chemical Applications of Group Theory","review":"I'm a double major in mathematics and biochemistry at Queens College of CUNY;we're very proud of our excellent,Ivy-League trained chem faculty(which is one of the best kept secrets in academia).I love textbooks and I believe any aspiring scientist must have a substantial libary at thier disposal.That being said; this is the worst textbook I've ever read.The definitions are too terse to be of any use to anybody,the writing is impenetrably dense and the mathematical proofs are careless and unclear.I was taking inorganic chemistry and really struggling with my intro to group theory and symmetry(since I made the mistake of not taking college geometry FIRST with the brilliant Dr.Ravi Kulkarni;that would have made all the difference.Learn from my mistakes;never try and learn mathematical concepts-and this IS a mathematical theory-from a chemist or physicist!)Cotton's book was the only book extant at that time-and it only confused me more.Just goes to show an ugly truth you learn as a college student-a great scientist does NOT a great teacher make.Recently,this dark room of inorganic chemistry was lit up by the brillant book by Robert Carter,&quot;An Introduction To Group Theory And Molecular Symmetry&quot;.If you're taking an inorganic chem course at the undergrad or grad levels,run-don't walk-to your bookstore and order this one.And if anybody offers you Cotton,JUST SAY NO!"},{"Title":"Chemical Applications of Group Theory","review":"So if you are a mathematician or a physicist, don't whine if this book isn't for you. It's for chemists, specifically inorganic ones, who use group theory to analyze ligand chemistry and spectroscopic measurements. It is also useful for those who utilize computational chemistry programs like Gaussian and need to know the basics of orbital and molecular symmetry.This book contains only point group symmetry and none of the SO, SU, U, etc. groups used in physics. There is also no coverage of Lie algebras."},{"Title":"Chemical Applications of Group Theory","review":"Professor Cotton's book is a well written introduction to the theory of group representations for chemists. It is appropriate for chemical experimentalists and beginners with a more thoeretical bent. It was NOT INTENDED to be a book of algebra for mathematicians or physicists interested in Lie groups. The pure rotation group is not covered, representations of space groups are not mentioned, ray representations are not used, etc. Many of the reviewers below seem to think they will need one and only one book that deals with applications of group theory - not likely! For a beginner with a background typical of a 1st year grad student in physical or inorganic chemistry at an American university, the book is good. If the complainers below ever tried to teach a course to such students using the more rigorous books they are clamoring for, they would be hung in effigy (if they were lucky).However, even for the intended audience, there are things that could be improved. Most glaring in my opinion is the treatment of electronic states, as opposed to orbitals. Even &quot;mathematically-challenged chemists&quot; have to face up to Slater determinants as basis functions for multi-electron wavefunctions. The spectroscopy and ligand-field theory topics are obscure if you don't introduce this concept. Symmetry with respect to interchange of particle labels is not that difficult to teach, and is essential for understanding the symmetry requirements that must be placed on electronic and vibrational wave functions."},{"Title":"Chemical Applications of Group Theory","review":"I read this book in 1965 as a freshman in Chemistryat UCLA. I had no background in group theory or representationof groups by characters. It started me on a life long study of groups,but the wrong way. For someone without the necessary mathematics backgroundthis book is actually harmful.I think a course in modern algebra should be necessaryto reading this book. In 1965 an understanding of Calculuswasn't enough even with a little Boolean algebra mixed in.It came down to us using the book like a recipe bookfor the mathematics, following many of the operating blindly.But I have to say that over the years I have learned more about groupsand that the approach here has grown in my respect with that study.So I have to say it is an excellent bookfor those preparedand a very poor book for those who aren't."},{"Title":"Chemical Applications of Group Theory","review":"This book is a double edged sword. As a reference textbook for a person who has already had a significant introduction to group theory and chemical applications of it, this book can't be beat. It provides some very detailed mathematical derivations of the theoretical formulas used within group theory which one may not find in an elementary inorganic text which skims over group theory. Additionally, Cotton covers organic, organometallic and inorganic examples which allows the reader to have a broad spectrum of systems to learn from. The blurbs about molecular vibrations and crystallography were nice too. Finally, Cotton does not lack in providing journal references to the original research that he covers in the text.In lieu of all that, this book is a bain to use in order to learn the principles of group theory. Cotton, in his typical fashion, assumes that the reader is well-versed in linear/matrix algebra (and has a very condescending comment for anyone who MIGHT have to read the matrix algebra appendix he has in the back of the text) and that the reader can visualize symmetry operations readily in their head. There are places in the text where he should go into more detail and provide further examples, but he does not. Lastly, anyone who knows anything about group theory knows that it is a pretty dry subject matter. Cotton doesn't enhance the excitement of learning group theory with his dry, humor-less approach to writing the text (not to mention that this 3rd edition is already overdue for another overhauling being over a decade old!). In case you have insomnia while taking your group theory course, attempt to read a full chapter in one sitting, you'll be out cold by the second paragraph!My final verdict, if you are a graduate student in chemistry who already knows something about group theory and its application, but needs a text to jog your memory now and again, this book is worth your money, but if you have to learn the basics of group theory from this book, RUN! Run as fast as you can!

It has an amusing story line of the events that surround a young boy's life and how he copes with his coming into fortunes and life in general. But Dicken's masterful writing makes more than just a story line, it is also a social critique of Industeralized Society. For existance, Joe represents how life was before the Industerial Revolution. He was kind, hard working, morally upstanding, and happy, amoung other desirable qualities. Whereas Estella, for example, represented how it was during the Industerial Revolution. She was greedy, self-centered, controlling, and unhappy. This is also evident in Pip. At first he had the traits of the former, but once he got his &quot;Expecations&quot;, he exhibited the traits of the latter. Another part of his critique was the differance between the rich and the poor. There are other important ways in which he portrays them, but for lack of time the poor people were happy, whereas the rich were unhappy. Dickens is also great at describing setting and characters, so as some might see that as boreing, I see that as giving more depth to the story. He makes it seem like the reader is actually in 19th century London and meeting such interresting characters as Jaggers, Mr. Pocket, and of course honorable Joe. Anyone concidering buying this that is in high school, I reccomend not buying this because you will not undersand it, hence dislike it. But anyone who is already out of high school, or someone who read it in high school I would reccomend this book. Dickens is well know in literary circles for his genuis, but for some reason I cannot explain, in popular culture he does not come close to the popularity of Shakesphere, even though he was writer and Social Critic."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The way he describes everything from the eerie feeling he has in Ms. Havisham's room, to the smell of hay in the streets of London. Also the way everything connects together with the things you think are not important, an the way the book, sort of calms down at the end and explains everything that happens. This was a very hard book to read, so I would recomend Cliffs Notes with this, bot do NOT read the cliifs notes seperate! It ruins everything! Even if you hate classics, this is still one great book, I hate classics too, but still, it's very good. I had to read this for a freshman honor class exam, so not that I read this by choice, but i'm glad I did."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It took me a little while to get into the story and get to know all the characters, but once I did I couldn't put the book down. Charles Dickens is a wonderful writer, and Great Expectations prooved it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A good read from start to finish, typically Dickens, one ofthe classics. A fine work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a novel of bitterly dashed hopes and people who still cling to their broken dreams, allowing them to rob the present of meaning. Pride and greed are shown to delude even the best of people, causing them to believe what they want, rather than the obvious facts. The characters are over-the-top, yet still drawn sympathetically, and are some of the most memorable figures in the whole of literature. This is Dickens' best work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"One could not expect to get a decent review on this book from American youth who lack the culture, knowledge, and discipline to enjoy anything that is not a video game. Understanding Dickens, one must remember that he wrote his book in chapters which were printed as excerpts in popular magazines of the time. Compiling these excerpts together results in a lenghtier novel. Appreciate the author's ability to develop characters, to visually put the reader into 1800 Victorian England, and Dickens as a social justice advocate for the poor. If you're looking for extensive sex, violence, and meaningless dialogue and plot, watch American Television."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book was on my reading list for 9th grade, and it was my first Dickens novel ever. It took me about 3 days to read, and it was kind of a fluctuating thing. Some parts of it I couldn't put down, while other parts I dragged myself through. On the whole, I thought it was a good book, but not one I would read over again for a while. Dickens' use of figurative language is exquisite, but sometimes I found it hard to understand at first. The way almost every character described is tied some way into the tale is fantastic. You always have to pay attention, for you never know when that character might turn up again. This is such a tragic story already that I wish it would have ended a little better. I know it broke my heart. All in all, I would only recommend this book to someone who is in the mood for a complex tragedy."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Even though I'm only in High School, this book had a deep impact. This book was extrmely well written, Dickens use of figurative language and his descriptive language was fantastic!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a great book, and if it's too 'complex' for you, you haven't read many good books, because it pioneered the layout of a novel. It is full of forgiveness, obsession, pride, disillusionment... rich and involving. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My previous experience with Dickens is that I picked up A Tale of Two Cities, got about five pages, and then returned it to the library, yawning.Well, I finally decided that I would will myself through a Dickens novel. And I enjoyed it immensely. I can't say that the plot was especially thrilling -- nor the ending particularly satisfying. And yes, it is long, and if you just want to find out what happens, you won't find it to be of much interest. But what I like about the books is the attention to characters and details -- even ones that are almost irrelevant to the story -- but which kept kept me smiling and reading. In particular, his friend who is a clerk who has made his house TRULY to be his castle, complete with moat and drawbridge -- and who has an Aged Parent that had me laughing like crazy. The unexpected irony -- when Pip describes things to be such and so, but when it is clear to the reader to be much different -- I found to be wonderful. I felt that Dicken's had painted very strong visual elements -- by the end of the novel, I had very strong visual images of most of the characters and settings. I'm pleased to say that I have read a Dicken's novel and I truly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Of all the negative reviews I read, the common theme is &quot;I didn't understand it.&quot; Or, &quot;I was forced to read...&quot; Truth is, it is a very solid novel; not the greatest, but very good and insightful. For those of you who claim not to understand this work, may I suggest a return to Winnie the Pooh? Give the book a chance, think a little about it, and you may be surprised."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I remember having to read this book when I was a sophomore in high school. At the time I hated the book with a blue passion. Basically becuz I didn't understand it. Just recently, I decided to give it another chance (fifteen or so years later) and could not put it down. Although Pip is the main character, I found my sympathies lying with Estella. So young, so beautiful... so hardened. Ms. Havisham, in her greedy bitterness, deprives Estella the chance of real emotion, real love. Although I believe Ms. Havisham realizes what she has done near the end of the story, it is much too late for Estella. The re-written ending, although it pulled at my heart-strings, didn't work for me. The original ending is the only logical, perhaps realistic, ending in light of the events that occur within the story. For you kids who are forced to read it, try it again in a few years. I know your perception will have changed."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to read Great Expectations for a class project. I looked at how many pages it was and froze; &quot;How am I ever going to finish this book?&quot; I thought. After about 30 pages I was hooked and read it in a week. The language is old, so if you're young read it with a dictionary, it helps a lot! Dickens did a great job of tieing everything together at the end, and you know he must of had some master plan on what was going to happen!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great expectations is not only a great story filled with mystery, drama and action. Great expectations is a book that points out the personality flaws in all of us. It examines relationships and how they function between individuals. It is a great book and well worth the effort of reading."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is an excellent book. It boosted my vocabulary level up a great deal and contributed to my education. Thanks to Charles Dickens for writing this extrodinary book!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"An extremely beautiful novel that displays human conflicts throughout its length. No wonder it is described as a timeless classic! I loved this book because it had such a greta plot, with all the relations surfacing at the end. The relationship between Pip and Estella is particularily interesting, especially the change at the end. This is a treasurable addition to any collection."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A book that captivates the ideals of entertainment, Great Expectations is a novel that cannot be put down. Having previously read &quot; A Tale Of Two Cities &quot; for an English topic, I was dissatified with the quality of work that Dickens produced and did not understand the hype surrounding his works and the popularity of sales. Great Expectations has changed my view entirely, as Pip, the protagonist will always be a person that can be related to and felt for. The life of the protagonist experiences many facets of human education, and the outcome is satisfing to himself and to the reader. Dickens has created a true exploration of people and how and who we are. Each chapter ends on a twist and torments the reader into further readings. The life of Pip and the events and characters that involve him work fluently and emphasis this theme. Dickens commonly gives subtle hints of information for the reader to use in working out the complexities of the novel, sometimes leading in the right direction, and other times, in a misleading direction. This keeps the reader informed and eager to process all the facts to conclude their own opinions. The ending is truely &quot; warm-hearted &quot; and acts ideally to conclude the novel. A splendid book not to be neglected from any book collection."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This may be Dickens' finest novel, for while it may lack some of the comic character that animates his other masterworks, it has a focus and coherence unseen elsewhere in his serial novels. Filled with memorable images and the pain of unrequited love and self-reproach, Dickens has invented a superb comment on wealth, on youth, and on life in general. (Youths forced to read it in high school may not understand the pain of looking back until later in life.)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I, too, languished through this in High School. I, too, vowed never to pick up Dickens again. Then something happened. This is not bragging: it just happened. I grew up. Any intelligence I had mellowed into understanding, a very different faculty. Saddened, changed, I picked up Dickens again. And at last, I understood. Great Expectations isn't a classic for its language, plotting, style or wit. Like all Dickens' work, it is faulted in these areas. It's a classic because of Dicken's passion, which along with Bleak House pours onto the page and if you are at the right time of life, into your heart. So to all the reviewers here who find him problematic, wait a bit. Read a little about the nightmare world he lived in, the choked waterways slimey and poisonous with oil, feces and dye...the dangerous, airless shacks stacked up on each other, the rotten food...when it could be had at all. If you can, too, research a little into the social mores of the day, because what Dickens says about Victorian manners is quite true: virtue was often toggled to wealth in an absurd attempt to justify those unworthies clawing their way to the top of the &quot;Beehive&quot;. Try Dickens again later, when you have grown old. He's a ripping good yarn, but you must forgive him...he sees people as tiny valiant miracles amidst a roiling world of injustice, farcical posturing, physical danger, ignorance and want, and he needs to tell you about it. He often jokes about it, because the society he was writing for was very touchy and required its medicine to be sugar coated. It is only after you've put a Dickens book down that the images--minus the wit--pour over you and like the smoke curling through a Dickens novel it occurs to you you cannot breathe..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dicken's novel, Great Expectations, teaches a lot to the reader. The best thing about the story is Dicken's development of plotting and characters. It is about a person who experiences grown and shattered expectations from childhood to teenagehood to adulthood. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; basically means what is &quot;expected&quot; in life: a job, a career, money, marriage, etc. Pip helps a convict, Magwitch, in the beginning, to escape by bringing him a file to file the convict's leg iron. In the second stage of Pip's expectations, Pip has always been thinking that his secret benefactor is a certain Miss Havisham (whom he met in childhood), because he thought that her daughter, Estella, was destined for him. At the end of this stage, the benefactor appears, and Pip finds that it is the convict whom he had helped so long ago!! He is filled with repugnance. And Estella also gets married to his most despised enemy. And he is deeply in debt. Pip's great expectations are shattered to pieces by all of this. Later, Pip has to deal with it in the third stage of his expectations, and the story ends with all the people around Pip married, but with Pip still single. But Estella's husband had done so much evil gambling, and he also died in a horse accident, leaving room for relief from Pip. So, the story isn't exactly a happy ending, but it's better than nothing. This is a GREAT book!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This was the worst book that I have ever read in my entire life. I dont know why anyone would want to read this for fun.

I think its awful that I was forced to read what amounted to an 18th century serial out of a tabloid.The reason the book is filled with so much meaningless drivel is that Dickens was paid for each installment and the longer the series lasted the longer he had a steady job, At least thats my theory. I just wish I could ask the dead author some questions like Why didn't you let Pip grow the Hell up? That poor me, I'm a country peasant with no friends act got real tired real quick. Second question Where in his warped imagination did he get Ms. Havishom? News flash! Anyone who did so many terrible things because a man left her was mentally unstable before she met the jerk which explains why he left her. Oh and one more thing if your a feminists (like me) this book will get you upset enough. The only women in the book are either crazy old hags or out right bitches. It certainly says a lot about male Victorian sensibilities!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I looked forward to reading a classic of Dicken's.

I have taken great joy in reading Nathaniel Hawthorne, Mark Twain, and even Tolkien. At least Tolkien went on and on, it was with purpose and there was a point.

I don't like long books like Great Expectations but this book went into extreme detail about the most meaningless things.The novel grabs you fast and has a story with many surprises and twists along the way.Theres all sorts of unknown parents, secret coniving, mysterious benefactors, and worst of all, many unrealistic characters. Miss Havisham, Pip, Magwitch, Mr. Jaggers, and Estella are the characters that you should think more about them understand them.If this is to be your first reading of the book, be patient with the book's middle third,because the real and important events starts very late;The story centers around a young boy--well, almost young man-- named Pip, and revolves around his growing into age. Much of Pip's worry and concern I could relate to--falling in love with a girl who only plays with your heart, growing up and leaving home for the first time, and discovering your true relationships with others and yourself.It is a darker work, but it has some exciting and entertaining parts to it, too. If a ex-convict came up to me, I would be so scared that I would run away. The fact that Pip trusted Magwitch with a lot of things really amazed me.Actually there are great descriptions with wonderful dialogues and I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants a good, but an illogical read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Do not give this book as a gift.

Some of the words the use you don't normally hear everyday or the way they phrase some of their sentences makes it harder to know what is going on. I liked this novel though the story was great in how all the events that took place connected to something else in the end of the story.My favorite parts in this book were when Pip was finding more and more about Estella and her family because it kept you wanting to read more and more of the story so you could find out what happened. The major themes of the story were kind of hard to understand because some of them are hidden in the story and Dickens doesn't come right out and say what's happening and sometimes he drags out the seen and makes it really easy to lose interest or just get confused.Dickens didn't really bring the story alive for me because I didn't really understand some of the parts in the book, but I did like the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"HOW I JUDGE A CLASSIC: I don't give extra brownie points to classic books. I ask myself, \\"If this book were published today by some unknown author, what would I think of it?\\" Perhaps this isn't a fair way to judge a classic, but that's the method I use.PROS OF GREAT EXPECTATIONS:- It has outstanding character development.- It's a story about people and relationships.- Good, authentic dialog.- A nice moral story.CONS:- Painfully slow pacing.- Long-winded writing style, long paragraphs.- Few characters that are that agreeable.CONCLUSION: Have low expectations when you read \\"Great Expectations.\\" Modern books have much faster pacing and are more easy to read.

It is considered to be his greatest work to many critics. I read the book and found that it was probably the most boring book I had ever read in my life. Overall the book had a pretty well thought out plot. To me though the book was a classic and masterpiece only when it was first became published. People now in the present are not very easily satisfied with a book with a good plot and are well written. People now are just more interested in books that have a lot of twists and turns in the story. They want be able not know what is going to happen next in the story. The book Great Expectations even though it was such a boring book it did have some very interesting parts. Also the book was overall well written by the author. One strength that the book had was the fact it had such interesting characters. The author had well character development throughout the book. All the characters in the book were described that you tell each character apart because of their personality or physical appearance. The main character Philip Pirrip also nicknamed Pip was very well described as a character. The author told everything possible about Pip so throughout the book you saw the main character grow into man and also grow as person in general. When Pip when through something you almost felt like it was you in the book. Also another strength in the book was the great setting descriptions. It was so good because when you were reading the book you could actually picture the setting in your head. The book had very little strengths because I was forcing myself to actually read it. If it had actually been actually interesting I would have finish the book in one day instead of a three weeks. The only reason that I actually read was the fact I knew had to do a report on it. The book had many faults for a classic book. The main weakness of the book was the chapters that were pointless and just there to take up space. The book seemed was written to just tell a story of boy without any really interesting parts. I was somewhat disappointed in the fact that the book was considered a classic book because a classic book to me is book that can interest anyone and any age. The book had great plot and well-written characters but I thought that the book could have been shorter. It could have been shorter and would still have the same impact on a reader. The reader will eventually find out that the book Great Expectations is just a book to read when you have nothing else to read. Think this book just wasted my time. I hated every minute that I spent reading this book. In scale of one through to ten I would give it a four. The book is fairly good but the book is simply too long to tell a simple and boring story of a boy named Pip. I wouldn't recommend this book because I think that the reader will be truly bored. Probably the main target audience of this book was of young adult. The book is good for that age range because of the somewhat difficult and confusing vocabulary. The book Great Expectations is just a book to be read when there are no more books to read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"this book basically bored me to tears, it's one of those books that you really have to be into from the beginning to get the story at all, like harry potter or lord of the rings. main point = if you're not a charles dickens fan, the amazon description doesn't amaze you, and even you've read it before and reallllyyyyy disliked, then this book is not for you."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"In my opinions, the book is alright, but not the greatest book ever as other people like to say. The writing is beautiful and clever, but I think that the characters and plot are really all pretty stupid and unrealistic, especially Mrs. Havisham; that would never happen and I don't believe it's possible to wear the same clothing without bathing for all those years. The clothing would be torn apart and you would smell horribly. The cake would've been gone, too. And the aged one in Mr. Wemmicks apartment who gets happier the more violently you nod at him?

Dickens' tedious descriptions and constant indecision on how the plot should turn makes the novel lose it's potential merit.Thousands of scholars and other readers have lauded Great Expectations as the finest Dickens' work of all time. The fact remains that it appears Dickens could not decide whether to make this a tragedy or an &quot;all's well that ends well&quot; happy-go-lucky type of story. This is proven by his change of the original ending. However, any reader could give testimony of feeling &quot;yanked, strung along, or thrown about&quot; from page one as they wonder just what Dickens wants them to think about Pip and his less-than remarkable life. Should we sympathize, feel disgust, be concerned? Does he deserve Estella's scorn or is he a victim of circumstance?The more you read of this cryptic novel the more you grow to understand that Dickens doesn't know what his novel is about, either. The entire book seems to vary by the chapter. And the fact that the plot has a potentially good story behind it that Dickens doesn't care to elaborate on makes the entire thing a bit more tedious for the take.The fact remains that Dickens is a fabulous story-teller. He has accurate, unjaded descriptions, refreshing, occassionally bitter, sometimes triumphant plots, and enough suspense to keep you reading throughout the night. It's just that none of that takes place in Great Expectations.Holly Burke, PhD.Clinical Psychologist, Abnormal Psych.

Don't write me off as a slack-jawed Gen-Xer though, because I've read some pretty heavy stuff (Faulkner, Montaigne, Steinbeck, Salinger, Dumas, Hemingway, Vonnegut, Tolkien) and loved it. I eat up Mark Twain; &quot;A Connecticut Yankee&quot; was a page-turner for me, and &quot;Huck Finn&quot; is my all-time favorite book.

I agree that Dickens is one of the great storytellers of all time, and he may have had the greatest imagination for character development since Shakespeare. But his writing style turns me off."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am currently being forced to read this book for my Honors English class in high school. I've already read it once before for a different class, so I know what I am talking about when I say this book is the ultimate cure for insomnia.I honestly try to appreciate what is *supposed* to be fine literature, but &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is about as entertaining as watching kale grow. First off, the fact that this book has two endings inspires a bit of skepticism in me. I've never heard of an author so indecisive that he would put two endings in a novel. It creates a generally unsatisfying conclusion, as you're at a loss for which ending to &quot;accept&quot;.Aside from which, this book has enough useless passages to fill a hundred pages or so. It seems that, basically, Dickens didn't quite know exactly what to write about, but felt the urge to *write* *something*. So he wrote &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, following the traditional poor-boy formula of his previous 15 or so books.I find it especially hilarious that none of my teachers have ever even read the bloody novel, but it's &quot;good&quot; according to the curriculum. In the words of someone from a certain other Charles Dickens book, &quot;Bah! Humbug!&quot;.Don't judge Dickens by this book, however. &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, for example, even though it follows the same &quot;poor-boy&quot; formula, is worlds better than this.As much as I'd love to say, &quot;Oh, it's a classic, everyone should read it!&quot;, I personally don't think so."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great works of English literature from the 1700s and 1800s shared one thing in common; twists and turns in the plot lines that are never fully exposed until the last lines of the book. Chief among these twists are reversals of fortune both good and bad. So goes this work of literature. Though read by many as children, I would consider it more worthy of young adults, as the text can be quite boring for anyone below their teens. Basically, the plot revolves around Pip, a boy who grows up poor in the care of his sister and apprenticed to a blacksmith; a blue collar job by any standard. But he comes into an inheritance which he gladly accepts, leaving behind his previous life. A second theme of this story is his awe and obsession over Estella, a pretty girl who he meets first when young and poor when she does not even see him, and later one when he is rich when she cannot look past him. This is the probably the part of the book best remembered; a boy infatuated with what he cannot get, only to re-encounter it on later on in life as something he might not want anymore.As a book, it is shorter than most of Dickens' work, and much easier to read. But it has less historical meaning, and to me, less exploration of social ills than his other works such as Oliver Twist and Great Expectations. The book focuses more on personal travails, and how relationships between individuals all depend on the where the individuals came from. The book is interesting enough, but not that exciting, and I would not consider it as a mandatory work for all students to read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I liked this book, I really did, I promise. But in my opinion, Dickens's other novel &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; is much, much better.So before you buy this book, check out &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; as well. Maybe you can buy both. :) Just don't go with &quot;Great Expectations&quot; because it is more well-known. That doesn't mean that it will be better in all people's opinions."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens, was a very strong novel. I enjoyed it, but found parts of it confusing and difficult to read. It is a very &quot;deep&quot; novel which has twists and turns throughout. In the begining, Pip was an orphan who went to live with his sister (who was mean) and her husband (who was an OK guy.) Later, he goes to the home of Miss Hauisham. She is a lady who is kind of crazy because of a past situation. Her lover left her years ago. Here is where Pip meets her daughter, Estella, who is very beautiful ( and who was always moody and was spoiled.) Pip falls for Estella (I guess he can put her personality aside.) Later on, Pip becomes wealthy but he can't figure out who left him the money (He thinks it was Miss Hauisham.) It ends up that a man named Able left him the money. When Pip was young, Able asked him for food. Pip got it for him and Able was convicted and he was forced to move away. After he moved he became wealthy and because of Pips heart and help, Able left him a fortune. As for the end... you can read it for your self and find out the suprises. My only complaint is that there are some confusing parts (as I said above.) Overall, I really enjoyed this book and reccommend it for people who like Dicken's work. To be honest, when I first got this book I did not want to read it. I figured I would just rent the movie with Gweneth Paltrow, and base my report on that. It is SO DIFFERENT. The book and the movie are not alike. I decided to read it and so I did. I reccommend this book for people who like Dicken's work. He really did a great job with this one."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations must have been what the readers of Dickens' serial publication must have had when they first read it, and I have to wonder if they were as disappointed as I was after slogging all the way through to the skewed, disjointed, and extremely contrived ending. This was written as a serial, not a novel, and I think Dickens (and his readers) would have benefited from a rewrite before publication in novel form.If ever there was a novel that set out to have no meaning, no core, no arc, and most of all, no satisfaction, it must be Great Expectations. The novel's title clearly states Dickens' perspective and intention; that great expectations in life will be met by great (and bitter) disappointment, and the greater the expectation, the greater your disappointment in life will be. The idea that a woman jilted at the altar will spend her life grooming a young girl to make other young men's lives miserable, is a contrived, almost paranoid idea from a male's perspective. Mrs. Havershim's great expectations for life were dashed, because instead of moving on to meet a better man, she chooses to become a shut-in and ruin a young man's expectations for life. However, if it seems that Dickens is building towards some kind of message about not having overblown expectations and then being bitter if they don't work out, the reader is to be disappointed. Dickens goes out of his way not to make this point or any point, but to make a grimly sad tale bereft of any kind of compass or solace for either the characters or the reader.Pip, the protagonist, survives his encounter with the damaged Estella, who had been deliberately damaged by Havershim to be \\"unable to love\\". The ending, in which he encounters her again briefly and is glad she is able to have the heart to \\"understand his heart as it was\\", is unbelievable, pompous and drowning in its own self-pity, all at the same time. It also feels as if Dickens took a perfunctory way to get out of a story that had meandered its way away from him.Great Expectations must be the most disappointing, overblown \\"classic\\" novel I have ever read, not because it doesn't have a happy ending, but because of the way that Dickens has created his characters and shapeless mess of a story, and presented it in the most abrasive fashion possible. I was relieved at the end to have finished it, not satisfied, not sad, and certainly not edified. There is nothing to learn or grow from in this novel; it has made me less of a Dickens fan. And that is the most disappointing result of reading it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm surprised that this book is a requirement in highschool. I had to read it in my upper division English Lit class in college and I just couldn't get into it. There are way too many retarded characters on which Dickens spends too much time, Pip gets more annoying with every page, especially his love for Estella who is one of the most disgusting characters in the book. I've read Jane Eyre before this and it was a real page turner. This is plain boring."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations has a few interesting characters. I'll give it that. Magwitch and Miss Havisham are definitely original and entertaining. But everyone else is pretty bland.Pip's love for Estella is rather pathetic. Why he would love such a despicable person is beyond me. This fact alone makes Pip difficult to relate to, and thus not a very good choice for the point-of-view character.But the one thing that absolutely ruins this book is the clutter of coincidences. One of the first rules of fiction writing is NO COINCIDENCES. And Dickens goes out of his way to break this rule. Over. And Over. And Over.Really, it is not a very good book. Please do not wasted your money on it (although there are a LOT of pages, so it could last you months as toilet paper"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Of all the Dickens novels I've read, this one is certainly the most atmospheric and perhaps the most true to life. In terms of art, this is probably his supreme achievement. The plot isn't as convoluted as it is in Bleak House. The action is more dramatic. The female characters, particularly Estella, are more believable and (in the case of Miss Havisham, for instance) more intriguing. The sentimentality and the overall length are under tighter control. The humor still abounds. The language is easier to read but no less descriptive. No, it's not a perfect work -- there are still cloying and annoying characters and incidents, and far too many ridiculous coincidences -- but to me, at least, Great Expectations is Dickens' greatest achievement."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The book \\"The Great Expectations\\" was probably originally intended for middle-class adults in London. Today however the book is read and understood by both children and adults. Some things about the book that made it worth reading was first and most obvious the story line. Also the book seemed to go really fast. The story started with action wich made the book more enjoyable to read. Also it didn't get bogged down very much throughout the entire story. Another good quality of the book is that it didn't contain much romance, which can also slow a good book down. The main point of the book that affection, loyalty, and consience are more important than social advancement, wealth, and class, could have a strong affect on certain communities. Since this sort of theme has been around for a while and will continue to be around for a while gives the book credit for being a classic. Also the fact that this book is fairly old and is still being read to this day makes it a classic. The book was written in great detail. All the characters were fully described and all served a purpose. That also made this book very interesting. I would recommend this book to middle school students, and to adults as well as anyone in between. This book and the main idea was not difficult to understand. Also it is enough of an action and \\"turn around\\" book that it keeps the readers attention even to the end."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations by Charles Dickens was a very good novel in my eyes. The main character Pip believed, as a true Victorian, that a gentlemen is made solely of financial aspects and physicall possessions, and he is oblivious to moral aspects of the positions. Upon recieving his great expectations, he moves to London for a further education, and to become what he thinks is a gentlemen. Through Pips life he learns that his life as a gentlemen is not what he thought it would be, and his views of a true gentlemen start to change. With thanks to Dickens and Great Expectations, we realize that sometimes even a convict may be more genteel than a traditional gentlemen. He may start as a poor orphan boy, like Pip, or labour as a blacksmith, like Joe. truly, what matters is the heart and inner worth that make a genuine gentlemen, and social prestige has not a bit to do with it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Although one of the first Dickens books that I've read, it is still one of my favourites. The scenes with Miss Haveisham's ghost wedding banquet are haunting and have stuck with me for years. We see how Pip saw this abandoned wedding banquet, and then we follow Pip and his subsequent relationship with Miss Havisham as he grows up. Miss Havisham, for some reason has resolved to take out her considerable vindictiveness on little Pip, and we see how this moulds little Pip's character. We also see the positive effect that a prisoner (Joe Gargery) has on Pip. The tone of this novel is quite gloomy throughout, but it does end on a positive note. Although gloomy, it does have Dickens' usual warmth and humour displayed throughout, and of course his wonderful characters. This is a book that will stay with you for a long time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"great expectations is just that. i am not much of a classics fan, preferring contemporary writers. i decided to read this after reading john irving's \\"trying to save piggy sneed, in this book irving finishes with an essay on dickens where he says that great expectations was the book that made him want to write. being a big irving fan, i decided to read great expectations and i have to admit i was blown over by dickens' writing style. the humour, the characterisation, the verbal jugglery, the pompousness, the joy of writing were all apparent and absolute fun. the best thing about the book is that it hasnt aged one bit.dickens writes with rare moral courage and compassion for the failings of his characters, he creates a vividly colourful world populated by extraordinary characters too bizarre to be real, yet makes us trust in them, and slowly makes us sympathise with them and eventually grow to love them. the strength of this book is not in its plot but rather in the style of writing.a thoroughly enjoyable book if you love a colourful writing style."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I have to read this book for highschool, and even though I'm not through with it quite yet, I think it's a lot better than I expected. Charles Dickens threw in a few parts that I thought were kind of exciting. In the beginning, you really have to get used to different spellings of words, like &quot;skilful&quot;, for example, but after you get into the book more, you catch on.The main character, Pip, goes from being a boy raised by his sister, to becoming a gentleman. In his journey, he meets several different people, like Ms. Havisham and Estella, for example. There are many different things he must go through before he is told he has an opportunity to become a gentleman. Now I just have to see how it ends!I'd recommend it to people who are older than highschool, just because I think you'd enjoy and understand it a lot more! But if you're a real bookworm, you'd like it. :)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"&quot;Great Expectations&quot; is an extraordinary novel of a young boy's journey to adulthood. We meet Pip as he describes his sister who &quot;raised him by hand.&quot; However, despite his misgivings about his sister he still feels very fondly towards his brother-in-law Joe Gargery. He meets many extraordinary characters along the way one of them being the classic literary figure Miss Havsiham. Miss Havisham had a broken heart and she raised her daughter Estealla to view men the same way she did. As Pip grows up and moves out on his own he becomes the only person to know the true identity of Estella. The other important character in &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a criminal. He had threatened Pip in the marshes when he was a young boy and came back from New Zealand many years later to see Pip again. All though the criminal meets his untimely demise we still grow close to the character and miss him when he goes. This book gives an excellent view of not only a young boy's thoughts and emotions but outlook as well. It takes you on a journey that provides you with many lessons that can be carried throughout your life. Despote the magnificence and brilliance of the author's writing it is still a very difficult book. Dickens gives an amazing outlook on life and he deserves the recognition he has gotten, even since his death. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a true classic and deserves to go down in literary history."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Absolutely one of my favorite books ever written... superb, intense and emotional, this books is highly reccommended to anyone who likes literature. Follows the coming of age of Pip, who is realized so fully that the reader cant help but identify with him, and come to feel as if he knows him. Anything by Dickens is bound to be something special, but in my opinion this one takes the cake."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a great story of Pip (Philip Pirrip)'s obsessive love for a woman who neither loves him nor seems in any way the typical heroine. As he strives to become a gentleman, aided by an anonymous benefactor's money, he succeeds only in alienating those who love him best and most honestly. Appearances, as in most Dickens novels, are deceiving, and those who are wealthy in a material sense are not those who are wealthy in the emotional sense and vice versa.The language and sentence structure are both complex; if you have any difficulty in understanding this sort of English you'd do well to wait awhile before reading GREAT EXPECTATIONS, because Dickens' brilliance is in the wording. This is less humorous than many of his other stories; however the humor is there if you look for it and listen for it in the phrasing.Dickens provided two endings for this book, and, frankly, I don't care much for either...but read the book, read both endings, and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a story that only Dickens could tell, and no Hollywood screenwriter can capture the same. Dickens created characters that can not be placed in another time. Pip is a blacksmith apprentince and meets up with a man in a graveyard named Magwitch. He helps Magwitch out and then Magwitch takes the blame and gets sent to Australia to pay for Pip's crime. Pip is then invited to play at Miss Havisham's manor with her ward Estella. And Miss Havisham uses Estella to despise any man. Since Miss Havisham was betrayed by her husband to at the altar by not showing up, she feels it's her life's duty to make all men suffer. So Estella makes Pip feel horrible for his hands and only allows him to get close enough to toil with him. You feel so sorry for Pip and how he is tormented by Estella. All the while he gets money from an unannounced bennefactor that turns his life around. And he moves to London to become a gentlemen. A great story about friendship.

I have also become a great admirer of the work of Frank Muller, who has recorded countless works, both popular novels and classics (including Moby Dick, the brave soul!)When Mr. Muller sank his teeth into Great Expectations, he created a performance with the perfect combination of innocence, humor, irony and adventure. He had me laughing out loud despite being stuck in terrible rush hour traffic.The actor manages to become the characters to the point where you forget only one man is reading all of the parts. He has created convicts you could easily picture, and almost smell. His portrayal of Joe Gargery makes you love the character for his heart of gold. His portrayal of Wemmick's \\"castle\\" and the \\"ancient\\" was so hilarious I was almost in tears.Of course, Dickens had quite a bit to do with it too.I realize there are countless recordings of this great work, and I'm sure this won't be the last I will ever hear. But I will always remember Frank Muller's rendition with great appreciation and a broad smile."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is a novel that will keep you interested all throughout. It follows the interesting story of a boy named Pip throughout his many life experiences and different phases of his expectations. The plot is connected in a unique way throughout the book, and mysteries are solved and connected with it. Through his beautiful writing and interesting plot, this novel is arguably Dickens's greatest work. The language does require your full attention to understand it, and it is a very long book, but the writing is so great that you don't really notice to much.The tone of the novel is pretty dark and gloomy, but there is a constant sense of hope throughout. With themes of social class, guilt and innocence, and ambition we see Pip grow as a person and learn about the struggles and trials in life. There is also a bit of a love story that occurs that puts some fey real emotion into the story.I would reccomend this book to younng adults and adults who have the ability to understand the writing. I would reccomend that a person read it when they are looking for a good book, but have plenty of time to read and really take the story in. You need full attention to read it, but it is well worth the time it takes."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"After having finished the novel and feeling uncertain as to what was meant by the ambiguous ending, I did some research in some critical journals. Lo and behold, I came to find that the sentence, as published in this edition, is NOT what was supposed to have been written. Doubtless it is a (large) typographical error, but it changed the entire ending of the novel. Shameful to have happened, particularly for a book that markets itself towards classrooms and reading groups.The only good thing that developed from this experience is that through my research I discovered an alternate ending that Dickens had originally intended to use. Reading about the controversy between the two endings was interesting. Aladdin's nonsensical third ending was not. Further, it makes me wonder what else in the story was horribly wrong......Great novel, but don't buy it from Aladdin. I won't be buying anything further from them in the future."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had thought of reading this book many times and am glad I finally gave it a read.

The notes in the Oxford Classics edition are much better (more thorough and more informative), and so is the introduction. George Bernard Shaw's introduction to this Modern Library edition is an intelligent piece of criticism, but it's also very partial and shortsighted. There's nothing terribly wrong with the Modern Library edition, but it's not the best one. I have used this for a class I was teaching, but next time I'll be using the Oxford Classics instead (unless something better comes along in the meantime)."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a great classic.

As Pip comes into a small fortune, and becomes a \\"gentleman\\" he learns the value and true meaning of friendships and life. But the journey is a long one, with many lessons to be learned along the way before he can find his true self. Dickens has given us a wonderful story, with rich details of the setting and characters that grow and are among the most interesting and magnetic to be found in literature.I don't need to go on and on about the book itself(although I could easily go over my allotted word count here), if you haven't read it yet ,just know you are in for one heck of a literary treat. It is a story that will transport you to another time and place, and you may not want to come back. I will however, talk about this marvelous audio book. Michael Page is the reader, and what a reading he gives. Just curl up and listen to this master storyteller. Every voice, every nuance is captured. There is no doubt who is speaking as he gives each character the personality and cultural characteristics as Dickens intended. He even does the women wonderfully, without going over the top. In my mind Miss Havisham has always sounded just the way Page portrayed her, Estella as uppity as ever,the humble Joe, along with all the rest.If you are a fan of this book, this audio edition will give you a fresh read and new appreciation of this fascinating book. If you are experiencing it for the first time, you can't help but to become enthralled.

Pip's parents die when he is young making him an orphan. Pip is \\"brought up by hand\\" by his sister, who treats him with scorn. His sister's lack of love, however, is tempered by her husband Joe, a blacksmith. Joe is a simple, uneducated man and Pip's only \\"friend\\" during childhood. Pip commiserates with Joe about his sister's verbal thrashings, trying to make the best of his unhappy upbringing.Early in the story, Pip has an encounter with a convict in the cemetery among the marshes near his home. Unbeknownst to him, this man would be the source for his \\"Great Expectations\\" later in life.One day Pip is invited to the home of Ms. Havisham. Ms. Havisham is a single, eccentric, old woman who stopped living in the real world many years earlier when she was spurned by her lover on her wedding day.Ms. Havisham has adopted the beautiful Estella, and from the moment Pip meets her, he is infatuated with her beauty. Estella represents wealth, education, success, and opportunity--things Pip values but thinks he will never have.Dissatisfaction within himself grows as he wants to be more in life than a partner with Joe in the forge. Pip becomes unhappy not only with himself, but also with Joe, who represents what he does not want to be--uneducated and simple. Failing to appreciate Joe's moral character, Pip's world view begins to change as he sees education as something to be attained--the sure way out of his wretched life and the means by which he could woo the object of his unmerited affections, Estella.Pip's life changes dramatically when he is visited by a well respected and fiercely admired lawyer, Mr. Jaggers, who brings him an unusual message. Mr. Jaggers tells Pip he is to receive \\"Great Expectations,\\" but the benefactor is to remain anonymous until and only if they choose to reveal their identity. Pip mistakenly assumes the benefactor is Ms. Havisham, and the manipulating, self serving woman does nothing to dissuade him from his incorrect assumptions.The story takes Pip to London where he lives a life of excess and discards many virtues from his childhood. He no longer wants anything to do with Joe and believes his future course has been immutably set--that he is to marry the beautiful Estella. He shares his indulgences with his new friend, Herbert, whose acquaintance he had made years earlier at Ms. Havisham's place. The two of them rack up excessive debt as Pip sees himself as \\"a man in waiting\\" for all his fortunes to come to pass.Things are not what they seem, however. It is eventually revealed that the benefactor is not Ms. Havisham but the convict, Mr. Magwitch, whom Pip had met in the cemetery many years earlier when he was a young, impressionable boy.Pip is confronted face to face with the despised convict, hounded by the remembrances of him torturing him in the cemetery, dreams that lingered, causing him much consternation. But now he has to accept the undeniable truth that his turn of fortune is not because of Ms. Havisham's provision, but the despicable convict's desire to make him a gentleman. The convict wants his life to be redeemed for something good and chooses Pip to be that vehicle.Through a series of events, Pip acknowledges the inexcusable way he has treated Joe and wants to make amends. Before he can accomplish this, however, other happenings complicate his life. The convict, now in England, needs Pip's protection. Pip must make a way for Magwitch to leave England without being discovered.While Pip hides him with a trusted friend, Pip comes to realize that the convict he had earlier despised has more redemptive qualities than Pip has within himself. As he makes provision for the convict's escape, Pip sees Magwitch change for the better, and in so doing, Pip also changes. Instead of hating the convict, Pip grows to love him. The self centeredness of Pip's indulgences is replaced with care, not only for the convict, but in growing degrees, for others.In the process of trying to escape, the convict is attacked by his long-time archrival and enemy. As a result, Magwitch is severely injured, discovered by the authorities, put on trial and convicted, but dies from his injuries before his death sentence can be carried out. Magwitch's estate is turned over to the authorities to make restitution for past wrongs. Pip is left penniless and obligingly accepts that his Great Expectations and source of income have dissipated into nothing. Meanwhile, Estella marries someone else--a man whom Pip despises.A few years earlier, Pip had secretly made arrangements for his friend Herbert to have a small expectation out of his \\"Great Expectations,\\" amounting to a sizable sum of money. When it becomes known to Pip that he will lose his \\"Great Expectations\\" to the authorities, his only thought is for his friend. Pip returns to visit Ms. Havisham and requests, in a show of repentance for the wrongs she had done to him, a sum of money that Pip could again secretly provide to Herbert.Herbert wisely uses this money to successfully buy into a business venture. He later marries and moves overseas in his business pursuits--none of which would have been possible without Pip's anonymous provision to Herbert.Pip credits this as the only redeeming thing he has accomplished, reflecting on all the other things he did or didn't do that could have been used for good.Pip falls ill following the death of his convict friend, Magwitch, and Joe comes to England to care for him until he is well. Joe surreptitiously leaves early one morning when Pip is sufficiently recovered, and when Pip wakes up, he discovers Joe has paid off all his creditors. Pip immediately returns home in penitence to confess to Joe all his past wrongs, realizing that Joe is a better man than he. He recognizes in his now humble state that his \\"Great Expectations\\" deceived him into using it as a source of pride against Joe.Upon arriving home, Pip's expectations are not what he envisioned. His sister who raised him by hand has long since died as a result of an attack on her by the evil Orlick. His childhood friend and confidant, Biddy, has just married Joe. In the end, redemption works its way for good. Joe and Biddy are happily married and the sore memories of Pip's sister are forgotten.Pip returns to London and within a month, leaves England and joins Herbert's firm, Clarriker and Company, overseas. Pip lives abroad with Herbert and his wife, and after successfully making partner, eleven years later, returns to his boyhood home in England. He discovers Joe and Biddy now have a son who reminds him of himself.Before bidding Joe and Biddy a final farewell, Pip makes one last trip to the Havisham place, the old woman having died many years earlier. Pip discovers Estella in the garden, a chance meeting since she no longer lives there. The old house and brewery have been torn down and sold off except for the garden enclosed by the ivy covered wall.Years of a stormy, failed marriage have softened Estella's vindictive, prideful nature, and she confesses that \\"suffering has been stronger than all other teaching and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be.\\"The reader is left to ponder whether Pip and Estella ever marry because Pip says, \\"I saw no parting from her.\\"In the end, Pip learns much about what matters--wisdom he would not have possessed if he had stayed working at Joe's forge. As a middle aged narrator looking back, there is sadness but sweetness about what he has lost because of what he has gained. Perhaps the reader is the real winner, having seen redemption on so many levels within each character. In the end, if we are honest, we can identify these shortcomings in ourselves. If Pip can work out his \\"Great Expectations\\" to bring redemption, perhaps we can, also--that is, again, if we are honest. Our sinful nature will always be there, but if we look for good, God will not disappoint us. Maybe \\"Great Expectations\\" will not only find us, but redemption will be there, too, just as it was in Pip."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This was my first time to read a Dickens book i thought i wouldn't like it but once i got to know all the people and there ways which were very funny ways at times, i really enjoyed the book and couldn't but it down i love the sweet friendship Pip and Herbert have in the story but the best thing was Joe how could you not love Joe in this story!!!! he wasn't the smartest person but he was the best person..!!!,Im not sure which ending i like most but i thought they were both good in there own way.. ;)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This particular book is just the right physical size, as are the type and font, to make it easy to read, unlike any paperback version you are likely to find.To enjoy Dickens is to enjoy his preposterous characterizations, clever and cutting wit, wonderfully complex story lines, and of course his trademark maudlin interludes or devices.The latter make a pretty rich broth making one of his books go a long way. His use of language too causes one to undertake his novels fully prepared to spend time parsing his sentences and consulting a dictionary in order to satisfactorily comprehend his writing.In other words, Dickens can never be read lightly even though, strictly speaking, his work might be considered light reading.'Great Expectations' is particularly worthy of close reading for, whether intentionally or not, it harkens back to 'The Odyssey' by Homer. Yes, that's right, apart from being a truly ripping yarn, the gist of which you can doubtless cull from other amazon reviews, this is a book in which Dickens examines or, more accurately, lays bare the inner workings of the (male?) human psyche.Humans are raised upon a diet of myths of human perfection, a list of which is endless; superhuman athlete, heroic military personnel, idealistic politician, anointed prophet, perfect mother, exalted leader, etc. What Dickens does in this great book is discuss the contradictions that lie within us all that make us heroes one moment and cowards the next; paragons of virtue on the one hand, and unprincipled thieves on the other; selfless benefactors today and greedy self-servers tomorrow.Most of us believe ourselves to be endowed with above average amounts of courage, generosity, and charity, etc. In addition to pointing out such conceits, Dickens proceeds to demonstrate how we maintain these notions while acting in radically contradictory ways to them.This brings me back to Homer's 'Odyssey,' and also to the works of Wm. Shakespeare which are the West's most revered examinations of man's psyche. It strikes one that this book is Dickens' effort, successful and brilliant effort, to do as they have. Granted, the latter's work is sentimental and written to be broadly popular; however, this accessibility in no way can hide the fact that Mr. Dickens addresses fundamental human truths/traits in this book.Based on amazon reviews, this book is evidently assigned to many 9th grade English classes. What a shame, as it is doubtful that such a young person has yet had a broad enough experience of the personal contradictions that allow us to tick. Perhaps Freshman classes would be better served by 'The Great Gatsby,' 'Catcher in the Rye' and similarly glib works, leaving sublime works such as this for later years. (It could be argued that early exposure might arm one against future bad behavior...the point Dickens makes though is that we can't avoid ourselves.)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations follows Pip's life goes from childhood to adulthood with many twists and turns.

We would expect someone born into his social class to remain in this position forever, without much hope for improvements. However, Pip surprises us when he has a chance encounter with Miss Havisham, an old, grumpy, widow. She's obviously delirous, upset at men who have crossed her, and does take out some of her anger at poor Pip. But yet Pip is lucky behind his wildest dreams, for he is about to meet the beautiful Estella, and while this may appear normal, it is definitely not. And this is what makes &quot;Great Expectations&quot; a classic: the book is about Cinderella from reverse: it is the man, in this particular instance, who moves from working-class peasant to meeting an upper-class elegant lady who is beautiful beyong Pip's dreams.It is an aspiring tale in that it tells the reader that they, too, may be able to have widespread class mobility. They are not stuck in their present circumstances and may indeed exceed their own expectations.-- Michael GordonLos Angeles"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"First of all, I too am a student forced to read this book for a Freshman Honors English class, and I fail to see how many people can call this book a waste of time. Sure, I know the language is a bit of a challenge, but that's what a dictionary is for!Anyway, I haven't yet finished the book (I still have a long way to go,) for I'm only on chapter 13, but I had to chime in and counterattack what all of the rest of the whiney students have said. So far, the way Dickens portrays his characters (by means of language, description, and dialogue) seems ultimately realistic (it should be, considering it was written in the 1830's) and there are many things throughout the book one has to come to love: Pip's almighty guilty conscience, the friendship bond between Pip and Joe, etc.I can't sum up everything, for as I've said, I'm not finished yet, but for those of you who are being forced to read it, read it with an open mind.

Nicholas Nickleby is next for me..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Certainly one of the most famous of Dickens's novels (right up there withOliver Twist (Penguin Classics)andDavid Copperfield (Penguin Classics)), Great Expectations follows a familiar coming-of-age narrative as young Phillip Pirrip - better known as \\"Pip\\" - negotiates the rocky road to adulthood in early 19th century London. One of only two of Dickens's novels that are written in first person narrative (the other being David Copperfield), Great Expectations is a fascinating tale of ambition, love, regret, missed chances and redemption, topped off with an adequately ambiguous ending (more on that later).Raised by his tyrannical sister and her kind, doting husband Joe, Pip is contented enough to become a blacksmith and live out his life by the misty Kent marshlands. That is until he is unexpectedly thrown into the path of two extraordinary people. The first is a convict, escaped from the prison barges offshore, a terrifying man who coerces the young Pip into stealing him some supplies from his sister's larder. Stricken by guilt and terror, Pip complies. The second is the mysterious Miss Havisham, a spinster woman who employs Pip as a playmate for her young ward, the beautiful Estella. Estella is regal, snobbish and cold - naturally, Pip falls head over heels in love with her, despite the realization that she's far beyond his status. Wretchedly aware of his own shortcomings, Pip yearns for a chance to make a gentleman of himself, and win the hand of fair Estella.And then, just as unexpectedly, fortune is thrown his way. He is informed by Miss Havisham's lawyer that a secret benefactor has endowed him with great expectations, and that he is to travel to London in order to prepare for his future. The only catch is that Pip is forbidden from investigating the origins of his newfound fortune, although logic dictates that it must be Miss Havisham, who surely has designs for both Pip and Estella. Locked up in a house full of bitter memories after she was jilted by her lover, Miss Havisham is certainly one of Dickens's most famous creations, with her own disturbing brand of revenge against mankind: to unleash her prot&eacute;g&eacute;e Estella out upon the world, to break hearts wherever she goes.Dickens has created a twisty and labyrinthine plot, with plenty of intrigue and adventure throughout, as familial bonds, secret alliances and loyalty among friends and work colleges are tried and tested. In typical Dickensian style, there are several extraordinary coincidences concerning shrouded parentage and wayward meetings, but everything hangs so well together that it's instantly forgivable. \\"Great Expectations\\" is Dickens at his best in terms of plotting and characterization; though there is a melancholy twinge throughout that no doubt stems from Dickens's personal trouble (he had recently divorced his wife, and has carrying on a stress-filled love affair with a young actress). As such, romanticized domestic bliss that so often concludes a Dickens's novel (reflective of Dickens's own longing for such a state) is completely absent here. The domestic angel-woman that is given so many names and forms throughout the canon of Dickens novels (here called Biddy, though she is virtually identical to dozens of other Dickens heroines) comes to a surprising end in \\"Great Expectations\\", as does Pip himself.Pip himself is certainly an interesting character; in that he is woefully aware of his own shortcomings, yet unable drop certain attitudes that make him miserable. After becoming accustomed to the life at Miss Havisham's manor house, he is frustrated to find that he now holds his beloved brother-in-law Joe in contempt, embarrassed at his low breeding and lack of gentlemanly manners (despite the fact that Joe was always his staunch ally against Pip's terrible sister, and the epitome of the virtuous commoner). Likewise is Pip's self acknowledgment that his love for Estella never brings him any happiness, only pain and longing. The fact that Pip is narrating his own story from a point in time *beyond* the proceedings mean that we are never overly critical of Pip, considering he is his own harshest critic when relating his behaviour - and it certainly makes you consider your own shortcomings.This is not to say that the whole story is woe and misery, as there are plenty of comedic characters that help lighten the mood, such as Pip's best friend Herbert Pocket, who (at their first meeting) challenges him to a fight, and Mr Wemmick, who survives his job by assuming two personalities: a grim and dour one during working hours, and a cheerful one when he returns home. There are several moments of humour in Pip himself, (though they are usually tempered by a sense of disappointment or miscommunication) such as his misreading of his parent's gravestone, or his excitement in reaching London gradually dissipating when he realizes that...well, that it's a bit of a hole.Last of all, there has already been several mentions in other reviewers about the fact that there are two endings to this novel; the first was considered too melancholy by Dickens's publishers, and so was revised (although to be fair, Dickens's himself didn't seem to put up too much of a fight, suggesting that he himself was divided on the issue). The published ending is still ambiguous, yet with room for hope (at least in the mind of Pip) as to the future with Estella. Now, most agree that the original ending is more powerful, and I have to agree. However, I do issue a warning *not* to read both endings in the same sitting. In my edition the original ending was added in an appendix directly after the conclusion to the book, and because it is so drastically different to the published ending, it disrupted my appreciation of the novel. I was left in two minds as to what truly happened. So if you're a serious reader, do yourself a favour and decide what ending you want to go with *before* you finish the book. It may be a tricky business, but it'll enhance your enjoyment of one of Dickens's best novels."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens' ability to turn a beautiful phrase is done complete justice by Michael Page. He delivers all that Dickens intends for you to find in Great Expectations, as though he was Pip's shadow for those many years described in the story. This CD set is worth listening to; I looked for chances to get in the car and continue the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When his magazine, All the Year Round, began failing due to an unpopular serial, Dickens was forced to begin publishing installments of a story of his own. The resulting work, Great Expectations, was published weekly from December 1, 1860 to August 3, 1861. This was his second semi-autobiographical work, but where David Copperfield was a confident expression of faith in middle class values, Great Expectations offers a bleaker view of whether those values will lead to happiness. In fact, Dickens own marriage had just come to an end after many unhappy years. Indeed he had recently changed the name of the magazine from the more bucolic Household Words. Despite, or because, of this ambivalence, Great Expectations became one of his greatest achievements.Pip, a boy of the marshes, is being &quot;raised by hand&quot; by his shrieking harridan of an older sister and her seemingly doltish husband, the blacksmith Joe Gargery. One day, while visiting his parents' gravesite, Pip is accosted by an escaped convict who demands that he bring him a file and some &quot;wittles&quot;. When the convict, Abel Magwitch, is later captured, he accepts the blame for stealing the file and food before being carted back to prison.Shortly thereafter, Pip is invited up to Miss Havisham's manor house to play with her beautiful ward Estella. Miss Havisham's life came to a halt when she was jilted at the altar, all clocks are stopped at the hour of her betrayal, the feast lies rotting on tables &amp; she wanders about in the decaying wedding gown. Estella is to be the instrument of her revenge upon men.Eventually, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; are settled upon Pip when a secret benefactor sets up a trust in his name and sends him to London to be educated and become a gentleman. Pip assumes, and Havisham allows him to believe, that she is his benefactress and that he is being elevated to a position that will make him worthy of Estella.As Pip rises in society, he leaves Joe behind, despite the many kindnesses Joe had shown him growing up. He becomes a shallow arrogant middle class climber. So he is stunned when he discovers that he is actually benefiting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being transported. Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger. Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises. Eventually, with Magwitch's recapture and death in prison and with his fortune gone, Pip ends up in debtors prison, but Joe redeems his debts and brings him home. Pip realizes that Magwitch was a more devoted friend to him than he ever was to Joe and with this realization Pip becomes, finally, a whole and decent human being.Originally, Dickens wrote a conclusion that made it clear that Pip and Estella will never be together, that Estella is finally too devoid of heart to love. But at the urging of others, he changed the ending and left it more open ended, with the possibility that Estella too has learned and grown from her experiences and her wretched marriages.This is the work of a mature novelist at the height of his powers. It has everything you could ask for in a novel: central characters who actually change and grow over the course of the story, becoming better people in the end; a plot laden with mystery and irony; amusing secondary characters; you name it, it's in here. I would rank it with A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield among the very best novels of the worlds greatest novelist.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I listened to the unabridged audio tape version of this book narrated by Michael Page. It's one of those deals where you listen to each tape entirely on the left channel, then play the whole tape again on the right channel to get the next part of the story. Which is kind of awkward, since you forget which channel you were on if you also use your stereo for music; but these editions are probably the least expensive (by the hour) audio tapes you can buy.I think Dickens' tendency toward exhaustive descriptions works a lot better when you're listening to it in the car than when you're reading it in print. I might never have had the patience to read the actual book while sitting in a chair, but listening to it in the car was pretty entertaining. Colorful characters, humor, suspense, unexpected plot twists; I can picture a lot of it in my mind even now. A recommended story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Since a potential buyer might be wondering which edition to buy, I've decided to give a brief review of the edition instead of one of the story.This is the 2003 reissue of the 1986 edition of the Bantam classic edition. This edition has the 1986 introduction by John Irving. It contains the Dickens classic in its intact form, with the original ending following it separately. It is 528 pages.When Dickens first wrote Great Expectations, it had a different ending. There are some who feel that the original ending is more in line with modern tastes, and that Dickens \\"caved in\\" by changing the unhappy ending to one that was \\"more acceptable.\\" Some feel that Dickens went too far in order to cater to his audience rather than stick to a literary standard. In the introduction, Irving discusses this issue among many others and suggests that Dickens was not so much driven by the audience as he was in touch with their lives when it came to inspiration. Ideas in literature may seem fantastic and improbable, but Irving points to events in Dickens's life that would seem equally improbable had they appeared in fiction. He also mentions modern real life events that, if put in a novel a decade earlier, would have seemed impossibly unrealistic.Yes, Dickens was an optimist. But the new ending is not a \\"happily ever after\\" one so much as one that leaves the door open.

It is an exceptional book that well demonstrates the genius of Charles Dickens. Not only does it have suspense and charm of romance and adventure, but it delivers thematically a look at the hypocracy of wealth in Elizabethan England, and a philosophical perspective on the meaning of happiness. In the end of course there is the climax with every bizarre plot twist imaginable. It is true, this is not necessarily a happy one: Pip gains happiness at the end only by learning by immense misfortune to himself and others, and by having his &quot;expectations&quot; crash down upon him, nearly destroying his future. Yet, this novel is an essential read for anyone, no matter how old or young because it still retains its meaning as freshly today as it did when it was written. It's only unfortunate that it's wasted on all of these people who don't bother to take the time to actually to try and comprehend what they're reading and who have consequently made such poor reviews."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm here referring to the Oxford World's Classics edition, published in 1999. Firstly, I love the book itself. It's compact, the pages have a soft, easy feel to them, and the print is a welcome size: smaller but very readable. A+ here.The characters are particular and animate. Through the use of his famously detailed characterization and description, Dickens creates an elaborate colorful neighborhood of which you feel part. A+ for this escapism and for the sheer pleasure it brings. I especially admire his keen sense of the droll. However, while the tale runs well through the first half or so, as it progresses -- did you find so also? -- it loses the intact sympathies of the reader by trying to connect all the dots that its intricate plot has spun out into. It's forever tying its own shoes. I was similarly disappointment in the final denouement of Estella and Pip, as a let down and overly cerebral. (B-) But I highly recommend this book as a good Dickens novel, and on its own terms, a great one.A very fun read!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations, a book that Dickens ironically considered as one of his \\"little pieces.\\" Though it is small compared to other works by Dickens, what this novel lacks in size it makes up for in quality. Great Expectations succeeds beyond almost all novels of its time in exploring the roots of character and moral behaviour. Charles Dickens makes the case for there being the potential for good and evil within everyone. Evil and sin follow from a combination of being self-absorbed and selfish. What is remarkable about the way these themes are handled is that they are clearly based on an assessment of human psychology, long before that field was established. The book is also remarkable for its many indelibly memorable and complex characters. Miss Havisham, Pip, Magwitch, Mr. Jaggers, and Estella are certainly some of the most complex characters ever created by Dickens.Though a novel founded on philosophic concepts, the story is full of action to keep the plot moving. An escaped convict, an attempted murder, and a mysterious benefactor all add to the sense of mystery that exists throughout most of the novel and forces the reader to continue. Murder, deceit, jealously, and revenge also help to hold the attention of the reader while Dickens explores the depths of human nature.As you read Great Expectations, raise your expectations (sorry, I couldn't help myself) to assume that you will receive answers to any dangling thread. Every detail is important, if not to solve the mysteries of the characters then only to enhance the \\"sense of place.\\" Although the England described here is long gone, it becomes as immediate as a nightmare or a dream that you have just awakened from.This story by Dickens is a must-read and deserves five-stars."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The great English master is at his best in &quot;Great Expectations.&quot; This is a story about loyalty, trust, and, this being Dickens, dark overtones of the human nature. One should not expect something for nothing, that is what this novel makes perfectly clear. Pip, who is the central figure of the novel, a good-natured boy growing up into adulthood, expects to be continously favored by fotrune and his mysterious benefactor who, he thinks, is acting out of the goodness of her heart. Along the way he meets a cast of character who represent the entire range of human nature: devotion, strength, treachery, level-headedness, and brutality.&quot;Great Expectation&quot; is a classic because of its relentless exposure of truth about the human condition--the condition in which decency and sanity are maintained at a high price, and innocence not at all."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I imagine many of the negative ratings are from high school students forced to read the classics, and this book is one of those undisputed classics. Why else would every student I've talked to have had to read this book? Me included.I must confess I didn't like it in high school. Dickens does have a way of writing elegant sentences conjoined by semicolons. A great editor would have told him frequent use of periods is acceptable.However, eight years later, while frustrated at my illiteracy in Japan, I was starved for great literature in English. I had gone through a couple of contemporary literature that always left me vaguely dissatisfied. I started reading my favorite author Jane Austen again, and picked up Great Expectations on a whim. What a difference those eight years made!!No one can touch Dickens ability to evoke an atmosphere. I felt I was right there with Pip in the foggy marshes, shivering before a menacing Magwitch. Or sitting around the fire of a small but cozy house while Joe was smoking his pipe and passing along nuggets of his own brand of wisdom. Or creeped out in Mrs. Havisham's mausoleum of a mansion.In addition, the dialogue is so authentic you feel as if you're eavesdropping on people's conversations. Joe's working class speech, Mrs. Havisham's upper class diction, the lawyer's dry speech all ring so true.Ultimately, the story itself is so carefully constructed, even after countless rereadings, the clues in this mystery of who Pip's benefactor is are barely perceptible. And Dickens' themes of human pride, ultimate humility, willfulness of character that only later realizes the consequences, and the six degrees of separation are priceless. Dickens' championing of the working class pervades all his books, but in this one his affection for the working man is more personal. You really can't help but love Joe and his bungling dignity.Yes, Dickens can border on the excessively dramatic. But most of the time this drama works to pull you into a touching tale."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Having seen the many reviews written by students, I must say that I would agree. In fact, they sounded like they could have almost been my students from the past. Overall, GE is well liked, but the major complaint most have is that the story line is too slow-developing. I think this is a fair assessment. Of course, this was the style chosen by Dickens since this book was compiled from serial form. How many people would claim that we ought to take a week's worth of a soap opera program and turn it into a movie? I doubt such a production would attract much attention. In the same way, a serial writer's objective was to build mini-climaxes throughout the book, twisting and turning to get the audience to scream with anticipation, so that the next segment would sell. From what I understand, Americans could hardly wait for the shipments to get off the ships. They would purchase the newest segment and immediately dig in!If you are a teacher, I highly recommend showing the 4-hour movie starring Anthony Hopkins (produced in the late 1980s, I believe). It is the best and most accurate of all the GE movies. This works really well in conjunction with the book, and it truly helps in the interest level for those students who are not as motivated as &quot;the readers.&quot; So go ahead and find out about the adventures of squeezable Pip, lovable Joe, the mysterious Miss Havisham, sweet Biddy, snooty Estella, and of course the mysterious Magwitch.

Little does he know how his whole existence is to complete the life of another--a stooping savior.Though of little social significance, Pip lives a content life full of innocent happiness and simple joys. As his horizon suddenly expands with an unexpected fortune, Pip finds his own path crossed with the paths of a misanthropic Miss Havisham and her young, beautiful, yet seductive ward Estella. Extravagance feeds Pip's vanity to burgeon, desire flourishes his motives of becoming some one he can never become. Pip strives desperately to extricate from the deepest root of his whole being. And the obsession grows for Estella as he wanders of further away from his true path.Followed by the death of Magwitch, love once again awakes within Pip as he embraces the man hidden in the darkest corner of his soul. No longer the dashing young man in his blooming age, Pip at last starts a expedition to pursue something that is conquerable.Thus we see &quot;no shadow of another parting from her&quot;..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I think this book is so good, it doesn't need to be explained. However, if you dispise this book, I emplore upon you to try the book on tape. After all, these books are meant to be read out loud. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens was part of a great humanistic effort, of the 1800s, that more than ever evoked and espoused the Christian principles of human respect for one another. Great Expectations is about the unexplicable evil youth encounters and how one should rise above the hate and vindictiveness of stupid, petty people. It is a book that explains that there is great suffering in the world and there are those that will hate you for no other reason than that you look the way you do, or simply for the fact you exist in the form you are, or have the ancestors you have. And this hate may never be fully exposed, but be there none-the-less, lingering in mysterious shadow and never seen. An honest read of this book by my ninth graders allowed some, who felt anger and self-pity in the form of vengful hate, to rise a little out of their cycle of dispare. The greatest revenge, some say, against your oppressor is to live happily. The book shows how a vengeful heart is so self mutilating and unfulfilling. Great Expectations runs the coarse of someone who managed to forgive. It is a moving book and one that gives inner strength and respectful grace and recognition to the divine in all of us. It is better to not get bogged down in a discussion of Dicken's personal life, which is a mixed bag, but just read the book. Why would ultra feminists hate this book? Because they hate. Hateful people will hate a book that so poignantly exposes these wreched people for what they are. The book also shows, most significantly, and contrary to much of the belief of the time, that bad people can reform and become good. The significance of this, and its effect that Dicken's made upon this notion, is as haunting and deep a goodness as the evil Mrs. Havisham placed in Stela's soul."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great expectations is a very good book. It has action and a meaning. The book starts off by pip, which is a young orphan boy, going to a graveyard to look at his parent's tombstone. Then a escape convict grabs pip and tells him to bring him food and a file for his chains. The next day pip brings the man what he wants and then police capture the man but he protects pip and says he stole the food because he is touched by pips kindness. Then one-day pip is taken to the satis house, the home of miss Havisham, pip meets a beautiful young girl named Estella and falls in love with her. One-day Jaggers who is a lawyer tells pip that he has received a great fortune from a secret benefactor. The man tells pip he must go to London immediately to start his education as a gentleman. Pip thinks miss Havisham has given him the fortune. When pip is in London he finds new friends and begins to treat his old friends coldly, especially Joe. Several years later a familiar face comes in to pips room it is the convict, Magwitch. He then tells pip that he is pips benefactor. Pip then agrees to help him escape London. Compeyson is pursuing Magwitch and pip later finds out that Compeyson is the one who left miss Havisham on the alter and that Estella is Magwitch's daughter. Pip begins to care for the convict but later Pip hears that Estella has married another man. When Pip goes to visit miss Havisham she catches on fire and is burned badly. During the escape attempt Pip and Magwitch are capture by police. Magwitch is sentenced to death and Pip loses his fortune. He gets back together with Joe and later ends up marrying Estella and living happily ever after. I think that the author of this book could have made this book in 3rd person instead of 1st and it could have made it better. I think that this book was well writen had had a good message of dont let money go to your head and know who your true friends are. I recommed this book to anybody."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It may be difficult to rehabilitate Dickens from the reputation assigned to him by his critics, such as his being labelled as a spinner of popular yarns; a prime representative of Victorian strait-laced morality; a notoriously verbose prosaist whose writing teems with rhetorical redundancies and digressions; a careless plotter and over-plotter with a propensity for hyperbolic and grotesque comedy, depicting grim and depressing situations peopled by caricatures and abnormally exaggerated personages. The criticism that he commits a number of unforgivable Freudian flaws cannot so easily be obviated as well. Unlike the more firmly established exponents of the realist novel, such as Stendhal, Balzac and Dostoevsky, with their searching psychological assessments of character and motive, Dickens seems concerned mainly with evoking the idea of a certain character and not the character itself in its concrete, three-dimensional actuality. This explains his penchant for caricature. Nevertheless, his ability to present concrete characters is illustrated in &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, one of his later and finer works, particularly the characters of Pip and the convict Magwitch, who are psychologically profound and sympathetic portrayals in comparison to the host of other characters. His ability as a profound satirist and social critic is conclusively demonstrated by his interweaving his analysis of class, injustice and crime with the narrative. Pip, who finds himself elevated from his humble origins to one of the highest strata of society, by being made into a gentleman by a mysterious benefactor, is shocked to discover that this same benefactor, the agent of his social progress, is a despicable criminal who offends him by his sight. The message is obvious: society is a complex network of interrelations that interpenetrate class divisions; Miss Havisham is jilted by Compeyson, who is Magwitch's accomplice; Magwitch is the benefactor of Pip, who is in love with Estella, Magwitch's daughter. All, Dickens seems to say, are equal, regardless of their class or origin, before the judgement of God, which transcends human judgement. This is memorably brought out in the courtroom scene, during Magwitch's trial, in the description of the shaft of light that illuminated the room, \\"between the two-and-thirty [prisoners] and the Judge, linking them both together and perhaps reminding some among the audience, how both were passing on with absolute equality, to the greater Judgement that knoweth all things and cannot err.\\" Dickens's moral is the necessity of human fellowship, which we see lacking in the dehumanised Jaggers and Wemmick and in Estella and Miss Havisham, who both come to tragic or regrettable ends, through their coldheartedness and pitilessness. This quality, Dickens's use of plot coincidences to deliver profound human statements, partially redeems him from the charges of being a mere popular storyteller or a romanticist. In this respect, and also with regard to his verisimilitude in rendering authentic detail, he invites comparison with the great realists, such as Flaubert and Joyce, the masters of radical and even amoral realism, though Dickens, with his undisguised moralising, his chaste heroes and puritanical heroines, does not sit comfortably amongst these two; both of whom had works banned, one for his apparent frankness, the other for his obscenity and scatology. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; remains, however, as one of the great representatives of the realist, or social, novel, the product of an age that abolished serfdom and slavery, that witnessed the Industrial Revolution, the growth of large towns and the expansion of business enterprise. as such, it is an invaluable document of its time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A classic British novel written by Charles Dickens, Great Expectations, is a great novel with a very good moral at the end. The main character, Pip, is a very dynamic character. His morals and thoughts change throughout the book.In the beginning Pip grows up living with his aunt but then he gets an anonymous benefactor who helps him grow up a new life as a boy with a good education and living as an upper class citizen. Throughout the book we see Pip's struggles and he overcomes them. This book draws one in so they are not able to put it down. A good twist at the end."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I really loved this book, but the best part about this particular form of Dickens's classic novel is the section at the end of the book that included Dickens's notes on the characters and plots, an alternate ending, and footnotes about the use of language or phrases that might be confusing to the modern reader. Also, the cover does not press an image of the characters or setting onto you, and allows you to picture your own Pip or Estella. Other editions of this book might not give you so many resources and be so reader-friendly. I am glad that I was forced to read this book, because I would have never read it on my own, or I would have quit after the first book---- which is a little boring, but reveals some very important facts to develop the intricate and complex plot. Isn't it great how everything ties up so nicely in Dickens? Read this book, but make sure never to question the genius of Dickens... putting you halfway to sleep before dropping a bomb and putting a huge plot into action. Stick with it, and you'll be glad you did. But make sure to get this edition of the book, because it is far superior!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Any one with a passion for literature (and those who don't) should read Great Expectations. Not only is the story itself wonderful, but Dickin's underlying messages of about life and circumstances that lead people to their destinies are amazing. While a bit wordy at times, the style is superb and outlives the era to speak to modern people as well as it did one hundred years ago. Please, don't let your view of Dickins be &quot;old&quot;! This book is as relevent today as it was when first published. Read it today!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I choose to read this book, though most people my age would not, for an assignment at school. At first I was skeptical and thought Dickens might be one of those boring writers who wrote pages and pages of nothing. As I read the book though I was very suprised. I found that the plot was very interesting and there were many exciting scenes. In conclusion I would recomend this book to anyone who thinks they can handle it!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Like many of the people who have rated this book, I am reading it for school (over the summer, doesn't that bite?). Anyways, I found this to be a great book. The storyline is fascinating and unpredictible, and the characters are marvously developed. The reason I gave the book only 4 stars, though, is because it is such a long read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is perhaps the best work of Charles Dickens. Charles Dickens did not write many books in the first person narrative, and in Great Expectations, it is from the narrative of the protagonist named Pip.The book is very interesting and when reading this book, you can expect to be sad, anxious, and moved.Dickens does a great job of combining all the characters together in one plot.The book begins when Pip is young and is met by an escaped convict and the book ends with a happy ending.-jonny"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Reaching deep into himself, Dickens created this novel of moral exploration, high comedy, and page-turning narrative power. Pip, an orphan raised by his bullying siter and her sweet-naured blacksmith husband, discovers one day that he has a mysterious benefactor. The good-hearted Pip suddenly has &quot;great expectations&quot; of his life and begins to reject spiritual values for materialistic ones. Depspite his financial windfall, things don't go well for Pip. Estella, the beautiful but haughty young woman he loves, coldheartedly tortures him. And then there is the reappearance of Magwitch, the escaped convict who forced Pip to steal for him when Pip was a young boy. While Pip's maturation and moral education forms the heart of novel with his usual array of unforgettable characters, such as Miss Havisham, Joe Gargery, Jaggers, and of course Pip. Great Expectations represents one of Dicken's greatest triumphs. It manages to be both funny and moving."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I got a few classics for the kindle app, can't go wrong with ant classics in my opinion!

Along the storyline, Dickens inserts several points that man has several sides. The book is excellent in depicting how easily betrayal can occur, how quickly man can turn on his closest friend.A very well written story, Great Expectations continuously keeps the reader interested with its intriguing occurences."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations reveals the life of an orphan, Pip, who is alone in a desolate world even though he lives with his sister. Charles Dickens, develops a plot that portrays true life in the 19th century. Pip undergoes several events that reveal the true motives of life, the happiness in true love and the curse of wealth.The audience can easily relate to the overall theme of Great Expectations, the familiarity of the sycophant, ambitous characters enable the reader to apply the concepts to their own life. This novel, in all its intensity is filled with details that make reading enjoyable and very realistic. Personally, I enjoyed this novel very much, its is a great book to read becasue it reminds a person of the immense value of the simple, loving things in life."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Thirteenth of Dicken's four major novels, Great Expectations has the most dramatic and gripping start that unfolds a story that drives eagerly forward, full of emotion and humor and many unforgettable characters. As a kid, we had this book on our Literature List and every time we had to write down the answers of Literature tales, it was rather strenuous and boring as this meant to be a part of education. However, when it came to conduct a teaching class in literature, Great Expectation turned out to be an adventure. Unlike Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, Pip is not really a hero and also it does not end a Happy ending but Pip is being stripped of his wealth and his position in society. Pip is sent to London to be educated as a gentleman, he is impressed by the wrong people for the wrong reasons. He neglects and abandons the honest, hardworking folk who care for him and his pride is hurt when he learns who his mysterious benefactor is. Pip express guilt for his behavior who have a violent nature and crude ways but altogether he is courageous too. Pip, his father surname being Pirrip and his Christian name Philip, that's how he is called \`Pip' , has a fascination for Estella but is brought up by Miss Havisham to wreck revenge on all male sex and break hearts. Herbert Pocket is a character who has frankness was amiable and cheerful who became a friend of Pip. Dicken's novels have a central theme \`rags-to-riches' tale of a poor, underprivileged boy who is finally accepted into society. Strangely, this one has a different end. A nice read and great pick for Classroom Literature workshop."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When i first red the book in the highschool i've looked through like Pip. But after some years, when i'm reading it again, now i can see it like Dickens do... It's a novel that anybody can selfexplain on any time of his life. If not, he's very lucky..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It's a shame that most people resign this book to their \\"having already been read\\" list as a result of this novel being assigned coursework in junior high or high school. Dickens was a master of depicting subtleties of human relationships and personalities. Great Expectations illustrates this gloriously. Whatever can be said of Pip, is that he is abashedly a hopelessly human character. I sincerely can't imagine a young reader to identify with the maturity of these character's substantive familiarities with one another. Please don't write this book off, because you feel as if you already know the plot line and story because you read it young, I guarantee, read as an adult, this celebrated novel will take on a whole new light when you have been out in the world and experienced the complexities of the human condition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I respect the point of view of the reader who said that he/she can't add much to the opinion of countless generations who read this classic for the past 150 years. Classics last this long because they're masterpieces, and hence this work deserves five stars.The only thing to add in my point of view, is that I won't be surprised to learn that Dickens wrote this story especially for school boys who are really struggling to identify themselves and determine what is really important in life. No wonder this is one of the most required readings in middle school. In other words, adults won't find in it a mature story like the one in Steinbeck's East of Eden, or the taboo-sex theme of Nabokov's Lolita. This is about a young boy who goes on a long journey and ends up finding himself and realizing what really gives him happiness in life.As for the ending, there are two endings; published and unpublished, and I like the published more. Don't read further for I will give the ending away, unless you've read it already, but in the last paragraph Pip says that the mist of the evening when he held hands with Estella reminds him with the morning mist when he left the forge. The way I see it is that Estella will go through the same journey that Pip went through when he left the forge and went to London, the journey that was initiated by Estella's father and that helped Pip to be a better man. Now Estella will go through a journey initiated and guided by Pip in order to make Estella a better woman. Magwitch hurt Pip in the beginning but Pip helped him so Magwitch gave him all his money. The money was gone but was left was more important than money: The journey and experience that made Pip a better man. Estella was mean to Pip, but Pip loved her, and destiny put them both on a crossroads at the end of the novel, but because Pip loves Estella and because she is Magwitch's daughter, Pip decided to walk with her in a journey that will make her a better woman.Magwitch and Estella, father and daughter, never met. But there was a link between them; Pip, who became a better man because of the father, and who will now pay him back by making his daughter a better woman. Great Expectations is about the magical and ironic links between people, and how the person who you think hurt you the most may end up to be the person who helped you the most. The fact that an evil man is not as evil as he seems, and a pure man is not as pure as he seems.And these are just few of the many other themes in this classic. So the bottom line is, this novel may be more meaningful to the middle school son than to the forty something father. Read it early before you get older!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Victorian society got a good spanking when Great Expectations was published, at the time Dickens's anger and frustration was at one of its highest points. Pip, the novel's protagonist - I hesitate to call him the hero - is at once likeable and recognizable as a powerful symbolic tool, though the former quality intentionally decreases as the novel progresses.Pip is joined by a cast of the most memorable characters in literature - the cold, ethereal Estella, the crazy, wounded Miss Havisham, loveable dullard Joe, whip-smart lawyer Jaggers - the list could, and possibly might, go on for pages. If there were literary awards for Best Ensemble, the characters in Great Expectations would clinch them all. The characters function as both political/social symbols and, though they exist in a time period far removed from us, identifiable and memorable figureheads that will - and should - be a literary hallmark forever."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I first read this about 12 years ago as a teenager in High School of course at the time I could not possibly comprehend everything that is going on. On a whim I decided to reread this novel and am very happy that I did, Pip, Joe, Estella, Mrs Havisham all these charecters are so colorful and well written it amazes me. This novel covers a diverse collection of human emotions such as love, friendship, loyalty, shame, and forgiveness. If the only time you read this it was mandatory reading for freshman english do yourself a favor and pick it up again and reread it I found it very worthwhile."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Many reviewers have called this Dickens' greatest novel. One reviewer says it was the first time a character's feeling had been explored in such detail. These things I cannot comment on - this is the first Dickens novel I ever read, and I am not familiar with other works of this period. I can say that it was a damn fine read though.I must admit, maybe it was a convention of the time, but there were a great many impossible coincidences in this story. The term &quot;soap opera&quot; even crossed my mind at one point. In the end I forgave these improbable coincidences because the story was so compelling, and the novel so old, and the author of legendary repute.I loved the saint-like character Joe. I think he was my favorite character. And Dickens does a masterful job of showing the friendship between Pip - the protaganist - and Joe and especially Herbert. Miss Havisham is the picture of the bizarre rich recluse. And Estella the epitome of the cold-hearted shrew. All of the characters are rich.And it is true, as many other reviewers have commented, that so many issues are explored in this work. The meaning of true love, genuine friendship, the implications of &quot;moving up&quot; and it's effects on family and friends, good fortune, redemption, etc. It's all there - life is there.The book was slow at certain parts, but most of the time I found myself eagerly turning the pages. Dickens is a master at compelling his reader to turn the pages. What will happen next? At some of the titanic coincidences and plot turns I found myself thinking, &quot;what?! You've got to be kidding me...&quot; and then begging for more. I think you will too.There are some deeply heartfelt moments. Deeply heartfelt, touching, that inspired warm feelings in me. It was a pleasant change of pace from the darker, more cynical literature of today (though there are evil people and violent actions in Great Expectations as well). The final lesson of redemption is truly heartwarming."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is my favorite book. I've read it at least 6 times, and it is still a wonderful story. Dickens makes you feel what little Pip feels on the unexpectedly interesting journey of his life. From his childhood encounter with an escaped convict to a mysterious rise to riches and fame later in life, I am completely immersed in his story. The tale of his love for a girl named Estella who, not only will never love him, but emotionally tortures him every day of his life is heartbreaking yet somehow familiar. There are subtle lessons to be learned from this book.

The narrator, who is also the main character, addresses you directly and colours the whole story with his own amiable personality. Indeed, one can imagine that the novel, published in instalments in that long bygone era before radio, television and other non-printed media, was conceived to be read out loud in the family parlour.The characters are straightforward, captivating and likeable. Totally removed from any realistic complexity, they are all the more memorable: nave, honest Pip; distant, cold, condescending Estella; devoted, loyal, simple-minded Joe; mysterious, ethereal Miss Havisham; etc.The plot, convoluted, wholly implausible and a tad predictable, evokes harsher but so much simpler times.

As all of Dickens' tales do, this provides a look at life for the ordinary man in that time and place, England in the 19th century. It is also a parable about the worth of people as judged by their wealth, status and power vs. their character and more. It is filled with wonderful character studies that only Dickens could do: Miss Haversham, stunted and destroyed by her bitterness, in turn doing great damage to the beautiful, cold Estella. The star of the novel, the orphaned Pip, raised by his shrewish and abusive sister and her wonderful, loving and simple husband Joe, the friends Pip makes, etc. Mr. Prebble reads this great novel as no one else can. He brings the characters to life so I could feel their emotions. All of the characters had unique voices and suitable accents that matched them perfectly. I was particularly moved by his portrayal of Joe. By the way, Mr. Prebble's beautiful, very masculine voice does the female characters believably. One does not even think about it. Thank you, Mr. Prebble, for narrating this novel and providing me with the best Christmas I've had for a while."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I loved it! In fact I remember reading Great Expectations during a 7th grade English class and getting in trouble for not paying attention to what was being taught. I came to this book on my own, as opposed to being made to read it, and while the lenth and the language was challenging for the first few pages, I remember falling head over heels in love with Dickens' style. This was the first time I felt myself get lost in a book. I've read it several times since in the last 14 years and I get lost in Pip's world every time!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Yes, the prose is overlong. Yes, the English language has evolved since Dickens' day, so you'll be using the dictionary feature on your Kindle often. But Great Expectations transcends time to bring a very relatable story to modern readers. The mystery deepens at every turn, the characters develop more fully and, if you open your mind and relax, the book's a downright page-turner (or page-clicker, for Kindlers).I tried reading this classic when I was younger and less patient, but it took a 40+-year-old me to 'get' it. Perhaps young people need to experience life and the lessons we all learn to really appreciate Great Expectations. Perhaps they relate a little too much with the freshly made gentleman and don't really understand why he castigates himself for his behavior. Or perhaps they're just not patient enough to 'zen out' and enjoy the book for what it is. Whatever the reason, I sincerely hope the young people who hate this book today, will pick it up again when they're more 'seasoned' - then they might just understand why it's a classic.If this review gave you information that was helpful, please feel free to click the YES button below!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great & free down load to PC Kindle product; yes, Kindle has a free software download so that you can read their books on your PC too. This book was a free download too at the time, I downloaded the softare as well as 99 other books!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is so boring, I have to read it for my Honors Preparation English Liturature and Writing Class. It is really difficult to understand also."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I wanted to start collecting the Penguin Classics hardcover editions, and I needed this book for a class so I bought it, and I guess I'm glad I hadn't bought a couple other novels to round out my purchase! The cover was rubbing off by the time it arrived to me, in a padded box. However the print on the cover is made, it is done very shoddily and couldn't handle being on a shelf, much less being read. I am very unhappy indeed. Phooey on whoever came up with this."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was greatly disappointed with the way this classic story was printed. The typing errors throughout the book ie.words that all ran into each other, and even pages of the story missing, made what should have been a pleasant read into a chore to finish it.I had looked forward to re-reading all the old school classics on my new Kindle but if the conversion of the old publications to e-readers are of the same standard, then I will not want to do so.I fear that \\"Oliver will not be asking for more\\" unless the recipe is improved.I have rated it only one star ,not because of Dickens Story but because it was spoiled for me by it's typing."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am no english literature purist by any stretch of the imagination but I did have high hopes for this book.The characters are realistic to the period but the story is very slow. The first half of the book is little better than boring. It picks up through the second half but finishes rather disappointingly.This book was purchased after a book club suggested it was Dickens' greatest work. Having read David Copperfield a number of years ago I would have to disagree.I am glad I read the book even if the only thing I got out of it was to be able to relate to it when others are discussing it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great novel to stand the time. I heard and read the novel in my high school days. However, I just tested the Amazon functions using it without actual reading."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I have read Great Expectations more than 2 times. I have listened to it also on Audio CD more than a few times. I occasionally just listen to any randomly selected track(s) at any randomly selected part of the story in it's unabridged version.I was excited to hear it in an abridged version and with several persons portraying the various characters.As much as I love the unabridged reading of the story; I was quite pleased with the acting out of the story in this radio-presentation-like recreation of Great Expectations.It was refreshing that Pip's dialogue was a faithful recreation of the actual text due to him being the character telling the story; so the Dickens' wonderful wordsmithing was not lost.It is a great story for all ages, to listen and learn to love; and I hope for their sake, to encourage them to read the story in its entirety."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I bought this book on Amazon about a year or so ago & just was really turned off by how much writing they cramed into even one page & the font is pretty small, it turned me off to the point that I never did even read the book, to those that did, hope it was good."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A great reading but the sixteen discs are not labeled as to chapters on the disc nor are there any liner notes. You must play the disc and wait for the chapter to be mentioned during the reading. I do not see why they would have left these necessary conveniences out. Very inconvenient."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I have to admit I have not read this yet. I saw these advertised in a magazine and just HAD to have them. I used a gift card and bought 4 or 5. They are just eye-candy on one of my tables right now....but I do want to read them. They weren't packed very well. They were just put in an oversized box, I'm lucky they didn't get messed up."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"CLASSIC. I BOUGHT IT FOR MY CHILD TO READ OVER THE SUMMER AND IT BOUGHT BACK SO MANY MEMORIES. I'M GLAD WE HAVE A COPY TO KEEP AROUND THE HOUSE."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My daughter had to read this book for school and she said it was a great read. She is 14 and it was easy for her to understand and follow."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Like many other reviewers, I read this book because it is a requirement in many English classes. Although the plot becomes interesting at times, the majority of it is filler. The book is filled with pointless characters and chapters devoted to run-ons of Pip's thoughts.Because the book was written so long ago, it is also very difficult to connect with. The character relationships are annoying. The romance between Pip and Estella becomes very hard to believe, because Estella is not a likable person. And the dialect is very unbelievable. It is hard to picture someone using Joe's speech patterns, even in old English times.While there are probably many people who will enjoy this novel, I would not suggest this book to someone looking for a quick read (meaning high school students). It is very difficult to skim and requires alot of time to appreciate. If you have a lot of time on your hands and you enjoy long, character developing novels this book may be for you."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This was an interesting book. It is the first book by Charles Dickens that I had ever read. The language was weird but that was because it was a British novel written in a different era. I enjoyed it though because it was a escape to a different era and time. I plan on reading several other works by this author. It was slow to start but only because I was not used to the writing style or language. I would recommend."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The setting of this book is in the Elizabethian era. Class, titles, and wealth is veryimportant around this time period and Dickens shows the importance in this great novel.Another theme of this novel is that not everyhting is as it seems.The story starts with Pip(Philip Pirrip) at the graveyard. He went to visit his dead parentswhen all of a sudden he was snatched by an escaped convict. The convict threatened Pipsaying that he will slit his throat if Pip did not bring food, a drink and a file. Pip did whathe was told and felt guilty for helping the convict out for many years after.He is asked to play at Satis House where he meets Miss Havisham and the beautifulEstella. Pip hoped that Miss Havishams intentions were to make his fortune, make him agentleman and have Estella to wed. He was wrong, instead Miss Havisham's intentionswere for Pip to fall in love with Estella and then have his heart broken.After this dissapointment, Pip hears news that an anonymous benefactor wants to makePip a gentleman and give him a fortune. Pip believed that the anonymous benefactor wasMiss Havisham but instead it was the escaped convict that Pip helped when he was ayoung boy. It gets even more interesting when Pip finds out that Estella is the daughter ofthe escaped convict.This novel comes with interesting twists and great themes that can have a reader thinking,\\" whats going to happen next?\\" I recommend this novel to any reader who likes a greatstory."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The reason I choose to write this review is quite simple: to tell of a great book that gets better every time you read it. The compelling twists of &quot;Great Expectations&quot; are very involved and makes for a book that not only comes off extremely in depth but also entertaining. I first read this book and high school and have since read it twice more. It seems the more knowledge I have gained the more I take out of each segment of this book as it is more closely tied into my real life.Simply put this is Dickens masterpiece and that should not be overlooked as many of his books were of extreme quality."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I liked the book Great Expectations, I thought it was very interesting to read. When I first found out that we ha to read it I didn't think i would like it at all but I did, once I got into the book.I thought it was hard to read. Sometimes I didn't get it but othere times I did and did think Charles Dickens made it easy to understand. I don't think he should have written so many characters becasue I lost track of who was who and where they were at. He should have written more to the ending, like what happend to Pip and Estella.I did like when Pip started realizing that just because you have money dosen't mean you can be mean to people like Joe and Biddy and everyone else that do't have as much as he does. I liked how toward the ending everything kind of came togeter; that's whenI really understood who was who. I really liked how all the characters were sonnected in some way like Magwitch, Estella, And Molly. Also Compeyson and Miss. Havisham."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is one of Dickens's better known classics, though not his best. The theme is worthy enough of study, though, and the reading is enjoyable. Recommended."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is one of Dickens less &quot;weighty&quot; novels. It is slow-moving and at sometimes tedious to read. While the setting and characters are developed well enough to draw you in to the story, the plot is quite unbelievable and the book sometimes tedious at times.The story is about Pip, a young working class boy who comes into great wealth because of a mysterious benefactor. He abandons his good old friends Joe and Biddy to follow his heart towards Ms. Havisham and her cruel daughter Estella. Also dragging along with him are Hubert, his friend and confidant, Magwitch, a filthy convict, Mr. Wopsle, a bad Shakespearean actor, Mr. Jaggers, a vindictive lawyer, Mr. Wemmick- Jagger's more amiable assistant, Molly, a servant with a mysterious past, and Old Orlick, whom you'll know all about at the end of the book.After my first go through, I gave this book a second chance to grow on me and read it again, but it didn't. Unless you are absolutely OBSESSED with Dickens,you are required to read it for a class, and/or you don't have anything to do over a weekend, then don't bother reading this book"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I found this book hard to read and hard to comprehend. The book is about a boy named Pip and his rise from lowly to gentlemanly status. Along the way, he manages to alienate his friends and he learns some valuable lessons about friendship in the end. The way the sentences are written and structured made it difficult for me to understand everything that was going on. Many of the sentences would be considered run-on today."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens tells his story through the consequences of several secret, unsolicited acts of kindness. The consequences of these acts varies greatly. Dickens seems to be unconcerned with passing judgement on the acts themselves, instead he prefers to humor himself by exploring of their unpredictable outcomes."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This novel was my first taste of Dickens and I have to say I was fairly surprised, and that in a very positive sense. Not only I didn't find it overly \\"wordy\\" or else, but extremely well written. But that's details. This novel is very intense and has unforgettable characters in it, honestly. It's very emotional and it's a trip. A trip that lasted two weeks for me, and that I will not soon forget, if ever. I wholeheartedly recommend this book for those of you who love literature, and even for those of you who are not literature-buffs, because the novel is very readable so don't be afraid of its length if you're not used to reading classics and such.Dickens, I realised, can be surprisingly funny at times, and this without ever losing his capacity to create strongly emotional moments and images. As there seems to be tons of reviews for this book already I'll stop mine here and just tell you that if you're interested in this book, go for it!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I never wanted to read this book, but a friend convinced me when he learned that I loved Pip on South Park (I found the little nerd funny). This was the best advice I'd ever taken. Reading this not only made me love Charles Dickens, but gave me a late start on loving reading in general.Granted, it's a difficult book to read. Dickens packs his book with descriptions and long sentences (yet every word is important and helps with understanding) and he's not easy to get through. Yet Dickens still, with all his flaws, remains a masterful storyteller. His characters aren't deep, but they're relatable and memorable. I love Pip, Estella, Miss Havisham, Joe, Herbert Pocket, Magwitch, and Aged P, and even though I've read this book a long time ago, I love them just as much now as I did then.It's a shame that people have to read this for school (I did so for my second time). It's a wonderful story that should be enjoyed by itself. If you haven't been made to read it, do so now. Push yourself through it and take your time (it took me a month to finish the book myself). You'll be glad you did. Assignments make you rush and over-analyze stories, and Dickens should never be read that way."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations was a remarkable book. I really enjoyed it. I didn't really have great expectations before I read it. It was about a little English boy named Pip. Pip is a poor kid who suddenly inherits a bunch of money and becomes rich. When he was poor he hated the way rich people treated poor people, but he finds himself doing treating poor people horribly when rich. He finally learns that everyone deserves to be treated with the same respect, even those less fortunate. This was an interesting book, but a tough book to understand, I would probably recommend it only for adults."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When I was assigned to present a novel for my English class at Mercy High School, I thought of Great Expectations because I had read it five years ago and remembered that I had liked it. I thought that it was rather straight forward and didn't remember having difficulty reading it. When I read it for a second time, however, I realized that it was alot more complex. The reading was simple and getting through the book was easy, but Dickens made his story one worth contemplating by expressing the many sides life with his characters. What made the people he wrote about so wonderful was his ability to make them unique and entertaining, yet so believable as human beings coping with ordinary problems that the reader had no problem sympathizing with them."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens develops the characters, the plot, and the conflicts in Great Expectations spectacularly. The characters Dickens develops throughout the story are human and easy to connect with. Pip is the most real to life character, because he exhibits the most human-like qualities. Pip is a very personable character that makes the reader feel sorrow and happiness along with him. As Pip looks to better himself and become a gentleman, he comes to realize a very important life lesson; money cannot buy happiness. As Pip goes through the story, he allows the reader to see and feel exactly what he feels and sees.Estella is described as a beautiful young woman that captures Pip's heart. Estella has a very insensitive personality, and enjoys making Pip cry; something everyone has encountered in a person some time in his/her life.Herbert is a young man with many dreams and aspirations. Herbert becomes Pip's best friend, and Pip realizes that this young man works very hard for what he believes in. This is the kind of friend that will push a person where they would not normally go by themselves.Abel Magwitch is the convict that Pip encounters at the beginning of the story. Magwitch gives Pip a large amount of money to start his life as a gentleman. Magwitch is the kind of person that would give the clothes off of his back to anyone in need. Magwitch is also a very personable character because he is not all good or all evil. He exhibits both of these; he is a convict and he devotes his life's earnings to Pip.Charles Dickens develops an outstanding plot as the novel unfolds. There are many life lessons throughout the novel. Pip realizes that all of the money in the world cannot buy happiness. Pip also finds out that true love is not just the woman he cannot obtain, because love has to be much more. The plot has many twists and turns throughout. There is always something new happening to Pip. It is almost like a soap opera, because there are so many people and events interacting with each other during the novel. When the plot becomes a little thin, Dickens begins to create suspense for the next big event about to occur. Dickens chooses to develop the plot through the character's actions. Not once did Dickens explain what was happening in the story, he let the characters take over, and within a few pages all questions were answered.The novel has many conflicts that develop throughout the plot. Pip and Estella have a love-hate relationship going on. Pip loves Estella, but she could care less about him. Pip and Joe have a conflict, too. Pip wants to see much less of Joe now that he is a gentleman, but Joe just wants to see Pip, period. Pip thinks he is too good for Joe, even though he is still just the same human as he was before. Money changes people's outlook on life. Pip was once a benevolent, caring, young man, but once he fell into money, he changed dramatically in the way he acted towards others. These conflicts provide for some pretty interesting facets in the story. Charles Dickens develops the characters, the plot, and the conflicts excellently throughout the novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Truly one of the best books I've read. I could hardly put it down- I carried it everywhere I went. The novel has humor, suspense, and action. All of the characters are delightful and important to the story. And I like the revised ending better than the original."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This version of Charles Dickens' &quot;Great Expectations&quot; may make a fine read: but that really depends on your taste. Yes, Charlotte Mitchell tailored it well. The overall layout is good; although some chapters may dampen your interest if you are a reluctant fan of 19th Century English."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Although this book is a bit slow moving at times, it is worthwile sticking with it to the end. A timeless classic about love, happpiness, and family, this book really carries a lot of hidden meanings, so read closely. You are sure to love the wonderfully drawn out characters and plots!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is a really good book. The plot is suspensful and you don't know what to expect. Also, the main characters are all very well developed. Like I said before it is really good, but if you don't like the classics don't bother because then it will be very boring."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I too am one of those high school kids that was forced to read the book freshman year. But unlike most of them I loved the book. It was with in my textbook which made it hard to read but other then that I could not put it down. The themes of the story are so inviting that you can't wait to read about what happens next. Dickens kept the tone inving and I kept going back to read more. I am now a junior and reading the book yet again for a history assignment and even though I know what is happening I still can't put it down.To all the freshman out there that have to read this book: Give it a chance. If you really hat eit and want to watch the movie go to the local library and get Disneys version of it. They did it exactly to the book and it is awesome. Its long but it does get rid of some of the unnecessary backgorund information. It comes in a series of 3 tapes.Other then that I love this book. I am not an avid reader but this one was awesome."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"the course of the year I try to read a few, \\"Important Novels\\" in order to get a fuller understanding of literature. Dicken's \\"Great Expectations\\" has been on my list for nearly a year. I completely dreaded reading what I thought would be a long and drawn out story about something I could careless about. Well, I was wrong.\\"Great Expectations\\" is now #1 on my all-time favorites list. While, admittedly, it took me roughly 150 pages to get any enjoyment out of the novel- once I was in- I was hooked. Pip's journey through life is a very refreshing look at how distorted we let our lives become by focusing on the unimportant. Dicken's ability to slowly alter Pip's views on life, without changing his essential character/morales (Ex. How Pip looks to help his friend in his business pursuits). Some have called \\"Great Expecations\\" his masterpiece... but in my opinion, it may be the \\"Masterpiece\\" of English Literature.I also wonder why this is required High School reading. While I loved this book at age 28, I think most 16 year-olds would find it unbearable. It seems like such a waist to ruin both the book and Dicken's name on minds that are not ready for such a reading task."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is an exciting story dramatically done in this audio presentation."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Many people may find Charles Dicken's \\"Great Expectations,\\" dated, due to it's time period and its flowery 19th century language. True, the book is extremely wordy, and there are many words you'll be getting out a dictionary for reference, and yes it's very slow moving, but it's wonderful.The book focuses on a young boy, who becomes a young man, named Pip, raised by his over dominating sister, and a kind blacksmith, Joe Gargory. For awhile Pip has gratitude for living in the town, but, when he is spurned by the rich Estella and Miss Havisham, he wants to be something greater, someone richer. Being rich falls into his lap, but not without consequences. The book is about the follies of false vanities, of turning ones back on those who loved you, on trying to chase an uncatchable dream from those who don't reciprocate feelings, (in this case Pip's devotion to the haughty Estella) and for neglecting the good values of life for the ostentatious ones. Too often in todays society people (I'm guilty of this too) forget about what's truly important, family and good friends, and associate with only the proud and the, what they deem to be, the important. In the process they get too wrapped up by material wealth rather than the simple beauties around them.Aside from the basic story, the characterization in this novel is wonderful. Dicken's has really created some memorable characters, full of depth and complexity. The dull headed, but kind, Joe Gargory, and the haughty, but lonely, Estella, along with the mournful and bitter Miss Havisham will stay with the reader long after he/she finishes the book.Reading this book is a treat. Peruse it's pages and enjoy."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This novel by Charles Dickens is very well written, although very verbose. The novel has a good plot, but the writting is sometimes hard to follow. It took me one whole month to read the book and fully understand it. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the classics, because it has a great story. Readers beware though, they must be ready to analyze everything in order to understand the novel"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm not a huge fan of Charles Dickens, but I have read a number of his books for reports and for reading. I've read Great Expectations for class and for personal reading. First of all the book is much easier to read then David Copperfield and others. The beginning is really riveting, and from there it keeps going. This book made me look to my personal life to see if I was finding happiness in the right things. I would read it at least once."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I loved this book. I have to admit in the beginning it was a bit of a chore to get &quot;into&quot; it but once I did I was just swept away. I especially loved the characters in it. I found myself putting the book down to tell my husband how mad I was at Pip. Joe, Estella, Abel Magwitch, Mr.Jaggers and of course Miss Haversham are unforgettable! A great book once you give it a fair chance. I am so glad that I stuck to it!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Before you reads this book, examine the title, and what great expectations do, so the events seem less shocking.This story is quite bittersweet and ironic, with a lot of interweaven and connected plots-not just of Pip's life. These plots make understanding this book, along with the rich dialect, quite difficult (where it lost the star) but amazing. ADVICE: read the Coles Notes (or other notes) chapter summaries.As I said, it's an extrodinary coming of age (rite of passage) which will not be as distant and farfetched as you might think. Comparable to your own rite of passage if you care to draw parallels with not only Pip, but all other characters too.I found that when you are forced to read this book and too much emphasis it placed on it, it loses it's 'interest', 'luster', and 'magic', (*wink* *wink* high school teachers!).Overall, I liked this book, but the language overwhelmed at times."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens has a very vivid imagination. He express himself in a bizzare way in all of his works. In this novel, however, he out does himself. This book has a strange air about it.

I've had to read this book about three times in high school but I enjoyed it every time. My recommendation will probably mean little because if your still in school you will probably have to read it anyways...but I still recommend it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations was ok, but there were a few things that the author could have done better. First, in my opinion he shouldn't have changed certain characters names around, which can be confusing for some people. There is also illegal activities on the part of some of the characters. Also, even the abridged version of the book is a bit long. Perhaps Dickens could have wound things up in a tighter package for the reader. Dickens plot can be a bit confusing at times, and the reader sometimes is left to piece together the novel for himself.However, this is not a necessesarily a totally boring read. There are several good things about it. Lying is at least partially looked at in a negative light, and steadfast faithfulness among friends is evident among some of the book's main characters. Justice is done to an man for his wrongdoing.Overall, the book is readable but too long. Also, when considering this book, keep in mind that author's back then, are different from authors today. If you like Dicken's works, you might like this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was disappointed from the fact that I did not finish the whole book when I was in high school. The plot and the theme of this novel are amazing. I prefer Dickens to stick to his original ending versus the happy and romantic one."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I may be only a 6th grader, but you wouldn't believe how much I enjoyed this book. Charles Dickens having a poor childhood because of the little money his family earned, has written a miraculous book having to do with money. Charles Dickens makes his case for there being a potential for good and evil in everyone. I really enjoyed reading this book and if you are looking for a fabulous book to enjoy, I strongly reccomend you read this."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens has written extrodinary books such as Olivet Twist, David Cooperfield, A Christmas Carol, and of course Great Expectations. You have not read a novel until you have read Great Expectations. It is truly one of Charles Dickens best. In a dramatic story about adventures and drama, Pip faces his greatest adventure. He is trying to reach his goal in life - great expectation. This story has its ups and downs, but otherwise it is dazaling and spectatuliuar. That is why I give Great Expectations two thumbs up."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I haven't finished the entire book yet, but have wanted to read it for years. The modern movie adaption with Ethan Hawke is one of my favorite movies and I always thought it was a beautiful love story with a real human quality. The book is much different then the movie, but however I believe the modern adaption was incredibley well done considering the difference in time. The book is aslow start but once you are adjusted to the language its actually fast paced reading... especially when Estella returns. My first Dickens and won't be my last. I believe everyone should read the classics"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I got this book assigned to me near the first day of high school this year, and just got finished reading it about a week ago. Let me tell you something, if you know about Dicken's life, this story is kinda based on it. Let me also say this book is extremely boring in the beginning, because you are learning the peices of the puzzle, but the second half is excellent, and all the peices of the puzzle came together, which is why this is an excellent book. My favorite character was definetely Miss Havisham. Don't give up on this book!!! This is the kind of book I think needs a small sequel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I think that the character development alone makes this novel stand out as one of the best novels of Charles Dickens. The plot summary is also well-crafted, with so many characters intertwining in the books final chapters. We see a personality change in not only Pip, but other major characters such as Estella and Miss Havisham, as we find out that they are all connected in some way.This book might be seen as a rather long and detailed book. Some of the details are probably overdone and unnecessary. This is definitely a book that takes some getting used to. However, I think that one of the morals of the book-- understanding your roots and accepting them-- make this a great book to read.The many characters contrast each other in so many ways, and there are so many good and bad characters, that it becomes a fun book to read. However, you must have patience to read a book this long and detailed.I think this book is well-written (some of the language is a little tough), and Dickens exposes his great writing ability and his abilty to deal with a complex plot and make it all come together in Great Expectations."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens was one of the most popular writers of all time, creating some of the best-known characters in English literature. In the book \\"Great Expectations\\", the protagonist and narrator, Pip begins the story as a young orphan boy being grown up by his sister. I like this book, because Charles Dickens takes you right inside the Pip's mind and you live through the events and discoveries of his life with him. Pip is passionate, romantic and somewhat unrealistic at heart. That makes the novel interesting. Of course, you cannot forget the great love story (Pip and Estella). The other characters Magwitch, Miss Havisham, Joe Gargery, Miss Joe, Estella, Mr Jaggers and Mr Wemmick are all unique and special in their way and they add to the novel's richness. Another thing I really liked was how all of the characters are interrelated to each other in ways that you may not discover until you get to the end of the novel. This novel will make you sometimes laugh and sometimes make you feel sad, but it is always entertaining. Latif Dose simplifies the texts. The language is very clear. There are not old English words and this gives the reader much pleasure while reading the novel. I think most young people would like this novel because it's not as hard to read as an other classic books. I recommend Great Expectations to anyone who wants to read a good, classic book because Great Expectations has a little bit of everything in it, mystery, romance and suspense. You cannot easily find all of these properties in other novels, which makes &quot;Great Expectations&quot; a special and a classic one.. That makes this novel very different. It is probably one of the top ten English novels of the 19th century. Some of the passages are beautiful. I cannot forget Pip's response to Estella when she says \\"You will get me out of thoughts in a week.\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The book was a gift and really excited my 10 year old godchild. Good seller."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This audio version is phenomenal...full of lively interpretation all by one narrator. Yet the lack of a chapter guide makes it extremely difficult to use should you be interested in tracking down a particular chapter. Some chapters start in the middle of disks or even in the middle of tracks.

It was the selection for our book club, so I bought it to read again.Although it's very long, it's a wonderful book, rich with detail and timeless for it's social issues and examination of interpersonal relationships.I had forgotten (or perhaps didn't appreciate in high school) how funny Dickens is. His sense of humor, and ability to convey emotion and atmosphere are extraordinary.I got it too late to finish for the book club and had to consult Spark notes (which are great for summary), but I hope to finish it soon.

(6th graders) This copy is the novel but an adapted version. The print size, the text appearance are friendly. The authenticity and truth of the story are upheld. All my expectations have been met. There are questions at the end of the text. Wanted about 20 copies but did not want to pay the top price! Like usual Amazon came to the rescue. Can't wait to introduce the children to a classic but closer to their level. It is authentic to so many of the important quotes. Not too many authors have one of their novel's characters last the test of time, meaning Scrooge. Dickens created him and we know the symbolic Scrooge, one hundred years later...we need to acknowledge his greatness as a writer."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I agree this is a great car book.

I heartily recommend."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"\\"Great Expectations\\" was Charles Dickens' third attempt at writing semi-autobiography, and his most successful. Poor Oliver Twist barely registers in his own book, while David Copperfield becomes a pasteboard figure after reaching adulthood. Pip only grows richer and more complex, and it's no wonder critics thus see \\"Great Expectations\\" as the best of the lot.We open with the finest sequence in the novel, along a swampy coastline in southern England where a small boy at his parent's grave is threatened by a desperate convict. The convict wants food and a file to help cut him free. The boy, Pip, must wrestle with some serious guilt, not to mention the threat of his sister and guardian's overzealous discipline. Social expectations cut one way, but a rogue feeling of sympathy for the convict guides him another. Which will win out?Pip's a bit of a prat, but he's meant to be. After coming into some mysterious money, the former blacksmith's apprentice abandons those who love him in a doomed attempt to win over Estella, the high-class, heart-challenged ward of balmy Miss Havisham. Estella bothers some people. How could Pip love her? Man, I've been there, and I reckon a lot of others have been, too. Estella is one of the great fictional representations of unrequited love, and in Dickens' hands, becomes something even more potent, a symbol of class division and status-scrambling folly.Dickens' handling of Pip is subtle and worth careful re-reading. By using the device of an older, unseen Pip as narrator, we sense where he fell astray without it being pointed out overmuch. Clashing with a snooty rival for Estella's affections, he sweats the possibility of being discovered as the friend of a guileless village blacksmith, Joe: \\"So throughout life our worst weaknesses and meannesses are usually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise.\\"Whenever the focus is on Pip, particularly when dealing with Estella, Miss Havisham, or the mysterious, vaguely creepy lawyer Mr. Jaggers, \\"Great Expectations\\" is both high art and a great read. Dickens' descriptive powers remained in high beam in this, his penultimate novel (completed in 1861). The storyline takes its time, but in such a way that it often feels like a prototype for the stream-of-consciousness narrative authors would employ a century later.If only \\"Great Expectations\\" didn't suffer from one of Dickens' chief bte noires, compounding coincidences. Whether it's the identity of Estella's long-lost father or Miss Havisham's unworthy suitor, too many of the plot strands wind up twisted together to unwholesome effect.Other plot strings, like the tale of a blackguard named Orlick or the romances of Pip's pals Herbert Pocket and Wemmick, do little to merit the lengthy attention they receive. Most annoying is the story of Compeyson, built up as Pip's main adversary. Yet we hardly meet the guy before he vanishes in the black waters of Dickens' top-heavy plot machinations.Except for Jaggers, Estella, and Miss Havisham, \\"Great Expectations\\" suffers from an uninteresting cast of supporting characters. But when you have three such meaty characters, not to mention the noble yet shifting Pip at the center, you have one eminently worthy novel. Add to that Dickens' descriptive abilities, and that harrowing opening, and \\"Great Expectations\\" delivers most of the way on its title's promise."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"i enjoy these barnes and noble editions. pocket books make a nice addition to the library."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I do pretty much all my \\"reading\\" on audio books these days and Michael Page is probably my favorite narrator so far. He changes his voice for each character in a way that sounds so natural and undistracting, and his female voices are not annoying (I think the mark of a really great narrator is how undistracting their \\"opposite gender\\" voices are.)The story of Great Expectations deserves to be told by someone of Page's talent. I first read it by accident when I was a kid, not realizing it was a classic (always avoided books I was supposed to read.) I liked it well enough then, but I love it now. The characters are interesting, the morality of the book is not preachy and it's such a substantial book that you can listen to it several times and still pick up some new insight or pleasure. If you're an impatient reader, the book is probably not for you. If you need action on every page, you might get bored. But if you are a people person and you like getting to know the characters of a book, if you like to look for truth in fiction, it's a great story, very well told."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Well, I was looking through some of the reviews posted here on amazon just to get an idea of what to write because this is my first review, and saw that a few people said that you need to be an adult to read this book. I kind of understand what they mean because this is a pretty dense novel, as most of Dicken's writing is. However, I don't feel that an individual's determines his maturity as a reader, and so, I dont feel that people should be discouraging teenagers from reading this classic book.Having said that, let me discuss a few key points that are important to keep in mind when considering whether or not to buy the book. Firstly, this is a very difficult read, so unless you are accustomed to reading classical fiction, be prepared to devote more time to reading the book than you generally would to a novel of similar length (450ish pages). Furthermore, the book is a drag at times, especially in during the first part. Often times, I would get lost while reading the book because I couldn't focus on the descriptions which seemed to get in the way of the plot. However, I have to give Dickens credit on doing a remarkable job of writing the dialogue between characters which allows the reader to immerse into the story. Whenever I wasn't lost, I would often feel as if I was right in the center of the scene and could vividly visualize what was going on around the protagonist.As for the theme of the book, I felt that it tried to impart a good, however slightly shallow, message on the reader. By the end of the book, it is very clear what the message is as all of the characters get what they deserve. However, having read a lot of philosophical literature, I feel compelled on extracting deeper meaning from everything around me, which is kind of hard to do from this book.My recommendation of this book would depend on the reader, I feel that if you have read another book of a similar genre or time period, then you would really enjoy this book otherwise it might be very boring. If this is your first time reading a book by a classical writer, might I recommend visiting sparknotes after every couple of chapters to get a clearer understanding of the plot. Also, I would recommend to every single person to only buy this book if they can dedicate significant time to reading it. Don't think this is one of those books that you can just read anytime you have a few minutes here or there because you will be lost and won't understand it at all. I feel it would be best to sit down and just read for an hour or two (depending on your attention span) and delve deep into the world of the characters. Not only does this process make identifying character development easier, it also makes the book more enjoyable.Also, for anyone who finds Dicken's writing style interesting, I recommend looking at David Copperfeild (just read the first paragraph, and you will be hooked)."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It was hard to get into for the first 200 pages. The end was nice though. It was not as good as I expected it to be. Not one of Dickens's best. David Copperfield was much better."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"HAHAHHAH696"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I too have been out of school for some time. I decided explore the classics. Mr. Dickens has such a command of the English language so much so that I could not put it down. He expatiated very well throughout the entire pages of the book. I did not read it without my dictionary; which is the reason I read it to expand my vocabulary. After reading this book television became very boring to me. My favorite is Joe Gargery and John Wemmick. Joe because of his stick-to-itiveness. He is the same no matter what. The latter because of his ability to separate work with Jaggers from home. He enjoys life to the max and loves his father so. Pip is also to be appreciated for he does see what is most important in life and the value of love is what is important. After reading this book I have embarked on two others: Much Ado About Nothing (which I have thorougly enjoy) and Silas Marner which is great also. I hope everyone can find the enjoyment of reading for pleasure and learning as I have. Happy reading"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A great book in concept. However, Dickens was apparently paid by the word. Especially the silly ones, like &quot;prithee&quot; and &quot;vittles&quot;. It is time that we stopped attacking freshmen honors students with this pretentious book, which serves only to drive them away from English forever. Nowhere near the best of Dicken's work, the book reads like a 19th century soap opera, without bathroom breaks and Snuggle-bear commercials. By the time the first interesting character returns to the novel, the reader is lucky if he or she hasn't choked to death on tears of frustration. Why is Estelle such a b****? Why is Ms. Havisham such an old hag? Why is Pip so utterly slackjawed that he permits 20 years of idiocy to be perpetrated upon his stale English carcass? Why, after all, doesn't his benefactor take care of business, murder the lot, and turn this into something vaguely enjoyable? Never mind the fact that Dickens couldn't choose an end, he apparently couldn't even choose a plot, wavering wildly between romance and mystery and the sort of English politics that Michael Palin would love to throw his pasty-white Anglo-Saxon hands about and throttle. Especially the politics. Do we really care about how an English attorney carries himself when we're 15 years old? Not bleeding likely. Powdered wigs and leg stockings sum up the bizarre nature of the staying power of this novel. It's about time that High School English teachers stopped telling one another how *good* this book is, and read it themselves, without the Norton Critical Teacher's Edition beside them. Especially when they have the advantage of alcoholic beverages."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm an eighth grade student forced to read this book for English class. Most people would probably assume that the book sucks. Guess what? It does. I'm sorry, but Charles Dickens does not happen to be my cup of tea. He may be a master, but it's impossible to deny that his writing is dry and the story drags in many places. I counted numerous parts of the novel that could have easily been eliminated without affecting the rest of the book. And what the h*** is Pip thinking at the end when he decides to marry (person who I will not name)? Seems to me his only reason for doing this is that he's completely desperate and tired of chasing after Estella all that time. It totally came out of nowhere and wasn't very realistic. The book's really not that bad, but apart from the interesting episodes with Miss Havisham, it's pretty boring."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Some may call me a classic book snob, but here it goes.Great expectations may be at times tedious and I won't deny that, but it is worth it.Charles Dickens goes into great depth of detail and at times a bit overly detailed and I'm sure that is where many people get lost. But if you get the main plot, then you can get the jiff of it.The characters in this book transcend time.Pip, the poor boy who finds himself wondering if he can love old Joe know that he is rich.Estella who cannot love truly but yet brought up to love and destroy.Miss Havisham, the old rich woman who had her heartbroken and know is trying her best to seek revenge.Joe, Biddy and others also play a pivotal role.The story itself plays on the role of moral and also mercy. It shows a colorful and at times exaggerated array of feelings. From grief to greed, to deceit and happiness.Pip, a lonely orphan and living with his sister, finds and help a criminal. Although it was not completely of his own will.Then Pip is introduced to the sad and luxurious world of Miss Havisham where he met Estella, the girl he loved from then on.From then on he resents his meager living until one day he finds out that he had just inherited a large fortune.Then on Pip goes on a quest to truly become a gentleman and win Estella's heart.But how can he win Estella's heart when she doesn't have one?Can he really forsake his family for money?Who gave him that money?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The kindle text is fine, but please be alerted that the link provided to get the free audiobook takes you to some japanese website that has nothing to do with Great Expectations that I could find."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a really good new book.

But why, for example, doesn't Pip use the Internet to look things up? Stuff like that. Still, it's a good read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"\\"Great Expectations\\" has often been claimed as a masterpiece, a classic, a book hailed through the ages as wonderful. However, I find that while its messages are eternal, Dickens's style is very off-putting. Don't get me wrong, his prose is very, very beautiful, and his characters are layered in a way that many modern novelists seem to forget. Yet his descriptions are extraordinarily, unnecessarily lengthy. It's a novel, not a travel magazine. Considering that Dickens wrote this novel as chapters to be published weekly in a newspaper, it's unsurprising how drawn-out the descriptions are (higher word count = higher profit). Also, by compiling all of his entries into one novel, you find repetition creeping in as you realize he redoes all of the unpleasantly elaborate descriptions from the previous few chapters over again. It's disappointing to read a book that takes you for either a dunce, or someone with short-term memory loss."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Ordered Great Expectations because it has been many years since I originally read it as a requirement for a literature class.

That convict has escaped with another, his enemy convict. They are captured in the end but the convict whom Pip aided gives Pip 2pounds and a shilling by his fellow convict later on.Then, Pip is taken to a rich lady, Miss Havisham&iexcl;s and meets proud and heartless Estella whom he falls in love with. Born in a quite a poor family in the country, he tries to be clever so that Estella does not call him common, and quite succeeds. And plus, fortune lays itself in his way by an unknown rich person. A lawyer, Mr. Jaggers knows the provider of the fortune but does not tell Pip who it is because the provider&iexcl;s wish is to let him/herself known when he/she is ready for it. And Pip goes off to London.In London, Pip is introduced to Mr. Matthew Pocket, a relation of Miss Havisham for Mr. Pocket is to be Pip&iexcl;s tutor. Pip lives with Mr. Pocket&iexcl;s son Mr. Herbert Pocket whom he had met before at Miss Havisham&iexcl;s when a child, and becomes very acquainted with him. His other acquaintance is Mr. Wemmick, who works for Mr. Jaggers. He has a different life at work and at home, that makes him peculiar. All this time Pip thinks that the &iexcl;unknown provider&iexcl; of his fortune is doubtlessly Miss Havisham and thinks that she wants Estella and him to be married. However, he finds out that in fact it is not Miss Havisham who gave him his fortune but the old convict he had helped! That convict had escaped again and fled to Australia where he had worked for Pip and had become an owner of quite some money which was given to Pip. And now he comes to Pip and tells him. So that convict is known to Herbert as well and they live together.Now, when Pip was young, his parents had died so he lived with his sister&iexcl;s family. Joe, his brother-in-law is a good friend of his, a blacksmith, but his own sister is not very nice to him. A man called Orlick, who was Joe&iexcl;s helper, thinks very ill of Pip&iexcl;s sister and one day, hits her on the head and makes her a simpleton and she dies after some years. That man Orlick, tries to murder Pip for false reasons but fails for Pip&iexcl;s friends save him.The convict, if captured, would be hanged, therefore, Pip decides that the convict should be out of England as soon as possible and that Pip should accompany him. They plan it, and it proceeds. Meanwhile, Estella is married to a quite rich man and Miss Havisham is dead. The other convict who had escaped with Pip&iexcl;s that long time ago, Pip&iexcl;s convict&iexcl;s foe, follows Pip and the convict on their way out of England and tries to capture them. There is a fight underwater, Pip&iexcl;s convict is alive but is soon captured by the police and his foe is dead underwater. Pip&iexcl;s convict, named Magwitch or Provis is deeply wounded, and dies in prison. Before he dies, Pip finds out that Estella was adopted by Miss Havisham and that her father is Provis, so tells Provis that and that Pip loves his daughter. After that, Provis dies.Pip has an old acquaintance in the country, his hometown, a lady named Biddy. He decides to propose to her, now that Estella is gone, and leaves to the country only to find that Biddy is already married to Joe! He congratulates them and thinks about another little Pip to be in that house, just like he was when he was young. He then departs abroad to where Herbert works, for when Pip was a possessor of a fortune, he had secretly found Herbert that job, and Herbert, not knowing the provider of such a job had invited Pip to be a clerk. Pip lives abroad for eleven years, meanwhile Herbert marries and Pip becomes their &iexcl;partner in the House&iexcl;.After those 11years, he returns to Joe and Biddy&iexcl;s abode where he finds himself there! Named Pip after Pip was a little boy! Pip is warmly greeted, and after dinner, Biddy, who knows all about Estella for Pip had told her when he was young, asks if he surely does not fret for her? Pip replies that he thinks not, but anyway, revisits Miss Havisham&iexcl;s old house. The buildings are taken down, but among the ruins, stands Estella! Her husband had died most unfortunately because of a horse but even before his death, her marriage was not led to be a happy one. For all Pip knew, she was married again, but she was not. Pip and Estella converse about their interests, and Pip says, &iexcl;We are friends.&iexcl; To which Estella continues, &iexcl;And will continue friends apart.&iexcl; Then there is a nice little paragraph, which, if I am not quite mistaken proves that they are married.When I was reading this fantastic novel, I saw a lot of things. On my reading of pre-20th century novels, I only encountered those which were in third person, or first person, but &iexcl;I&iexcl; as a girl, not a boy. Great Expectations was something new, for I had thought that a boy liking a girl is to be quite different from a girl liking a boy and a boy&iexcl;s thoughts about poverty and being ignorant is to be quite different from a girl but I found out that it&iexcl;s quite the same. I mean, it depends on one&iexcl;s character and personality of course, but I found out that some boys do not like telling lies or stealing as much as girls and adults do not. It is a fantastic novel, an excellent read, and although the ending is not originally Charles Dicken&iexcl;s idea, I think Dickens made a great decision to follow what his friend suggested. For the original ending was a sad one, which would have made the reader very unhappy for Pip, whereas the new ending gives some hope and happiness to the reader. I read from a book on Great Expectations that the title, Great Expectations, meant not only Pip&iexcl;s expectations but the reader&iexcl;s of Dickens&iexcl; novels&iexcl; expectations. I surely think that those expectations were rewarded to perfection."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was forced to read Great Expectations in the ninth grade, and i am still in the ninth grade, so yeah.

My opinion is if we can understand the story that Charles Dickens has created ever so descriptively here, and in other stories, then we will understand present day literature, as it appears much easier to comprehend (from my personal perspective)."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Really good book.

The book starts out when he is 8 years old and he is in a grave yard when an escaped convict comes up to him and demands that he get him some food and a file, so he can get out of his ankle cuffs. Pip does as he is asked and doesn't tell a sole like he had sworn too. The story then continues to follow Pips life as he gets older.This book is an English novel written by Charles Dickens. Charles Dickens wrote many books, of which a couple are required reading by English classes. Great Expectations is a well written book in which the surroundings, characters and noises are well described. Although Great Expectations is well written I feel that the story is a little slow to pick up and, it is hard to become engrossed into the book because it seems a little monotone. In later chapters you can also guess at what might be coming next.Great Expectations though slow to pick up, does have a good, solid story line and can be entertaining to read once you pass the first chapter. This would not be a good book for people who like action books or books with a lot of twists and turns that keep you reading to see what comes next. But if you like a slower paced book with maybe a hint of love in it with a less gripping more predictable out come then Great Expectations would be a good pick."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Well, unlike the multitudes in America, I was NOT forced to read \\"Great Expectations\\" in high school or at any other time. However, lately it seemed like it was time to pick up this old classic and to dig into its treasures.The story starts out with an unlikely scene in a graveyard in a small English village. There we meet a little boy named Pip, who is visiting the gravesites of both of his parents. There we also meet a desperate convict who is cowardly enough to scare the little boy half to death in order to get some food and other items. Pip - an earnest, battered little orphan being raised by his sister and brother-in-law - anxiously sets out to please this convict. And so starts the tale of Pip's life.After the convict scene, Dickens takes his time in setting up exactly what Pip's life was like as he was groomed to take his brother-in-laws place as the blacksmith in the town. Dickens' genius for wit, along with some very likeable characters, help pull the reader through the endless pages of details and slow action.Soon, however, Pip's fortunes change...and then they change again...and then yet again. Yet, while the storyline somewhat resembles a roller coaster, the pacing is so slow that one is never overwhelmed by the action. In fact, I was rather underwhelmed by the amount of action there was for the number of words I was reading.Even so, I would say that this book is worth the effort. Dickens explores human nature of an average man when beset by a number of unusual situations, each one building on the last. Pip is likeable in these scenarios because he is never obnoxiously perfect or unaffected by his changing fortunes. In some ways, he \\"learns his lesson\\" by the end. In others, he does not.While Dickens tackles some rather weighty issues in this book, he does so in his distinctive, chipper, witty manner. Thus, one never really understands the emotional depths that the characters experience due to either their oppressive or their opulent fortunes.

While not as emotionally satisfying as the earlier &quot;David Coppefield,&quot; it is nevertheless tighter, more compact, and displays a greater maturity and discipline of writing style on Dickens' part. Those who feel 'Copperfield' has all the characters, take note of the ensemble here-- Pip, Joe Gargery, Biddy, Mr. Jaggers, Uncle Pumblechook, Abel Magwitch, Estella, and the novel's haunting, living spectral figure, Miss Havisham. The intertwining of these lives, the playing out of these destinies, combined with its memorably Gothic beginning and unsettling ambiguous ending make &quot;Great Expectations&quot; a pleasure to read for both its narrative power and literary craftsmanship. Considered by many to be Dickens' &quot;best rounded&quot; story, I concur by offering this example. Having finished the novel, I craved a viewing of David Lean's brilliant 1947 film. I ended up by mistake with the Ethan Hawke Gwyneth Paltrow 1998 remake. I decided to give it a try, and was so enraptured by the look of the film and its grasp of the material I stayed with it. Not as satisfying as Lean's film, to be sure, but it works.

In classical Dickens style, Chuck makes a good social commentary or stirs some good emotions, yet does it way too slowly. The plot speeds and dies down, goes somewhere sometimes and goes nowhere even faster more often, and brings up characters who have no real purpose. Dickens is accused of being &quot;wordy,&quot; and I see why: British authors were often paid by the word and length of their novels and short stories.

It is the story of what each of us would probably do if placed in the situations Pip deals with. There are love, friendship, and warmth, which are nearly destroyed by obsession, discontent, and the desire to keep up appearances during the course of this powerful novel. These seemingly necessary emotions and acts of something near betrayal are finally exposed as cheap and worthless when the hero's true benefactor is known in the end. Pip, the main character, is something like all of us, and the people he encounters are very likely to be similar to those we encouter in our own lives."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I found that this novel was quite wonderful, really.

I usually fly through novels within a few days, but getting through this one is likened to going through a maze in the dark. I give it two stars because I do think the plot was interesting, but the execution was abominably horrible. I actually had to have a dictionary next to me in order to understand all the weird words Dickens used, words such as 'peppercorny' and 'farinaceous.' Now, I usually pride myself on having quite an excellent English vocabulary, but I felt utterly lost when trying to read this book. Some of the dialogue was completely unfathomable and pointless, and about a quarter of the time I did not have a clue as to what he were talking about. Many of the characters were annoying, Mr. Pumblechook for example. I cringed during the chapter when he saw Pip, after Pip had become a gentleman, and the stupid man kept saying \\"May I? May I?\\" Ugh. There was so much this book could have done with out; the endless pointless descriptions, the useless minor characters, and the stupidity of some of them was unbearable. What I mean by that is Miss Havisham's voluntary reclusive existence; I mean, how can somebody live like that without going completely insane, just sitting in the dark day after day, wearing the same clothes, and throwing her life away for a man who was only after her money? Stupid and lame that was, if mildly noble (her behavior). I cannot understand why Dickens is so praised as a writer. His plot may be good in this book, but it is terribly written. I have made two attempts in my life to read this book. The first time, I got about halfway through and had to stop because it was about as enjoyable as plucking my eyebrows. A few years later, the second attempt got me to about the 42nd chapter, but again, my interest fizzled out. I do not think I will ever finish this book, and would only advise reading it if you have trouble sleeping, because it will knock you out fast.

Fall in love with and his often misguided heart."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It's ridiculous to review Dickens, who is as secure in the Western canon as Shakespeare. Nonetheless, I'll make two points about \\"Great Expectations\\", which is the first Dickens novel I've read since my adolescence. (Kennedy was President, alas.)First, I'll say that the characters in this book are affecting exaggerations and not quite real. For example, Joe Gargery, the blacksmith, is touching in his decency and saintly in his generosity. But Dickens gives him no rough emotional edges, and so he never rises beyond rustic sentimentality. Likewise, Hebert Pocket, Pip's friend, is a lovely young man but exists in friendship with out making any demands. And, there is the resolute and controlling Mrs. Havisham and her pathetic martyrdom. Yes, she was hurt by a man. But, it's hard to imagine a person living in the filth and disorder of her mansion, unless she is crazed, like a modern street person. To sum this up, I'd say that his characters are not really persuasive, even though they resonate emotionally.Second, I was surprised by the near total lack of visual effects in the writing. Early on, there's a moment of visual writing when young Pip is in the cemetery. But thereafter, this element is all but lacking in the book. Even after several re-readings, for example, I could never quite see Magwitch tumble into the river.Regardless, I enjoyed the read and did not find it discursive or too long. Go for it!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I liked this book even though sometimes I couldn't understand it. Charles Dickens used a lot of words he didn't need to, and he used a lot of big words that needed to be looked up. There was a lot of parts that I did not understand. Otherwise it was a pretty good story when I knew what was going on. I would recommend this book to other people because you learn about the lifestyles back then."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This novel was pretty good. I liked how everyone's lives in it were somehow connected. I also liked how Pip matures and learns the big lessons of life.One thing I didn't really like about it was that it was hard to understand. The English dialect was hard to follow, all the different names were hard to sort out, and there were manyold-time-ish and confusing words. But other than the confusion, the story line was great and Dickens wrote it really well and brought everything and everyone in the book together nicely. All of the characters were fun to read about and Dickens made them seem interesting and some very weird. I would recommend this book to anyone because it seems like anyone could connect with the characters in this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book seems interesting as you would expect from Dickens, but I must admit that i found it boring.

This is the worst, yet! I don't understand why students have to read classics that people rarely understand! I thought the book was pointless with nothing to look forward to while you're reading. Many books have a strong structure and basis where you want to know what will happen next, which keeps you reading on. This story has no meaning and Charles Dickens is going no where with this. Not to mention the characters are just plaing weird. Where in the world did Dickens get a bizarre lady like Miss Havisham, who is practically ill in the head? I would never recommend this book because it was boring, time consuming, and I can rarely consentrate on what I was reading. I'm glad I got over reading this. I'm sure the only people who read this book is the ones who are forced to, like myself. If I can give this book's rating as a no star, I would. Too bad it only comes in 1-5 stars."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"TOO LONG, IT SUCKED!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"i havent read it yet but it shows diskousting:)I hate this book and i hope my mates of aal &lt;vasos &gt; help me finisk it.Chill out"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"this has got to be the worst book i have ever read. first off, for me, the storyline shure cured my insomnia. you will get bored from the first paragraph. his sentences are difficult to understand and very lengthy. my sugestion, borrow from the library before you consider buying this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens and this book are very overrated.

This ranks with Catch-22 and Huckleberry Fin as one of the worst novels yet published in the English language. Was there a plot? No. Don't kid yourself. The fool author made it up as he went along not caring if it made sense or if the characters had any meaning. I hate this novel with a passion so great it scares even me. I'd like to see all copies burned. Okay, not really. That's a little extreme. But, at least take this garbage out of school curriculums. Its' making us stupid, making us believe Pip's world is what the world really is. Pip if a fool that got dumped too many times and where's the sex. Was Dickens scared of it. I believe that all great novels should have sex in them. It brings some humanity to them . Great Expectations is a fantasy on level with the Bible but worse, tragicly worse."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations was a mediocre book. I was not impressed. I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class. It was too long and boring. I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real. It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill. Every chapter was boring. I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book. Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays? This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story. In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK! If you want to read a good Dickens story, read \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I didn't enjoy this book in high school back in 2000. I am re-reading this book again after 12 years.What an amazing gift we have inherited from Charles Dickens. I am enjoying revisiting the Victorian society again."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was compelled to read Dickens (\\"A Tale of Two Cities,\\" in my case) in eighth grade and decided that I didn't like his writing. I managed to avoid Dickens and the Victorian novelists for several years, even as an English major. It wasn't until I was in my mid-20s that I read \\"Great Expectations,\\" and I'm glad that was so, because I was finally ready to appreciate Dickens. If you've ever picked up a Dickens novel and put it back down with relief, you might try again in a few years. If you do, \\"Great Expectations\\" is an excellent choice for meeting, or for encountering again, this amazing author.Like \\"David Copperfield,\\" this novel is written throughout in the first person, and follows the title character from childhood to adulthood. The first-person point of view gives the story vividness and impact, as we see everything that unfolds through Pip's eyes. The difference between the perspective of Pip the boy and Pip the adult, looking back and writing, colors the plot and creates suspense.There are many possible reasons to read this book (other than having it assigned to you, of course).You could read it for its astonishing characters -- Miss Havisham, defiantly moldering away and shut up in her never-used wedding finery; Magwitch, the escaped convict with a backstory you'd never expect; Joe Gargery, the blacksmith whose external roughness is matched only by his inner tenderness; Estella, as self-divided and self-destructive as she is beautiful. You could read it for its settings -- the spooky marshes, the busy streets of London, the gothic horrors of Satis House. You could read it for the plot -- the hidden connections, unexpected reversals, and ambiguous endings. You could read it for its social criticism -- the comprehensive view of working-class, middle-class, and upwardly-aspriring characters; the insight into what people will do to themselves and others for money; the unsparing look at ideas of gentility versus actual nobility of character. You could read it for its language -- the idiosyncratic dialects, the indelible scenes, the variety of prose rhythms Dickens employs.In the end, there are two main reasons to read this novel: pleasure and wisdom. \\"Great Expectations\\" is of its time without being dated, and can be enjoyed as a satisfying story. The themes Dickens addresses are timeless, and speak to the 21st century as forcefully as they spoke to the 19th.This isn't my all time favorite Dickens novel -- that would be \\"Bleak House,\\" followed by \\"David Copperfield\\" -- but it's one of his best. If you've never tried it, or if it's been a while since you did, give it a try. You may well become a Dickens addict."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The DK series of classics are great!

I loved the book then, and I love the book now. It is easily one of the best books that Dickens' has written and well worth the read for everyone.

Charles Dickens is one of my favorite authors of all time next to Sparks, Crichton, Irving, Brewer, and Bradbury. The story follows the inheritance into wealth of a fourteen year-old in 18th century England. Told with detail, finesse and a mystery that will keep you hooked, don't miss out on this first rate literary experience.The young orphaned Pip, the sensual Estella: the boy's love interest, the enigmatic and vengeful Miss Havisham in her bridal wear. These are images you will never forget. Pick up a copy (unabridged if you can) and loose yourself in this carefully and masterfully wroght world.I also recommend John Irving's works, mainstream fiction, and Dandilion Wine by Ray Bradbury. Also look for the edition with the forward by Irving and the original ending.Check them out and buy while prices are cheap!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations read by Michael Page, unabridged on 16 audio CDs, was a great listening experience. I've had my copy of the book on the shelf for years, but never got around to reading it. Unfortunately, I spend more time driving than reading. Michael Page did a fine job reading all the roles with distinctive voices for each character, male and female. The total listening time was about 20 hours. There were many tracks on each CD. So if your CD player only remembers which track was playing when you stopped it, then probably the most you will have to repeat when you re-start the disk would be about 40 seconds. The recording quality was good, but the duplication process less than perfect. There was 1 disk out of the 16 that had some \\"popping\\" sounds. I do not know if every copy of the audio book will have 1 disk with some static, but my copy did. It was a little annoying, but was not too bad. The audio book was produced by Brilliance Audio of Grand Haven, Michigan. The bio on the box says that Michael Page is a Professor of Theater at Calvin College. I was impressed and entertained by his reading. He did sound British!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"\`Great Expectations' is one of my favourite Charles Dickens', second only to A Tale of Two Cities. Those who are not habituated to his style of writing may find it a bit difficult, but eventually that hurdle too would be overcome and the reader can enjoy the work of one of the finest authors of all time to its fullest.Phillip Pirrip was an orphan living with his dominating elder sister with no great ambition for the future, other than to become a blacksmith like his brother-in-law, Joe Gargery. But that was before he inherited a large amount of money from a mysterious benefactor. Now, leaving behind his shallow ambitions and old acquaintances, Pip follows his dream of becoming a \`gentleman'. Then maybe the beautiful but cold-hearted, Estella, the ward of the eccentric Miss Havisham, would accept his love for her. But will the unsolved mysteries of his past hinder him from fulfilling his \`Great Expectations'?Though Great Expectations first appeared in Dickens' weekly magazine, All the Year Round, more than a century back the story and the characters of the book still live on. Like all other books by Charles Dickens \`Great Expectations' too, does not just tell a story but also gives a message to its readers. Pip after coming into his inheritance starts ignoring his old friends because he feels that they are inferior to him, little realizing that they were the ones who loved and cared for him when he had no money. This situation is not something unique or something that can be related to only by the people of that time. This happens with almost every one of us. Once we achieve our goals we conveniently forget about those who helped us reach that goal. The way Dickens' has woven this message in his unforgettable story makes the book all the more beautiful. One thing I liked about this book is how all the seemingly unconnected characters seemed to fit together like the missing piece of a jigsaw puzzle by the end. What makes this book truly unforgettable is its characters. Every character of the book has an eccentric side to them. The only character that I think is \\"normal\\" is Pip and I did not find him interesting at all (I like eccentric characters. Am I weird?). Maybe that's how the author wanted it to be. Though the book has only a few female leads, they are the ones who steal the limelight. The eccentric Miss Havisham who sits in a room with a rotting wedding cake, wearing her wedding dress seemed more alluring to me than any of the other characters. It was her eccentricity that truly attracted me to her. If she had been some old, moody spinster, I would not have liked her half as much.Though I have repeated the point more than once, but \`Great Expectations' is truly an unforgettable book. Combined with prolific writing and memorable characters, this book is something which should be read at least once by all.Favourite Quotes:\\"Suffering has been stronger than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be.

Dickens also is a great writer and it is seen in every one of his stories, and especially, here, with Great Expectations.

I can honestly say I hated it! I found it weird and difficult. I am now 55 and decided it was time to check out Charles Dickens and find out what all the fuss was about. Having completed two of his greatest novels, Great Expectations and David Copperfield, I am a Dicken's fan for life! As an author, I realize how much I have missed. I love the old-english style of writing, the great history of Britain, and the downhome stories of boys, which seems to be Mr. Dicken's love. I am sadly impressed of the mistreatment of children of that era and am surprised that any were able to rise to achievement. What was true then, is true now - if we are to achieve anything in life - no matter our past, we must pull ourselves up by the boostraps and become... Excellent read.

Not me. Granted, part of the reason I enjoyed this book so much was because I had expected it not to be (A Tale of Two Cities is still collecting dust on my bookshelf). The writing is flawless; characters, wonderfully varied; and plot, save an occasional feeling of contrivance at the almost uncanny character interconnections, spectacular.Pip, an orphan, lives with his 20 plus years older sister Georgiana \\"Mrs. Joe\\" Gargery, an unhappy woman who \\"rampages\\" on him and her blacksmith husband Joe, a simple, kind man. During an unexpected encounter with a shackled escaped convict, he is coerced into helping the man to prevent bodily injury to himself. It's not the last the boy will see of him. Pip is later asked to visit an eccentric woman (having been left at the altar by a scheming fianc&eacute;), where he encounters the beautiful but cold Estella, a future love interest, and several other central characters. Eventually an anonymous donor provides monetary help to Pip hoping that it will facilitate his becoming a gentleman and a scholar. But as his financial situation changes from meager but adequate to one of relative wealth, his personality transforms from kindhearted and unpretentious to inconsiderate and snobbish. Only through the adversity that follows his attempt to fulfill the expectations of his benefactor does Pip learn some important life lessons.Also good, Mr. Pip by Lloyd Jones (wish I hadn't read it before GE), An American Tragedy by Theodore Dreiser, and The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When I was a teenager, I loved Dickens. In later years, however, I abandoned Dickens for more overtly \\"intellectual\\" authors. The wonderful thing about great books is that they do not suffer from multiple readings. Returning to Great Expectations after maybe 20 years was a delight. It is simple, accessible, gently humorous and heartbreaking. Dickens' love of language is simply a joy to experience. The novel is beautiful, effusive and yet tinged with Pip's own discomfort of class and self. Dickens holds his own as the Master Storyteller of the 19th Century."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"All the standard Dickensian motifs are present in this book: deus ex machinae, factitious coincidences, longueurs, inventive names, an empathy towards children in a world of pompous adults, and sheer expository brilliance.Dickens paints a picture in your mind...you see the country, smell the air, and hear the voices of the characters as if they are actually speaking. This being Dickens, you must allow for some patness in the plot...grant that, and then you can enjoy the genius of his phrases, metaphors, characterizations, and recounting of the absurd.(Wopsle's go at Hamlet in London should have you laughing out loud.)This is an excellent book...a classic."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A dark night. A pair of escaped convicts; a young boy named Pip who is seven years old. Pip helps the convict Magwitch with food and drink. Magwitch is sent in chains to banishment in distant Australia. Pip living at the forge of Joe Gargery and Pip's sister (Joe's wife) becomes an apprentice blacksmith. Pip also meets the enigmatic Miss Havisham who dresses in a yellow wedding dress lamenting her lost love. At Satis her estate he encounter Estella (star) who becomes the love of his life. Estella is as cold as an Eskimo and her heart as icy as Mt. Everest. He also meets Herbert Pocket who becomes his best friend.In part two we see Pip moving to London as he and Herbert become dissolute, fall into debt and live shallow lives.In part three secrets are revealed which make Pip a good man. We learn that it was the convict Magwitch who provided the funds needed to allow Pip to go to London and work for Mr. Jaggers the lawyer. We discover who is the father and who the mother of Estella. We learn what happened to Magwitch and all other mysteries are revealed. To give these secrets away in this review would ruin the pleasure of reading this classic novel.Great Expectations is a bildungsroman which is darker and more inttrospective that Dickens earlier David Copperfield of 1850. In it we see Pip grow from a selfish callow boy to a man who has suffered, helped others and been reunited with his lost love.Along the way we meet such immortal characters as Joe Gargery and his loving wife Biddy; the tragic Miss Haversham; the evil Orlick and Compeyson and the complex convict Magwith.The novel is cinematic in its ending as Magwitch returns to England to see how Pip is doing as a young man who has lived on the convicts benevolent financial bequest.Some critics believe that Estella is a representative of Dickens mistress Ellen Ternan. The novel is well plotted and moves quicker than many Dickens novels. This 1861 novel is narrated in the first person by Pip and was the last completed novel in the prolific Boz's illustrious career.Great Expectations should be read by everyone who loves English literature and Charles Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a wonderful story that Everyman's Library has place in great binding."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"If you have a student who either hates to read or struggles to read I would highly recommend this audio book.

Were I able to, I would give the book four and a half stars, rather than the four I've assigned it. As other reviewers have already amply commented on the book's numerous merits, I should like only to point out , what I thought to be, its foremost shortcoming. Although intentional by Dickens, I found my extreme dislike of Pip for much of the book to be a nuisance, chiefly because, as narrator, Pip set the tone of the narrative. It can be difficult not to equate the loathing of the narrator with the book itself. Luckily enough this was not a particularly prominent failing, and did not heavily tax me. Besides this, I found the book to be splendid, particularly during the bits concerning Joe and Mr. Wemmick, who were, at times, heartwarming and emotionally evocative to an extreme degree. In short, Great Expectations is one of Dickens's greats, with only minor, easily overlooked flaws."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It is impossible to exaggerate the satisfaction this book gives to its reader and the power of its deep human sympathy. If you were to read only ten books in your lifetime, Charles Dickens' GREAT EXPECTATIONS should be one of them.If you were to listen to just one audiobook in your life, Frank Muller's narration of Great Expectations should be it. One of the most complimentary things that can be said of such a performance is that it leaves you feeling that the work can be read only in that way. Muller accomplishes this, with the curious and endearing twist that Pip's own narration comes with an American accent, while all others speak in the unforgettable idiom of their place among the English classes and subclasses. Muller on Dickens is a triumph that even Dickens would have applauded.Now, for the book. The personae will stay with you forever. Pip himself. The deeply generous Joe Gargery. The immortally beautiful Estella, her heart in the end made soft through suffering. Miss Havisham, too terrible to believed but in the end redeemed from her lake of bitterness, if her cry, 'What have I done?!' is to be taken innocently. Wemmick and the Aged P, then - belatedly, Miss Skiffens the gloved. Herbert, then Herbert and Clara.Jaggers, about whom one is left to ponder, 'Who *is* this man?'Dickens and Muller are at their best with scoundrels. Expectations provides them no shortage of villains upon whom to practice. Pumblechook. Bentley Drummle. Old Orlick. Compeyson, about whom the best thing said is that he has drowned.Dickens' keen eye for the glory and the pathetic depths of humanity is almost unparalleled in English literature, with apologies to his critics. He knows that there are Gargeries and Biddies and Herberts. He understands this without for a moment denying the hell in human hearts that is comprised by the likes of Pumblechook with his false respectability and Orlick with his violent, drooling hatreds.He has comprehended that heaven - if he believed there is such a place - is likely populated by people surnamed Havisham, Jaggers, and Magwitch, who perhaps dance the more vigorously for having been much forgiven.Yet writing *about* Dickens and his worlds takes time that could be spend on reading Dickens and of his worlds.For that you'll need to pick up Great Expectations."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Michael Page gives a wonderful performance that brings \\"Great Expectations\\" to life.

Great Expectations shows how much of our lives are lived on incomplete information. The hero assumes that he knows who is guiding and helping him to live and grow beyound his simple beginnings, only to discover at the end that nothing he assumed was true. The hero does live up to the expectations of his benefactor, and beyond the expectations of many others.

Some parts were hard to read/understand."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is one of the most absorbing novels I have ever read. It is also the best. The plot is complex and exciting, sometimes very funny and sometimes almost unbearably sad, with so many plot twists it is impossible to lose interest. The writing and descriptions are...well they're Dickens': always brilliant and powerful. And the characters in Great Expecations, Pip, Uncle Pumblechook, Miss Havisham, Mr. Jaggers, etc., are colorful and original, and complex and lively. Great Expectations has the suspense of any of today's thrillers (during the last fifty pages I could not put it down) and a wonderful message: that your social standing does not determine what kind of a person you are; aristocracy isn't all it's cracked up to be; what you really need in life are good friends and people that care about you. Great Expectations is a masterpiece of the first order. I cannot stress enough how much I enjoyed it. It is most assuredly a book I will keep reading again and again throughout my life."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When reading this book in high school, I considered myself very fortunate that the copies we had contained the original ending. It was placed at the end, after the ending that was originally published. I much preferred the original ending from the momentI read it, and have since checked every copy I have come across to see if it is in them. Sadly, often it is not.The kindle edition does not contain the original ending. I did not see any reviews of this edition that mentioned it, so I thought I would post one for anyone else who finds that important, as I do."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"GREAT EXPECTATIONS is often the novel used in high schools to introduce students to Dickens. Due to it's length and fairly long and uneventful middle phase, I'm not sure it's the best text to introduce people to Dickens. Still, it is a pretty good story and contains some of the most memorable characters in Dickens' fiction.GREAT EXPECTATIONS is the story of Phillip Pirrip, otherwise known as Pip. Pip's parents die not long after he is born and he is raised &quot;by hand&quot; by his sister. His brother-in-law, Joe Gargery, is the town blacksmith and loves Pip. The two are best-of-friends. One night while looking at his parents' graves, Pip meets a convict and his life is forever changed by that meeting. As the novel progresses, Pip meets Miss Havisham (the wealthiest woman in town) and her beautiful ward, Estella. Pip immediately falls in love with Estella and is haunted by her all the days of his life. Eventually Pip is bond to Joe as his apprentice and sets to work in the blacksmith forge. Several years later, Pip's luck changes when he is informed by a lawyer from London, Mr. Jaggers, that he has become the recipient of &quot;great expectations&quot;. The book then follows Pip's life as he enters this new stage in life and as he develops and becomes a &quot;gentleman&quot;. Everything is brought full circle and just about everyone gets what they deserve by the time the novel ends.GREAT EXPECTATIONS isn't the easiest of books to read. What many writers can do in a sentence often takes Dickens two pages to tell. Also, the book is divided into three phases and the second phase is rather boring (except at the end) and really does nothing more than to fill in a few plot gaps and illustrate to us how much of a prig Pip becomes. Nevertheless, GREAT EXPECTATIONS is still a good story containing some very vivid characters: Pip, Estella, Joe, Miss Havisham, Magwitch, Jaggers, and Wemmick. The characters in GREAT EXPECTATIONS are as memorable as anyone in DAVID COPPERFIELD, OLIVER TWIST, or A CHRISTMAS CAROL. The first phase of the book is quite interesting and sets up everything that later occurs in the novel. The third part of the novel is full of excitement and contains Pip's repentance and reformation. Overall, it's a great book and even though it was written over a hundred years ago, it has a lot to say about the society in which we live today."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I first read this book when I was in eighth grade. Ever since then, I have been going back to it because even though I know how the events will eventually turn out, this book always retains the magic touch to entertain and keep one hoping that the main character Pip will live a happy life.Upon reading the first page, the reader is drawn into a world of mystery and suspense. The reader is whisked into an English cemetry from olden times and what draws the reader further is the presence of a little boy crying, afraid of the eerie atmosphere. To make matters worse, a very strange looking man appears to frighten the little boy even further. The suspense just begins.As if this wasn't enough for the little boy crying in the cemetry, Pip goes on to face even more difficulties in life. Pip meets with the strange Miss Havisham who forever wears her white wedding gownn. Pip feels forever alienated by the proud Estella, whom he has fallen in love with. The problem is --- Estella doesn't seem to care at all. To her, Pip is a poor, common boy.Excitement builds up as Pip is granted the chance to become a gentleman with prosperity. Will Estella care about him now? Will Pip remain the same kind-hearted young man he was when he was poor or will he change?Even though I have long found the &quot;answers&quot; (there are two different endings in the orginal) I am still amazed at how Dickens creates fascinating characters and fills his novels with mystery, suspense and romance."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As an English teacher, I purchased the collection to use in my classroom.

Both words probably had accents on characters as missing characters appeared as question marks (?), so I am not positive what the words actually were (one was French) and to be honest, I never bothered to look them up.

I highly recommend this wonderful book andfor free you cant beat that price."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a book worth reading, and it's a shame my first experience with it was having it force-fed to me 22 years ago as a high school sophomore or junior. I only wish I could find the crappy, soulless joke of a book report I regurgitated from Cliff's Notes to please my teacher and get that all-important \\"A.\\" Suffice to say that if I found it I would not post it here.Having re-read the book, I now can say with certainty that Dickens is a brilliant writer and storyteller. His use of language is phenomenal, and his characters tell a deep emotional tale. I suspect it is the tale of Dickens' own childhood dilemma: an emotionally abandoned boy seeking greatness and knowing at some level that he was born for it---and that fate somehow picked him out for it.Pip is a multidimensional character, with hopes and charm and honesty and flaws. He is utterly sympathetic, as I'm sure little Charles Dickens once was himself.Pip, an abused and undefended boy, is picked out rather randomly by a near stranger (seemingly the idealized parent for whom every child secretly hopes) to become a gentleman---to rise above the meagre expectations for which his limited birth has chosen him. Even his closest childhood ally, Joe the blacksmith, does nothing (read that: nothing) to defend him against Joe's abusive wife, Pip's older sister. To Dickens' discredit, I felt that he over-defended Joe's weakness as a non-defender. But, by the same token, Dickens' rendering of Joe's all-too-realistic weakness is quite honest and common: after all, so few adults really do stick their necks out to defend the child. I am only left to suspect that in Dickens' own childhood none did either. I would guess that like Pip, Dickens was surrounded entirely by adults who were weak, sadistic, self-centered, or manipulative. My guess is that only his talent, hard word, and patience allowed him to rise above.My only real criticism of the book (and it's not a big one) comes near the end, when Pip tries to help Magwitch escape England and thus find safety. Granted, Dickens' treatment of this situation does assist the flow of the novel, and does allow him to show just how much Pip has grown to care for his benefactor, but it still left me shaking my head. (And I'm not spoiling the plot, because in the version I read the editor's footnotes spoil the plot anyway early on in the reading, as clearly the editor assumes that the reader knows the story beforehand. Then again, maybe the editor is spoiling the plot to give himself some power. I felt some of his footnotes, which are otherwise quite helpful for background, suggest that he was in an annoying sort of competition with Dickens to show his own greatness.)So although the plot device works for Dickens' purpose, it just didn't strike me as sufficiently realistic to keep my disbelief suspended. My reason: Magwitch is a hardy, intelligent, cunning world traveler, who suddenly, for no good enough reason, puts all his trust for escape from England (and thus his life) into the hands of a complete novice, Pip, who creates a foolhardy plan for escape that ends up getting Magwitch captured and sentenced to death.In reality, given what Dickens' shows us about Magwitch's character, here's what I think would have really happened had Magwitch heard Pip's plan:Magwitch: \\"Pip, thank you for creating a plan to rescue me, but I think I'll pass. I'll go off into the night on my own, and leave England the same way I came to it: on my own.\\"Magwitch would have traveled onward with less hurrah, more stealth, and far more privacy. And as the result he would have likely left England safe and sound, and continued to keep up his benefactor relationship with Pip.But that wouldn't have suited Dickens' purposes for the plot, so the more realistic ending was avoided.That said, the book was still great. I couldn't put it down. Kudos to Dickens! And to hell with my high school teacher for nearly ruining my regard for this great writer."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Another reviewer claims that you have to be at least 21 years old to read this book. Although I don't think it should be \\"forced\\" on schoolchildren (they will only hate it) I read this novel when I was a child and I loved it. I have just re-read it now and I enjoy it all the more. This is my favorite novel by Dickens. It is from his later period and is criticized for being too dark - which, however, makes it more perfect for today's sensibilities. Stephen King cites this work as one of his favorites: he believes that it is this book that brought the gothic novel mainstream.Was there ever a novelist who created more memorable characters than Dickens? Here, we meet perhaps his most intriguing - Miss Havisham. For anyone unfamiliar with the story, I will not spoil it by describing her. The story is similar to parable about the prodigal son - good Pip inexplicably comes into some money and goes off to the corrupting city.AN IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE: Dickens wrote two ending for this book. His friends thought that the original ending was too downbeat and they asked him to come up with a different one. It is the upbeat ending that is the official ending of the novel. However, most critics agree that the original unpublished ending is better. Most modern editions feature the unpublished ending in an appendix. MAKE SURE YOU BUY A COPY THAT CONTAINS THE ORIGINAL ENDING!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is one of Dickens's later novels, a work of his artistic maturity. The narrative is symbolic rather than realistic. Although, as in most of Dickens and in Victorian literature in general, the plot relies heavily on coincidence, it is acceptable here because the events are true to the internal, psychological, logic of the story.After writing A Tale of Two Cities, which was unique among his novels in that it had none of his trademark humor, Dickens set out to make Great Expectations rich in comic elements. This despite, or perhaps because of, being in a depressed state of mind himself at the time. The conventional critical view is that he largely failed in this attempt, but I strongly disagree. The book is hilariously funny in parts and the main character, Pip, exhibits a characteristically British humour-in-adversity throughout his adventures. There is also the host of minor comic characters that we expect from Dickens. And he for once manages pathos without spilling over into bathos, so there are tears as well as laughter here, sometimes both at once.If you have not yet read any Dickens, this is not a bad book with which to start, although for younger readers (teens) I would recommend Hard Times or A Tale of Two Cities as their first. Great Expectations demands a mature sensibility to appreciate its symbolism and psychological depth. Perhaps because it chiefly concerns the childhood and youth of the protagonist, it is often given to young people to read and is a set text in some High School classes. This is a pity because, in its dark complexity, it is more likely to turn youngsters off, rather than onto, Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I've never read any Dickens of my own free will. I was forced to read &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; in high school and I thought that was enough for me. However, one day, on a whim, I bought a copy of Great Expectations. I'm not sure what I expected, but I certainly didn't expect to love it as much as I did.Dickens is not a writer to read at a swift pace. Indeed, this novel was written in weekly episodes from December 1860 to August 1861 and, as it was created to be a serial, each installment is full of varied characters, great descriptions and a lot of action which moves the plot along and leaves the reader yearning for more. Therefore, unlike some books which are easily forgotten if I put them down for a few days, Great Expectations seemed to stick around, absorbing my thoughts in a way that I looked forward to picking it up again. It took me more than a month to read and I savored every morsel.Basically the story is of the self-development of Pip, an orphan boy being raised by his sister and her blacksmith husband in the marshlands of England in 1820.Every one of the characters were so deeply developed that I felt I was personally acquainted with each one of them. There was Pip's roommate, Herbert Pocket, the lawyer, Mr. Jaggers, and his clerk, Mr. Wemmick. And then there was the wicked Orlick. The dialogues were wonderful. The characters often didn't actually say what they meant but spoke in a way that even though the words might be obtuse, there was no mistaking their meaning. I found myself smiling at all these verbal contortions.Dickens' work is richly detailed and he explores the nuances of human behavior. I enjoyed wallowing in the long sentences and letting myself travel backwards in time to a different world. However, even with the footnotes, I found myself sometimes confused by the British slang of 150 years ago, and there were several passages I had to read over several times in order to get the true meaning. Of course I was not in a particular rush. I didn't have to make a report to a class or take a exam about the book. This is certainly a pleasure.I heartily recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good read.ting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being transported. Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger. Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises. Eventually, with Magwitch's recapture and death in prison and with his fortune gone, Pip ends up in debtors prison, but Joe redeems his debts and brings him home. Pip realizes that Magwitch was a more devoted friend to him than he ever was to Joe and with this realization Pip becomes, finally, a whole and decent human being.Originally, Dickens wrote a conclusion that made it clear that Pip and Estella will never be together, that Estella is finally too devoid of heart to love. But at the urging of others, he changed the ending and left it more open ended, with the possibility that Estella too has learned and grown from her experiences and her wretched marriages.This is the work of a mature novelist at the height of his powers. It has everything you could ask for in a novel: central characters who actually change and grow over the course of the story, becoming better people in the end; a plot laden with mystery and irony; amusing secondary characters; you name it, it's in here. I would rank it with A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield among the very best novels of the worlds greatest novelist.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This review refers to the audio(CD - Brilliance Audio) edition of \\"Great Expectations\\" by Charles Dickens, read by Michael PageThis unabridged audio edition of Dickens' classic superb chronology of \\"Pip's' journey through life going from a poor boy to becoming a man with \\"expectations\\" is simply marvelous. As Pip comes into a small fortune, and becomes a \\"gentleman\\" he learns the value and true meaning of friendships and life. But the journey is a long one, with many lessons to be learned along the way before he can find his true self. Dickens has given us a wonderful story, with rich details of the setting and characters that grow and are among the most interesting and magnetic to be found in literature.I don't need to go on and on about the book itself(although I could easily go over my allotted word count here), if you haven't read it yet ,just know you are in for one heck of a literary treat. It is a story that will transport you to another time and place, and you may not want to come back. I will however, talk about this marvelous audio edition. Michael Page is the reader, and what a reading he gives. Just curl up and listen to this master storyteller. Every voice, every nuance is captured. There is no doubt who is speaking as he gives each character the personality and cultural characteristics as Dickens intended. He even does the women wonderfully, without going over the top. In my mind Miss Havisham has always sounded just the way Page portrayed her, Estella as uppity as ever,the humble Joe, along with all the rest.The book is an unabridged reading on 16 discs. each discs has 90 very short tracks(about 45 seconds each), I had no trouble starting up where I left off(when I absolutely had to leave off). I just made a mental note(or you could even write it down) of the track number and disc where I stopped it. The sound quality is excellent, and total running time is about 20 hours. Each disc is in it's own paper CD holder with a clear front so you can see the disc number you are looking for.If you are a fan of this book, this audio edition will give you a fresh read and new appreciation of this fascinating book. If you are experiencing it for the first time, you can't help but to become enthralled.

This is one of my all-time favorite books ever. I had to read it eons ago when I was in ninth grade, and now (14 years later) I am still enjoying it. Every few years I take this one down from my bookshelf to revisit. This is the story of Pip, a small orphaned boy living in poverty in the English countryside with his much older sister and her husband. Pip meets a convict in a graveyard one damp morning and helps him out in the form of some vittles and an iron file. Later in the story, Pip moves from poverty to being a &quot;gentleman&quot; due to the influence of a mysterious, anonymous benefactor. This book tells of his adventures and how Pip's expectations guide him through life. Towards the end of the story, Pip finds out that reality is sometimes very different from what we expect it to be. The characters are what really make this book stand out. Charles Dickens is a master of character development, and his descriptions of Miss Havisham, Wemmick, Joe, and the others is brilliant! The dialogue is great, with the words written the way a commoner would have spoken in England in the 1800's. Another thing I really liked was how all of the characters are inter-related to each other in ways that you may not discover until you get to the end of the novel.This novel will make you laugh and it might make you sad, but it is always entertaining. If you are in high school and reading this book for the first time for English class, keep at it! It may seem difficult at first if you are not used to Dickens, but this book is well worth it! It is truly a gem."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is not the full version, despite the length. There's no indication of this until you get inside the book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens's acknowledged masterpiece, Great Expectations, is rightly considered one of the greatest novels of all-time. It depth and breadth are staggering, as it follows its protagonist, Pip, from his early childhood through his later life. During the course of his life, we encounter a vast catalog of raw human emotions: love, hate, jealousy, hope, sadness, despair, anger, pity, empathy, sympathy -- and on and on. The story is treasured and revered for many reasons. One of its main strengths is its plot: after a somewhat slow introductory section, Dickens puts his story in fifth gear and delivers a fast-paced and exciting story that gallops along without ever losing interest or clarity. The incredibly complex plotline, full of separate stories and incidents that seem totally unrelated to each other, but are then all harnessed together as the book heads straight toward its denouement, is also full of constant plot twists, which continue up until, literally, the last paragraph. But, of course, as with all of Dickens's major works, it is the characters that make the book. Like Shakespeare, Dickens preferred to have the story develop through the characters, rather than having the characters be mere set pieces inside of an overriding story. And what great characters they are: the perennially paradoxical but essentially human Pip; the bitter and mysterious Miss Havisham; the beautiful and haughty Estella; the simple and saint-like Joe; the kind and benevolent Herbert; the very human convict, Magwitch -- and all of the other wonderful characters. Dickens excelled in creating well-rounded, very human characters who harbored very real and very complex emotions -- that is, human emotions. We identify with Pip as he winds through his life, because we have been there, too -- the disappointments, the surprises, the loves, the anger, the sadness. In whatever way his story may differ from our own, it is still essentially human, as is ours. For all of his complex and paradoxical emotions and sentiments, Pip is a recognizably human character -- and that is why we love him and this book. A masterpiece for the ages, which will endure for years yet to come, Great Expectations is a great book that can be loved by one and all, for, at its heart, is that grain of simple truth that says so much about what is human in all of us -- whether we have great expectations or not."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The description of Miss Havisham & her home alone is worth two to three stars. This is unlike any other book in the English language, with the possible exception of Emily Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights?\\" Dickens tells us many things in the begining of the novel that appear out of place or irrelevant, but later those pieces fall into place so that the big picture is revealed.This story runs the gamut of emotions for the reader. Shock, empathy, joy, disappointment, & disdain are all there for the various characters at different times. Multiple plots, detailed descriptions, & ever mutable characters made this a long & entertaining read. This is the story of Phillip Pirrup or Pip. He is a true hardluck case that you root for. His family except for a brother & sister have all passed away. He lives with his sister{a husband beater} & brother in law Joe Gargery in a tiny English village. Oddly for this era, this is one of the few books where fear from a man's perspective is explored. That in itself was refreshing. Along the roller coaster life that Pip finds himself on he meets enigmatic people & gets an anonymous benefactor who helps him reach London to start a better life? Once there life & the nature of Pip himself is radically altered. This is when the title of my review becomes clear. Dickens asks & answers very poignant psychological questions long before Freud was ever heard of."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I chose to write a review of Great Expectations because I wanted to be able to rate a novel &quot;five-stars&quot; without an ounce of hesitation.Context: I'm not by any means some sort of an intellect. Like many people who have read Great Expectations, I was assigned this book in high school. I remember looking to the end of the book, first, to see how many pages there were. I cringed. Then I began to read that first chapter about a boy named Pip who meets the convict looking for vittles.I won't give anything away about the plot. I only want to say that this was the first book that I ever read that I had me truly absorbed. I remember a kid in my class who read ahead a few chapters and had us all in wonder as to what twists transpired. He just smiled and said, &quot;you won't believe how this thing turns out.&quot;After reading other Dickens books I realized that his greatest strengths was populating his books with amazing, odd, likeable, and despicable characters who found there way in and out of his stories.If you haven't read this book, do so."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I got the &quot;cover-to-cover&quot; book on tape for a long road trip, never having heard the story before. I loved every minute of it. The things that Dickens does with the English language is endlessly entertaining, the story he tells fascinating and fast-paced. The highly talented Martin Jarvis reads wonderfully, giving great characterization to the many people appearing in the story, allowing me to see them all as completely distinct.It's a shame that people feel such resentment when forced to read something. Most of the bad reviews this book gets are from young people who were forced to read it for a class. When taken at one's own leisure, and in one's own time, it is quite entertaining. I'm not sure that the teachers who assign the book are pointing out all the things that make the book great, such as Dickens's flair with the language, the point he's making about a society that places birth above worth, and his ability to make abstract arguments that enhance the story. I'd be interested in hearing from literature teachers to find out how they use the book in their classes.One of the best books ever written, this reading is one of the best investments of my time I've ever made."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Our book group decided to read a book by Charles Dickens in this the bicentenary of his birth.

Even with Dickens' extremely long r&eacute;sum&eacute; of books Great Expectations maybe the only one read by younger readers because the other are usually mature plots or have extreme length. But, Great Expectations is a \\"great\\" exception.Charles Dickens used a very eloquent vocabulary. His absolute mastery of English makes his book interesting yet difficult to read. Terminology has changed since he wrote the novel, and, in addition to the evolution the language, Dickens was British. This fact changed his wording from typical American English and helped the book be more in character. Dickens also exercises his talent for manipulating words and creating vivid word pictures like these sentences, \\"Mrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisite art of making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt itself,\\" and \\"It was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the wind blows cold: when it is summer in the light, and winter in the shade.\\" These brilliant word pictures make the book a bear to read when quickly read but also makes it brilliantly fascinating when soaked in and read slowly. In short Dickens has the entire language in his hands and works it masterfully into a brilliant weaving of plot.Dickens also knew how to capture his audience. He used a fantastic plot that wove in and out. Even though his plot was almost cheesy, he managed to pull it off without to much \\"cheese\\" suspected. Though I thought this book had too many climaxes, if you think about its original form - serial - then you understand that he had to keep his readers interested. Dickens keeps the plot \\"writhing\\" until the very end where he had a most expected and cheesy ending. The ending seemed rushed and scrambled together. Out of the whole book spanning thirty some years the last eleven are on the last five pages. The plot as a whole was very good. The plot moved the characters along and changed them to be what they are at the end. The characters grew as you read it not only in age but in emotion and focus.Dickens characters are amazing. He captures a lot of emotions and kinds of people in one book. He grasps a boy's changing thoughts until he grows to be a man. The innocent, childish fears of Pip are so easily grasped, and Pip's relations with Miss Havisham completely change him into a self-centered man trying to woo and unlovable woman. He also shows the starkness of humanity when exploited by its own race. Even some of the lesser characters still show the variety of human expression like Joe's nobleness and Wemmick's eccentricism. In all the characters were amazing.As a whole the book is a masterpiece and classic for all generations. Great Expectations will always be close to my heart."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"First of all, in reference to the reviewer who seemed to think the title was inapropos, all I can say is that I hope that they didn't read the book, for such a lack of understanding would be pathetic. I digress. I am here to dispel some myths. Since this book is often assigned in school, and perceived as \\"important,\\" as another reviewer noted, I think a lot of people shy away from it and assume it will be boring or difficult to understand. Dickens' novels, however, work on multiple level. There certainly is important social criticism and a web of subtly laced motifs within this novel, but on the surface, it's just a good read. I read it on a whim and ended up staying up all night to finish it. So, don't dispel this novel and turn to the many vapid works available to you. One piece of advice, read the real ending before the changed ending (though the changed one will appear first). I felt that the original one was far better, more relevant, and sadly invalidated by the changed ending thrust upon me first.

That also made this book very interesting follow"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Probably one of the most memorable Dickens characters, Philip Pirrup is known to most readers as Pip, the 7-year-old boy whom his short-tempered sister raised by hand. Little Pip infers that he has sustained, from as early as his babyhood, a perpetual conflict with injustice. He has known, from the time when he can speak and discern his surrounding that his sister, in her fits of caprice and violent coercion, is unjust to him. It seems to poor Pip that all the endearments in life brushes by him or bypasses him altogether. Fate has ineluctably deprived him of the lightsome hours that make our childhood a time to be remembered like a happy dream through all our after life. The bright side of growing up with his sister's fits of spleen is Pip's friendship with his brother-in-law Joe, who not only has taken him into apprenticeship but sanctified the house Pip calls home that is otherwise sullied by his sister's temper.A chance but terrifying encounter with an escaped convict for whom he brings provisions pilfered from the kitchen cupboard changes the entire course Pip's life. But it is not until he meets the beautiful, cold-hearted and haughty Estella during a summon to a decaying Miss Havisham that he sets his mind to whittle away his coarseness and to become a gentleman, one on Estella's account. The sudden but timely generosity of a mysterious benefactor comes to assist his making of a gentleman and promises a handsome property. The prospect of great expectations not only immediately relieves him from his ordinary sphere of life and frees him from apprenticeship with Joe, but also concurs with his eagerness to abandon his humble origins.GREAT EXPECTATIONS thus follows Pip's new life under his fortune and depicts his education, new relationships, and development through adversity as he slowly dawns on the true nature of his great expectations. The new life does not come without a catch as he finds himself living in a state of chronic uneasiness respecting his perfidious behavior to Joe, whose interference in his life he now regards as disturbance. The more Pip basks in the favor, privilege, and conviviality that is concomitant of his fortune, the more his is convinced of a happier life derived from simplicity and fidelity that only Joe can offer. As he sidles closer to the truth about his benefactor's identity, a revelation for which he is not prepared struck him.GREAT EXPECTATIONS is a story of moral redemption with a prodigal son-like protagonist in the orphaned Pip. The tale is extremely straightforward but is woven with substantial issues he has to deal with. Eager to shred his humble roots, he promptly disavows family and friends at the prospect of a fortune. As the fortune loses its luster and eventually dissipates altogether, he confronts his own ingratitude and learns to love the man who both creates and destroys him, figuratively speaking. Dickens deftly validates Pip's redemption by showing that it produces good deeds as well as good works. This is especially worthy of merit because the novel is told in Pip's first person narrative. Mishandling of the narrative might render the whole tale unconvincing.The proof of Pip's redemption comes laden with good deeds rather than airy words: his clandestine acts of kindness in securing Herbert a partnership in business, and in securing Miss Havisham's respectable opinion of the long-suffering Matthew Pocket, and in his refusing to accept money from Miss Havisham, and most significantly in his love for the man whom has bequeathed him with the fortune."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book was reccomended to me by my mom for me to expand my reading tastes. I was maybe a little hesitant, but I began reading it, and was immediately pulled in by the compelling, quirky characters and the mind boggling plot.

When I first saw Uncle Pumblechook's name, I was immediately able to guess what sort of a person he was, same with Mr. Wopsle, Mr. Wemmick, Mrs. Joe Gargery, and more. The humor is subtle, but once you get the joke you'll be howling.However, Dickens is certainly not an author who says little when there is an opportunity to say more; in a nutshell, his writing is quite flourid. Ten pages can be a whole lot to get through, not because it is boring, but because it is full of complex words, sentences, and paragraphs, that you'll need a little bit of rest. I felt sometimes like reading it was like an excercise seminar for my mind. But don't let these few words discourage you, it's a great read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"...endless is the error of intimacy.Such is the story of &quot;Great Expectations.&quot; I have to say that Dickens totally floored me with this magical tale of love and pedestals. I don't even know what made me read it. I think I just found it in my mother's house amid throwaways in the attic. Oh no...this is NOT to be thrown away, this treasure of English literature. This is the reason why we read.Pip is an orphan with no prospects in sight. But one day, under the strangest of circumstances, he becomes the veritable ward of an unknown benefactor and hurtles toward the gentlemanly future of high living and culture. Along the way, he is placed in the almost daily charge of the bitter and rich shut-in Miss Havisham, guardian of the irresistable, yet bitchy Estella. Poor Pip spends a great deal of his days partaking in the education of a gentleman, doing the bidding of the witchy Havisham woman and pining after the girl who uses and abuses him. It sometimes seems like this high society training is a big freakin' mistake.Things heat up when he comes across the criminal Magwitch and doesn't turn him in to the authorities. From there on in the piece continues to fill the mind with limitless imagery. The writing style is a beaut and the characters continue to intrigue with every passing page, from the disgustingly prunish Miss Havisham to Pip's dim-witted, but thoroughly likeable father - a man he sadly comes to see as shameful as his education and training strengthens.This is a story of yearning and loss, guilt and foolish pride as one person after another gets a wish granted and regrets it or waits for a train that never comes in. Yet somehow the ending leaves behind a great feeling. This is among my favorite books ever."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I may be only a 6th grader, but you wouldn't believe how much I enjoyed this book. Charles Dickens having a poor childhood because of the little money his family earned, has written a miraculous book having to do with money. Charles Dickens makes his case for there being a potential for good and evil in everyone. I really enjoyed reading this book and if you are looking for a fabulous book to enjoy, I strongly reccomend you read this."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I love the cover of this edition. The painting seems almost perfect for Dickens novel.But on to the novel itself. \\"Great Expectations\\" was the first of Dickens' novels that I read and I had to read several more before I found another I liked anywhere near as much. It is a small work compared to \\"David Copperfield\\" and his other massive English comic novels. It is a much darker work, too with less of the comedic touch.Dickens published and/or edited several magazines and some of his novels were first written as serials to bolster flagging circulation, \\"Great Expectations\\" is one and it shows. The novel grabs you fast and has a story with many surprises and twists along the way. The one drawback to the earlier serializaztion is that the book probably has too many small climaxes and cliffhangersLike many of the other great novels of the 18th and 19th century a modern reader may well find it a little too full of long descriptive passages. I personally feel that it travels along fast enough that you won't notice.I feel a word or two may be necessary about coincidence in the novel, certainly some other reviewers here at Amazon have felt there was too much. The first thing that should be said is that Dickens readers would not have criticised the coincidence, at the time they had a much firmer belief in \\"fate\\" and would have felt that the coincidence showed how much of Pip's tale was fated to be. The other thing worth mentioning is that the coincidence is no less than one can find in quite a lot of modern television if you just explain the plot. We need to ask if the number of coincidences seems unnatural within the book and if the book works. My answer would be that this tale runs along at a fine pace, well written and well worth the read. The coincidence does not detract from the novel.I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants a good, classic read. As one of Dickens shorter works it is also a fine place to start."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As a student, I had to read this book as a requirement for my junior year summer reading. Being the largest book of them all, I reluctantly started on this one. However, after giving it the twenty-five page test, I found the book terribly addictive. Had I had a more generous time budget, I would have finished the book in two to three days. As it was, it took me over a month. The storyline, with Pip intertwined in a weird emotional triangle with one Miss Havisham and Estella, has the reader wondering &quot;Who is on Pip's side?&quot; and &quot;What the heck is going on with this Estella babe?&quot; The emotions Pip felt, the things he went through, and just the thought of actually having to go through what he did brings tears to the eyes (even mine, which had been dry for years). By reading this book, I even became more in-tune to my emotions. This novel is an excellent piece of literature for any language buff (Dickens is a sheer master of the English language), and for anyone who loves a good tearjerker. Happy reading!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great story written by a great author!

This novel contains a bevy of characters that the readers will find unforgettable. The haunting figure of Miss Havisham has stayed with me since my 10th grade literature class (almost 30 years ago) and my recent rereading of the novel brought her horrid existence into full view again. The plot has twists and turns and although I found myself having to stop reading and letting certain episodes sink into my understanding, the beauty and scope of the writing is truly remarkable. As a young student of Dickens, I resisted the long descriptions and difficult dialogue and I don't remember loving the book when I read it the first time. As an adult, however, my admiration for the novel is undeniable."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read Charles Dickens's book Great Expectations. This book is about a young boy named Pip. Pip lives with his older sister Mrs. Gargery who is married to a black smith named Joe. Early in the book Pip meets an escaped convict that was on the run. He may not know it yet but the convict will have a lasting affect on him. When Joe finds out about the convict he asks Pip to help the police catch him. After a quick battle the convict and his partner are caught. Later in the book Pip meets Miss Haversham whose cold ward Estella Pip adores. An unknown person pays for Pip to go to London and become a gentleman.Charles Dickens is a wonderful writer. The Great Expectations is a great example of Dickens writing power. Moby Dick and other books are just as well done. I enjoyed reading the Great Expectations it was a long and detailed story of adventure and affection. I hope you enjoyed reading it too."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I can only agree, a great book that is very nicely done and is easy to read. I like it, it is simply a classic everyone should have read!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This seems to be a very nice copy of the book, it is easy to read in its big font and looks nice aswell. :)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Yes, Dickens was paid by the word when writing this.Yes, this is a big bookYes, if you were forced to read it in school, you probably hatedYes, if you read it on your own at or after age 25... you probably loved it.I for one, thought this book was great, sure it was wordy, but it was not wordy in that \\"what the heck is he trying to say\\" way that gets many other wordy books (Crime and Punishment - though I blame the translators for that one).Short Summary: This is the story of Pip, starting from a young age after his parents and many younger siblings are deceased and he is being raised by his militant sister and her lovable but slightly dense husband, Joe. Pip has very little hope of a future other than an apprenticeship with Joe as a Blacksmith. Suddenly... doors start opening for Pip, and opportunities present themselves to him. He accepts but never knows who or why strings are being pulled in the background to open these doors for him. We follow Pip through his life as he accepts these opportunities, and they lead him down a strange but wonderful path of self discovery, maturity, and opening his eyes to the real world.The reason this book is so effective is because Pip is so real. We follow him through his blunders and successes, we dread his putting his foot in his mouth, saying the wrong things to Biddy, or Ms. Haversham, and we rejoice when he commits selfless acts and hate him when he commits selfish ones. It is my personal opinion that this book will have more of an affect on the late twenty year olds and up because by then you have suffered a bit, and made some of the same mistakes as Pip, you have wandered through finding your way in the world, and the confusion of who you are, wishing you were something else, loving what or who you cannot have, and figuring out what path to put your life on.The rest of the cast of characters is quite a collection of multifaceted, entertaining, and interesting people. Ms. Haversham is a favorite of many, so strange, so tortured, so heartless, and so intriguing... then we have Dear old Joe, so Simple, and mild, and encouraging. Joe's love is unconditional and unwavering. Biddy, is so loyal, so kind, and so honest, then you have her polar opposite, Estella. There are so many other characters that are interesting, fun to read about and that you will have strong feelings for one way or another.I highly recommend this book, even though it is over a century old, the language is not difficult to read (very little work required) and the plot and characters are stellar. True there are no explosions, but a book can be engaging with out them. Give it a try."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I agonized through this book in HS and have recently breezed through it. About 30 years have passed in between.What I was most struck by in my second reading was how relevant the story was to our own times. Child abuse and emotionally damaging relationships, celebrity lawyers, prison reform, the dangers of easy credit, how easily a person can dispose of their past identity. Dickens wrote about this 140+ years ago but he could have been writing about the present day. Yes, a reader has to warm up to the 19th century language, but once that happens, the characters and their emotions are so authentic and fully developed. I found myself so annoyed at Pip in the middle of the novel, I almost put it down. How could I possibly care about such an obnoxious young man. But I did care and cared more and more deeply as the book wound down. Pip's transformation was convincing because the reader sees how it occurs in small increments. In the end I took a deep breath and thought to myself, well, Pip, you finally grew up. It may not be the best book to force teenagers to read, but I hope mature readers will take it up and find the treasures inside."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is an incredible masterpiece of storytelling. Charles Dickens is witty and intelligent. He creates characters that you are able to warm to and he is able to sculpt a brilliant plot. Without putting in any spoilers i will let you know that the main character PiP, definitely got what he expected ! and he learnt something in the process - that character is far more valuable than status - even the status of being a gentleman !!\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was brought kicking and screaming to this story thanks to high school English Lit requirements but it ended up being my favorite of the term.

I read David Copperfield after, which was supposedly Dickens' most belove character, but I enjoyed GE much more. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is Charles Dickens' version of the poor kid fantasy. This is almost a fable, I would say. This is the kind of story that you hear over and over growing up in poverty. It is almost in the category of Robin Hood, but this is the real thing in the flesh and blood. The old man in the cemetery scene still plays over and over in my mind. I should have read everything written by Charles Dickens by now, but yet I haven't. I started A Tale of Two Cities a little while ago and I have it on my night stand. I think that I'll get back to it tonight. I don't know who beats Dickens in superb phrasing and style.

Charles Dickens' eloquent language enthrawls you and keeps you reading on. I have seen how some people find this hard to get through; I was 12 when I read it and I understood it perfectly and loved it. Others think it is too long - this just gives you more to enjoy. I also had to read it because I was told to (for school) and I just read with enjoyment without focusing on every little detail like others have (which in my view is the reason for their disliking.)

The characters are unforgettable and the story which starts out slow in the beginning grows very quickly. The book is about life, living and the disappointments that come with it. The novel seems to have a very sad and uneasy tone throughout it. And if you have right version of the novel you will be able to read Charles Dickens original ending for this novel.

I found that the reason I had such difficulties beginning it, was due to its monotonous and dull beginning. Once past that section, Great Expectations dramatically lifts. I found the whole idea of a women stopping her clocks and living in darkness due to unrequited love a little morbid, yet also slightly romantic, and I found myself disliking the main character with a vengence. Not his best, certainly, but still okay."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A word I hear spoken often today is: boring. I hear that word coming out of the mouth of many teenagers. We live in a society that is so bombarded with continual stimulation, that we expect to be entertained at every turn and get bored too easily if &quot;forced&quot; to read a classic book like Great Expectations. Many high school students would rather be doing something else than reading so it doesn't surprise me when I see all the reviews by teenagers who said they hated the book. I recommend that they read it again in 20 years after seeing the world."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Although Great Expectations is better-written than most contemporary novels (Miss Havisham alone makes the book worth reading and demonstrates Dickens' wonderful skill with characters), I fear that GE is most people's only contact with Dickens because it's short enough to assign for school. (So is A Tale of Two Cities, a great story, but not much like other Dickens works.) If you can stick with them, I recommend even more highly Dickens' Bleak House, Our Mutual Friend, David Copperfield, and Little Dorrit--they're long but they are great, well-written stories with fully developed characters and (sometimes mysteriously long) plot and description that turns out to be crucial (you get a hint of that in GE). Don't give up on Dickens; his works are classics for good reason."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Love it....Love it! I have been trying to find the book, but I guess an electronic copy works better since I will forever own it on my kindle!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Enough has been said about the book itself by others who are far more qualified--I've read it and I like it. I'll speak to the edition itself, because formatting of Kindle books (especially free ones) can be very hit and miss. The illustrated Kindle edition by Top Five Books is easy to navigate, formatted well, free of errors, and contains a variety of illustrations. It is free, and there is nothing about this version that recommends choosing an alternative."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is widely regarded as one of Charles Dickens' finest works and I have to agree; it is one of my favorites, second to A Tale of Two Cities. The story of a young boy's growth to manhood, and his rise to unexpected prosperity and subsequent fall, is strongly written and captivating. Great Expectations captures the attention from the first page and, unlike some of Dickens' other works, it never has a dull moment. Like all of Dickens' works, it is peopled with a large cast of unique and quirky characters whose relationships to each other, as the story unfolds, end up being as intertwined as a plate of spaghetti. Some of the scenes and characters in Great Expectations are downright bizarre; the scenes involving Miss Havisham and the Pocket family felt distinctly Alice in Wonderland-ish in their weirdness.What makes Great Expectations so strong is the main character, Pip. He is that rarity among Dickens' characters, one that has depth and more than one dimension and mood. He tells his own story and, as an adult reflecting back on his own childhood and adolescence, he reveals his own youthful selfishness with a poignancy that surely every listener can connect with. Haven't we all been Pip, selfish and unappreciative of the goodness of others and unworthy of their admiration?I did not listen to this particular audio edition, although I know that Brilliance Audio produces top-notch audio books and Michael Page is an excellent narrator. I highly recommend the edition I listened to, produced by BBC Audio. It is a no-frills production, but the narrator (Martin Jarvis) is outstanding. He truly has a gift for voices (I especially loved his rendition of The Aged), and adds color and personality to the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I enjoyed reading this book in high school and also enjoy watching one of the old B&W; movie versions if it happens to come on TV.

His nagging sister and weakling of a brother-in-law are raising him. He doesn't have much, yet is compelled to help an escaped convict with food and drink. (More out of fear than compassion, mind.) He knows no other way of life, so he doesn't expect anything... until he meets Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham is an old recluse who still mourns after the man who broken her heart on her wedding day. One day, she invites Pip over to \\"play,\\" and that is where he meets young and beautiful Estella. The pretty girl intrigues and irritates him in equal parts. Proud and cruel, she makes him feel like a nobody. And that is how his desires to become a gentleman emerge. So imagine his surprise when a secret benefactor grants his biggest wish, a stranger with \\"Great Expectations.\\" Pip soon moves to London, abandons his old acquaintances for new ones, and reunites with mean girl Estella, now older and more beautiful. Will he be good enough for her now?Great Expectations is my favorite Dickens novel. Granted, I have only read this one and Bleak House (I've also read A Christmas Carol and another novella of his), but it is my favorite one of the two. This novel contains beautiful storytelling, lots of irony and Dickens's signature eccentric characters and hilarious dialogue. This is my second time reading this after over a decade, and I enjoyed it more the second time around. (I enjoyed this as much as the other novel I read at the same time as this one, which, to my surprise, brought up Dickens and Great Expectations.) Pip is a wonderful character. He does, however, get on my nerves when he wants to be around people that to me aren't worth it. Estella is such a snob, a total beyotch, but I can see why Pip would want her to think well of him. One thing I've always found interesting is that Dickens always depicts lawyers as greedy and callous. Bleak House illustrates this even more. Perhaps Dickens disliked lawyers. Could his father's stay at a debtors' prison have to do with this? Well, one thing is clear: Great Expectations is a beautiful novel, one of the best out there, even with its altered ending. I've read both endings and like them both (though I prefer his original ending). Two endings are great because they give you a choice. Anyway, a great summer reread. I have A Tale of Two Cities and look forward to reading it soon."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I love listening to audiobooks while I work out and have a special fondness for the classics, so I was very excited by the excellent reviews this audio version received. I had read that each disk contained 90+ brief tracks, which is fine with me as I have never had a problem importing audiobooks into iTunes. Well, there is always a first time. I don't know what iTunes uses to find CD info or track names, but not a single disk came up identified as Great Expectations, nor did the tracks have any type of logical naming system. I had to type in a name for 93-94 tracks on every single disk (eg. disk01track01, etc).The audiobook itself is quite good of course, thankfully. I just need to warn those who plan to import for their iPod that it will not be a simple process. Better have a couple of hours to type. Had I known this would be a problem, I would not have purchased this version."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As usual with Dickens, improbable coincidences abound. They are artfully presented however and Dickens does offer one or two surprises.For one thing, the novel is quite violent. Dickens graphically describes one character dying from burns. He presents a ruffian or two. Even one of the better gentlemen manhandles his maid.Also as usual with Dickens, we find a full cast of memorable well-defined characters. Mr Jaggers, the lawyer to beat all lawyers, and his assistant Mr. Wemmick who never mixes business and home matters, except under exceptional circumstances. We find Miss Havesham a wealthy but bitter spinster left at the altar years before. We meet Joe Gargery, a wise well-meaning blacksmith who lovingly raises Pip, the novel's main character, taking him on as his apprentice. Pip leaves him when fortune mysteriously smiles on him. An unknown benefactor gives our hero a substantial income so that he may fulfill his Great Expectations and become a gentleman of means and of leasure.And there you have Pip in a nutshell: he leaves a loving home, a kind man and a good position to become a man of the world, a man about town, in short a bit of a parasite.But then to become a man of means is for Dickens to have attained heaven on earth and he only lets the truly good enjoy their fortune. Jaggers is rich and cannot be called good, at worst he is amoral, but he is a man of action. On the other hand the thoughtless and ungrateful Pip doesn't deserve heaven. Not just yet.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My only real complain about this bookis that Orlick seems to be an annoying intrusion. Both of the \\"Great Expectations\\" movies I saw deleted the role of Orlick, and I can't say I missed him. Along with \\"Oliver Twist,\\" \\"Great Expectations\\" was one of my father's favorites.Onto the text. Pip (who is still a child and a literary reincarnation of Oliver Twist)) has a frightening experience in a graveyard when the escaped convict Magwitch (kind of a literary reincarnation of Fagin) threatens him and demands a file and some food. When Pip goes to get these things, we meet his sister who is not so nice to him. Though her husband Joe is. (Undoubtedly, this tense marriage reflects Dickens's divorce.) Moving on, Pip delivers the file and food to Magwitch who is of course grateful. sadly, Magwitch is captured, but he remains grateful to Pip.Later, Pip meets the tragic Miss Havisham. Havisham was left at the altar, and she never quite forgave the male sex for this. Interestingly, she has no concept of time. She has friends who visit her on her birthday, they do not mention it. Havisham trains her adopted daughter Estella to hate all men. Pip continues to visit Havisham and Estella for sometime. Soon, some good news comes from lawyer Mr. Jaggers. Pip learns that he is to be trained as a gentleman. Pip knows that Jaggers is Havisham's lawyer, so he assumes this gift is from her. (Why not?)Pip is accompanied by Herbert Pocket who is the son of Miss Havisham's cousin. Herbert tells Pip of Havisham's tragic past. We are permitted some sympathy for her. Pip (who is falling love with Estella) knows that Estella resembles someone, but he can't quite place who.There is a sad, but true to life scene when Joe comes to visit Pip, and because this kind man is not so educated, he turns out to be an embarrassment to Pip. In a scene of self sacrifice, Joe decides to let Pip go his own way.Later there is a disturbing scene between Havisham and Estella. While we may feel sorry for Havisham, she tried to plant her hatred in Estella, and naturally, Estella could only take living for hate so long. The real drama is still to come. Pip finds out that his benefactor was indeed Magwitch. (The man from the graveyard!) While we may share Pip's horror to some extent, we later learn that Magwitch is a sympathetic character. Basically, Compeyson was a kind of Uriah Heep who manipulated Magwitch. To make matters worse, it is punishable by death for Magwitch to be in England.I don't want to give away the ending, but this is easily one of Dickens's greatest books."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"After reading a bunch of these reviews, I've come to the conclusion that this book should not be pushed on high school students or younger. It's almost sad to read a review from someone who just read the cliff notes. Come on now, do we really need to hear from you? This is my favorite Dickens novel so far, and though I haven't read them all, I loved everything about it. Though the ending is happy, it is by no means a Hollywood ending. Would recommend to any SERIOUS reader that wants to read authentic period prose and a great story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I thing Great Expectation is a great book in many way such as the Themes, the Character and the Writing Themes in this book are very important. They can easily relate to us today. The main point of the book that affection, loyalty and friendship are more important than social class, wealth. The character of Pip made me feel quite sad. He had a very difficult life but he can improve himself and become the gentleman finally. There are many character of this book that also made this book very interesting follow up."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"and I very nearly did.For the first half to three quarters I was utterly and completely amazed. The character of Miss Havisham is genius, and a character like none I have ever met before in literature. The images of her sitting corpse like in her decaying house will stick with me for all time. Everyone should read this book for this fascinating character.While the first part of the book delighted me with wicked satire, and dark humor, the last quarter of the book was too morally right for me. Every character saw the error of his ways, and strove to be a better person, and here the book lost much of the original feel it had going for it. I suppose maybe in Dickens' time, he couldn't get away with a book that did not have a morally uplifting ending.However, I say this is a must-read for the characters of Miss Havisham and the beautiful Estella alone. Also the lawyer Jaggers is a great character."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is filled with ambition, greed, cruelty, and love. It is one of the best books I have ever read in my high school years. Get entertained with Mr. Joe and her violence towards Pip and her husband Mr. Joe Gargery.Also, Pip travels to France to become a gentlemen, which is one of the best parts of this novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I wish that the book was shorter :( Especially because it's 387 pages and I have to write a report on it (10 paragraphs on 10 quotes from the story that I believe show the importance of the story in the next 10 days :( YUCK! However, it still hasa very interesting storyline that is very very detailed :D"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is one of Dickens's later novels, a work of his artistic maturity. The narrative is symbolic rather than realistic. Although, as in most of Dickens and in Victorian literature in general, the plot relies heavily on coincidence, it is acceptable here because the events are true to the internal, psychological, logic of the story.Great Expectations tells the story of Pip, a boy who starts as an orphan who moves on to apprenticeship in the business world of nineteenth-century England. Along the way, he falls in love with a girl from a wealthy family, and gains a mysterious patron.The book is heavy on character development and descriptive detail, but relatively light on action and suspense. The orphan Pip, the convict Magwitch, the beautiful Estella and her guardian, the embittered and vengeful Miss Havisham, the master lawyer Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick his secretive assistant - all play their part in this story which is a memoir, a mystery, and a romance.Great Expectations never loses sight of the social mishaps of the time and is often on the teacher's list in literature classics. Most people who read it will like it and will be able to identify with the characters, but impatient readers will drown in the details, extended descriptions and explanations, and deep characterizations."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens is to me the most obvious of writers. Most of his novels are to various extents semi autobiographical. Most are populated by people with amusing names who, aside from the main characters, seem to be caricatures more than humans who think and feel with any semblance of subtlety or complexity. Most are deeply concerned with social injustice and class struggle. Most are filled with plot twists, and almost all are very enjoyable reads. Dickens is nothing if not a master storyteller who loves to manipulate the emotions of his reading public. His stories are theatrical more than novelistic. It is no wonder he is the most popular author of the Victorian age, and maybe second only to Shakespeare in the history of English literature.GREAT EXPECTATIONS and DAVID COPPERFIELD are my 2 favorite Dickens novels, probably because they both have more overtly autobiographical elements than his other works. I also love BLEAK HOUSE. GREAT EXPECTATIONS is the story of Pip.. of his rise and fall, and ultimate redemption. This novel gives us a clear window into the heart and mind of Dickens himself. The story itself held my interest from beginning to end, had important themes to explore, and despite it's lack of introspection in examining personality issues, made you care about the main characters. Dickens was one of the great writers but he is not my favorite novelist of that period. I prefer George Eliot's style as a novelist. To me, Dickens power was in connecting emotionally with his audience and it must have been some experience hearing him tell his marvelous tales in person."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is an excellent coming-of-age book with which many people will be able to relate. I will admit, the beginning was rather grueling, but looking back, I am glad I finished the book. Dickens has a fabulous vocabulary and an excellent sense of people. The characters are dynamic and quite various. I would recommend this book to other scholars."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is a masterpiece of fiction. Until you read the book you don't realize just how influential this story is in western literature."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations didn't meet my expectations. I was a little bored throughout the begining and middle of the story. I think what kept me reading on was the desire to read a \\"classic\\" (I usually read biography or history).I continued reading because I wanted to find out if Magwitch would meet his daughter. In addition, I was interested in Pip's strong desire to be a gentleman. Other than help his friend in business and dawdle about thinking about an emotionally deadweight chic, Pip didn't seem interested in obtaining a job or taking real advantage of his opportunities. I'll give Pip credit for helping his friend attain stature in business, and eventually going on to operate with his friend after losing his unearned wealth. But the lazy part is 19th century gentleman, huh?Maybe Dicken's purpose was to show the benefits of wealth and the slothfullness of one who didn't have to work himself to attain it. Maybe it hit me at the wrong time, as my fiancee just took a hike and left me after I just sold my house (and now have no place to go). Trust you me, I won't be wasting my life away like Ms. Havisham though. I haven't reached gentlemanly status and need to continue working . . . .I've only read Charles Dicken's Nicholas Nickleby and Oliver Twist in addition to \\"Great Expectations\\". Of these, I thoroughly enjoyed Nicholas Nickleby. In the future, I'll look for Kates and Madellines and not Estellas. Great Expectations was a tougher read for me as these characters just simply didn't entice my interest too much. Of course, maybe I needed a brighter read . . ."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I first read this novel for a class. Years later, I picked it up again and reread it. It's excellent. The characters are very interesting. Pip who loves the cold-hearted Estella. It is good to see how their characters interact and how desire is lasting. You got to feel bad for poor Pip. Miss Havisham is the most interesting of all, still in her wedding gown after all these decades. A must read. It's a fairly long novel, but well worth the time it takes to read it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I thought the book Great Expectations was a pretty good book. At parts of the book it was good but then there were those parts where I didn't like it in all books there are usually those parts. I though it was easy to understand.For the major themes I didn't always understand it all. Some parts I never really caught on to were at the beginning when he was a little kid then he had grown up I never caught on to that right away. But when I finally did it was good and interesting to find out.I do think Charles Dickens did bring the story alive. I think also he should have had so many characters because then it was hard to understand who was who and where did they come from. At some points I wish he would have had explained himself more then what he did. I got mixed up so much with all the characters it was hard to keep track of them because they were in the story and then they were gone then all of a sudden they came back. But out of it all it was a good book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Astonishingly this book joins passion and soul with dreams, i bought this book since i saw the movie and i just tought i needed to go deep inside, as a personal review, i've always enterteined the vogus idea to get an analogous life experience so this story might be great for those who dream with going ahead, this story is also helpful to find out for certain that you can see your dreams comming true from where you're least expecting."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Although I rated this book four stars, I wish there was a three and one-half star rating- that's what I'd really like to give it. Dickens is one of my favorite novelists, and normally I am passionately enthusiastic about his books, but I could only manage to get slightly warmer than lukewarm about this middling novel. Overall, it wasn't bad- it is, in fact, one I wouldn't mind rereading in future. However, I didn't think it was quite as good as many of Dickens' other works. The plot, while not bad or boring, was not as suspenseful and intriguing as that of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, as slowly but enjoyably developing as that of &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, or as wonderfully tantalizing and gripping as that of &quot;Bleak House.&quot; The characters, while not hopelessly mediocre or bland, were not nearly as likeable and were much more forgettable than those of other Dickens novels. Although Pip was not a bad protagonist, I did not enjoy or like him as much as I did, say, Oliver Twist or Esther Summerson. Likewise, his character development, while interesting, was not, to my mind, as good or as interesting as that which is undergone by David Copperfield, a hero who I liked better than, and with whom I could sympathize more than with Pip. Estella and Miss Havisham, while interesting, did not add much to the plot, and when it comes to criminals those of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, are, in my opinion, more memorable, and in many ways, more sympathetic than Magwitch. While not a thoroughly forgettable or bad book, I wouldn't reccommend it to first time Dickens readers- it may discourage them from reading more. Wait until you've read one or two of his better novels, such as &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; or &quot;Bleak House.&quot; Then come to this one- only don't come with expectations that are TOO terribly great."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"this book was good and had many irony. its just didn't like it much because was boring for the early part.only the suspence kick up it was really nice to read..but the ending i didn't like cause it left me knowing that estela won't get with pip"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Reading for me is boring, but I was not bored for one second while reading this book. Throughout the whole book Dickens kept my attention and had me wanting more. From the very first page when Pip encounters the convict, I could not put the book down. I had to find out what was going to happen. Also when Pip's sister, Mrs. Joe, was attacked I was guessing to the very end to find out whom it was who attacked her. This is by far one of the best books I have read. All in all, I recommend you read this book. I'm sure that you will enjoy it as much as I have."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This novel is excellent. Although it starts out slowly, it begins to pick up in the middle.

Seeing Pip grow up, I watched him go through a transformation. Once an unitellegent child, he grew up to be an intelligent young man. The book deals with child abuse, social status, and family and friendships. I saw how a sister took in her little brother to raise him and keep him from dying like the rest of their family.

I felt bad for Pip because he was living as an orphan with an abusive sister. That must have been very exhausting mentally and physically. I admire Pip because he is very young and the fact that he has to travel,work, and take care of his sick sister, he is a very good rolemodel. I also admire him because if a ex-convict came up to me, I would be so scared that I would run away. The fact that he trusted Magwitch with a lot of things really amazed me. Pip has gone through a lot of things with his family and his own personal life in a considerable amount of time and I admire him for that. Hopefully him and Estella get together because Pip is a very nice guy and I think that they would have a lot of fun together."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"if there is ever a person i feel sorry for: it's Pip. we have all looked up to the pretty girl (or boy) at school, and had that utter pain of knowing that it is impossible. pip is the patron saint of the rejected male.i have two problems with this book: one is the deus ex machina-esqe conclusion in the final 50 pages, where everything falls into place. when i say everything falls into place, i don't mean neatly. the ending is anti-climatic and pensivly moody. but things seem to work out in a weird way that i have some problems withsecondly- the whole plot of the book is one whole huge coincidence.with that said... i didn't mind the two faults whatsoever. there are few books that i have enjoyed so thuroughly as GE.anyone that has read Dickens in the past already knows about his prowess as a writter. and for people who have yet to read him (or highschool students who have just recieved their copy of GE, with a frown) will realize why he has remained contemporary, and still enjoyed.when i was in highschool, and i had to read a tale of two cities... my teacher exhausted the book, going over every minute symbol that was in it... in the end, it bored me. so, with that said, i love two cities regardless cause i read it independantly, and enjoyed it on my own pace. i recomend to all highschool studends to read the book at their own pace and bugger what your teacher tells you (yeah, i'm a good rolemodel). school tends to destroy great works of literature, don't fall into the trap.... whooops i thought this was a book review...great book, beautiful characters, a classic and well worth 5 stars... nuff said(i shed a tear or two at the end)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When his magazine, All the Year Round, began failing due to an unpopular serial, Dickens was forced to begin publishing installments of a story of his own. The resulting work, Great Expectations, was published weekly from December 1, 1860 to August 3, 1861. This was his second semi-autobiographical work, but where David Copperfield was a confident expression of faith in middle class values, Great Expectations offers a bleaker view of whether those values will lead to happiness. In fact, Dickens own marriage had just come to an end after many unhappy years. Indeed he had recently changed the name of the magazine from the more bucolic Household Words. Despite, or because, of this ambivalence, Great Expectations became one of his greatest achievements.Pip, a boy of the marshes, is being &quot;raised by hand&quot; by his shrieking harridan of an older sister and her seemingly doltish husband, the blacksmith Joe Gargery. One day, while visiting his parents' gravesite, Pip is accosted by an escaped convict who demands that he bring him a file and some &quot;wittles&quot;. When the convict, Abel Magwitch, is later captured, he accepts the blame for stealing the file and food before being carted back to prison.Shortly thereafter, Pip is invited up to Miss Havisham's manor house to play with her beautiful ward Estella. Miss Havisham's life came to a halt when she was jilted at the altar, all clocks are stopped at the hour of her betrayal, the feast lies rotting on tables &amp; she wanders about in the decaying wedding gown. Estella is to be the instrument of her revenge upon men.Eventually, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; are settled upon Pip when a secret benefactor sets up a trust in his name and sends him to London to be educated and become a gentleman. Pip assumes, and Havisham allows him to believe, that she is his benefactress and that he is being elevated to a position that will make him worthy of Estella.As Pip rises in society, he leaves Joe behind, despite the many kindnesses Joe had shown him growing up. He becomes a shallow arrogant middle class climber. So he is stunned when he discovers that he is actually benefiting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being transported. Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger. Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises. Eventually, with Magwitch's recapture and death in prison and with his fortune gone, Pip ends up in debtors prison, but Joe redeems his debts and brings him home. Pip realizes that Magwitch was a more devoted friend to him than he ever was to Joe and with this realization Pip becomes, finally, a whole and decent human being.Originally, Dickens wrote a conclusion that made it clear that Pip and Estella will never be together, that Estella is finally too devoid of heart to love. But at the urging of others, he changed the ending and left it more open ended, with the possibility that Estella too has learned and grown from her experiences and her wretched marriages.This is the work of a mature novelist at the height of his powers. It has everything you could ask for in a novel: central characters who actually change and grow over the course of the story, becoming better people in the end; a plot laden with mystery and irony; amusing secondary characters; you name it, it's in here. I would rank it with A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield among the very best novels of the worlds greatest novelist.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Now I'll admit that when all is said and done I am a newborn to the world of so called classic literature. So when I was assigned to read Great Expectations for English class, I'll admit to being a little more than skeptical. However once I began to read the novel I discovered something. The novel wasn't that hard to understand. While it did take a while to get fully immersed in the novel, once you were in you really wanted to see the novel to its resolution. The prose was easy to understand, and the plot crossed generations easily. Maybe classics just have a bad reputation with the younger generation, but Great Expectations went a long way to helping to shorten that gap. I think the driving force that leads me to recommend this book is the fact that we all have great expectations of life, and that we all dream of improving our status in the world. People will always share a common bond, and in this novel Dicken's truly shows us that."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is one of my favorite Dickens books, detailing a lifelong love story between Pip and Estella. So sometimes the circumstances aren't realistic - so what? TV shows these days aren't either. Pip is a likeable character, and the various other characters represent real forces in our society. This is a great novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Each time that I read Great Expectations I'm left wondering whether or not Pip would have been happier if he had never been made the gift of \\"great expectations.\\" More importantly, would he have been a better man if he had remained apprenticed to his blacksmith brother-in-law Joe rather than having been sent to London to be trained in the ways of a gentleman?Great Expectations is a Dickens cautionary tale in which the author warns his readers of what can so easily happen to a person when given the opportunity to \\"better himself\\" by leaving his home, family and friends behind for education and fortune-seeking in the big city. As soon as word reached the local townspeople around whom Pip had spent his early years that a fortune was soon to be his, Pip found himself treated with respect and awe by the very people who had had little time for him in the past other than to chastise his behavior and relationship with the sister who was raising him \\"by hand.\\" Their \\"boy\\" became \\"sir\\" overnight it seemed.But sadly, after arriving in London and seeking to impress his new friends and colleagues, Pip decided that those who loved him most were an embarrassment to his future prospects and he only occasionally felt any guilt about his lack of contact with them. It is only when Pip's future prospects shockingly take a turn for the worse that he seeks the comfort of the family that he left behind.Along the way, Dickens fills Great Expectations with some of the most memorable characters in British literature history. There are Miss Havisham, the spinster who never recovered from being jilted at the altar; Joe, the blacksmith and Pip's brother-in-law who never stopped loving Pip as a son no matter how much Pip neglected him over the years; Estella, the beautiful young woman whom Pip has loved since they were small children but who has been raised by Miss Havisham to give her heart to no man; Herbert, Pip's best London friend, a truly good man who both benefits from Pip's help and who eventually offers Pip a new future of his own; and, of course, Magwitch, the colorful escaped criminal whom Pip meets in the first pages of the book.This is one of those books that I read every few years because re-reading it is like visiting an old friend after too long an absence. As the old memories come back, it's like I've never been away."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"First of all (as I like to say!) I'm no smarter than you and I thought this book was great, that said, this book is not THE easiest to read in that it does take a while for things to get really interesting.

If you're a serious reader - and I expect you are if you willingly attempt this book - then there shouldn't be a problem getting into it. Dickens is far easier to read then Dostoevsky or Tolstoy or even Hawthorne or James.You have to understand that you can't skim the classics. If you do, then you miss out on subtle prompts and hints. In fact, any good book should have some buried clues, clues that if you don't pick up, the plot will be confusing or pointless. That's what makes these kinds of books great, the challenge and the reward, plus the wonders they do for your vocabulary.If you want books you can skim over before bedtime and still pick up the plot and characters, that's fine, not everyone needs to be a serious reader. However, don't go around bashing great books that you shouldn't be reading, because you might turn off somebody who will really enjoy it.If you have a real problem with the book, mention the plot, or accurately describe why you don't like the writing style."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is truly one of Dickens' best works. It is long but there is so much to offer - rich, memorable characters, universal themes, exciting adventure, unrequited love, murder, mystery, and revenge. The plot touches heavily upon social class distinctions, education, economics and crime and punishment. Issues that still resonate with the modern reader today.Great Expectations, famously, begins in a cemetery where the orphaned Pip is visiting the graves of his parents. There he encounters an escaped convict from a nearby prison ship who is to change his life though Pip will not understand fully how until many years later. As the book continues he meets many surreal characters with perhaps the most memorable being Miss Havisham, the crazed jilted bride, whose manipulations in regard to Pip and her adopted daughter,Estella, break Pip's heart and leave Estella a shallow, empty woman. Another one of Dickens more famous characters appearing in Great Expectations is Pip's guardian, Jaggers, the successful and possibly compulsive obsessive, attorney. Less well known but equally memorable appearances are made by Pip's loyal friend Herbert Pocket whose unusual family provide comic relief and social satire, Pip's brother-in-law the kind but uneducated Joe Gargory, Mrs. Joe, Pip's shrewish sister who is raising Pip \\"by hand\\", Jagger's assistant Wemmick who neatly divides his home life and his work life plus a host of others. Life in 19th century England - both London and it's small towns - are masterfully kept alive by Dickens' sure contemporary descriptions."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My first complete Dickens book was \\"A Tale of Two Cities.\\" Since that was an idealistic romance novel, this book rather surprised me with its portrayals of the darker side of human nature. Instead of heart-wrending sacrifices, I found painful ingratitude. Instead of perfect heroines, I found scheming, insensitive women. This book was not anything I expected with regards to characterization and theme. However, I would have to say this book exemplifies human nature much, much better. It was not a very entertaining read at all, but the craftsmanship and word employment simply could not be better. This book may not turn one's daydreams on paper, but it is a solid, landmark work of literature."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My daughter had to read \\"Great Expectations\\" for 9th grade English,she was short of time and a slow reader.

Well read and helped keep her interest."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I wanted to revisit this \\"classic\\", having read it in high school and remembering it fondly. I was not disappointed, for I found the story more applicable to my life now, ten years later, than at the time of my first reading. Back then, it seemed a good yarn - lots of fun characters, intriguing plot twists - a grand adventure. Upon rereading, I was able to absorb the story while thinking about my own \\"coming of age\\", and weigh the morality of Pip's universe. At the same time, my original impressions were not misguided - the moral/societal questions Dickens explores are layered into the fun characters and strong plot development.In addition, there are some interesting \\"reading group\\" questions at the back, as well as some interesting commentary by various authors since the time of the original publication. For that reason, I would recommend this edition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Above all what I loved about this book was how all the characters came together and were somehow related in some surprising way. The book was very well written. I had to read this book for school and I'm glad that I was forced to or I might never have chosen to read this book. The language was very understandable unlike some other books I've read from that time period. I really recommend it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"One of the great novels in the English language. It would be presumptuous of me to add more.

Of all the novels I've ever taught my students these 12 years I've been in Education, this novel, Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens, is by far the best! It is easy to read and understand, and it holds students' attention until the very end. The plot is like a roller coaster and all the characters seem to be connected in some way. The end of each chapter leaves the reader in suspense and anxious to continue reading. Although the setting of the novel takes place in 19th century England, the novel's themes and the characters' experiences seem to relate to all social classes, races, and both genders. Even my students at an inner-city high school in Atlanta rush home to read ahead to find out what will happen to Pip next!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Yet another success by Charles Dickens, this book is sure to warm hearts of both children and adults everywhere.

If you want a cozy, enticing book to read by the fire on a snow day, go ahead, and read the powerful story: \\"Great Expectations.\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"\\"Great Expectations\\" by Charles Dickens is a very haunting novel. While the book portrays England as dreary, in a strange way it makes England seem like a nice place to live in. 1800s England as depicted in the novel has a lot of poor people. But the people seem nicer and more innocent minded then people are these days. Even the bad guys in the story seem more innocent minded then people these days.The book begins with a young child called Pip visiting his parents grave only to be stopped by an escaped convict who asks him for food and a file. Pip goes and gets these things secretly to avoid getting in trouble with his sister. Later on the convict is captured and before he is led away, he lies that he stole food from Pip's aunt's cupboard to Pip's uncle Joe and this saves Pip from getting in trouble for taking the food. After that, Pip gets a strange opportunity at a house called Satis House owned by a Miss Havisham. She pays his aunt to have Pip play with a beautiful girl called Estella. Later on, Pip is told by an aquaintance called Mr. Jagger that he has great expectations. He tells him that a secret benefactor has provided for Pip to be educated. Pip, jumps at this opportunity. He goes to live in a rented room and is educated all the time not knowing who is providing him with the sums to be educated. He continues to think about the beautiful girl Estella who shuns his advances.\\"Great Expectations is a very haunting novel. With the book, I got a full view of what life was like in England in the 1800s. The character Miss Havisham is really scary. Her house with its room where there is a decaying wedding cake is almost like a haunted house. The book contains no supernatural elements though and that's what is so amazing, that Charles Dickens manages to make it scary without putting ghosts or monsters in it. Miss Havisham was clearly a woman with a lot of potential who ruined her life because she couldn't get over a romance that went sour. I felt bad for her and hope people learn from her example.The character that really caught my attention was Estella. I have had experiences in my own life where I had a crush on a girl who didn't have a crush on me and so I knew what Pip was going through and related to his character in this respect. Its when they're young that men are haunted most by those feelings for a girl or a woman, it is clear though that Pip needs to move on and find another girl to get in a relationship with.All in all, Great Expectations is a good fast read even though it is not an adventure novel, which makes the novel even more amazing."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Just a wonderful enthralling read! I enjoyed this so much! I read this in high school but decided to read it again. I just did not appreciate the story line or the characters back as a teenager. I am so glad I decided to re-read this again! I am now going to work my way through more of Dickens novels. His character development is wonderful! The story line has twists and turns to keep the pages turning! You just don't know what you are missing by not reading this novel! Yes, I recommend!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"There are few if any authors who could create such a variety of wonderful characters as Dickens has done in his many novels and short stories. They touch you and remain with you - even becoming icons. This is true in all Dickens novels, and it is no less true in this work. How bizarrely wonderful is Miss Havisham with her tattered and yellowed bridal gown and half century old wedding cake? Who else could come up with such a marvelous character?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm not going to say much about the story, because you probably already know it. I first discovered the book over 40 years ago in high school.But I really appreciated this edition. As a forward, there is an overview of the book, pointing out things to help you understand them when you read them. It also clarifies some of the points made. It doesn't say anything about Pip suffering from depression, but I think he does, which contributes to his low self-esteem.Then at the back of the book, there is a section of notes, including the original ending. There are also notes on some of the words used or articles mentioned in the book.All in all, this was a wonderful read and look forward to reading it again."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is hailed as a one of the great masterpieces in literature and for good reason. However, it does drag in the beginning and current audiences may not be able to fight through to reap the rewards this book gives out. Also, the language used in the book is not used currently in use and may throw off some readers. Midway threw the book I was enjoying Great Expectations, but disappointed in the pace and flow and ready for it to quicken. But it did and I was enthralled with the final 200 pages."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Pages are all different size and roughly cut. A bit rubbish, really. This is not a reflection on the narative, which of course is well reviewed in general."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was forced to read this book in my English class this year, and I almost died. For a more thrilling read, try a dictionary or a phone book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens ReviewI think that this book was a little bit advanced for us to be reading there was way too many different characters and way to many character changes. If he would have kept the book simpler, it might have been a little bit easier to read and understand. It also would have helped if the author would have only given some of the characters one name instead of giving some people two names making it look like they were a completely different person, that was very confusing.It was good at the end when things finally started coming together and making a little more sense. One of my favorite parts was when Pip finally realizes that he is not meant to be a gentleman, and that he was meant to be a blacksmith. The major themes were the only thing that really helped me understand the book. I really didn&#65533;t like this book very much because I couldn&#65533;t really relate to it, therefore, I couldn&#65533;t understand it. I think that we should have read a book that was more modern and practical."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is my least favorite book. I was forced to read it for freshman honors English, or I would have stopped reading it. It has a good plot, but because Dickens was paid by the word, he added too many useless details. I really didn't enjoy dinner scenes that lasted for 17,000 chapters without revealing anything remotely important. However, the way the characters intertwined was fascinating. If you want to get the interesting part of the book, read the cliff's notes. I've also heard it's a little less mind-numbing on tape. Only read the book if you're going to be quizzed on it the next day. I don't know if all Dickens is this bad, but I'll not read any more of his books until I'm forced to for my next English class."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations was not that great of a novel.

Charles Dickens wrote a novel about a boy who had a hard life, and in the end he was happy....Big Deal!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is not a book most people should read. I wouldn't call it horrible but it is intensly boring. Dickens takes a whole chapter to say something anybody could say in a sentence. Im in the eighth grade and am required to read it.

I only recommend this for reader lovers, highly advanced people in litereture and who can understand something not written in english."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book was very dull and boring. I was made to read it in English and I soon realized not far in that it was very boring. It's not a good book for highschool readers. It is written in very dull and boring text. I mean the theme is great and all but the language and storyline stinks. I would not ever read this book again and if I had a choice to get this book or nothing i wouldn't get anything. It isn't a book to buy but for some odd reason is still have the one left from school. This book is quite possibly the worst book i ever read. If you are really interested in this book then go see the stupid movie or rent i from the library."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Do not read this book. It is a form of painful torture! If you have to read it for school buy the Cliff Note. Or if your instructor is on to that kind of thing, at least listen to the audio book. At all costs do not read this book! Take it from someone who knows."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"You won't be needing a bookmark with this novel- more like a pillow! I read this my freshman year of high school, maybe I was just too young to understand it and appreciate it, but I could not read the whole thing without falling asleep. After reading half the book, I read the cliff notes and actually found them more interesting than the novel itself. Unless you are suffering from insomnia, I wouldn't buy it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to read GE for my freshmen honors English class, and I thought Lord of the Flies was bad! Dickens takes 1 paragraph to convey an idea that could have been said in 1 sentence! Many of the vocabulary is just out of our time, and take the fun out of the story. Unless you have heaps of time and patience, I recommend that you stay away from this &quot;book&quot;."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I did not have \\"great\\" expectations after reading some of Mr. Dickens other work (see my review of \\"Tale of The Two Cities\\"). But someone told me they at least made a movie about this one so I figured I may as well give it a shot.Well lets just say that I wont be seeing the movie but I will admit that this one is at least better then the other book because it is just thick enough to balance out this wobbly dresser I have when I weged it under one of the legs.A better effort!

They are going back to the classics. I never received the Great Expectations.The computer said it was sent but never showed up on my Kindle. I have a Kindle and I have also ordered products from my computer. I somehow found myself with two (2) accounts with Amazon. I could order books for my Kindle with one account and anything else with the other account. I have tried to straighten this out twice. The result of the last time was to close my Kindle account and the loss of all my books on my Kindle. I still am unable to order from my Kindle and now am also unable to order Kindle books from my computer. Which makes my Kindle completely useless, just a piece of garbage.While I'm on the subject I recently ordered a book and received an E mail saying the bank refused to honor the credit card number. Some time ago I had notified Amazon of a new number that the bank had issued. They had gone back and used the old number. I straightened that out and then I received an E mail saying the Book was undeliverable and Amazon was issuing a refund (the address was right). I may never receive that refund because they keep going back and using the old credit card number.I will never order anything from Amazon again."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book has a good story concept and Dickens writes well...but the story would have been alot better had he not been paid by the word. His lengthy descriptions of mundane tasks serve to break the pacing of a novel that already barely dredges along."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am in the seventh grade and we had to read this book in literature. Thanks to a great teacher, we were able to get through this book without too many difficulties; however, I would not recommend this book to anyone who does not want to invest a while in reading it! I took us the whole second semester to finsh this book, doing most of the reading at home. While most everyone was engrossed in the storyline, it was like pulling teeth to actually read! I really enjoyed the story, but I would raher just remember the story than refresh my memory by rereading it because, face it, the story is just too long!P.S.Since I feel this is such a great story, instead of reading the book, might I recommend watching the movie?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"In the first twenty or thirty pages, I was pleasantly surprised by Dickens's humor and had great expectations for his storytelling and prose-writing talent.I mean he is hailed as one of the greatest literary giants of English literature, as well as one of the most popular novelists of his time.But alas, my great expectations were dashed mercilessly, and I found myself - not unlike how Pip finds himself in the last portion of the novel - banging my head against the hard, boundless boredom that permeated the first 300 pages of non-drama, non-action, and non-story whose only saving grace was that it was not endless.In the beginning, Dickens sustains the story with action, and there's nothing wrong with that as it makes the story more engaging. But aside from that in the first interminable and insufferable two stages of \\"Pip's Great Expectations\\" that span exactly 300 pages, I was thoroughly disappointed in Dickens. Other than Pip getting rich all of a sudden, NOTHING happens: no desire, no real conflict, no gaps, no turning points.As far as the story is concerned, the 300 pages is crap.I said it. Don't gasp.The story finally, finally, finally picks up when Pip finds out the identity of his benefactor, goes through rather inexplicable mental ordeals about accepting the truth along with free money and sentimental outbursts with his \\"dear friend\\" Herbert about pretty much everything, followed by an incredibly maudlin confrontation with the guilt-stricken Ms. Havisham and a final showdown with the villainous Orlick into whose clutches Pip idiotically falls with a stupid letter that gives him little reason to risk the whole grand escape plan he and Herbert hatch for the next day.My conclusion: this book is overrated.Why is it that academics pick these boring books that can't tell stories as part of the western canon? I love reading classics, thanks, but THIS?The book displays a glaring lack of storytelling talent, psychological insight, and restraint. His prose is dense, sprawling, and unseemly as sentences are connected by ugly semicolons and don't flow beautifully at all. The scenes are more told than shown to the detriment of the flow of the story, and characters burst out into mawkish sentiments left and right.Yuck.People are irresistibly drawn to anything related to themselves. I have a sneaking suspicion that the academics who bill this book as \\"most fascinating\\" and \\"greatest and most sophisticated work\\" see THEIR prominent characteristic in it.Cloying, verbose, mediocre at best in the story composition, and irresistibly boring for the first 300 pages, it's \\"most fascinating\\" in the perplexing literary status it garnered over the years, \\"greatest\\" in its unnecessary length,and \\"most sophisticated\\" in the exquisite boredom it creates at that threshold pitch that is above sleep-inducing but below engaging.I won't be reading another Dickens in a long time.Read something else and save your time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm a senior in high school and was asked to read this book for my AP English 12 class.

That is not entirely true. I am in seventh grade. I not only loved the book, I understood it too. I have done character analyses (for instance: Bentley Drummle had a troubled childhood) and critisized Pip's character. My mom insists that he's a &quot;loser&quot; - but, then again, she never did have that much insight into character. The poor guy is in love so he can hardly see straight! Anyway, I don't pretend that I'm average, because I'm not. But I enjoyed it and understood it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It's just too, too bad that no one reads this anymore. It is a timeless story of a young man (love-stricken from young childhood) growing to adulthood by means of a mysterious benefactor. Mr. Jaggers, John Wemmick, Biddy, Matthew and Belinda Pocket, Bentley Drummle, the Aged Parent, and Miss Skiffins are just a few of the absolutely marvelous characters that Dickens created for his story. And how could I forget Estella Havisham, the object of Pip's (christened Phillip) affection? Mr. and Mrs. Joe get a fair part of the story, and they are both delightful - one, because she is so horrible, and the other, because he is so good. A few of the more minor characters (the aformentioned Miss Skiffins is one) such as Trabbe's boy and The Avenger are superb even though they may only speak a few words. If I could give it ten stars, I would!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is Dickens' 3rd last novel, and nothing indicates that he was running out of steam. While this lacks (in my opinion) the energy of &quot;Dombey and Son&quot; (1848), &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1850), &quot;Bleak House&quot; (1853), or &quot;Hard Times&quot; (1854), it is still a phenomenal piece of literature. Pip is an interesting creation. First we see him as a small child who is victimized by his sister. His brother in law Jo (while not too bright) never approves of Pip's abuse. It is interesting that Dickens wrote this troubled marriage scene soon after his own divorce! It is also painfully tragic when Pip starts to make his way into the world and he has to realize that the kind hearted but simple Jo has to take a back seat to his success. Jaggers offers some welcome comical touches. It is interesting that Pip becomes victimized by a legitimate colleague Orlick and as it turns out, the old thief was his benefactor. (In my opinion the old thief was a literary reincarnation of Fagin.) To this day, I have never forgotten the chills when I discovered that the old thief in the early part of the novel was his benefactor. So we have domestic quarrles, true to life tragic events, strong images, comical touches, and surprise events!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I reallly liked this book, though it made me tired to read it and I could not have any distractions while I read, I am really glad I did. This book was a good challenge if you stick to it. The book all comes together at the end if you keep reading. The characters are really deep. My teacher says the best thing about Great Expectations is it has a twisted plot line and the worst thing about Great Expectations is that it has a twisted plot line. Overall, I enjoyed the book, except the last two chapters. I believe Dickens got tired of writing the book and desided to end the book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is superb. Everything about it is very real to life (unlike much of Dickens' other novels). Though it may be hard to comprehend, it doesn't take a genius to understand the themes of this book. I'm not going to spoil it for anybody, but believe me, the themes plays into everybody's life, including love, money, and heritage. I also recommend Catcher in the Rye if you're into the types of books that make you stop and ponder."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to read Great Expectetions for school, at first it seemed like the worst book ever written, it was boring, confusing, and seemingly pointless. But, of course that was before I finished it and fully understood what Dickens was tying to convey. the whole book is a mystery, only in the very end do you finally find everything out. Note: if you are going to read the Cliffs Note version of the book (which i highly recommend you do) do not read the character summaries, because that will kill the whole book for you. Believe it or not, this is probabaly the only classial book with enough suspense to compete with the modern thrillers. Oh, and by the way, if you don't have to read it for school, I highly recommend you listen to the audio tape."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Those who have known the whole constitution of true art will assign to its realm Great Expectations.

The Bible, Tolkien's books, and Great Expectations are the greatest I have yet to encounter."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"After having a very diffiult time enjoying A Tale of Two Cities, which I found to be unappealing, austere, and excessively verbose, I was prepared to denounce this book as well. However, it is far too good to heap words like &quot;boring&quot; upon simply because it is long and involved. The autobiographical narration lends it a personal quality far more appealing than that of A Tale of Two Cities, and above all Dicken's empathy for his characters is apparent. The branching subplots weave together seamlessly as the novel progresses (Unlike some people I'm not going to spoil the ending for everyone). Even if you've been turned off by Dicken's before, give it a chance."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"One of the best books I've read to date. Not at all boring unlike many other books of this time period. Can be quite humorous and the plot is masterful. The characters are masterfully portrayed, especially Joe and Pip.

The story begins with Pip visiting his parents' grave sites. Here he meets a runaway convict and begins a new journey. The convict persuades young Pip to get food and a file for him. Pip does and the convict is thankful, but later is captured and confesses that he alone stole the food. Pip is sent for by Miss Havisham, a middle-aged woman whose whim it is to live in the bridal dress she wore on the day she was jilted by her lover. She hates all males and sends for Pip to enjoy the sight of him being tormented by Estella, a proud, beautiful young girl. Pip falls in love with her. Pip's sister dies before he comes of age, and Pip receives money from an unknown benefactor. During this time he learns about himself, his love for Estalla, and the unknown benefactor. This book is about a young mans life who has a few unique experiences and what he learns.Charles Dickens uses imagry that takes the form of real objects. The detail and words he uses gives more meaning and detailed images. It allows each situation to be clearly seen. The imagery also comes from the analogies and metaphors. It gave the book more life, more meaning. The visualizable images, metaphor and other kinds of figurative language set up great results thought the entire text."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"OK... I know how Dickens is supposed to be this wonderful author, but lets just face it - Its boring! Its not his fault, when he wrote everyone wrote like that, but these days its just too hard to follow..

Now if he could have written the same story in 200-300 pages instead of 500, maybe people would enjoy this book more!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations by Charles Dickens is a great mix of humor, thrills and suspense.

Without a doubt, my favorite book of all time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"&quot;Great Expectations&quot; as well as other Dickens novels like &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; were written with a purpose. Dickens was so against some of the evils of his time that he had to do something to speak out against them. And he did. He represents in the lives of his characters the thousands of children forced into inhumane working conditions. And that is just one of wrongs he set out to correct. Carefully read, Dickens provides countless details of English life with its evils and triumphs. I have read several of his novels and always find them inspiring as well as educational."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am not going to bore you with excerpts from the text. But I'll say this, Great Expectations is one of the most compassionate novels a person can read. The complexity of the plot adds a certain greatness which undoubtedly entices the attention of the reader. The story itself teaches us to never give up hope and that our destiny does not depend on our social status; but rather, the quality of our character."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to read this book twice: once in the ninth grade and once in college. While I think it is better suited for the college level, I can't say that I found it much more enjoyable the second time. The story revolves around the coming-of-age of Pip, the main character. Raised an orphan, Pip acquires a mysterious benefactor who funds his attempt to become a gentleman. There are some interestingly eccentric characters, and the book relies more on the characters themselves than the plot. However, this is an example of Dickens' wordiness becoming too cumbersome; it simply couldn't maintain my interest throughout the book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is a very interesting book to read, from the beginiing scene with Pip at the graveyard to the touching ending of Pip with Estella, Charles Dickens has described wonderfully the plot and all the characters involved and how they all finally fit into place.

I thought Pip was pretty cute when he was a little boy, and I really didn't see any change in him when he became rich like my teacher said. This is a great book, and it's the only book I liked that I ever read in English class along with 'Anthem' and 'Of Mice and Men'. Like most books it goes slow at first, but you get into it more and more. Although I really, really do like this book, I refuse to see the movie which stars Ethan Hawke and Gwenyth Paltrow, because just by looking at the commericals and the pictures from the movie, I could tell that it's not like the book at all and for that, I know that I would hate it. As a matter of fact, my friend told me that it wasn't. So, I refuse to see the movie, but I was able to see an older movie of the book and I liked it, because it was like the book and that's what I like. This is a wonderful book and I wouldn't mind reading it again! A must have for any literature fans who like to sit back, relax, and well...read. : )"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to read this book this year for my English class. At first I was interested, when Pip was a child, but I quickly became sick and tired of it's boring nature. I am in the honors program in my school, and we only had about 2 and a half weeks to read it, but it seemed like 2 and a half years. I was disappointed most because this massive plot builds up, and I was waiting for something to happen, but nothing really did. Furthermore, it was a bit hard to understand, especially since my mind was drifting, becuase it is hard to pay attention to this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is definitely one book that I'll read again and again throughout my life. If I had to pick a favorite character, it would probably be Estelle because even though she was cold and distant and VERY conceited, she still had a heart of gold.

I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in reading about interesting characters that continue to develop throughout the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I've been out of college for awhile.

The story is narrated by Pip, brought up by hand by his sister, Mrs Joe Gargery, commanded to attend Miss Havisham, jilted bride now in decay, where he falls in love with the beautiful Estella and decides he wants to be a gentleman. Eventually, apprenticed to Joe Gargery, blacksmith, he comes into a fortune, and is convinced his benefactor is Miss Havisham, intending him to become a gentleman so he can marry Estella. Miss Havisham's intentions for Estella, of course, differ markedly from this. Dickens includes a rich cast of characters: the guilty and regretful Pip; the cold and cruel Estella; the warm Herbert and Clara; the kind-hearted and faithful Joe and Biddy; the capable Jaggers; the split-personality Wemmick; the nasty Orlick; the single-minded Magwitch. Great Expectations is a much easier and funnier read than the only other Dickens book I can remember reading, and this books immediate predecessor, A Tale of Two Cities, and I noted the echo of the knitting women at the gallows in Estella's actions. The notes are a useful addition, as is the introduction by Angus Calder. A brilliant read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"What a wonderful masterpiece. Touched every part of me.

Pip falls in love with Estella, but like her mother, Estella claims she cannot return anyone's love.When Pip enters young adulthood, he discovers that any anonymous benefactor has given him a large sum of money and moves him from the colorful and calm fields of the country to the dreary dampness of London, and a life of sophistication.Through this adventure, Pip explores his sense of integrity, his values, and the depth of his faith in the goodness of others."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"***This review may contain spoilers***Like practically every other American student, I encountered Dickens's \\"Great Expectations\\" (hereafter GE) in an abridged version in junior high, then the complete text when I was much older. In my opinion, GE is a glorious (not glorified) soap opera chronicling the wildly fluctuating vicissitudes of Philip Pirrip's (Pip's) eventful life, from an orphaned, tormented child apprenticed to genial blacksmith Joe to, by a turn of ironic fate, a wealthy \\"gentleman\\" of leisure. As been often noted, Dickens created worlds, if not universes, in his novels, and GE is certainly no exception. In this review, I will try to avoid detailing the plot, which is already well-known. Instead, I will comment upon Dickens's use of backstory and flashback to flesh out most of the major characters in the novel.Even the most colorful, flamboyant characters in GE are not one-dimensional or stereotypically good or evil. We learn how Miss Havisham's marital jilting by Arthur compelled her to become a spectral recluse in her gloomy estate. We learn how Miss Havisham's misanthropic upbringing caused her frosty ward Estella (whose name suggests a blazing but distant star) to become an inaccessible man-hater. We learn how Magwitch, Pip's surprising benefactor, became a convict through cynical ad hominem prosecution in the barbaric English court system, was transported to the penal colony that was Australia, and how he acquired the money through hardship just to help the orphan Pip, who showed him mercy at the graveyard, and why he risked arrest in London to see his gentleman. We learn that Estella's mother, servant to Mr. Jaggers the lawyer, was convicted of murder but saved, after a fashion, by the lawyer and how she had to sacrifice her daughter so that she could become a lady. We even learn about the somewhat schizophrenic Wemmick, Jagger's clerk, who is sullen and joyless at work but positively animated and exuberant when he is at home (The Castle) with his elderly invalid father The Aged. Through these backstories, we find out that no Dickensian character is ultimately utterly despicable, or demonic, or flawless, or saintly. They are all achingly human, trying to live life the best they can.Since GE is primarily about the growth and development of Pip, we witness his human complexity most of all. In a paraphrase of a comment made by his friend Herbert, Pip is intelligent and naive, curious and hesitant, loyal and perfidious, snobbish but introspective, a false gentleman (through wealth) and a true gentleman (through re-discovered contrition, feeling, and love). Dickens's revelation of the humanity that still lurks in the most wretched of us is encapsulated nicely by Pip's caretaker and brother-in-law, the brawny but forgiving Joe, who says about his abusive father, \\"Whatsumever the failings on his part, dear reader, remember that he was that good in his heart\\". This noble, some may say Christian, sentiment, elevates GE beyond its busy, coincidental melodramatic soap opera plottings and trains its sharp focus on the multifaceted levels of the human condition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Compared to other Dickens' books I have read, this one is the most bizarre and strange story, and it took a little bit of adjustment to get into it. But it didn't take long to lose myself in the magical, grand drama by this literary wizard. As usual, this book has rich background materials, the marshes, deprivation, violence, mysterious and dark past, turns and twists, surprises and over the top coincidences, vengence and forgiveness...The first person perspective by the protagonist is candid and often humorous as well as insightful about the conflict and frustration of an underprevileged person with aspirations in the society where status of a person is not very mobile. The title is fantastic, Great Expectations! How great, and how ominous! Indeed!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectationsby Charles Dickens; I know that had I been required to read this book for 9th grade English, I'm pretty sure that I would have hated it. As it was it took me better than a month to get through the first half of the story... and then I raced through the second half in a couple of days on my Christmas Kindle. A classic story of poor boy makes good, loses his good fortune, finds it again through sacrifice and character and hard work. Lots of interesting examinations of British class separation and discrimination, expectations, and dry humor.

Brought back so many childhood memories and thrills !! Worth reading over and over !"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I enjoyed reading this novel mostly because of the rich text and language Dickens used to display the imagery. Dickens wrote this piece in such detail that allows the audience to fully engage in the text, relate to Pip and his struggles, and bring a deeper thought to the way we treat our individual social statuses. As citizens of the United States, we are obligated to work our way to \\"the top of the food chain\\". The majority of the time, we are not given a high status, by blood or other means, to build a superior reputation for ourselves. Therefore we must have the will and determination to make our personal goals become reality. In Great Expectations, Pip's struggles and adventures are great examples of how the audience can relate to the story line and setting throughout the novel to our own personal lives.I thought that Dickens' creatively demonstrated that an individual's social status is not what determines the rights of respect and standards on a person's character. The ability to prove our greater meaning in this world is not something that the government can label us on. As humans, we have the right to make mistakes and errors in life, but out of the morals and standards in which we uphold allow us to make those mistakes result in a learning experiences. Pip strives to become a better man throughout the novel for various reasons. However, Great Expectations allows us to see the connection between the book and real life. In both situations there are/ will be countless obstacles getting in the way of ambitions we set. When Pip decides to leave Joe behind and pursuit his ambitions of becoming a true gentleman he made a decision, much like Dickens himself, to benefit his own life. With any decision there must be great responciblity and will.Personally, I strongly believe that anyone can improve their well-being within a reasonable manner. Only with dedication and support from relatives or friends can one truly achieve their goal. Sometimes our goals don't have the exact result we wished for, but we should be grateful for what we have and work hard for what we want to improve. What I have learned from this book is that no matter what your status is in school, work, at home, or in society as a whole, we all have the ability to make something greater of ourselves. Each individual has the capability to achieve all of ambitions in life we wish to imagine."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Like many other high schoolers who wrote reviews on this page, I was forced to read this in my freshman english class. I thought it was an extremely good story. The characters (my favorites being Orlick and Trabb's Boy) are brilliant and subtley funny. The story is creative and unpredictible, and overall, it was absolutely supberb. The only reason this book doesn't get 5 stars is because it tends to drag a lot of the time, and Dickens overlong descriptions are a bit grating on the nerves, but I DO understand why people would have liked it like that in the 1800's. They liked their books long and juicy. It's a bit dated but Great Expectations is well worth a read if you have the patience. Even if you are impatient, you can not miss this great story and its wonderful characters, so at least see one of the many great movie adaptions. My personal favorite movie version of Great Expectations is the 1999 Masterpiece theatre version."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Having not read this since high school (and not being able to finish it due to boredom), and now having the ability to rediscover it since it was a free download, i decided to give this book another whirl.I was pleasantly surprised....I loved it. I found the book to be moving, interesting, and an all around great read. It has all the classic Dickens-style plot twists, with some great surprises, as well as some pretty contrived coincidences (also classic Dickens).I only took off a star because the ending was changed from how i remembered it. When I googled it, I found that Dickens often changed the endings of his books in to go with the times..... not a big fan of that!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I just graduated with a Literature degree and, amazingly, had never read anything by Dickens. I had gained a sort of superiority to the man and his works. I would dismiss it as all sentimental unbelievabilities. But I decided to not be so proud and read one of his books. On a recommendation from one of my professors, I started with Great Expecations. What I found was a deeply engrossing, funny and humane book that captivated me for the week and a half that it took to read it. Much of it was very realistic (barring, of course, the unrealistic coincidences, that are actually, in their own way, quite comforting) and believable. Dickens went a long way to get into the mind of his narrator, and it works beautifully, as we struggle with Pip in every decision and look back with him at the bad decisions that he made. The themes of the novel (pride, isolation, friendship, hopeless love, etc.) can easily be translated into our own society, putting ourselves in the shoes of the characters as we deal with our mistakes and try to do the right thing. A very amazing book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"There is no doubt that Charles Dickens' \\"Great Expectations\\" is a masterpiece. The intricacy of its plot has rarely been matched. Its characters are unforgettable. It speaks powerfully to what it means to be human.Pip is the perfect picture of flawed humanity. He is essentially well meaning, but his vision always seems to get cloudy at just the wrong time. Throughout the book, Pip falls prey to his dreams and infatuations. In the process he ignores those who truly love him. Only in the end does he learn, in catastrophic terms, the importance of love. Only then is able to accept it.\\"Great Expectations\\" is the story of Pip's learning process. Along the way we encounter some of Dickens greatest secondary characters: the fierce Mr. Jaggers, the self-centered and mentally unstable Mrs. Havisham and her heartless prodigy Estella, and Pip's great friend Joe.I give a special recommendation to this Bantam Classic edition of the work. Its introduction by John Irving is one of the greatest pieces of criticism ever written.Though not my favorite Dickens novel, I give \\"Great Expectations\\" a heartfelt recommendation."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations succeeds beyond almost all novels of its time in exploring the roots of character and moral behavior. Charles Dickens makes the case for there being the potential for good in everyone. Evil and sin follow from a combination of being self-absorbed and selfish. What is remarkable about the way these themes are handled is that they are clearly based on an assessment of human psychology, long before that field was established.The book is also remarkable for its many indelibly memorable and complex characters. Miss Havisham, Pip, Magwitch, Mr. Jaggers, and Estella are characters you will think about again and again in years to come.The book also surrounds you with a powerful sense of place. Although the England described here is long gone, it becomes as immediate as a nightmare or a dream that you have just awakened from.For a book about moral questions, Great Expectations also abounds in action. The scenes involving Pip and Magwitch are especially notable for way action expresses character and thought.Great Expectations also reeks of irony, something that is seldom noticed in more modern novels. Overstatements are created to draw the irony out into the open, where it is unmistakable. Yet the overstatements attract, rather than repel. The overstatements are like the theatrical make up which makes actors and actresses look strange in the dressing room, but more real on the stage when seen from the audience.At the same time, the plot is deliciously complex in establishing and solving mysteries before that genre had been born. As you read Great Expectations, raise your expectations to assume that you will receive answers to any dangling details. By reading the book this way, you will appreciate the craft that Mr. Dickens employed much more.This is the third time that I have read Great Expectations over the last 40 years. I found the third reading to be by far the most rewarding. If you like the book, I encourage you to read it again in the future as well. You will find that the passage of time will change your perspective so that more nooks and crannies of the story will reveal themselves to you.If this is to be your first reading of the book, do be patient with the book's middle third. It may seem to you that the book is drifting off into a sleep-inducing torpor. Yet, important foundations are being lain for your eventual delight.Mr. Dickens wrote two endings for Great Expectations. Be sure to read both of them. Which one do you prefer? I find myself changing my mind.Give love with an open heart, without expectations!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"All right. I admit it. The book starts out slow. Dickens, though I love the man, writes in such flowery and long winded language at times. What takes many authors a line or two, Dickens will devote whole pages.And I almost put the book down for that exact reason. I'm very happy I did not.With so many detailed threads in the story, the depth to the characters--when they all start to blend together a few chapters in, the result is page-turning.The story centers around a young boy--well, almost young man-- named Pip, and revolves around his growing into age. You cannot help but love the boy. Much of Pip's worry and concern I could relate to--falling in love with a girl who refuses to return your sentiments and only plays with your heart, growing up and leaving home for the first time, and discovering your true relationships with others and yourself, as shocking as they may turn out to be.I felt as if I was side by side with Pip through it all, and that made the novel a wonderful experience for me. I recommend the novel for the young because so much relates to them, and also for the older readers--because you can experience it all again.A wonderful and heart warming tale. Just get through those first chapters.The book is timeless, with the basic story line being one that has affected almost everyone sometime in their life; falling in love with somebody who does not return the feelings. Pip, the main character, falls in love with an exotic and beautiful girl, Estella, but of course she does not have any feelings for him. So Pip does everything he can to win her approval, and most importantly her heart. It is hard to skip around in the book. While some passages might seem as if they have nothing to do with the story, they do. Everything in the story is tied together somehow. Skimming the book is not going to help. Certain events and people the reader thinks are insignificant or forgot completley, will appear over and over throughout the book. I am glad that i decided to read Great Expectations, despite the negative remarks from peers. I found out that most of them never made it past the first few chapters, so they missed out on the good parts. The only reason I did not give the book a higher score is that parts of it are slow and dry, but stick with it, you will not be upset. --This text refers to the Mass Market Paperback edition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens, for whatever reason, never crossed my path in high school, and in the years since I have found myself intimidated to pick up one of his books. This year I resolved to get over that and selected 'Great Expectations' to be my first venture into Dickens' famous fictional worlds. And what joy! As it turns out I had no reason to be intimidated because Dickens is imminently readable and highly enjoyable.This novel is told from the point of view of Philip Pirrip, nicknamed Pip, who begins his tale as a young boy visiting the graves of his parents when an escaped convict happens upon him and threatens him into helping him get food. This experience will have a huge impact on Pip's life, although just how huge is left to be discovered until much later in the novel. Pip soon finds himself in the service of an eccentrically, manically wounded old woman and her beautiful but cold-hearted charge Estella, whom Pip is doomed to fall for and spend the rest of his days pining for. He begins to feel oppressed by his poor life, anguished that his miserable situation will never be good enough to win Estella's heart. And so it seems to be a blessing when a mysterious benefactor takes Pip away from his home to make a gentleman of him in London. Certainly Pip is pleased to have been \\"rescued\\", but over the course of his teaching a curious thing happens to him: he begins to lose the humanity that had made him such an upstanding young man in the first place. He forsakes relations with his loving family, judges his best friend as a great guy doomed to failure, and slowly allows his finances to spin out of control as he begins to spend more and more of his unnamed benefactor's money.'Great Expectations' is, ultimately, a journey of self discovery. Pip rises in society and leaves his life behind him without realizing just how much it had been worth to him. When he reflects on all that has happened to him and wonders if the inaptitude he had sensed in his friend \\"had never been in him at all, but had been in me,\\" it is a thoughtful discovery that really makes you think about what is truly important in your own life. What makes someone a success? Is it the amount of money in their bank account? Or is it the friendships they forge? Does someone need to be educated to be happy, or can they just be satisfied with what they have? Dickens pulls you along through Pip's story with a great deal of wit and a dash of cynicism that, refreshingly, serves to enlighten the reader rather than depress them. It is an intelligent and heartfelt novel that has become a classic for all of the right reasons, and is one that remains relevant to modern readers -- the true test of a classic, in my opinion. As for myself, I have been thoroughly enchanted by my first experience with Dickens, and look forward to reading many more of his books in the coming year."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations was my first book by Charles Dickens, and I still believe it to be my favorite. It is a very powerful book that connects with people's lives all over. The main character,Pip, grows up in the home of a blacksmith. With both of his parents dead, he lives with his overreactive sister and her husband, Joe Gargery. Pip soon meets Miss Havisham and the beautiful Estella that lives with her. He longs to be a gentleman, but the social class division leaves Pip a blacksmith apprentice, and Estella a lady. However, one night, Mr. Jaggers (a lawyer)comes to Pip and informs him that he is a man of great expectations. Pip has no idea of who his benefactor is, but heads to London to start his eventful life as a gentleman.Great Expectations is a amazing book in many ways. Three of these ways are: the themes, the characters, and the writing. Themes in this book are very important. They can easily relate to us today, and these main ideas are crucial lessons through literature. Next, the characters. Dickens creates such perfect characters that they will stay in your mind and you will begin to link people you know to people in the book. Such characters include Miss Havisham, Joe Gargery, Mr. Jaggers, Magwitch, Herbert Pocket, and many others. These people in Great Expectations make the book enjoyable to read. Lastly, the writing is awesome. Sentences are easily read, and the suspense keeps you reading from cover to cover.Great Expectations will always be one of my favorite books, and I strongly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a challenge, and a excellent read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"An outstanding book that I read this year was Great Expectations. This was a wonderful classic written by the magnificent author Charles Dickens. Charles Dickens wrote a book that truly captivated the power of human love. He showed us that life can be very difficult, and you have to work very hard in order for you to succeed.In the beginning of the book, a character named Pip lived on a forge near some marshes in England. His family was generally poor. He lived with his older sister and her husband named Joe. Joe was a fairly poor blacksmith. One day, Pip was walking on the marshes. Suddenly, a strange man came up to Pip and threatened him. The strange man was a convict who was put to die on the marshes. He was handcuffed and chained. He told Pip that he would kill him if he didn't bring him a steel file and something to eat. Pip then ran back to the forge and brought the convict a steel file and some food. This vivid occurrence haunted Pip for the rest of his life.After the incident on the marshes, Pip met a lady named Miss Havesham. Miss Havesham was a very weird lady. She always wore her wedding dress in her house. She never left her house. Miss Havesham had a very beautiful adopted daughter named Estella. She was an arrogant woman. While looking at her, Pip fell in love with Estella.One day, a mysterious man came to Joe's forge. This man was sent by a secret benefactor who was residing in London. The man didn't give his name. He told Pip and Joe that someone in London was requesting him. The secret benefactor wanted Pip to come to London so that he could become a gentleman. Pip was very excited when he heard that he could work in London. Pip and Joe agreed upon the proposal. Later in that same week, Pip left Joe's forge to travel to London. There he could be a gentleman with a bright and bold future.While in London, Pip encountered many strange mysteries. Pip finally met his secret benefactor. Read the book to find out who the secret benefactor was...Overall, Great Expectations was an outstanding book. It really captivated the vast stretches of life. Great Expectations really made me feel quite sad. I felt very sorry for Pip. He had a very difficult life. He had change his personality forever once he became a gentleman.

I am also sure that whatever edition you get will be great. This book shows tons of emotions, and is guided by the narrator, Pip. It is a superb book, that once you pick up you will never put down.Pip is raised by his sister and brother-in-law, both named Joe, b/c of his parents being dead.

There are lots of surprise twists and turns in the plot, especially about Miss Havisham and her adopted \\"daughter\\" Estella and her true parentage.As always, a Dickens novel is peopled with wonderful and unusual characters that eventually all play a part in telling the story.

And you absolutely forget that it is all one person reading. The wonderful descriptors Dickens so artfully paints in complete portraits and scenery with words, flow effortlessly, almost musically so that the it unfolds in the listeners mind as sure as one were reading Dickens' words.

We find a set of interweaving story lines that rival today's best movies ('Crash' comes to mind. Sorry! I digress, already.) Anyway, as usual, the protagonist and narrator, Pip, bears all the innocense of Dickens' best characters. He is able to observe all the qualities and idiosyncracies of the good, the bad, and the ugly in Victorian England. As another orphan character, he is \\"brought up by hand\\" by his strict and nasty sister with the help of his brother-in-law, Joe Gargery, a benevolent blacksmith. The plot moves quickly as he comes upon an escaped convict who coerces him to get him food and a file. He finds the experience all too much, for he is in a no-win situation. He manages to escape this escapade with grace, but not the situation his sister places him into. She forces him upon the company of Miss Havisham, an old, bitter woman who has never recovered from being jilted early in life. Through her he meets a young woman, named Estella, and falls hopelessly in love. Through Havisham's patronage, he becomes an apprenticed gentleman as well as Joe's apprenticed blacksmith; then he obtains wealth from a mysterious benefactor. From these experiences, he acquires a gentleman's demeanor as well as a gentleman's appetite for money.\\"Great Expectations\\" is a worthy classic book experience. The characters are drawn well, especially Miss Havisham. (The images Dickens uses for her and her surroundings are among the most memorable of the novel.) It defines what true wealth is, and juxtaposes well the pompous and the hypocritical characters with the genuine and good. 'Great Expectations' demonstrates, more than it preaches, about the virtues presented. Also, the plot lines run together in a way that is so skillful, it hardly seems contrived. There is also some good irony and suspense thrown in for good measure. \\"Great Expectations\\" is a decent and enjoyable reading voyage."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations by Charles Dickens is a timeless 19th century novel that addresses issues in life that remain relevant today. In particular, it explores the modern individual's personal development through experiences that span from youth to adulthood.In Great Expectations, Dickens employs several techniques to effectively portray the personal development of the main character Pip. The title, Great Expectations, is significant because it reveals that the plot focuses on Pip's aspirations in life. The novel is a first person narrative, with an older Pip retelling and commenting on past events that had an influence on his social development. This element allows the reader to observe how a young Pip reacted to events in his life and how an older and more mature Pip interprets these events years later. A recurring theme throughout Great Expectations is the class system of Victorian England and the significance of social status. Pip struggles with the issue of social status throughout the novel and must come to the realization that social status is not connected to one's real character.In his novel Great Expectations, Charles Dickens combined aspects of his own life, with his knowledge of human behavior, to create a realistic portrayal of an individual's personal development. The novel's portrayal is so clear and its content so relevant that it continues to be read and analyzed over a century after it was first written."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As young men and women, at some we must make the choice to stay in the community and be a humble fish in a little pond or strike out on our own in the big city.There are many ways to do this and Pip, the main character, does it scornfully although he does not know it at the time. Like so many people, he is lured by the bright lights, \\"sophisticated\\" culture and big money of the big city. He has no problem leaving behind a simple world where he is cared for via an unknown benefactor for an unknown reason. He guesses at whom the benefactor might be and what their intent is, but he gets it all wrong. He falls from the path of moral righteousness and has no idea what his life really means. Dickens masterfully crafts together this story. I think that Joe represented good Pip and Orlick was the alter ego. Additionally, I was kicking myself for not seeing a couple of plot twists, but I was so engrossed that I didn't see them coming. I hope the same thing happens to you.I wonder if F.S. Fitzgerald was influenced by Dickens because there is a fantasy like worship of the rich, followed by a downward spiraling degradation. Although F.S.F writes about the rich with outright contempt, Dickens neutrally accepts them more as a vehicle for the story.Anyway, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens' novel Great Expectations explores the side of human nature that many do not like to read in novels. In the United States, in the 21st Century, people would rather read about romantic-style plots where all turns out well for the protagonists. Dickens, however, chooses to illuminate what man can really be capable of: betrayal, duplicity, unfaithfulness, and a handful of other negative characteristics.Definitely an interesting novel, Great Expectations will undoubtedly have its audience intrigued and constantly pondering.I would highly recommend this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Unlike many of the reviewers who wrote so passionately about this work it is not a book that has played a significant part in my reading life. The great narrative drive, the tremendous skill in creating vital characters, the richly descriptive and often ironic language are aspects of Dickens genius.But somehow the world of Dickens dark and gloomy and Victorian and so British reality never really appealed to me. This says nothing however about the quality of the work and its great gifts to the reader. The book is the portrayal of a society, and of a moral education. This is a book about the formation of a character through experience, about learning from life's difficulties and disappointments to become a better person. It is about ' recognition' not only of one's own true and better self, but about what is important in life. This book as Dickens himself has had enormous influence on Western literature. I think of two very different writers, Kafka and Salinger both of whom clearly had Dickens in mind in certain points of their writing. Pip, Magwitch , Joe Gargary,Miss Havisham, Estella are living characters in the heart of Western literature. The book then I believe is far greater, far more than my own reading has given me of it. Not always apparently does the reader do justice to the work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"i was a assigned this book to read over the summer between 8th and 9th grade for my honors english (it seems as though many students are assigned this book going into 9th grade honors english. is it some sort of nation-wide standard?)... at parts the language can be thick and a little harder to decipher than most the language of most authors people my age are used to reading... this is only a slight hindrance, though, because about half way trhough the book (assuming this is your first dickens book, as it was for me) you get used to it and you seem to be talking like pip in real life!!!!!!! (well, a little bit for me because i read the book wuite quickly, seeing as how i loved it) i kept saying betwixt instead of between, which i enjoy saying now because it makes me feel smarter than evryone else (jk).... anyway, i was the single person in my class that absolutely LOVED this book... the only thing that i didn't like was taking EXTENSIVE nots throughout the book, which ruins many of the other books we read (such as the amazing lord of the flies).... aside from that, the book is quite good... not only is dickens able to hold my attention through most of the book (when i say most, i;m excyuding the part where they are planning that escape with provis, which i thought was boring), which is a huge feet for someone such as charles dickens, who i expected to bore the living daylights out of me... overall, the plot is very good, but the messages that it carries are even better... pip is driven by greed all throughout the book, until he becomes mentally ill... when he realizes what he's done, he becomes a new person, and is at peace with himself... the realationship between him and estella is very complex, too.. until very late in the book, he is captured by her beauty, he partakes in a blind love for her. by the end of the novel, after all he has been through with her, he gains a true love for her based on her qualities, not because she is rich and beautiful.. this love was always there, he just did not uncover the exactness of it until he grew as a person through his sever low. so many vivid characters, i can't even explain how good the characterization is int he book... IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THIS BOOK, READ IT NOW OR YOU WILL BE DISSAPOINTED LATER ON!!!!!! if you can, read it twice, as i plan to (probably next summer, so it isn't so fresh in my mind)... group discussion on the book really accentuate the meaning of the book... the meaning is really deep, and most people don't catch all of it. the lake is much deeper than the top of the seaweed, don't be afraid to plunge to the bottom...though this book did not completely enlighten me and totally change my life, i did learn from it, which is something that rarely comes in spades. in this case it comes in spades, hearts, diamons AND clubs...enough rambling for me, im sure your not even going to read that whole review, it was quite long...review in a nutshell: good book with good messages (plural) and an engrossing plot... READ IT!!!!!other good books: bleak house by dickens (my man), heart of darkness by joseph conrad, farhenheit 451 by ray bradbury, lord of the flies by william golding, siddartha by herman hesse (not many people have read this, WHY?!?!!?!?!??!), don quixote by cervantes, old man and the sea by earnest hemmingway... can't think of any more off the top of my head... oh yeah, dracula by bram stoker...thank you, good bye"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Contentment in life is a struggle; in \\"Great Expectations,\\" by Charles Dickens, a young boy is faced with disappointed expectations of ambition and desire for social self-improvement. Set in the mid-nineteenth century in Kent and London, England, social class is portrayed as utmost importance. For young orphaned Philip Pirrip-Pipp- life is a struggle of realization of the real world and place in life as well as culture. Through traumatic events, mishaps and altered expectations to the truth, Pipp learns that social improvement is irrelevant to one's real worth.The reoccurring motif in, \\"Great Expectations,\\" is in direct relation to the major them of self-improvement through social class. Through characters, places, and infatuations, this motif is prominent. Miss. Havisham, Estella, the Satis House, and Bently Drummle all introduce different levels and perceptions of social class of the 1800's. Bentley Drummle represents the grotesque side of high class, Miss. Havisham and Estella are the quintessence of the highly educated, lavish and greatly respected side of the upper class, and the Satis House is merely the embodiment of the riches young Pipp adores and idolizes. Each character not only adds to Pipp's life long obsession of social well being, but life lessons learned in his battle for fulfillment."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens was one of the most popular writers of all time, creating some of the best-known characters in English literature. In the book \\"Great Expectations\\", the protagonist and narrator, Pip begins the story as a young orphan boy being grown up by his sister. I like this book, because Charles Dickens takes you right inside the Pip's mind and you live through the events and discoveries of his life with him. Pip is passionate, romantic and somewhat unrealistic at heart. That makes the novel interesting. Of course, you cannot forget the great love story (Pip and Estella). The other characters Magwitch, Miss Havisham, Joe Gargery, Miss Joe, Estella, Mr Jaggers and Mr Wemmick are all unique and special in their way and they add to the novel's richness. Another thing I really liked was how all of the characters are interrelated to each other in ways that you may not discover until you get to the end of the novel. This novel will make you sometimes laugh and sometimes make you feel sad, but it is always entertaining. Latif Dose simplifies the texts. The language is very clear. There are not old English words and this gives the reader much pleasure while reading the novel. I think most young people would like this novel because it's not as hard to read as an other classic books. I recommend Great Expectations to anyone who wants to read a good, classic book because Great Expectations has a little bit of everything in it, mystery, romance and suspense. You cannot easily find all of these properties in other novels, which makes &quot;Great Expectations&quot; a special and a classic one.. That makes this novel very different. It is probably one of the top ten English novels of the 19th century. Some of the passages are beautiful. I cannot forget Pip's response to Estella when she says \\"You will get me out of thoughts in a week.\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"There is really no need to recount the plot of this classic - I think most people who are thinking about reading it already know it is a story of poor boy done good and has wrong assumptions about how he comes about it. But despite the storyline being well-worn, there is till so much to get from this story. What comes across most clearly is the theme that nothing comes without strings-attached - Pip's great fortune, that at first looked like manna from on high, turns out to cause more trouble than it is worth.Dickens is a joy to read - his description is masterful, and his ability to paint pictures of his eccentric characters is unsurpassed - the contrasts between the charming Mr Wemmick and the slimy Mr Jaggers; the amazing Miss Havisham; the self important Pumblechook (who I could not stand! Is there any character in literature so annoyingly self-deluded?). My absolute favourite is Joe - his convoluted ways of attempting to pass information onto Pip, his attempts to spare Pip from his evil sister and his localised venacular. The only disappointing characters are the two main ones - Pip comes across as insipid, uninspiring, and frankly undeserving of the fortune that he falls into. Estella is so sketchily drawn that you never get any feel for her, and I think that given how much complexity Dickens manages for some of the minor characters, he could have afforded more to Estella.However, this is a great read. Don't read it just because you fell you \`have to read a classic' - read it because it is a well written story with the right balance of humour and pathos."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I don't think I'd be giving away much of the plot if I were to say that the story revolves around Pip, a young, middle class orphan who has dreams to be a wealthy, respected gentleman, but has no hope of this as he is a rural blacksmith apprentice. His prospecs change, however, when a mysterious, anonymous benefactor offers to make Pip's dream a reality. I won't give away the ending, but the novel supports Dickens' belief that the middle class is the class to which people should aspire.The plot of this story wasn't to my liking. Dickens' attempts towards the end to wrap all the subplots into one neat little package annoyed me...similar to plot twists in modern Hollywood movies--things so outrageously convienent that it makes one want to roll his eyes. The manner in which things are written, however is fantastic. While the main characters are rather boring, the minor characters, (especially Biddy, Herbert Pocket, and John Wemmick) were much more interesting. Thankfully, Dickens focused on them enough to flesh them out and make them memorable. I would recommend this book, not because I enjoy the plot, but because the writing style is superior and because I, being lower middle class, enjoyed the positive viewpoint Dickens extended concerning my class."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"What have I missed all these years? I'm ashamed to admit that this is the first Charles Dickens' I've read and I'm 40! Heavens forbid! Don't make the same mistake.......read this book now!I've spent the past week being thoroughly entertained by Pip! No wonder Dickens' is considered such a great writer....this book will have you laughing out loud, and being inspired by the incredible depth of understanding Dickens has for the human condition at all levels of society.....and he manages to do so while weaving a story about one young boy's transformation and maturation...and the tradeoffs for every choice in life.Once you pick this book up, you won't want to put it down until you finish. It's that good!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens, along with Dostoevsky, stands atop my list of novelists who could most accurately portray the subtleties of human emotion and passion. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is simply a masterpiece of 19th-century fiction, and is pure Dickens. In this semi-autobiographical work (a trademark of Dickens' writings), the life of a poor young boy, Pip, is followed from his humble beginnings to his rise into the middle-class, due to the mysterious aid of an unknown benefactor. His pursuit of Estella, a beautiful young girl raised to break the hearts of men by her jilted caretaker, Ms. Havisham, is a classic of literature that has been repeated countless times since. The tragic, gradual break between Pip and his family (particularly the humble but caring Joe) is heartwrenching. Pip's eventual realization of the insincerity of the middle class, and his love for Joe, brought tears to my eyes.&quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a wonderful, moving book that has been copied and satired again and again, from Mishima's &quot;Forbidden Colors&quot; to South Park. An important and unforgettable novel!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A great story about a young man who has lost his mother and father and is being raised by only his older sister, Charles Dickens' &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a story of diversity, poverty, and growing up. Pip, the proantaganist of the story, is a boy in England. The story is about the adventures of life. As Pip grows up, he must strive to understand what is going on, and why it is going on.The book is very long and almost covers Pip's entire life. The book is enriched with humor that we can all relate to. Short episodes make up the majority of the book.

And even I have to appreciate this classic. Charles Dickens knew what he was doing, okay? Great Expectations is a classic, and there's a reason it's a classic. For the plain and simple fact it was well written, with an interesting plot and a good twist. Just because something doesn't contain profanity, sex and violence doesn't mean it should be presumed boring. A basic summary - it tells the story of life, obsessions and social status. As far as I'm concerned, it isn't boring. Just wake up to yourselves, teenage world. Virginia Andrews isn't the extent of reading pleasure."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I find myself surprised at the comments provided by earlier reviewers. One critic gave &quot;Great Expectations&quot; one star because he/she failed a test. Why should Dickens be blamed for that? Another said there was no structure (in a Dickens novel???). Another, that there was &quot;little direction and less power.&quot; That there was no theme and no plot. Perhaps I am seeing things that aren't there but, whatever the shortcomings are, it is not in plot, themes, or characterization. It is the story of the orphan Philip Pirrip, known to everyone as Pip, from the age of about seven to the age of twenty-three, with a brief section at the end that takes place about eleven years later. Pip is being brought up \\"by hand\\" by his loud and quarrelsome sister and her kind and quiet husband, the blacksmith Joe Gargery. Young Pip is soon asked to serve in the home of Miss Havisham, who appears to be half mad since the day, years earlier, when she had been left at the alter by her old lover. Miss Havisham is raising a young girl named Estella to be heartless in her treatment of men when she grows up as a form of revenge against all men. And, Pip naturally falls in love with her. After a few years, Pip finds himself wealthy due to some unknown benefactor (who he mistakenly thinks is Miss Havisham and who he also believes has planned to have Estella marry him when they are older) and he now has \\"great expectations\\" made of him. He plans to become a gentleman and he leaves the kind and devoted Joe to live in London, Pip hoping to leave behind his humble past of which he now feels ashamed. After a few more years, he discovers that his unknown benefactor was Abel Magwitch whom he had helped when he was seven. Magwitch had been convicted and deported to Australia where he became a wealthy sheepman. Even though Magwitch was forbidden to return to England, he does so just to see the young man he had been helping to become a gentleman. Through problems with the law trying to arrest Magwitch, problems with Magwitch's past, the loss of the fortune and of Pip's great expectations, and through illness, Pip discovers the basic goodness in Joe, the devotion of Magwitch and of Pip's close friend Herbert Pocket, and what really is important. He discovers the value of family and of close friends and confidants. Estelle, who had married a cruel oaf, also learns her lessons and finds that she may have a heart as well (in the more common of the two endings of the novel). This is a great novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"If you're like me, you were forced to read some Dickens in High School and found him to be pedantic and to sound archaic.

I enjoyed getting the feel of what it was like in the old days of Britain."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am making my way through Charles Dickens...not in any particular order...the first few I've picked are mostly familiar through TV or film adaptations that I've enjoyed and/or on the recommendations of friends.\\"Bleak House\\" was my first read, finished last month. \\"Great Expectations\\" is my second read.What can I say? I am just so enamored with Dickens's story-telling and character development that I have a fear that when I am done reading his canon I'll have to declare a 13-way tie for first place. We'll see.Between Bleak House and Great Expectations I *almost have a two-way tie for first place, in no small part because they are such different types of books...Bleak House was a universe of characters and subplots; Great Expectations fewer characters and not as much intrigue, although the last 1/4 to 1/3 of the book is riveting. And some good comedy also.But I am going to put GE at #1 and BH at #2...while I loved Bleak House as I read it, and have a few favorite characters, \\"Great Expectations\\" will *stay with me* much much longer I think...Bleak House is brilliant (really brilliant) for its commentary on the period and for its settings and for its intricacies; Great Expectations is brilliant because it is simple and timeless.I'm not nearly vain or clever enough to think I'm the first to recognize this, but three neat things about Great Expectations are: 1) it's a novel which illustrates the old warning \\"Be Careful What You Wish For...\\", 2) it is the complete opposite of \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" - an earnest, non-cynical first-person narrator who meets so much kindness along the way, and fewer \\"phonies\\" (although there are a few), and 3) it's such a personal novel that anyone who dares wonder what they could possibly learn about human nature by reading such an \\"old\\" book NEEDS to read it for that very reason.The characters are just so memorable...if I had to pick a favorite, I think it would be Wemmick...you probably work with him and don't even know it: he's the man (or woman) who is competent at work, works for an insufferable boss, and has a completely different home life than work life. His care of \\"The Aged\\" is a remarkable example for any of us in caring for our parents.The love stories are also very touching - especially the ones that turn out for the best...but no spoilers in this review.And the story of Pip's unrequited love is so true to life...and although I think it would have been worse for Pip to lose Estella had she been more than just beautiful outside but also beautiful inside, Dickens wrote beautifully and agonizingly of the highs and lows associated with unrequited love as only one who has experienced it can truly identify. One of the worst and most painful aspects is not the fact that you aren;t chosen but that they chose *that* person. And all you can think is: anybody...anybody but *them*.A memorable book and must reading.Now on to another Dickens novel! :-)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It is one of the magnificent books in history that everyone should have.

Written originally in different volumes and distributed to an excited Victorian republic, Dickens was able to make his audience care and feel for his odd, moving characters. He was the Stephen King of his day; a clever businessman who distributed mediocre books to the public. That Dicken's fever passed on from one generation to the next is fine, that this made Dicken's books classics in schools is a shame. But let me get to the actual book at hand! Yes, many characters in Great Expectations are original and interseting. Overall, however, Great Expectations is wordy (!), and painfully convoluted. It is often difficult to get through, and geared towards a certain audience only. This is not to say that everyone will dislike Great Expectations, but we live in an age (good or bad) of gritty realism. Authors like James Joyce and F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote with and still show a heavenly pen, Dicken's stories are what turns so many young people against reading. Anyone who wants to live in a former era, Great Expectations is a must; for anyone who wants a powerful, sophisticated read PLEASE put Great Expectations in the incinerator."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book was a large disappointment for me. I had seen the movie, and hoped that the book would be good. However, I was wrong. In fact, this book turned out to be one of the worst I have ever read. The book has too much description, not even important to the story. Dickens lost my interest in the book from the very first chapter, just a plain description of main character Pip's history of his family and town. This chapter drags on for too long, as does the rest of the book. As an example, the character Estella's rudeness towards Pip is repeated so often that it becomes annoying. I got the point of Estella's bringing up and lifestyle early on in the novel, and this did not have to be repeated so often. This book could very well have been interesting, but Dickens did not do a good job writing it. His continuous decscrptions of such landscapes as rivers and trees are irrelevant to the story, and caused me to drift away from it. I do not reccommend this book to anybody, and advise you to avoid it. I, as well as many other people I know, could not even finish this book. It brought no interest to me, and it is too long, considering that it contained nothing attention-grabbing and no excitement. However, if you do insist on reading this book, please just get the cliffnotes. It is not a book worth buying."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"when I read this book. Honestly, after I liked &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; I was expecting more from Dickens. Maybe Dickens wrote in the style of his time, which was to be very detailed, but it really doesn't translate well to today. I don't mind long books (I'm reading War and Peace now) but this book went into extreme detail about the most meaningless things.This story was essentially a Victorian soap opera. Theres all sorts of unknown parents, secret coniving, mysterious benefactors, and worst of all, many unrealistic characters. This book was so contrived and unnatural that I really don't see how it's attained &quot;classic&quot; status.If you don't mind meticulous attention being payed to the minutia, which is Dickens's style, then I'd recommend &quot;A Tale of Two Cities.&quot; If not, there are many other authors much better than Dickens that you can read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations was a mediocre book. I was not impressed. I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class. It was too long and boring. I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real. It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill. Every chapter was boring. I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book. Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wopsle's stupid plays? This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story. In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!

Especially the second stage of Pip's expectations, which finds Pip devoid of any characterizations beyond \\"I'm rich and you're not,\\" and \\"Oh, how I do love the lady Estella.\\" It's enough to make you vomit. Mr. Dickens should have made this a much shorter novel, or maybe even a short story. It still would have been boring, but maybe not as boring."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A guy I work with read this book and it seemed like he was reading it for three years! Every day he sat there with his legs crossed sipping his tea and reading Great Expectations, spending about an hour on every page! What an aristocrat. It was brutal!Than I tried to read the book.I couldn't get past the first stage or the first part or whatever because it was so f*cking boring i thought my f*cking head was going to explode! NOTHING HAPPENED!That freak I work with didn't like it either.I'm just surprised he could read the whole thing without completely losing his mind."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"AAH! This book bored me to tears... literally. Thanks to Charles Dickens and his array of b****y women and the rest of the babbling morons, I never want to see that book again. It was thrown across the room many times in the course of my reading. Being forced to read that garbage didn't help much either. I don't understand why honor english students have to be tortured with his 500 pages of nothingness. I had to get the monarch notes to be able to understand it all! It made me feel like an idiot and maaaaaaybe if it was understandable and shorter.... it would actually be good. MAAAAAAAYBE!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I think Great Expectations was a very long, boring book that didn't have a plot. Dickens seemed to drag the story on and on. If the book wasn't as long, it might have been better. I heard somewhere that Dickens got paid by the word and that is was there's a lot of extra, stupid words in it. I also think that it was twisted because everyone was realted to each other."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"the book was boring, poopy, i didn't like it at all, had to read it for school, not a good time"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens was actually a good writer, but he never could come up with a decent ending. His stories were well written, and the characters were interesting, especially in this book. This story follows the life of a young boy as he grows up and tries to make a place for himself in the world. He meets some interesting characters that, at times, get the better of him. He also falls in love with an unattainable woman. The story carries on without a climax, without a point, without resolution, and, ultimately, without an ending. It just abruptly stops. I think this was the best book I read by Dickens, which isn't saying much."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I thought that this was a pretty good book. In the beginning I wasn't sure if I would like it becuase it was kind of different but I continued reading it and I ended up enjoying it. Some of the parts in the story were kind of hard to read. There were so many characters to remember and to keep track of. One of the characters went by two different names so that got confusing. Another thing that got difficult while reading was the dialect that Dickens used while writing the book. I like the way Dickens wrote this book. He doesn't tell you about everything that is going on, so you have many questions about things and at the end everything is answered for you. It doesn't turn out how you would expect."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I found most of the book a good read. I was suprised by who Pip's benefactor was but that's what a good book is suppose to do. Intregue you, suprise you.... I didn't enjoy the ending though I thought with all that went on in the book that there would be a different approach to the ending."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I thought this book was a really good book. I liked it because it was very exciting and interesting. I thought it was difficult to read though because of all the characters in the story. I thought that there was way to many characters and there didn't need to be that many. Dickens also used a lot of long and hard words which I didn't understand that well. That made the story even harder to read. It was also very long and I think that Dickens could have taken some parts out. It got kind of boring during the middle of the book but at the end it was all worth reading. I think Dickens is a very good writer and I would like to read some more of his novels. He thinks of neat stories that no other author would think of. Overall, this was a very good book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I must confess that this was the first book I've read from Charles Dickens and did'nt liked it.I believed that he would describe more profoundly the rigid class difference in the british society of the end of XIX century."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book got to me fast and in great condition, and at a great price!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The Great Expectation was a great book. I thought that it was a little hard to read. But I just read the part over that I didn't understand and I eventually understand it. Another thing that confused me is that Charles Dickens uses a lot of names for his characters. He should of just stuck to one name per character so that the readers wouldn't get confused. He also had some unrealistic plot in the story. Otherwise this was a great story how a boy becomes a gentleman and learns how to act. I would recommend you to read this book if you want to keep guessing."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Pip craves the approval of Miss Havisham and the love of Estella, who basically treat him like dirt. Even when he's with them he's miserable and knows it. Pip also knows that he's being an ungrateful snob towards Joe and Biddy, who've done nothing in his life but love, respect, and protect him. This because he cannot help but view them through the eyes of the rich and vindictive Miss Havisham and the beautiful but really darn mean Estella. Despite all this, Pip is a likeable character with whom it is easy to identify and sympathize. Eventually he confronts the superficiality of his expectations and embraces his true nature. In the process he transforms both Miss Havisham and Estella into feeling human beings, understanding and remorseful of the pain caused by their previous conduct."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"...this book and I are! I had to keep reminding myself that this story was fiction, otherwise I probably would have gotten much more emotional about it than I did. Many of the emotions Pip went through, I have also at some point.

I have read it again and again. The only problem I have with it is that I am never able to get through part three. How could I call it my favorite then? Read the book and discover the magic."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My first experience with this book was as a freshman in high school. Being so young, it was nearly impossible to grasp the depth and breadth of this genius piece of work. This story is amazingly broad in character development. Through the novel, one is able to follow the life journey of Pip, and his ties to those closest to him in life. He &quot;changes, and changes again,&quot; and can never fully recover from what he learns. There's no going back. This book will forever remain one of my favorite. It's one that leaves you wondering how a person could have the talent to create such a touching, masterful work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"People have enjoyed the adventures of Pip and friends (or enemies, as the case may be) for decades! Though quite confusing at times, Great Expectations was a well thought out novel. This book required more concentration than most, with a cast of characters that would fill the world many times over. I had trouble reading it in the normal haphazard fashion I usually take; a chapter here, a few pages on the way to school, because of all the details put into it. I know this classic was written with money being paid per word, but I found much of the long, rambling, descriptions to be the one major fault of the novel. I think that the one reason people accept and cherish these lengthy descriptions is because Great Expectations is one of the &quot;classic classics&quot;, so to speak. People expect it to become tedious in places, filled with descriptions of anything from a desk drawer to toenail clippings. But overall, I found this to be a touching book, about mangled love, childhood, and life in general. A great read for anyone with patience!!-LJ"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I think that this book was superb, not just because it's a classic but because of it's morals and it's story of young Pip and how he goes through many many adventures and many wonderful happenings in his life. That's why of course it's called Great Expectations - the title tells all"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book helped me realize I do not need to read books in a conventional manner to fully enjoy them. I read the book with the aid of books on tape while in the back of my parent's Toyota riding through Holland. The atmosphere of the many hours spent enjoying the book while I would have been sleeping or staring vacantly at the fields still calls me to thank my eighth grade teacher for assigning it to me. Even though I remember groaning at the first sight of the thick novel, I am happy to have known the eccentric nature of the rich old lady, the adventuresome curiousity of young Pip, and most of all the intriguing presence of the girl Pip would be affected by for his whole life"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This novel, written by Charles Dickens, shows us that we cannot achieve happiness from money. It also teaches us that if we succumb to our desires we will end up losing in life. I recommend this beautifully written masterpiece to anyone who enjoys reading"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"After doing numerous analysing on the novel, I find Estella the least developed of all the main characters in the book. The chapters in which she apperas in are short; her actions are small and her speeches are simplistic. I find it a pity that Charles Dickens did not actually further develope Estella and based the entire story on Pip"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is one of the most depressing novels I haveever read. Just about anything and everything goes wrongfor Pip and just about everyone in the story dies. It wasa good book, don't get me wrong, just a bit of a downer."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens is a rare genius who succeeded in capturing vividly the manifold pains - physical, emotional, and moral - of childhood and the effect of these scars in the adulthood. As a result, his stories still resonates powerfully after so many years. On the weak points, Dickens tends to rely on remarkable coincidences to tie the plots together, and the psychological studies of his characters are not as sharp and profound as those of Dostoyevsky or Henry James. I also found the contrived happy ending very unsatisfying."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is an incredible read. The main character really absorbs the attention of the reader. The plot is amazingly well done, you won't want to put the book down!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Everyone must read this book. It is quite a story, but not for the weak of heart. It will make impostors change their ways (or at least know the extent of wrongdoings) and those who are earnest count their blessings that they are."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book shows alot of character and keeps you wondering what this little boy is going to go through next. charles dickens is a wonderful writer. This book should be made mandantory for all students to read while they are still in high school."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"More high school students should read this book. I loved this book, and I read last year as a freshmen. If you think about it, high school students can relate to this book just as they can relate to books written now. Even though it is written in older times and with &quot;big words&quot; doesn't mean one should not read it and say it is boring and stupid. Many high schoolers can relate to Pip when he was bored with being a blacksmith because he got tired of doing it, because alot of times high school students sign up to do stuff that it turns out they don't like or that they are tired of because they thought they would like it or their parents made them do it. Many high schoolers can also relate to when Estella makes fun of Pip, because they argue with siblings or that guy/girl who sits next to you in biology class that you don't like but they still talk to you. Then when Pip gets his chance to finally become a gentleman, many high schoolers finally get their chance to do something they want. Once you read the first few chapters of Pip's childhood and up to when he gets to become a gentleman, you are hooked. I personally loved this book. It was one of the only books I read in my freshman year of high school, and now I am glad that I read it. It was wonderful."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This was a great book because of the way that he made it seem that you were there.Also because of the way he kept you on the edge of your seat, and the way that all the characters are all familiarized to each other makes the book good but hard to understand,except the way that he wrote it in Old English made it hard to read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I first read this book when I was 12 or 13 - ten years later I decided to read it again because I remember loving it so much. It was just as good the second time round.While not his best book (of the ones I've read David Copperfield takes that prize) it is a thoroughly enjoyable read with larger than life charcters and, in places, Dickens' trademark subtle, sarcastic humour. Add a great storyline and you've got a great book.I cannot believe that so many younger people are panning this book. Not being full of adrenalin-packed scenes does not make it boring! Get an attention span!One more comment - while the recent film with Hawke and Paltrow was a good film in its own right, it lacks so much when compared to the book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am 16 years old and this was my summer reading book. I thought it was pretty good. Just because you have to read it for school, don't just discount it as a worthwhile book. Yes, it is long, but it DOES have a point. You have to keep in mind that Dickens publiched this in monthly installments in his magazine - so yes, it is long. But take your time and enjoy the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This review comes from a 15 year old male. I found this to be a rather good novel. If you are willing to read a big novel, do so and you should find some enjoyment in this book. If you can't stand reading some pages with just too much detail to get to the actual plot, avoid. Email me your comments, peace."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations has been one of the first of many novels I happen to touch upon fashioned by Charles Dickens. I set forth to reading it with a mind not interested but curious. Zeal may be the one motive that takes me through the first part of the novel. Fleeting moments of ambivalence of good and evil throughout the novel can always be found in one's life. As have been articulated, I find myself in Pip's reaction to what his fate and destiny has brought him. Pip's oscillation between compunction and remoselessness, egotism and selflessness is the cardinal element upon whcih the story is built .On the other hand, the plotting of the novel is superbly constructed, with the lives of countlss characters interwined with one and other. Miss Havisham, I reckon, is one of the best of them. This is one great novel that you should not miss. Miss it and you shall lose what is more valuable than Pip's expectations."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a classic story of unrequited love and growth. It teaches something to everyone who reads it. There is so much beauty and depth in this novel, it cannot be put into words. My advice for anyone and everyone who will read this in the future is to treasure every moment you spend reading this book. Take every detail in and you will never regret the time you spent because it is entertaining and absolutely thrilling. There are a lot of twists and turns in the plot as well as the emotions in the characters and it literally brought tears to my eyes."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read this book in 5th grade and I loved it! I still do. It is the best book. I think it is not boring at all and is very very very funny!!!! I think that everyone will like it once they get into it!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I think that two clarificifactions need be made to edify those who thought this book &quot;sucked&quot;, and that the characters were &quot;insane&quot;. Dickens is exaggerating! For example, there are hardly any people in real life like Jaggers, who do everything in such a business-like way. And yet he is very interesting and highly entertaining. And for everyone who thinks there were too many details: try to imagine just a bleak straightforward account of Pip's life. A good novel shouldn't just be a summary. And if you think it's wordy and too descriptive, try IVANHOE (another great book). Regarding the alternate ending: YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE FOCUS OF THIS BOOK IS NOT PIP&quot;S LOVE FOR ESTELLA. Who gives a damn whether he marries her or not? The focus of the story is on Pip's aspiring to such expectaions, and being drawn away from his family and humble origins, until he discovers the true treasures of life. I loved this book, and if you do not think it ranks as a classic, then what does?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is the story of a young boy, Pip, and how he struggles to reach the experiences of Estella, the girl he loves, as he grows up and matures. This novel, written by Charles Dickens, explains the disappointment of loving someone without response, and being unsatisfied with one's life, because of having such high expectations that one cannot meet. I liked the way that the author portrays the characters and the setting to give a resemblance of the theme. I was interested throughout the story, for it is gripping and unpredictable. I sincerely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys novels that one can relate to with a deep meaning. Also, to anyone that likes a challenge Great Expectations is an ideal book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When a game of leap-frog goes awry, young Pip Maplethorp's father is killed.With the family crumb-winner out of the picture, Pip is forced to travel to London where he finds employment as a Governess to the Lingus family (whose daughter, Constance, taunts him with cries of \\"you're lost - lost in a Fog of Lag !\\"). On day, while gathering pond scum, Pip meets and befriends Dr. Wetherbee. This chance meeting provides the book with one of it's few moments of comic relief, as Dr. Wetherbee repeatedly strikes Pip about the face and head with a cricket bat that he affectionately calls \\"Trevor\\". I won't ruin the book for you by telling you what Pip sees behind the potting shed that makes him no longer desire to be a Pediatrist, but I will tell you that, after reading that chapter, I never looked at pudding the same way again. I predict that this book will have resurgence in popularity and soon everybody will be saying, \\" Is that your Dickens in your hand?\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is Dickens' greatest novel, and one of the best of all time. Full of some of his most memorable characters, such as Magwitch (convict with a heart -- or liver), Miss Havisham, Pumblechook, Jaggers, Wemmick and more. From the opening graveyard scene to the final confrontation between Pip and Estella, you're hooked, laughing and crying. Pip is the Dickens character with the most psychologically realistic growth, and is therefore the author's most sympathetic hero. Wonderful plot, wonderful description, an absolute must. I highly recommend the Bantam paperback because the introduction by John Irving, &quot;The King of the Novel&quot;, is just as extraordinary in its own way. It's a superb, personal, passionate defense of Dickens that has affected me as much as any of Irving's best novels."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"While reading the reviews that others had written, I was amazed at how many people did not like this book. Maybe if you weren't so rushed into reading this book, you might actually enjoy it. Some of the reviews may stop you from reading this book, but I am telling you to read it. It is very descriptive, has a wonderful plot, and a great author. Ignore the other reviews because this book is clearly a classic and will ALWAYS be a classic."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Yes, it's hard to believe. Not a page is wasted. There are no digressions and few apparent digressions; the story - admittedly a long story - is swiftly and cleanly told, and it contains all the character growth, suspense, and frippery that one could reasonably ask of any story. This is DESPITE the fact that the book has all the virtues of any Dickens novel. The languge is, as usual, witty and a delight to read - in fact, more so than usual: it turns out that first person narration suits Dickens. All of the charcters are memorable - in fact, more so than usual: it comes as a great surprise to hear that this is the Dickens novel with the fewest characters, if you actually number them. The usual quota of gorgeous incident is there: in fact, more. And so on. It's hard to imagine a more nearly perfect book. -And there's one other thing I should mention. \\"Great Expectations\\" probably has a special personal appeal to many different sorts of people, but I would like to especially, from personal experience, commend the novel to graduate students. I hope they'll see what I mean."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"An undeniably solid book. I can certainly identify with Pip, but it was, at times, drab.

For a younger reader the language can be difficult, so I helped him as much as I could. I thoroughly enjoyed the story though! I like Dickens' since of humor as well as the way he kept you hanging on wondering just how this was going to end. As we get farther and farther away from the lifestyle of the 1800's I think it is important to look back and see what life was like before technology. I also enjoy the British take on things. I don't always &#34;get it&#34; until I re-read it a time or two, but the humor is there. (SPOILER ALERT!) I actually thought the ending was sad until my son pointed out that in class they considered the fact that when Pip &#34;saw no shadow of another parting from her,&#34; could mean that they were never seperated again.

Great tie in of all the characters and relationships of each to the main character. I preferred the author's original ending."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book was surprisingly funny, but I went into not really knowing what to expect beyond that it's a \\"classic\\". The plot revolves around the rise of a young man, Pip, in society due to a mysterious benefactor. The subplot of Miss Havisham in her lonely house is creepy and introduces us to Estella, the love interest of Pip. At times the writing felt antiquated and I had to reread some passages to get the gist of the meaning, but it was fun to feel sort of challenged as a reader."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I have absolutely no doubts whatsoever that Charles Dickens, if he lived today, would still classify as an author's author. He's a master of all the things that make for great writing and storytelling. Dickens has an ear for dialogue most authors would kill their own mothers to possess. He also is a master of creating vivid scenery, another sign of excellence essential to great writing and one which many authors lack. Finally, but not least in importance, Dickens knows character development. He REALLY knows how to develop intriguing characters, to the point where many of his books spawned figures that have become literary archetypes. Not bad for a guy who grew up in extremely adverse circumstances. He even spent some time in a factory sticking labels on bottles after his father's imprisonment for debt. Most people wouldn't recover from such poverty, but Dickens did. He went on to a successful career in journalism before settling down as an author of serial novels. This format, which allowed Dickens to write and release his stories piecemeal, made him a great success with the public. The anticipation for the latest chapter or two of his stories often led to near riots. Not many writers can elicit such a response today.Many consider \\"Great Expectations\\" a seminal work by a master. Millions have read it, most unwillingly, but most consider it one of Dickens's most accessible stories. It's a tale about a youngster named Phillip Pirrip, known throughout the story as Pip, and his rise from relative obscurity to the heights of wealth and privilege. As the story opens, we see Pip lamenting the passing of his parents in the local cemetery. Their deaths resulted in Pip living with an older sister and her blacksmith husband Joe. Life is tough in Pip's village. His sister wields a heavy hand against her younger brother, relatives like Uncle Pumblechook berate him, and they live in a place where convicts often escape from barges floating on the river nearby. In fact, Pip has a frightening encounter with one of these prisoners at the beginning of the book. His actions, undertaken at the command of this felon, result in a series of incidents that lead Pip to the home of the local recluse, a dour old woman by the name of Havisham. This woman, as rich as a lord but as unhappy as one could ever be, takes a liking to Pip and keeps him around for entertainment.It is during his tenure as Havisham's court jester that Pip comes into contact with several important figures that feature prominently in the story's later episodes. He meets the cold yet beautiful Estella, Havisham's adopted daughter, and falls in love with her. He also makes an initial contact with the old lady's lawyer, the highly successful Mr. Jaggers, and an odd young man named Herbert. All play an integral part in what is to follow, namely the announcement (through Jaggers) that Pip has suddenly come into fortune, or great expectations, that require him to move to London in order to train as a gentlemen. In London Pip spends time with Jaggers, his assistant Wemmick, Herbert, and even Estella. He spends his money, helps his best friend in covert ways, and wonders who in the world set him up with this money and property. Jaggers makes it clear that he isn't supposed to dig too deep concerning the origins of the fortune. Instead, he is to wait until the day when the individual responsible steps forward. When that happens Pip's world as he knows it nearly collapses. He must move heaven and earth to avert disaster while at the same time coming to terms with who he is and what his future holds.\\"Great Expectations\\" is, in a word, great. It contains all of the hallmarks one associates with Dickens. The characters, everyone from Wemmick to Jaggers to Havisham to Joe, sparkle brightly as fully formed individuals living and laboring under very real problems. Atmosphere is divine: Pip's village and London come to life under the writer's pen. Even the author's penchant for examining social ills moves to the fore in a chapter that looks at the horrific conditions in London's main prison. Another real plus is the humor. If you haven't read Dickens, you don't know what your missing in the humor department. This author has an amazing sense of what is funny, and it is nowhere more apparent than in the scene in which Pip and Herbert take in a play starring one of our hero's relatives. This short chapter along with the ones describing Wemmick's abode are absolute masterpieces of hilarity, and they're actually bright spots in what is otherwise an occasionally dark piece of writing. And last, but not least, there is the downbeat conclusion. There are actually two conclusions to \\"Great Expectations\\". Make sure you pick up a copy that has both of them.About the only thing \\"Great Expectations\\" lacks is length; it's one of Dickens's shortest novels, which is probably the reason millions of teachers assign this book to their students. That's unfortunate because most kids want nothing to do with this book once it's forced upon them when in fact they could actually benefit from reading it. Why? Because \\"Great Expectations\\" teaches us a lot about love and identity, two things that matter quite a bit (or should matter) to young people. The teachers ought to assign something like \\"Hard Times\\" and let those who want more seek out \\"Great Expectations\\". The prevailing opinion on this book is that it is semi-autobiographical. It doesn't really matter whether the story is about the author's life or not. What is important, I think, is that this story attains a perfection that few books ever reach. That's why it's a classic, I guess. If you haven't read Dickens before, you should start right here."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations, 1860-'61, Dickens's second to last completed novel is the first tome I have ever read and is one of the best books I've ever read.The story centers upon Pip who is orphaned and lives with his mean sister and her kind husband Joe. The book's classic opening is when Pip meets an escaped convict and he forces Pip to give him food and then later is caught. Little did Pip know that this occasion will live on and he will be reminded of it in a very unexpected fashion later in the bookYoung Pip is then sent to Satis House to meet the very mysterious and eccentric Miss Havisham who, jilted at the altar spends the rest of her cursed recluse life in her rotting, yellow wedding dress in Satis House. Pip also meets Estella, a beautiful, yet very cold and proud girl brought up by Miss Havisham to hate men as revenge for her fiance's betrayal.Great Expectations is the story of Pip's life and of all the surprises (there's a lot of 'em folks) hopes: some lived some smashed, and of course, Dickensesque eccentrics who populate the book.Great Expectations is the first tome I have ever finished and I must say that it was worth it. Since I didn't have the book for a while, it took me about three months to read it but have no fear, for this is a pretty quick read with many twists and turns along the way.This book is often considered Dickens's masterpiece. Well, I don't really know about that but it has to be close to that. It certainly was a great read and I think you will agree."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I've taught this book in 9th grade for years because it is a curriculum requirement. During that time, I have raved about the incredible abilities of Dickens to create memorable characters, plot fascinating fiction, make the lives of ordinary people in England memorable, write incredibly descriptive passages . . . .The time has come to tell the truth. While it may be a great *work of literature*, Great Expectations is a tough book to like.There is much to appreciate - in the intellectual sense of the word - about GE, from carefully drawn characters to an infinitely detailed plot. Without exception, students love to play *connect the characters* as the novel progresses. They discuss the unrequited love between Pip and Estella, Biddy and Pip - they love the relationship between Joe and Pip. They are fascinated and repulsed by Miss Havisham and her house. They are shocked by Magwitch, and enthralled by his sacrifice. Truly, this has all the makings of a 9th grade *hit*! So what's the problem? Language,length, and format.The language is off-putting. So much is colloquial to the time and difficult to bring current. Joe's dialect (along with the convict's) is VERY difficult for my deep south students to imitate when reading aloud, and sometimes even difficult for them to decipher at all. Sentences can go on (and on and on and on and on) so that the end hardly seems connected to the beginning. While common when Dickens was writing, these patterns are a bit difficult for a modern audience.Length and format are a problem that go together. Originally published as a serial, this novel was presented a chapter or two at a time, with a wait between installments. That allowed a reader to digest the events in a chapter, contemplate the relationships, discuss them with friends and build up anticipation for the next installment. By virtue of that style, many side-stories are included that have little bearing on the overall plot. Likewise, there is much detail included that seems almost irrelevant when one is reading the novel in full. Those are the very things that fostered interest in the serial, and yet in a novel, they seem extraneous and confusing. At the end, the novel seems (just a bit) overwritten (and perhaps that is because it wasn't originally a novel).In summary, my feelings about this novel are mixed. The story itself is fascinating, but I find myself eternally dreading that time of year when I will yet again introduce it to another crop of unsuspecting students . . ."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"In this delightful edited version of Dickens immortal tale, Hugh Laurie reads. Now you may or may not know Mr. Laurie spent years in London as a kind of character actor. Today he;s playing House on TV. But, he reads GE as each of the characters. As he is so talented each voice is hardly like the other. Some may remember him from Black Adder and the silly prince. But here you see just how versatile he is.As for the story...Dickens' twists are remarkable. GE may have the funnest of the who did what whens. If your just getting to know the man and his works or love him to pieces. This version is superb."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"GREAT EXPECTATIONS has long been acknowledged as one of Dickens' best, but it gets even better under the smooth voice of narrator Martin Jarvis, an actor who was named Reader of the Year in the UK and who lends his passionate voice to this brilliant unabridged recording.

DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was just 10 years old, when I first read an abridged version of this Dickens Classic. I must have read it many times since, and everytime I read it, I am filled with array of emotions, and a deep respect for the author. Pip, the hero, is a character that embodies hopes, disappointments and dreams of every boy. As he narrates his life, we grow with him, see many people come in and go out of his life, and we feel with him his emotions and predicaments. Life is full of surprises, unexpected twists and turns, and this novel is a great chronicle of the possibilities of fate. But most importantly, this is a story of pining... and a novel worth pining for.Miss Havisham, the old lady, epitomizes eccentricity, while Estella in her cold abandon represents every heartbreaker. This story is about pining, about love, about friendship (especially Pip and Joe, and later Pip and Herbert), about relationships, and most importantly about what one feels and lives by. Like all Dickens novels, this is a very well written story, and is much more engrossing than any of its on screen versions. This is a story that must be read at leisure and it must be failing of the reader to try and compare it with some cheap paperback that one can scram through while watching a movie and munching chips and cola. Classics deserve respect, attention and concentration: dedicate yourself to one, and trust me you will discover a lot more. A lot more about the novel and a lot more about your own self.We all have Great Expectations, and this one by Dickens beats them all!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Written as a serial publication, Great Expectations is very fast paced and the character development is superb. It is also very easy to read. The plot is well developed and the number of characters and the interaction of subplots is masterful.When a terrified four year old Pip is coerced into bringing an escaped convict food, he sets into motion a chain of events that will determine the direction of his life and explain that of others. Having served in the house of Miss Havisham, a woman jilted on her wedding day and filled with hate and revenge for the male species, Pip receives notice of &quot;great expecations&quot; - the term for the potential inheritance of a large fortune. From his humble origins as the son of a blacksmith, he is destined to become a gentleman. But the identity of his mysterious benefactor continues to haunt him. And the lovely Estella, for whom he craves, could she be part of this inheritance? Why is someone grooming him to be a gentleman? Who? All these questions and more are answered as the story unfolds in this powerful work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Looking at the reviews for this book, it seems many are reading this book for the first time, as I did, as part of an English Literature course in high school.Believe me, we can all assure you that this can be a difficult book for a ninth grader to enjoy. After all, we're talking about blacksmiths, pirates, and so on. Hardly things the average teenager of the 2000s can relate to.But if you're in your twenties, thirties, or forties, this book is as compelling a novel as you'll ever read. It's an opportunity to look back at Pip and ourselves, the great expectations we all have, and the major surprises, disappointments, and regrets of life.The adult reader can understand the vindictiveness of Miss Havisham, the pride of Magwitch, the true and rare friendship of Herbert Pocket, and, of course, Estella. Each man has in his life an Estella.Beyond the true-to-life tale of hope and defeat, is the wry humor throughout the book that a more mature reader can appreciate.Surprise yourself. If you hated this in high school, pick it up now; you may find this is one of the best books you ever read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It is such a good and interesting read everytime I read it! If you're getting started on Dickens, I would totally recommend \\"Great Expectations.\\" Dickens considered it a short novel (probably true for him, considering the length of some of his other books like \\"David Copperfield\\") but there is so much depth in \\"Great Expectations\\", so many layers to it that it doesn't fall short in content.

It has been severely abridged (with a very inconspicuous mention of the fact) for no obvious reason. It also has an asinine foreword by some dubious character. Do not touch it if you like literature!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"In honor of Charles Dickens' 200th birthday, I re-read one of the first of his novels that I experienced originally over 30 years ago. After having read some eight or nine other Dickens novels, revisiting Great Expectations was a somewhat different experience this time around.Like David Copperfield, this is a first person narrative. Being inside the mind of the central intelligence and narrator, the reader can only know what he knows. Therefore, there are fewer narrative threads and multitudes of characters to weave into a complex tapestry than there are in other great multi-layered novels such as Bleak House and Little Dorrit. The jovial wit and exuberance of Pickwick becomes saturated with a world weariness and verges on cynicism in most of the novels of the second half of Dickens' career. As one of his last completed novels, Great Expectations fits within this pattern.Pip is not quite the bland, colorless character that Oliver Twist or David Copperfield are. True, the structure of the plot almost demands that he be a passive recipient of much of the action. His fate is mapped out for him by the anonymous benefactor from his youth and it is not until well into the second half of the novel that he actively seeks to steer the course of his life with each subsequent piece of knowledge he acquires. Pip is not quite an innocent. From an early age, he is consumed by guilt over unknown sins he feels he has committed. He does fall prey to vanity and he descends easily into spendthrift habits and enjoys his unearned prosperity with shameless hedonism. His greatest sins seem to be pride and vanity, leading to the snobbery that fuels the snubbing of his faithful and saintly brother-in-law Joe. To his credit, he is self-analytical and examines these shortcomings as soon as he realizes he possesses them.The sentimentality that often mars even the greatest of Dickens' novels is muted in this one. Pip is fully aware that he is no angel and there are few \`catch phrases' as often appear in his other novels to signal the reader to be moved. On the other hand, the coincidences are piled a little too high for my taste and the evil Orlick subplot seems to be one adversity too many for this plot which can sustain its own weight on the saga of Pip, Estella, Miss Havisham and Magwich.As much as any novel, in Great Expectations Dickens captures the torture of a male's infatuation with an \`unattainable' female beauty, especially one so willing to inflict heartache. This novel still reaches across the centuries with an emotional power that is timeless and universal. Regarding the so called happy ending that Dickens revised as a concession to public sentiment, the ending for this novel is not quite so clear cut as one might expect in a Dickens novel. The last sentence, in particular, includes a double negative that in no obvious way equals an unequivocal positive. By doing this, Dickens is able to sustain the tone of the novel leading up to it and not betray the thematic thread he has followed for almost 500 pages. Despite its shortcomings, Great Expectations possesses a power never surpassed in his novels."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Anyone who loves the english langauge language will enjoy this book. Dickens is a master of description bringing to life the colorful characters. So, if you haven't read Dickens for years, pay him a visit ."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had great expectations, because I had listened to a very good Charles Dickens recording by Martin Jarvis earlier (Hard Times), and Great Expectations was also good, even if it did not make me laugh quite as much as the Hard Times audiobook."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Read this when I was about 10yrs old, then saw the movie at an old theatre. I've probably reread at least a few times later. Never gets old, its like replaying an old classic.I remember reading the other books in print and it didn't have any guides or history or word translations. Used a dictionary and encyclopedia to figure certain things out.I purchased the BN classic and it provides a bit more history that one would have known, unless you've done a research paper on it. Other helpful insight & information one may not know during that time period or era. BN does a pretty good job."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations by Charles Dickens is one of the greatest novels I have read. First, I admit, I have difficult transitioning to Dicken's novels. They are written in English, but not in the version of the langauge I speak. However, after reading for a while, I am able to adjust to his style.This novel is great for many reasons. First, it helps me to understand the poverty and hardships faced by the poor in England during his time. Whenever I read one of Dicken's novels, I am always left with an attitude of gratitude. Additionally, in this novel, nothing works out the way I expect or want it to. I wish that Pip would not have acted as he did once he came into his great expectations. I wish that things could have worked out differently with Miss Havisham and Estella. But, the ending is well done. The twists are what I enjoy most from Dicken's novels. I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As background information, I am in the process of reading most of Dickens 22 novels. I bought the Penguin Popular Classics version of the novel. It is very basic and comes in a simple green cover. It contains no introduction or analysis, just the text plus a very brief historical sketch of Dickens. It seems to be an excellent value for the money and I bought three Dickens novels in the series. I was a bit disappointed in that one book seemed to fall apart as I read it: the binding seemed very weak and cheaply made. It was marginally okay for the present book which is just 400 pages, and the book did not fall apart, but did seem damaged after one read. Another Dickens novel, which was 700 pages long, fell apart with at least 50 pages coming loose. After this bad experience, I bought other versions of Dickens's works - Wordsworth Classic versions and the regular Penguin Classic versions, the ones with the photo on the covers.Charles Dickens, who lived from 1812 to 1870, is the best know male English writer of the 19th century. He authored 22 novels plus numerous short pieces. Most of his writing was first written in serialized form, later published as single novels.A young Dickens at the age of 12 had the unenviable job of attaching labels 10 hours a day at the Warren's boot blacking factory. That experience shaped much of his writing career. Still in his teens he became a law clerk, then later in his twenties a journalist. The last job as a reporter led to the serialized writing of his novels. His works were social commentaries with larger than life characters, or colorful caricatures, living in the slums of London. He was a critic of poverty, social injustice, and the slow moving court system. Those themes permeate most of his novels and it is present her in Great Expectations. This is a novel set in London and the countryside close to London. It is a story of a young boy who wants to grow up and become wealthy and to be a gentleman. Those are his \\"great expectations.\\"Without giving away critical plot elements, it is the story of a young boy called Pip, whose parents are dead, and who lives with his sister and her husband Jo who is a blacksmith. They want Pip to learn the trade and be a blacksmith as well. They live in a small town near marshlands near London. His ambitions are grander and he wants to escape to London and become a gentleman. Will Pip find happiness? Will he succeed? Action shifts back and forth between the small town where Pip first lived and the city of London. It involves Pip, lawyers, accountants, Pip's new friends, his love interest, etc.The novel is not used by Dickens for any pressing social issues, although one might argue that it shows how Pip's ambition blinds him to his true friends. But mostly it is pure entertainment. The book is a classic but has a choppy feel that one can attribute to the way it was written. It was written as a series of dramatic stories for popular serialization which were then combined to make a single novel. I enjoyed the read and would highly recommend the book.Having read 10 of Dickens's novels I still rate David Copperfield as best, and ahead of the present book, both as a work of literature and for entertainment value. In many ways the two novels are similar, but the plot is far more interesting and realistic in David Copperfield, and Dickens has many more interesting characters in that book, and as a bonus it is almost twice as long."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Beautifully binded book.

I love the way he writes, I love his wit and imagination. The twists and turns in the last third/quarter of the book are fantastic, keeps the page turning.

A wonderful novel of Pip who comes into his \\"great expectations\\" via an unknown benefactor -- who he believes to be Miss Havisham. We see how the influence of money and position affect Pip's relations with his family and former neighbors, and not necessarily for the better. There are lots of surprise twists and turns in the plot, especially about Miss Havisham and her adopted \\"daughter\\" Estella and her true parentage.As always, a Dickens novel is peopled with wonderful and unusual characters that eventually all play a part in telling the story. I understand that there were two endings of this book published. The version I read had only one ending and I don't know which one it was. I will have to search out another version of this book to see which I liked best."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My grandad recommended I read this. I will admit to being very skeptical on the first few pages. I had to read and re-read some of the passages quite a few times to undesrtand what was being said through the old english slang. However, once I passsed that, I found it to be a touching and very interesting story.It is filled with some of the greatest characters ever created in literature.Along the way you will find many truths applicable even in today's society and Dickens expresses it in way unique to him.Dickens has created one of the most beautiful novels ever written: Great Expectations. It's a must read for any book lover and it is by no means overated.This is one you would want keep as part of your collection. It is simply a treasure."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I loved this book. When my teacher first told us we had to read it I thought I would be bored. Boy, was I wrong. It was a little hard to get past the dialect, but what a great story. Dickens did a wonderful job with the characters and how all their lives are somehow connected."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"From the moment I discovered that \\"Great Expectations\\" was a mandatory book to read in many high schools I thought that I belonged to those happy people on whom, by good luck, it hadn't been forced in their teenage years. I do not think that even if it had, the novel wouldn't have brought me pleasure later, when I grew up, but my past experience with it would have certainly impeded taking the book in my hands again. There is little doubt that in many cases high school stifles the willingness to read literature (not \\"bestsellers\\", however) when young people are confronted with such serious and complex works as \\"Great Expectations\\".The situation with \\"Great Expectations\\" is similar to that when a high school student is forced to read a fairly technical textbook on contemporary physics: there are chances that he or she will like or even be enthralled by some ideas in the book, but inability to follow and understand details (although symbols might be recognised) will almost certainly produce a negative opinion of it in the end.\\"Great Expectations\\" is one of the greatest novels I have ever read. Often humorous, with a carefully planned structure and set of heroes, wonderful narration and an unmatched appeal to senses, it reveals a story of unrequited love, an affair which now stands out as one of the most painful in classical literature. The complex relationship of the principal heroes - Pip, a touchingly honest and faithful young gentleman, and Estella, his beautiful and highbrow tormentor, are at the heart of the plot. But such original figures as Miss Havisham, Mr Jaggers, Mr Pumblechook, Joe Gargery and Biddy supply a rich background - each of them being a perfect example of a character in literature. For, as Alphonse Daudet noted, \\"It is the business of the novelist to create characters, not to write fine prose\\". Though Dickens' fine prose is also above all praises.But \\"Great Expectations\\" is much more than a simple romance - it is a great life lesson. Why do people \\"destined for each other\\" often end up being apart? What makes us break other people's hearts? How long will true love last? What obstacles surmount?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"What can I say that hasn't been said already? &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a tremendous novel from the introductory paragraph to the final sentences. The plot is deep and intricate, and there's even a surprising plot revelation occuring late in the book about the origin of Pip's wealth and opportunity in life. The characters are all well-defined and inherently interesting, and such major characters as Pip, Estella, Joe, Miss Havisham, and others vividly live in the mind. Even minor characters such as Mrs. Joe and the Aged Person are memorable and amusing. The novel's storyline, beginning with Pip's early childhood and ending in his late middle age, is epic in breadth. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; treats the reader to a delightful plot and scene for all of its five hundred pages.Even better, however, is the brilliant prose Dickens gives us in the novel. It is humorous, moving, touching, witty, clever, and always perfectly phrased. Never for a single second does the reader feel bored. Like many great works of literature, there are plenty of moments where the writing is almost awe-inspiring in its beauty and language. With a talent as great as Dickens, one could write about almost anything and it would be tremendous reading. When paired with the brilliant plot of &quot;Great Expectations,&quot; it feels almost heaven-sent.Many readers see the term &quot;classic&quot; on a novel and feel that it becomes a type of chore, and add it to a laundry list of literature that somebody felt would be good for them. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a classic, but it's not at all the literary equivalent of medicine. It's a delightful treat, and a quick read despite its length. I can't imagine reading this and not treasuring it. It is, quite simply, fantastic."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I studied this book for 2 years in high school and never really read the book itself until a month before my super majorly imprtant exam. Up till then, i was surviving on cliff notes and whatever my tutor said. I had tried to read the book at least a hundred times but fell asleep after the first page.I give this book 4 stars for the fact that dickens is such an AMAZING writer. i'm not saying this coz its a classic. after studying this book for 2 years, you get to know the structure, the language, the relationships between the different plots and sub-plots. and i was BLOWN AWAY by the BRILLIANT way dickens tied everything together. SIMPLY AMAZINGI admit, it IS a tiring read. but like what another review said, Great Expectations was meant to be read chapter by chapter, one per week or soemthing like that. the book i read came with a timeline which shows the publication of each chapter.I do recommend this book. just make sure that you're really really awake when you're reading it. pay attention to the details e.g. how the atmosphere reflects the different characters stuff like that. Read it once. and read it AGAIN. i swear the 2nd time you read it, everything will become clearer. Read it a third time and you'll notice how Dickens pulls the novel off. pretty intriguing."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I know lots of people will flay me for saying this, but this book has a lot of repeat value. I could read it every year, for five years at least without getting bored doing it. I had read the abridged version in school, and a year ago i had seen the movie (featuring gweneth paltrow and ethan hawke). I liked these so much that inspite of knowing the story i bought the unabidged version and was plesantly surprised how much i enjoyed it. Both the movie and the abridged version concentrate only with Pip's relation with estella. The book is infact much wider in its scope. For example Pip's relation with Mr.Pocket fills more pages than that with estella.Charles dickens surely spins a superb yarn of pip, his ambitions, desires, weaknesses, and pureness of character which is so entirely credible and believeable that it seems like an autobiographical account told in the third person. This inspite of the novel containing eccentric characters like miss havisham difficult to find in actuality. Another important contribution of this novel is to portray the relation between pip and estella. Its extremely difficult to say what exactly it is. Infatuation? No. It was the very soul of his existance without which he could not exist. It lasted from childhood till the end. Love? Unlikely. He was torturing himself in her company and this can hardly be called love. Hatred? No. Vengence? No. On miss havisham's part maybe but not on that of pip or estella. There's no answer forthcoming. Just when we thought we were intelligent and mature enough to understand relationships Mr. Dickens comes along to tell us to start from kindergarten once again.I found Mr. Dickens style of writing quite modern. Of course there's an influence of the times he lived in but the novel has a very modern tang. In fact if the means of transport were cars instead of horses, there was electricity instead of candle light and so on, making only such cosmetic changes the novel would definitely seem to be written very recently. I just realised - the movie proves this."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I must admit, this review is slightly prejudiced. I am a high school student, and I read this book for fun. I had tried to read Dickens before, but found myself having a hard time ploughing through the complex vocabulary and intricate parlor dialogue of Hard Times. But I decided to take another stab at Dickens, perhaps with something a little more palatable. All of Dickens' novels, I realized at the end of Book I!!, are VERY, VERY SLOW -- AT FIRST. Then Dickens decides to play on his own soporific introductions!!!!! There is a crucial turn in events for Pip, and the book takes off. Every few paragraphs, there's another handhold so to speak, to keep the reader's suspense and to keep the plot building. Both the language and the many interwoven plots are delectable and unavoidably magnetic -- your hands just can't seem to put down the book, no matter what you do. This book has it all. It also helped me understand why I hated reading the Odyssey for English. (Translations always lose some of the vivacity and fullness that the author has pumped his or her very original work full of, and it is this fullness that made the work so great in the first place.) It is a long read, and you have to be willing to be patient with the beginning. But it's definitely worth it. And the more you read, the easier it gets. After reading this book, I feel inspired to read all of Dickens' works!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When I found out I had to read Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens for school, I was extremely dissapointed. I had already read A Tale of Two Cities, and absolutely hated it. Students in other classes had read Great Expectations and not liked it either, so I figured I would not enjoy it either. But I decided I would read it anyway, because it is considered to be one of the best books of all time. The books starts out fairly slow, and it takes the reader a few chapters to get used to Dickens's writing style, for he uses an abudance of description. He was paid by the word so he had incentive to do so. For those who are able to survive the first few chapters, they will enjoy an extremely lovable book and not be dissapointed. The book is timeless, with the basic story line being one that has affected almost everyone sometime in their life; falling in love with somebody who does not return the feelings. Pip, the main character, falls in love with an exotic and beautiful girl, Estella, but of course she does not have any feelings for him. So Pip does everything he can to win her approval, and most importantly her heart. It is hard to skip around in the book. While some passages might seem as if they have nothing to do with the story, they do. Everything in the story is tied together somehow. Skimming the book is not going to help. Certain events and people the reader thinks are insignificant or forgot completley, will appear over and over throughout the book. I am glad that i decided to read Great Expectations, despite the negative remarks from peers. I found out that most of them never made it past the first few chapters, so they missed out on the good parts. The only reason I did not give the book a higher score is that parts of it are slow and dry, but stick with it, you will not be upset."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens takes you on a ride that will keep the reader enthralled throughout.

How did I get through high school without reading it? My hs English teachers chose the heartbreaker, David Copperfield, so it's not my first Dickens. I can see that Dickens can tell a story.

It's funny, I couldn't get through it as a kid, but now I've really enjoyed it. Charles Dickens writes these characters that seem so alive. He describes them so well, their little mannerisms, that that part alone fascinated me. Pip's perception of them felt really spot on for a kid. He was definitely put upon to some degree, but much of what he felt was horrible behavior toward him by the adults was really stuff that's common to every kid. It reminded me of how I felt sometimes toward relatives and friends of my parents, all of whom I like now, and I both laughed and felt horrified to realize it. Anyway, very very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This was a Book Group choice, but I really enjoyed reading it.

I read it when I was a child, and having been re reading it ever since. It is told through Pip, the narrator. His voice is clear and realistic.The reader feels for him as if he were a real person. Miss Havishman is a sad character and her disappointment in love is very understandable. Mr. Jaggers the lawyer is sharp as most lawyers ought to be and are. I felt for Magwitch, Pip's benefactor. And I understood Pip's feelings towards him when they meet again after many years, Estella is not my favorite character, but she learns to be a better person. Charles Dickens is, needless to say, a timeless writer, one of the very best. Eugenia RenskoffDifferent Flags"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens, Great ExpectationsDickens tells an intriguing yarn, creates suspense and amuses us with a range of eccentrics, friendly such as Wemmick or Herbert Pocket, or macabre as with Pumblechook or Jaggers. As in David Copperfield, he gives us strong and often threatening women, like Betsy Trotwood, and here Mrs Joe. Both of these semi-autobiographical novels begin with a shock to a child that reverberates through the rest of the action. Both are seen from the dual child-adult perspective; both belong to the Bildungsroman genre. Both have been repeatedly adapted for stage, screen and radio drama, and yet both have their weaknesses of characterisation and narrative tedium.Several decades ago it was not unusual to find a Dickens novel as a set text for public examinations. Today this would be unheard of: \`Too long, Sir!' \`Boring, Sir!' I recall attempting to \`teach' Nicholas Nickleby to secondary modern school pupils in the Sixties. Then that outmoded method of \`reading around the class' was still in vogue. The lads enjoyed that and were doubled up laughing as Nickle Arse and Queers went about their business. Those who say they still love Dickens today, are probably thinking of one or more of the excellent BBC adaptations rather than the text of the book itself. Reading a Dickens novel today, except as a Simplified Classics text, is no mean feat.It has taken me several weeks to get through Great Expectations, reading it in bite-sized pieces, often as a Book at Bedtime treat. That is probably the best and most appropriate method, since like most Victorian novels it was designed for serialisation, which also of course accounts for the repetitiveness and the prolonging of tension by ending each Part on a cliff-hanger. It is not easy for the modern reader to read with the eagerness and innocence of his Victorian counterpart. The sheer thickness of the books and the at times plodding nature of the narrative demand a time and patience that for most of us today is in short supply.Nevertheless, I am pleased to have made the effort, and was for the most part captivated by the narrative and relished the sheer exuberance of the language, as when Dickens allows Pumblechook or Joe Gargery to indulge in their respective bumbling monologues. True, I got tired of Pip's continual self-analysis as he expounds on his guilt in rejecting the advances of good friends like Joe, Biddy and, later, the convict Magwitch aka Provis. I cringed, too, at the moral miracles of a converted Miss Havisham, kneeling before Pip. And the fire was an unconvincing contrivance. As for the cooked-up non-serial happy ending, the less said the better."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read this book when I was in high school.

I decided to try Great Expectations as my first introduction to the great English author, on the recommendation of a friend of mine. And I was not disappointed!That said, I had a bit of a difficult time at first getting used to Dickens's use of language, and I found the first part of the book a little hard to get into, but I didn't have to struggle too much or for too long: after a short while the characters came alive for me and the story became so absorbing, that I could not put the book down. The novel has a fantastic, very tight plot, and the characters are memorable. This always works for me as a reader!Great Expectations was my first Dickens read, but it will certainly not be the last."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"** This review is a synthesis of the three Charles Dickens books that I've read:A Tale of Two Cities (Penguin Classics),Great Expectations (Penguin Classics), andDavid Copperfield (Penguin Classics). The rationale for reviewing in this manner is to provide a foundational point of reference for those new to Dickens' work.In the last two years I have read, in this order, Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations, and David Copperfield. All three of these books were exceptional reads, and if you are thinking about dipping your toes in the waters of Charles Dickens you can't go wrong with any of them. However, notwithstanding the fact that these three books are all in the upper echelon of world literature, I have no difficulty in distinguishing between them and coming to the conclusion that they are properly ordered, from \\"most best\\" to \\"least best\\": David Copperfield, Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations.It seems generally to be the case that, for those who have read just one of Dickens' books, Great Expectations is the book most people have been exposed to. And most people who read Great Expectations love it. The genre is probably best described as romance meshed with individual tragedy among numerous characters. However, perhaps the strongest part of the book is the manner in which the secondary characters present a contrast to the primary story. I liked the book very much, but I think it suffers from two flaws not present in the other works reviewed here. First, the characters are not as believable as in the other two works. Second, the plot follows an unlikely path, especially in the end. Concerning this second point, it should be noted that Dickens struggled with the ending of this work, and I think it shows.Tale of Two Cities ranks second in this group in my mind. This book is a combination of political intrigue, romance, and personal triumph. I rank this book above Great Expectations for the sole reason that the characters in this book are so strongly developed. I don't think I have been exposed to more memorable characters in any book I've ever read. The story is interesting, too, because it takes place against the backdrop of a historical event, the French Revolution. I think Dickens had an easier time writing a convincing plot in this story than in Great Expectations because he had the aid of a real historical event.Great Expectations and Tale of Two Cities are both excellent books, but David Copperfield is simply the best piece of literature I've ever read. To be sure, I'm only 24 and have only read 10 pieces of classic literature since my high school years. However, David Copperfield so outdid anything I've read that I feel more than comfortable in recommending it as certainly one of the best books of all time. Dickens did a remarkable job of capturing a wide variety of human emotions and mindsets. He was aided in this by two things. First, the length of the book gave him space to fully develop his sentiments. Second, the book is written in a first-person autobiographical voice, which I think made capturing sentiments much easier than in attempting to narrate them in the third-person. Further, because the book chronicles David's life from childhood through middle-age the reader is exposed to a wide variety of human thoughts. The characters, for the most part, are more believable and the plot is generally good; I took offense to only one chapter in the whole book.Now, if you haven't read any of Dickens' books, I don't recommend starting with David Copperfield. I would start with Great Expectations and work through a couple others before David Copperfield. In terms of the plots, David Copperfield is much more similar to Great Expectations than Tale of Two Cities. So if you loved Great Expectations I think you will be well satisfied with David Copperfield. The plot from Tale of Two Cities is the odd-ball of this trio. In any case, all three of these books are great pieces of literature... enjoy."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Many people scoffed this book back in my freshman English class, because it was Dickens, and Dickens meant \\"boring\\" to them. However, shrug off the normal tendencies to stereotype an old-time classic to be a bore, one can find a true delight in this beautiful story of a young man struggling with an impossible love, the pressures of money and society, and, of course, himself. It is an excellent, absolutely enriching read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is certainly one of my favorite books. It's about a boy named Pip who struggles to find his own identity. While struck with unfortunate circumstances, Pip remains resilient and continues his struggle in becoming a \\"gentleman.\\" Truly a Brittish classic, it has been called the unofficial autobiography of Dickens and it can be easily called one of his best works. The novel is filled with symbolism and characters that come to life as you read the pages. This book still graces my shelves and I look forward to reading it again. I recommend you pick it up and rea it too."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Perhaps the greates novel I have ever read. Not only enjoyable but contained relevan lessons for my life - you can't escape who you or where you come from by changing your circumstance."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Like several of the people on this review page, I had to read this book for a 9th grade English assignment. Unlike most of the people in my class, I read the whole book and liked it. The book is about a young English boy named Phillip \\"Pip\\" Pirrip living in 1800s England. He is the son of a blacksmith and then is invited to play at an old woman's house. The impression Pip gets from the old woman and her daughter is that Pip isn't good enough. From then on, he grows up and tries to get better for his life after getting a fortune, but things go downhill from that as he gets deep in debt and becomes ill. This book is by no means perfect and has plenty of flaws. The book is way too wordy and could probably be half as long as it is and still get a good point across. I also felt that the ending of the book was a little strange, but overall it was an okay book and I was not bored with it at any point."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"...the defect of almost all the movies (except, perhaps, the 1989 version with Jean Simmons as Miss Havisham (!)) is that the movies emphasize Pip's pursuit of Estella to the exclusion of almost all else. In truth, the core of the story is Pip's class strivings and his inability to distinguish the valuable from the shiny and superficial. Read the book and you will appreciate the character Biddy who is the polar opposite of Estella in every way, and the way, to paraphrase Othello, Pip \\"threw a pearl away richer than all he yearned for.\\"Some of Dickens' characters and coincidences are a little stretched, but they nevertheless are woven together very nicely in the fashion of a good suspense novel. Great Expectations is divided into three volumes, each representing a phase of Pip's Expectations. The structure is strangely like \\"The Monkey's Paw\\": The first expectation (wish) is for riches; the second expectation finds the granted wish not exactly what the protagonist thought it would be; and the third and final expectation leaves the protagonist trying to pick up the pieces.As another reviewer commented, do get an edition that includes the original ending. It is only a few paragraphs but it wraps up this morality tale in a way that is appropriate to the entire theme of the story. If you wonder where the \\"new, happier\\" ending was substituted, just look for the place in the very last chapter where Pip suddenly changes direction and makes a lie of what he has just told his family.If you feel that you cannot sit through the novel, then at least get the 1989 film version (though it is out of print--you will have to pay a little more than you might like) and watch it for probably the accurate representations of the various characters, if not some of the stellar performances of the most acclaimed 1946 version. If nothing else, you will see something very rare for any actor or actress--the opportunity to define two characters in the same classic. In 1946, Jean Simmons' Young Estella defined \\"beautiful but cruel\\" for a generation, and in 1989 the same Ms. Simmons revealed the pain but even greater cruelty of Miss Havisham."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is another book which is forced upon unsuspecting high school students. With many younger reviewers giving this classic 1 and 2 stars shows that this novel will not be appreciated by most studetns. If you hated this book in high school I recommend picking it up again after college.This novel follows the protagonist Pip, from inncocent boy, to dreaming adolecent, to proud gentelman, and comes full circle to the disullusioned adult. Tha characters he meets along the way are some of the most memorable in english literature, especially Miss Havishham, Estella, and Magwitch. Dickens also treats us, about half-way through, to perhaps the best twist of any novel I've ever read.The only thing I at first disliked about this novel were the bizarre coincidinces which caused seemingly unrelated characters to actually have close histories with each other. But I reconciled this for myself in the following way: A major theme of this novel are the machinations of characters to control other characters. Well we must not forget that there are meta-machiantions above this by Dickens himself, and for that all readers can be thankful."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens' Great Expectations portrays the life of the protagonist, Pip, and how he begins as a mistreated orphan and transforms into a gentleman with a mysterious benefactor. Set in the mid 19th century, Great Expectations is a novel with a surprising plot that keeps its readers guessing. Its' intriguing story line and interesting characters keep the story light-hearted and humerous, but Dickens' dreary descriptions and gloomy details bring also a sense of sadness and compassion to the novel. Aside from the novel being time consuming, indepth, and in great detail, Great Expectations is a classic novel that all should read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Though someone stated you have to be over 21 to appreciate this book (and I am 21 now) I first read this story when I was 14 years old, in 8th grade, and understood (and loved) it right away. Why? As an adolescent struggling with popularity (the modern, teenage equivalent of the English class system) and unrequited love, I immediately identified with Pip. Furthermore, the romantic atmosphere was completely intoxicating, from the vast marshes to the city of London; though the narrator describes it as disappointingly crowded and dirty my sense of the city from this book was much more elevated. I also admit I was helped by the updated Classics Illustrated comic book version of the book, which I peeked at now and then while I was reading Great Expectations--despite my aversion to revealing the ending before I reached it in the text (eventually, I succumbed to my temptations). If you can find this (probably) out-of-print illustrated version of the story--not sure what the status of Classic Illustrated is these days--make sure to buy it. But to return from my digression, the novel is where it's at. Dickens' impeccable imagination creates an vivid sense of place, an unforgettable cast of characters (including the ultimate romantic ideal: Estella), a rich and textured story, and an immortal message of aspiration, disappointment, and dreams. This story really fired my imagination as a teenager, so I encourage those youngsters who may be dissuaded from reading it to pick it up--I'm not guaranteeing you'll like it but if you read it before you're forced to you just may find something valuable in it. As for the rest of you \\"grown-ups\\" if you haven't read this masterpiece yet, get off yer asses and take a trip to the local library. It'll make your day."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I've read many, many books throughout the years, in a wide variety of genres. Periodically, I try to stretch myself by taking on works that I might not otherwise gravitate toward. Sometimes I am rewarded; that is how I discovered Hemingway and Vasily Grossman (much to my delight). However, I generally read for pleasure and will never be considered an erudite literary critic; in other words, you won't find me reading Shakespeare.I recall reading A Tale of Two Cities in high school and to my recollection, enjoying it. With that in mind, I was determined to give Charles Dickens another shot, with the knowledge that if it were to my liking, there would be a wealth of material at my disposal. That is how I came to read Great Expectations.The novel centers on young Pip, an orphan taken in by his domineering older sister and kind, blacksmith husband. Pip is destined for a life as an apprentice blacksmith, a member of the English lower class, until an encounter with an escaped convict radically changes the course of his life. For you see, young Pip harbors \\"great expectations\\" and a life far beyond that set before him. With the help of an anonymous \\"sponsor\\", Pip begins his journey toward life as a gentleman.When reading Dickens, Tolstoy, and even more so Shakespeare, the first hurdle is becoming familiar with the language, the style of writing and the idioms and terms used by writers of the era; even more so with Dickens, where he routinely spells words phonetically when spoken by Cockney British commoners. Somewhat offputting at first, the reader soon becomes comfortable with the style and is amply rewarded and entertained.Having read numerous novels from the period, I was well familiar with the British class system on the mid-19th century, but nowhere is its rigidity more apparent than in this work. Within days of attaining a sponsor, young Pip completely removes himself from his former friends and relatives (both geographically and socially), even expressing embarrassment for having been associated with them. There are several story threads that work themselves together nicely near the end of the novel.Having become reacquainted with Dickens, I fully expect to sample more of his work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"First of all (as I like to say!) I'm no smarter than you and I thought this book was great, that said, this book is not THE easiest to read in that it does take a while for things to get really interesting. I rated it 5 stars because it is excellent but you need to have some patience with this book, in the end it is much worth the effort....and keep me updated!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I decided to read Great Expectations in order to challenge myself--In the past I'd tried reading classic literature and was a little disappointed--and quite unexpectedly found my favourite book, perhaps my favourite writer.Great Expectations is at once profound and a joy to read, and its characters will stay with you long after you've put the book down. Finally, I understand the term \\"great literature\\"."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Read it, no matter what, no matter if you have to read a page a day for two years, get into it and you won't be able to put it down and then you'll think, that reviewer was right I love this book. It was the best book that I read in my junior year, it wasn't required reading, BUT IT SHOULD BE! And Miss Havisham and Estella! After reading about the endless virtues of Lucy Manette in a Tale of Two Cities, I found those two very refreshing and intriguing and completely unexpected. Read the book, love the book, accept the book and all of its truths, and then name your cat Pip."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is Dickens' classic novel about the life of a young poor boy and his voyage through life. To me, it is not dissimilar to David Copperfield in its themes; however, David Copperfield moves me to tears every time I read it.I came across an original review of Great Expectations at The Atlantic Monthly's website. The reviewer wrote of Dickens and this work &quot;The very title of this book indicates the confidence of conscious genius. In a new aspirant for public favor, such a title might have been a good device to attract attention; but the most famous novelist of the day, watched by jealous rivals and critics, could hardly have selected it, had he not inwardly felt the capacity to meet all the expectations he raised.&quot; T.A.M. then went on to state that they felt the book did in fact live up to its title.Unfortunately I am not permitted to type in the whole web address so that you could more easily find this review, but if you are interested, go to The Atlantic Monthly's website and under the section entitled &quot;Books and Critics&quot; type in &quot;greatexp.htm&quot; at the search engine.

It will give you a whole new prespective of love, family, and yourself."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It's rather amusing to read some of the comments -- obviously written by people (i.e. teenagers) forced to read it for sophomore English class. Hating &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is kind of like hating Beethoven, Shakespeare, or Monet: O.K., it's not your taste, but it's really a waste of time to say &quot;IT SUCKED.&quot;Dickens's novel is one of the all-time champs. Unforgettable characters, beautiful writing, and a depth of understanding of human nature rarely equaled in English or American fiction. As they say in theory class, it works on many different levels. If you hated &quot;G.E.,&quot; well, then, you probably wandered into the Literature aisle by mistake. You probably also don't like &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; &quot;David Copperfield,&quot; or anything by Hardy or Austen, if you've bothered.Otherwise, if you love literature and haven't read &quot;Great Expectations,&quot; consider your education incomplete."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This has to be my favourite Dickens novel. In fact, I would go so far as to place it alongside Flaubert's &quot;Sentimental Education&quot; and Dostoevsky's &quot;Brothers Karamazov&quot; as one of the great novels of the 19th century. I am astonished by the number of one and two star reviews even though they do appear to come mainly from high school students being &quot;forced&quot; to read the novel for English class. Judging by the spelling mistakes and grammatical errors which proliferate these submissions, Dickens is not the only thing that they've had trouble staying awake for. In addition, it is ridiculous to suggest that Dickens's novels were so lengthy because he was &quot;being paid by the word.&quot; His books initially appeared in serial form as books were very expensive in the Victorian era and he understandably wished to avoid precluding large sections of his target readership from being able to sample them. The fact that some current &quot;readers&quot; find this novel &quot;too long and boring&quot; is, I believe, a sad reflection on our media saturated society where a two-second attention span is rapidly becoming the norm."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Why, in God's name, do high school teachers insist on stuffing this complex novel down the throats of their teen-aged students? Because the initial chapters are narrated by, Pip, a little boy we watch become a young man? Because there are pirates and bad guys in it? Because there's a sort of love story? I'm sure some high schoolers understand GREAT EXPECTATIONS but the majority of them... I don't think so.GREAT EXPECTATIONS contains many complicated, adult themes and issues that adults will surely appreciate. A virtual encyclopedia of human emotions--fear, child abuse, anticipation, disappointment, love, jealousy, manipulation--this greatest of all of Dickens' novels has everything. And all these ingredients are woven into an incredibly entangled plot, full of twists and turns. On top of all that, the novel is also a virtual encyclopedia of the layout and attitudes of Victorian London.Holding it all together is Pip's incredible perceptions into his world and his emotions. Never before had there been a character so aware of his feelings and, still, because he is human, he allows these emotions to sometimes compel him to do the opposite of what is right and best. Pip does sometimes behave like the child and young adult he is, but that doesn't mean this novel is suitable for anyone of that age.Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great expectations is an extremely wonderful book!this book starts talking about a boy named Pip.he is trying to live up to everybod's expectations of him while trying to live his own life.Pip was born an orphan.his older sister adopts himand thats how his sister is admired for bringing him home and raising him. she was married to joe her husband. this story really starts off when Pip meets the convict on the old church graveyard on the hill of the marshes.The convict told Pip to bring a metal file,pork pie and a meat bone. The convict was very thankful. from that day on Pipd id not tell anybody about that day. His sister later on dies and he meets a girl named estella. estella was adopted by miss Havisham. Pip loved her but miss Havisham taught her to hate all men.This book is a wonderfully good book. I would recommend this book for children ages 13-21. It is an arduous book for some readers but it is aninteresting book to read. I love books that Charles Dickens writes. He is an awesome writer. If you like to read about romance, deception, horror and drama then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I must admit that beyond my initial attraction to the novel's title I made several attempts over a period of years to settle into the story but could not get past the first several pages. There are many things to throw off potential readers to aged classics like this one, not the least of which is Dickens' choice of character names such as Pumblechook, Wopsle and Magwitch, which I at first found absurd and annoying. However on a recent attempt I made it as far as chapter 10 (of 59 total) when it dawned on me suddenly and unexpectedly that I was hooked and that there was no turning back.The unabridged version is not something one can breeze through in an afternoon, especially considering that it requires the development of a certain skill to absorb Dickens' narrative style, much as it is with the often difficult prose of Henry James. Some parts read very fast while others are tortuously overwritten creating a virtual standstill as the eyes glaze over and one starts to look for good reasons not to throw the book against the wall and pull out tufts of hair from one's head in frustration - a good editor would do this book no injustice but I am not going to recommend the abridged version because most parts are not to be played with. But as is the case in life, our accomplishments must be earned, and so I will make this promise to those contemplating reading this work: make the effort, put forth the time to read this novel, which is not a short one, and before long it will grow on you and you will come to treasure your time spent with it, and even savour its pages as the story unfolds and comes to an end.It would be so much easier for the many students who are assigned this book to take the low road and read only a study guide and then rent one of the movies of it and then definitely not ace the class, but the intelligent ones could pull off a pass; but they would be cheating themselves of something that one cannot put a price on- a well told story with vibrant characters who share in our capacities to be hurt, to feel joy, to be knocked down and to live life, for what are stories if they are not reflections of ourselves, our desires, our fears, our untold secrets, our ability to connect to other souls and grow or be cut off and wither.Let me tell it to you straight. Dickens is a master storyteller. He has created a legacy that has been surpassed by only a few and is a standalone in terms of sheer narrative prowess. Modern writers, especially screenwriters (like myself, eventually) would do themselves no harm if they took Dickens' work to heart and used it as a model for their own for here there are no pyrotechnics, no stretching of rehashed plot ideas into the thinness of an overblown balloon, no exaggerated or contrived formulae, granted there is no small measure of coincidence in his stories, but here there are real characters with beating hearts and flesh, fully capable of a misstep and fall, part of a story that is relevant and timeless and enriching, even necessary to the human spirit if we are to grow and thrive and not kill one another with the evil and savagery that we are all capable of.As Nicole Kidman said during her Oscar acceptance a few years back: \\"art is important,\\" and for Dickens' contribution I am grateful and would be doing a disservice if I did not write this ditty for those that may listen. To Kidman's remark I would like to add that without art, life would no longer be tolerable and not worth living. It even convinces one to stick around for a little while longer. Those who do not feast on classics like \\"Great Expectations\\" are paying a very heavy price, one that not even Mr. Gates can well afford."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I spent a whole term going over this book in freshmen English class. It is an overall good book, full of interpritations. There are many symbolisms and allusions. However, it is important to remember that this book was originally a serialization, as it came out every week in the paper. There are some parts when Dickens drawls on with his plans, events, ect. However, there are scenes that are very fast paced and action filled. The overall plot is a young, naive boy of about ten lives with his sister and her simple husband named Joe. However, Pip is given a secret benefactor and is thrust in the life of nobility. Pip is tangled in his probelems of leaving Joe behind and his encouters with the shallow (and I mean SHALLOW) Estella and the wicked Miss Havisham. Dickens is a master with characters and the languege, but he doesn't describe any everyday events. For example, Pip goes to study law, but thats all we know. In my opinion, it gives the characters this higher than life importance, and less real. But, if you take this book slowely, maybe a chapter a night (instead of the five I had to do), you will definately enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"&quot;Great Expectations&quot; seems to be a term used to describe a young man with expectations of becoming a Gentleman. This is the story about a young boy named Pip who though considered poor, was raised as an apprentice in a respectable trade. When his parents died when he was very young he was brought up by his older sister and her husband Joe Gargery the blacksmith. Joe although a little slow, acts in many ways as a loving father and friend to the boy, and is more noble than any of the other characters in the whole book. His older sister however isn't as nice, and in the modern day world probably would have been brought up on charges of child abuse. (If this book was ever remade into a modern day movie I couldn't think of anyone else I'd rather see playing Pip's older sister than Kathy Bates. I pictured her every time the character is mentioned.)Pip then comes into some money by a mysterious benefactor, and becomes an ungrateful little boy who looks down upon those he used to associate with and puts on airs. At this point, in my opinion Pip becomes a very unlikable character for most of the remainder of the book. He believes Miss Havisham who is a mysterious mean old wealthy lady is his benefactor and falls in love with her adopted daughter Estella. I believe this makes Pip look very shallow, since the only redeeming quality she seems to possess is her looks.Pip moves to London and is entrusted to a lawyer named Jenkins and his assistant Wemmick to teach him how to become a gentleman. The lawyer Jenkins, while unloving, is likeable, and in his own way noble. Wemmick who leads a double life is one of the best characters in the book. (I believe there are many people who would like to keep their work life separate from the home life, and can relate to this character.)Jenkins hires a tutor for Pip to teach him how to act like a gentleman. It seems that all the gentleman in this story do however is spend money. Pip and the tutor's son Herbert who becomes Pip's best friend then proceed to work themselves into debt.A pirate which Pip met in his childhood comes back into this life, and brings many changes. (The pirate Pip meets reminded me of the sea captain from &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, or the main character in the &quot;Count of Monte Cristo&quot;.)In the end Pip tries to redeem himself, and in some ways does.There are some plot twists and mysteries to solve. Some work out well and are pleasant surprises, others just seem unnecessary to the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"GE is one of the better books that I read in my illustrious high school education. The book threw me a little because of all the words Dickens used to describe every character right down to the tiniest little thing. Pip and Joe is a good pair of characters to have in this book, because they are so different and so alike at the same time. They both like to work with metals and Joe is a blacksmith and pip is his apprentice. They are different in the way that they act. Joe takes the brutal ness of pips sister, and pip does not. When pip starts to work for Ms. Havisham it shows his torture that he has to take from Ms. Havisham in the way of verbal bashings. Thought Ms. Havisham does not beat him unlike his sister does, she is a very cruel and malignant women. Then one-day pip meets Estella, she seems like a nice girl but in fact she is a very cruel women just like her grandma. This is the beginning of pips crush and then turns into a passion. Dickens then goes into the part of the story where pip finds out why she wants Estella to hate men. He finds out that she was left at the alter by her ex. This set a fire in her and that is why she hates men. Then pip returns home one day from work at Ms. Havisham's house and he finds a lawyer there with Joe and some one gave him enough money to get a good education and a home. So he takes the money and pip goes to school in England and the story pretty much lost its importance after that, but pip does find out that the person who gave him the money was from the Escaped convict, he owned his own farm in Australia and he was rich from that. These are just some of things that happened in the book, to find out some of the finer details I urge to you read the book for yourself. It will give u a better insight into dickens writing also."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations was the greatest book that I've ever read. The way that the book was put together always left you wanting to know more. The book was told by a young boy named Phillip Pirrup, that falls madly in love with a young lady name Estrella. He ends up being sent away to England to become a young gentleman, and strays away from the love of his life. A great deal of scandal goes on, and if I tell you anymore than you'll know what happens, but I will tell you this. If you like a dramatic sope-opera filled with love, suspense, and action than you will find this book astounding. I can tell you I loved this bok, and I'm sure you will too."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I hated a Tale of Two Cities but I loved this novel. This typical Dickens, great characters, several plot twists, and a lot of description. For any one who has read everything by Dickens, I'd suggest &quot;Titus Groan&quot; and its follow up &quot;Gormenghast&quot; by Mervyn Peake. They are fantasy novels but are extremely Dickinsian (though original enough to keep from being derisive) and in my opinion equal to any thing Dickins wrote and in better prose."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Sorry for the nasty mean review. Totally uncalled for, caught me on a bad day. Everybodys different and everyone has their own opinions and just because someone else doesn't like something is no reason to put them down. Its just frustrating because these kids reviews always say the same thing, &quot;this sucked&quot;, or &quot;this was boring&quot; and thats all they can say about it. But anyway, if thats the way they feel then I guess thats just the way they feel and nobody should write such nasty reviews or get mad for such a petty, stupid reason anyway. So, anyway, this is one of Dickens best, as I've said before."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Of all English writers,Charles Dickens is the champion of the genre of \\"Bildungsroman\\",a department of fiction writing pertaining to growth and development of the protagonist. Dickens's writings are darkly underlined by an all-dimensionsal illustration of aperson's character and by an uncanny portrayal of childhood. \\"Nicholas Nickleby\\",\\"David Copperfield\\" and \\"Great Expectations\\" have gone into the literary folklore as novels containing some of the finest amd most vivid passages ever composed on children's psyche and indignified lives. Perhaps the author's this ability to paint children's woe stems froms his own abusive and disruptive boyhood and perhaps in several of his fancy's infants,Dickens was actually trying to reflect his very own horrible childhood. \\"David Copperfield\\" is undoubtably his most personal and in certain fractions autobiographical novel but in \\"Great Expectations\\",employing a compatible first person narrative method,Charles Dickens conjures up a very much real life character who,like David Copperfield,narrates the story of his life as he progresses through his childhood,errors of judgements and unseeming expectations to a tragi-joyous adulthood;as he stives on in life with a plethora of illusions;as he realises the moments of truth one by one.\\"Great Expectations\\" is young Pip's story,a trajectory of his yearning to excel and drift away from the \\"oncommon\\",a desire to be loved and respected in society, a not-so-uncommon craving to grow up and establish himself. For an orphan living in the country marshes in England and brought up \\"by hand\\" by his sister Mrs. Joe Gargery,Pip's on;y genuine friend in his early boyhood was Jor Gargery,the blacksmith---also supposed by the central character to have been made to \\"marry her by hand\\". But a sudden and apparently misfortunate meeting with a fugitive from the nearby Hulks---and the consequent burden of guilt his troubled conscience has to bear---a visit to the queer Miss Havisham's and an unexpected deliverance of all his miseries all consire to Pip's rise in life. The mysterious London lawyer and master defender of criminals Mr. Jaggers arrives one day to inform Pip that if he would,then he is entitled to excercise a proposition of going to London and studying and doing all he can to rise up in life and be an established gentleman with no cost from his side---a mere boyish fancy of Pip till that moment. so marches on our gentle little gentry class boy to the city on te back of the notion that it was Miss Havisham who was actually his benefactoress and who had destined him and her adopted daughter,the cruel,unforgiving and heartless Estella,to be together. And thus begin young and inexperienced Pip's trysts with harsh realities of life.In a novel that essentially figures around human expectations and failures through the tame medium of words,Pip's story is massively apt for the enlightenment of this theme. Pip is found to be a real-life character leafed out of life's own text book and not an imaginary effigy of fairy-tale gratifications,which David in \\"David Copperfield\\" in some stretch is. He's an ordinary person with extraordinary aspirations but as he moves on in life,he learns about himself and this personal growth is exquisitely and relistically portrayed by Charles Dickens. Indeed it's in a great city like London where truth dawns upon Pip,truth that demolishes all ethereals about life,about riches,about Miss Havisham and EStella,and most important truth of them all,the truth about himself. Pip runs into debt,makes several mistakes,is broken down and broken apart by an illusory love and endures fits of remorse,which punctuate his entire existence arising out of a marked ingratitude towards Joe and Biddy,his friend from his old school. His only means of moral salvation from this quicksand of sin is te hearty relationship with Herbert Pockets,his best friend and companion in all his catastrophes. Actually in Herbert and his father,also the tutor of Pip,Charles Dickens creates two characters dissolved in innocence and ignorance with no big aims for money. When all of Miss Havisham's near and distant relatives are coaxing her to milk her fortune,the Pockets are the sole remaining figures to brush aside such ideas. This is one of Dickens's numerous tricks as a writer to subtlely show that goodness can still be glimpsed in an otherwise sadly denudating world.Charles Dickens is believed to have gone through his work \\"David Copperfield\\" thoroughly before writing \\"Great Expectations\\" but even so on certain occasions,the reader does decipher resemblance between these two high acclaimed novels. The shape of Pip's path i life doesn't bear that great degree of difference with these two popular fictional characters are often found to merge. Miss Havisham is reminiscent of Betsy Trotwood's resentment towards the male society,only more elongated and elaborate;in Pip's detest of Drummle and his love for Estella,the reader catches a fair glimpse od David's own contempt towards Uriah heep's lust for Agnes;Mr.Pockets and his family's fiascos and innocence bear a certain kinship with those of Mr. Micawber's;and Pip's deep friendship with Herbert reminds the reader of David's relationship with Traddles. These similarities could blot Dickens's claim to unprecedented imagination power or may strangely prove that life of one is often intertwined with aanother's. The first person narrative technique used to describe Pip's story in this book too isn't without some strong criticisms. The opinions and witty contemplations formed by Pip of people both is his marsh country as well as in London from an early stage in his life render the reader musing as to how his innocent and delicately humorous conjectures could suddenly be transformed into something satirical and concrete. Are his views constructed on the spur of the moment or are they being built now as Pip stares down the years and pens down his history? If the latter be more inclined towards the truth,then it definitely distorts Pip's authenticity as a writer and his memoir is left somewhat ineffective with misleading overlapping of the past and te present.Certain detractions are not so difficult to eke out from \\"Great Expectations\\" really but flaws are a regular parameter of any work of literature. The genius of Charles Dickens is never in doubt in this book as the reader discerns the author's accustomed mingling of humour and dark pictures in a book that promises life as it is. Dickens's obsession with wit and humour is revealed in the features of Mr. Pumblechook and Mr. Wopsle and in incidents such as the latter playing Hamlet on the stage. That when perceived from te swift flow of narration perfectly complimented by the dialogues and conversations and punctuated by moods of reflections makes the book instantly appealing. The caricature of the marsh country is another point of revelation of the author's informed and classy state. The world of Dickens is one of individual identities and aspirations,where all characters find their own proper places. And this world isn't a big one but a narrowed and trimmed realm of compulsive non-overlapping characters all fuctioning significantly in the due course of Pip's realisation of the world and its intricacies.The most beguiling factor in providing Pip's tale a touch of realism and in turn making the novel more touching and endearing is the evident defects in his character. He feels remorseful at his ingratitude towards his poor and \\"common\\" family;he is exasperated at the return of his \\"old convict\\" years later and in his refusal to address him not as Magwitch,his real name,but as Provis,his assumed name,he subconsciously admits denial of his own humble past. Pip isn't mature enough to handle his own humble past. Pip isn't mature enough to handle his own present either,and time and again has to rush to Herbert and wemmick,Mr. Jaggers's assistant,for solace and help. As illusions fade one by one and emotions of al sorts jumble up together in Pip's life,he's found to portray at least fractions of our own lives. \\"Great Expectations\\" is vastly a cofession of a dilapidated soul whose expectations in life are not without unforseen twists and turns. This is an immensely moving tale of a young man's ineptitude and discontentment told in restrained sentimentality,empathic ruminations and glittering descriptions. This classic is a gem for any literature lover,where Charles Dickens;s authority as a writer is amazingly deft."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dudes. You gotta read this book. It's totally awesome.Charles described the people and places so well, it's like its real and your there with everybody.Pip and Estella's love story might be the greatest love story in history. Greater than Rhett and Scarlet. Greater than Romeo and Juliet. Greater than Spiderman and Mary Jane. Yes, it's that good.Sure, there are plenty of movies, but none do it justice. Its like the Scarlet Letter. You've gotta read it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It's not worth it, even with the low price of 1.99. You're better off getting the free version. The only thing you're going to get is a couple of illustrations and there is no link for a free audio book like it says there is."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"There are two main sorts of novel - those that end quite happily and satisfactorily, with everything essentially \\"working out\\" for the better and most great problems resolved. The second kind is quite the opposite, an about-face, and of course \\"Great Expectations\\" would fall into the latter category. It's only main tender-bellied spot for me to prod with critique would be the fairly obvious plot unfolding, even to someone unfamiliar with the story as I was.As so often happens with \\"classics\\", in the end the main characters end up being one another's long lost aunts or cousins, fathers, daughters, stepmothers, caretakers, lovers, or perhaps the cause of misery to one or many, of course all unbeknownst and hidden until you happen to stumble in on their story. That's not really giving anything away, for those that are worried. And it is not to say that Dickens was unoriginal with this one, because it's a fantastic read, but that he's had better - even in the form of \\"Oliver Twist\\".Those that like the happy ending shouldn't really be too interested. Those who like ..., intrigue - um, stay away too. The heart of this pup is dialogue and the torture of internal thoughts and personal dissatisfaction. The protagonist is poor, so desperately wants to be a gent and have \\"expectations\\", ... The guy doesn't get the girl. No real living happily ever after. But I don't see why that's necessary."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations\\" by Charles Dickins is a really good book. I personally do not like to read but i truely enjoyed this book. Although the beginning is very slow and Dickins takes forever to get to the point many times, i found myself unable to put the book down at times. Great Expectations is a good book about loyalty, trust and fate. It also teaches you to remember your true friends and do not let wealth go to your head. The story is centered around an orphan boy named \\"Pip\\". Miss Havisham is the woman who looks after and takes care of Pip. One day Pip is at the gravesite of his parents and the convict, Magwitch, asks him to help him out. Pip does help the convict out not knowing what Magwitch will do for him in the future.One day at Miss Havisham's house Pip meets Estella. He falls in love with her but she does not return the feelings. In fact she is cruel and plays with Pip's emotions. Despite the way he is treated by Estella, Pip never gives up on on trying to win her over.Later on, Pip is told that he has come into a great fortune from an anynomous benefactor. After he comes into all of this money he goes to London, England to study and become a gentleman. While he is in England he becomes somewhat \\"stuck up\\". He treats his old friends like they are not as important as his new friends.While in England he finds out that Estella has married a man who he cannot stand. He also meets up with the convict, Magwitch. Magwitch tells Pip how he is Estella's father and how he is the secret benefactor to his new found wealth. In gratitude, Pip tries to help Magwitch escape from England, but while escaping the police catch them and arrest Magwitch and put him to death, while Pip's money is taken away from him.Pip goes back to Miss havisham's house and becomes friends with his old friends again. He also meets up with Estella there and after awhile the two marry.This book is well written in the way that everyone can relate to the subjects in some way.I really enjoyed reading this piece."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I still wonder why this book is a perennial reading requirement in junior high schools across the country. I had to read it way back when, and it almost turned me off from books in general. This is not to say it's a bad book, because, on the contrary, it's great, but don't have great expectations of an exciting contemporary read. To enjoy this book and appreciate the beauty of fully-fleshed characters, come-alive scenes, and intricately woven plot, you absolutely must keep in mind that this book was written in a different time, before the Hemingway revolution of sparse prose. As you read it, expect long verbose passages and miles between exciting scenes. But stick it out, and in the end expect a great read that stays with you a lifetime.

It is a well done Dickens-style (obviously) story of a young boy raised in a poor environment by his sister--his only living relative--and her husband, a blacksmith named Joe. After visiting a very rich and eccentric woman by the name of Miss Havisham, the young boy named Pip is approached by a lawyer and is told he has &quot;great expectations.&quot; And that he is to move to London to be bread as a gentleman, when after a certain period he is to inherit a large sum of money. The story goes on to London where he is brought up, and leads to some very interesting twists. The tale is well told, and enjoyable if you are fond of Dickens (while I appriciate Dickens.. I admittedly do not like &quot;A Christmas Carol,&quot; so keep in mind that if that is the only Dickens you have been exposed to, give him a try through one of his major novels.) The character of Pip is a very sympathetic one, and his faults are all to scarily human. This novel covers great, surprise, assumption, and other noteworthy themes.

The book never had me. I don't think it ever actually tried to have me. It's premise centers around a boy named Pip and his life in 19th century England. It's only too bad that Dickens spends far too much time showcasing his prolific skills of writing in the English language and less time on any sort of a solid base for this specific novel. The reader feels absolutely no connection to any of the characters, most notably Pip or Joe. The one bright part of the book is Miss Havisham, who Dickens spends enough time with for us to empathize with her for her lonely life.The biggest problem of course, is it's lack of commitment to any sort of theme. A great novel, as many would claim this is, must possess the language and have something to say. It seems, especially at the beginning, that Dickens is taking his stand against early Industrial Revolution labor practices. However, the book never really delves into that in any way shape or form. When Dickens chooses to describe Joe's house or some other hovel, he persists to use the same kind of language as when he describes, for instance, Miss Havisham's or Wemmick's house. This book, on the whole, is as dry as Spanish sherry and is simply not meant for anyone who wishes to extrapolate anything of meaning from the books they read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"my 14 year old daughter needed to read this book for one of her classes. she didn't think she would like it, but she ended up loving it. my 17 year old son is also reading it now and he also really likes it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I love listening to it.

Michael Page reads Dickens' great novel beautifully, giving each character exactly the right voice without ever sounding phony, hammy, or exaggerating or over-emphasizing anything.Page makes every sentence perfectly clear and delivers each line of dialog just right.

I've never heard of Page before -- is he an actor? -- but he certainly deserves an award for his brilliant performance reading this novel, one of the crown jewels of English literature."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My biggest complaint concerning many audio books is that they're poorly narrated--often in monotone, or with one character's dialog sounding much like the others.

Dickens can be very tough to read, but also very rewarding because you know that you are enjoying a piece of literary genius.

I won't say it's the best just because once a work of art attains greatness I find it quite incomparable to other great works. Great works are ones which have fully succeeded in expressing the emotions and convictions of the artist, and without a doubt Great Expectations acheives this. Unfortunately I only hold this view of the book containing the original ending, which was not the originally published ending. (spoiler) The original ending at first seems sad and frustrating, but one can't help but to feel satisfied in knowing that through suffering Estella had gained a heart, which is much more than she would have gained through a cold and heartless relationship with Pip. The happy ending which was published is almost a fairtale ending and it perverts the themes which make the novel so relevant to reality. I must admit, like Dickens' friends and publisher, the original ending was hard for me to swallow, but as I dwelt on it and how it related to the novel, no other ending seemed appropriate, especially not a happy one."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Well, i have read all of the previous reviews, and it is apparant that people either love this book or hate this book.

Yes, it is rather boring at times, and yes, it has a long, involved, and confusing plot, and yes, Charles Dickens gives very tedious descriptions of everything. But the morals and meanings portrayed in this book far outshine the faults. If you cannot find them, then it will most likely be boring and dull. If you can, it will probably become one of your alltime favorites."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I simply loved this book.

This book is outside of the genre I usually read and I am greatful for having taken that leap into the unknown. The satisfaction came from a story that was not only told well but one that ended well. There, in my humble opinion, is nothing worse than experiencing a story only to find that the ending is not truely a completion. Each character and plot line is seen through to its end! The enrichment came from an insightful journey through the trials and tribulations as well as the successes and failures of these well developed characters. This adventure turns from a tale of successes and achievents to one of self realization and personal fulfillment through Mr. Dickens' skilled hand.Nothing is perfect. The story starts slowly. The reader must stick with the book to understand the fact that the beginning of the story was not simply necessary, but a foundation that supports and grows the story like no other introduction could. Some of the descriptions of places or things I found to be exporbitant. This leads to great character development but also to some tiresome chapters. As with any work of literature written durring the time period this book was written, the language is trivially dated or old.I would, and do recommend this book to my friends as one that will not simply pass the time but provide enjoyment!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read this book when I was a kid and I still remember Pip and Estella.

I did watch the movie many years ago with my wife, and it was good, but of course, the book gives you so much more.Do be warned, this is not a high adventure action-packed read. It is simply a good story well-told. I was surprised to read so much to get so little, in the sense of reading many pages to find out so few or minor details. I continued to read as much and as often as I could to get through this book. It is a great story even if I think it could have been written in half the pages.It is classic for a reason, do yourself a favor and read it if you had not.

I would be happy with them and angry with them when they did something that was, in my opinion, wrong or ill-advised At one point I actually found myself having a down day but couldn't put my finger on it until I realized I was at a point in the book where Pip was depressed. Some of the language and unusual expressions that are used in the book can be difficult, but, if you are a fairly well read person, you should be able to do fine. Great book!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I'm not sure how I got through school without reading it and I'm sure I would not have enjoyed it as much in my student days. However, it truly is a wonderful peek into human nature at its worst and at its best."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This being the first novel by Dickens, i didn't know whether i would like it or not. I was pleasantly surprised at how much i did like it. Usually the books that they force you to read i don't enjoy. Although this was never forced on me during high school, i know it is a popular book on high school curriculum. I found that i loved it and has become one of my favorites. I really liked the storyline and thought the characters were enjoyable. I will definitely have to pick up more of Dickens' works.SPOILER: a lot of people didn't like the new ending that Dickens wrote, saying it is too happy and that the original depressing ending was superior. I actually didn't like the original ending and didn't find the newer one to be too joyous. I read the new ending as Pip being doomed to always love Estella, making it more depressing than the original. Anyway, that was my take."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens could put in some really cool surprises for the plot through his books, and this one is no different. When Pip learns who his benefactor is... whoo! I suppose some of the surprises could be predicted if you read enough, but it still makes for an interesting story, and especially good for the time it was written in.I remember reading this many years ago. This may not appeal to people who do not like 'old-fashioned writing', and yes, this book is different than many of the 'easy' novels you will find today, it is still a solid and die-hard classic with a cast of good characters and a story with enough twists and turns to keep it good. Charles Dickens wrote many fine books, and this is definitely one of them."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book truly shows how well written a novel can be.I read this book for school, for all those who are having to read this book for school, I reccomend reading it beforehand because not doing so means finding the book dull and unnatractive while answering all the tedious questions that can ruin a book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was quite disappointed reading this book after having read David Copperfield. Although both books bear some resemblances, the plot in Great Expectations is much more condensed and simpler. The story is again the orphan-boy-who-gets-away-from-home-in-search-of-a-happier-life. The plot, however, is much less intricated than it is in David Copperfied. There are fewer characters (and fewer pages!) in this book. That caused me an impression that the story is not as feasible as it is in David Copperfield. Some things seem to be rather unreal or fantastical. There are some qualities, however, that remain the same as they are in David Copperfield. The narrative, the characters descriptions and their surprising behaviour keep the reader up to the last page. So this is my advice: if you are one of those who tried to read David Copperfield but gave up because thought it was too boring or long, Great Expectations is an excellent book for you. And maybe, after you have finished it, you'll be willing to read a much better one: David Copperfield."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"i have read the book twice once last year for my teachers book report and this year for the 9th grade merit english classes. These reviews on here only describe parts of dickens story so if you do have to read this for 9th grade read it don't take the short cut because the teachers will know and when you have a test on the book you will FAIL!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"All right. I admit it. The book starts out slow. Dickens, though I love the man, writes in such flowery and long winded language at times. What takes many authors a line or two, Dickens will devote whole pages.And I almost put the book down for that exact reason. I'm very happy I did not.With so many detailed threads in the story, the depth to the characters--when they all start to blend together a few chapters in, the result is page-turning.The story centers around a young boy--well, almost young man-- named Pip, and revolves around his growing into age. You cannot help but love the boy. Much of Pip's worry and concern I could relate to--falling in love with a girl who refuses to return your sentiments and only plays with your heart, growing up and leaving home for the first time, and discovering your true relationships with others and yourself, as shocking as they may turn out to be.I felt as if I was side by side with Pip through it all, and that made the novel a wonderful experience for me. I recommend the novel for the young because so much relates to them, and also for the older readers--because you can experience it all again.A wonderful and heart warming tale. Just get through those first chapters."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"From the many rave reviews of this book, I was expecting to read a literary masterpiece.Howver,my expectations were negated, just like Pip's. This illogical story has some exciting and entertaining parts to it,as well as old fashioned humor, but as a whole it is slow and tedious. Read it if you have patience, otherwise, you are in for a long one."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to read this for my AP English class. At first, it didn't catch my attention, but to my english teacher's urging (Mrs. Brodmerkel) I read on. Actually, if she wasn't there to explain each chapter after we had read it, it wouldn't have been As good. This was a great book, and I think everyone should have to read it. There are so many different social conditions that still pertain to life today.

Great Expectations by Charles Dickens fulfilled this. It is a compelling story about a young man who through a series of circumstances meets a beautiful yet cold hearted girl named Estella. The book follows him through his adolence an adult years. To me this book still hold very true today. It tells about love and how time may not heal all wounds. And also about how some people are manipulated, as Estalla was, into living out others lives."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectaitons by Charles Dickens is a good book.

I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one who uses these wonderful books to escape this world. I was deeply saddened to have learned that all of them are gone: James, Siegfried, Tristan and Helen are gone. I also just learned that \\"James\\" and I have the same birth date, October 13th, different years. I wonder, what other books \\"James\\" had in his head, but gotten too sick to write them?"},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"I have been reading James Herriot's books for many years, but hadn't been around them for quite a while. Upon running across this book online I decided to get it. Unsurprisingly, I was once again brought back into the warm-hearted atmosphere of Herriot's charismatic charm and forthright mannerism of veterinarian practice. His delightful wit and unfettered spirit bring such nostalgic wholesomeness toward the simple joys and unhampered qualities of another era ... of an unconditional love for life. All of his books left a profound imprint of his compassion and dedication toward the heart of the animal kingdom and humankind overall. An absolute 'no brainer' ... this book is wonderful and one for the library..."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"I return to James Herriot again and again when I need a reliable mood enhancer or 'comforter'. His vignettes of the animals and people of the Yorkshire dales always remind me of the life we all share -- amusing, quirky, sometimes sad, but part of a tapestry of daily victories and set-backs that wraps around the world. His interlocking tales have the additional advantage of being short, and self-contained. If you need something to lift your spirits, or to pass a little time when you're not ready for \\"War and Peace\\", give him a try."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"The reading on the audio cassettes is done by Christopher Timothy, the actor who plays James Herriot on the BBC series &quot;All Creatures Great And Small&quot;. He does a magnificent job of Sigfried, Tristan and all the dales farmers. It is truly a delight to listen to this series of tapes - it takes you into another world.(Note: there appears to be an error above, listing Edmund Stoiber as the reader.)In this set, James has joined the RAF to support the war effort, though fate has other plans for him. We follow his attempts to get in shape and become a pilot, as events and people remind him of his many experiences back in his vet practice.Perhaps because of the War Years, some of these stories are slightly more edgy, such as a rash of dog-poisonings and an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease that is uncomfortably reminiscent of recent events. But overall there is that sweetness of tone that pervades all of Herriot's work.I think my favorite story was the old farmer fetching two gallons of the local pub's best beer in a milk bucket in order to warm a mother pig to her new family. Of course he saved a &quot;drop&quot; for himself and his mates. The amazing thing about these books is that there is never a repeated story throughout the whole series."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"I read his books as a teen and loved them. Bought the whole set for my grandsons, [teens]. They laughed until they cried. [so did I]."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"The books arrived so quickly that I got to take my timewrapping the books."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"James Herriot continues the story of his veterinary practice, and his family life in England. World War II is past, the children are growing. His stories chronicle the changes...."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"My first experience with the late James Herriot's inspirational books took place in a bookstore in Singapore, in the 80's. I was barely 14 &amp; had not heard of this writer/vet. But as soon as I started reading All Things Wise and Wonderful - my very first JH book, I knew I had to get the rest of the series.Through his poignant, funny, sensitive and Yorkshire-accented writing, I relived his world as a practising vet. His was a world where decent, civic minded people lived with much love &amp; respect for their pets and farm animals. A world where I wanted/want to be in.It is true how one book reviewer put it: every chapter will have you either laughing out loud or shedding a quiet tear. To this day, I still remember some of his stories that touched my heart. The courtship years when a young JH was trying to impress Helen (who eventually became his very supportive wife); the timid little black stray cat, who with her last breath, would placed her one surviving kitten into the hands of a caring family; the endearing 'beggar' dog; the bored, pampered &amp; misunderstood pet dog of a wealthy spinster...I could almost touch and see JH's characters through his vivid writing. I even felt his pride when his daughter also became a vet, &amp; his son a doctor.I am sorry that there were not more of his wonderful tales."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"If you want a book that will take you back to the country life and its people with all their foibles and admirable qualities and love animals then his books will be pure enjoyment! I love the way he tells his stories. In his stories, he doesn't ever claim to be the best veterinarian around (I think he underrated himself), but you know he is a wonderful, kind, animal and people loving person. The way he speaks about the people and animals he comes in contact with, come to life and you feel you are right there with him. You will laugh, maybe cry, and cheer him on as you read. If you have animals, or raise them, you will love his books, although you don't have to own any to appreciate them."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"James Harriot has that amazing ability to transport you into his world, take you into his confidence, and offer you his friendship.....all through a series of heartwarming stories taken from his life as a Yorkshire vet. It's so refreshing to read books that are not strewn with violence and sex...yet which captivate your attention. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants some good wholesome entertainment and an occasional chuckle."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"I have read each of James Herriot's books many times (including this one) and still enjoy them every time I read them! This book is one of my favorite books of the series, and is highly recommended by me. If you have read the other books you will love this one just as much if not more! If you have not read any of the other books, this book would also be a good one to start off with. After reading it I can assure you that you will want to read all the others. NOTE: I also have all five of these books on audio tape (by Christopher Timothy) and would recommend these as well! It is great to listen to them while you do hobbies since you can actually do two things at the same time, and Christopher Timothy (who played James Herriot in the BBC series) really brings the characters to life, using different voices and accents."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"The third book in the series and you know exactly what to expect. Yes, folks, it is every bit as entertaining as the first two, and that's probably all you need to know. But I'll go ahead and mention that he spends some time in the RAF during World War II, which we knew he would as the second book ended. I'll also mention that he and Helen have a baby, which you probably expected. One of the great joys of his writing is discovery, so I'd hate to screw that up with a spoiler, but these two tidbits are on the back cover anyway. Oh, and halfway through it, I predicted an ending in advance, and I only had to read 1000 pages by this guy before that happened. It's still great, great stuff, and you know you'll love it."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"I have the complete series of All Creatures Great and Small books now. This was the last one and I loved it as much as I loved the others. He was a fantastic writer and having been born and raised on a farm I can appreciate a lot of what he talks about. I also have his cat and dog stories books and loved them just as much."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"All of Herriot's stories are good. There are some repeat stories in each of the books, but that is no big problem. I read a story a day, that keeps in interesting and the mind is not cluttered with several things at once.I do enjoy the books, I love animals and Mr Herriot has a way of bringing out the emotion in you."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"If you like animals you will enjoy all James Herriot's books. This is one of a series of delightful books. Reading one will make you want to read the next one. I can read them over and over."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"I'm biased but I just love James Herriot. I find the stories to be so entertaining, so humorous, heartwarming, and so well written! They make me desperate to visit the Dales.For anyone just wanting to read wonderful stories that make you feel happy, James Herriot is perfect.I would recommend them to anyone."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"Have read 4 other of his books and somehow this got by me. After finally reading it, I have to compare it to all the others and I, being an animal lover, give it 5 stars. He tells it like it is and doesn't pull the punches. Yes, sometimes it is sad but other times, you will laugh your head off. Excellent story teller. If you love animals, this is for you.....all of them are."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"This book was beautifully written. It easily transported me to the Yorkshire Dales. Then on to basic training for the RAF and onward. Well worth a read."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"To all who love many human beings and also who love animals, James Herriot's books are for you. He writes warmly, compassionately, with humor, and very intelligently about his life in northern England as a veterinarian. In this book, he starts off with his joining the RAF and bits of what he went through in his training. But the actual focus of this book, as the reader comes to see, are that his RAF training and the people he meets during this time, remind him of past veterinary experiences and one is then plunged into his wonderful stories of life with his animal patients and their owners. The book is delightful, written with a serenity not often found these days. His patients don't always get well, but mostly they do, and his intelligence, veterinary knowledge and skill, and particularly his creativity in putting facts together for his diagnoses is astonishing. I have heard people say that the story is too slow-moving. I say to them that they should put away their prejudices and look into this delightful, deeply compassionate and often funny, well-written, sensitive series of true stories."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"I read the Herriot books years and years ago. I learned that my husband had not. So when he needed more \\"going to sleep\\" books that could be read in short sections and would let him fall pleasantly to sleep after a few chapters, I ordered all the \\"Bright and Beautiful, Wise and Wonderful\\" series for him. After the first bedtime with the first one, he kept it next to him all day, to read just one more chapter when he had a few minutes free. He regales me with some of the tales that I have since forgotten, so I plan to re-read these wonderful snapshots of life, location, people, and animals for myself. They are actually even more refreshing now than when they first delighted me 30 years ago."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"\\"Two hours and yards of catgut later, we dusted the patched up peritoneal surface with sulphanilamide and pushed the entire mass back into the abdomen.

As always, Herriot presents us with a lifestyle that we can all envy, despite his self-deprecating asides. He paints a graphic, lovely, and seemingly true-to-life portrait of life in the Scottish Dales.Herriot is at his best when describing visits to local farms when he does hands-on work under the watchful eyes of the farmers. Their stoicism is always amusing, and the technical details of the veterinary practice of the time are always fascinating. I found the RAF adventures to be a little less engaging, but the book is well worth reading.Highlights of this book include a depressed man whose dog, Digger, starts to go blind; a sick farmer whose calf has severe stomach problems; and the care of a horribly wounded stray cat that turns out to be rather remarkable.I didn't read these books in order, and now I wish I had. You can really enjoy all of the stories without any background, but you can probably enjoy Herriot's life a little more if you see him go from newly appointed apprentice to respected top doctor."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"This book in the series is slightly different, since James is training in the RAF and each chapter starts with his war reality and then dissolves into homesick remembrances of Yorkshire and his animal clients. Still great stuff, though."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"This book is not just for animal lovers. It is very entertaining and James Herriot writes with humor and has a great love of people."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"i wish i had known beforehand that this was a sequel of books. i would have started at the beginning, because these are wonderful stories in the rugged life of a wonderful veternarian who had a great love for his animals that he treated in the hills of scotland. i thoroughly enjoyed his life story."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"Visited an old friend, James Harriot Enjoyed the book as it was the only one of his I hadn't read.Have visited this area in Yorkshire in the past and really enjoyed it.

But once I read one, I had to read them all. Well, the ones that are his accounts of being a vet. And I have read each one numerous times, plus have listened to the audio version. They are just good for the soul. Each book is full of heartwarming stories, as well as some funny happenings that always bring tears of laughter for me. I would recommend this book, plus the others for anyone that likes animals...for anyone of any age."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"Herriot's third collection of loosely autobiographical tales of veterinary practice in the Yorkshire dales ostensibly takes place while he is serving in the Royal Air Force during World War II. However, most of the chapters only begin with a paragraph or two about his military life which inevitably reminds him of someone or some animal-related event from his past. This was mildly disconcerting as the connections between the RAF event and the story to follow are sometimes quite a stretch. The tales are still quite entertaining and enjoyable, although it becomes slightly more clear that what is being related is becoming a bit more fictionalized than the incidents contained in the first two books of the series."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"This edition of James Herriot's memoirs sees him being drafted into the United Kingdom's Royal Air Force to play his part during World War II, leaving behind his veterinary practice and his wife (now expecting young Jimmy). Although he never sees combat, his description of military training gives an inside view to the training process for pilots in the war, interspersed with plentiful reminiscences of his veterinary practice back in Darrowby. Throughout this story is a sweet marital love, which colors his every experience, and the warm, wry wit that characterizes his writing is just as splendid as ever.As in his other books, there are a few examples of coarse language, and there is one scene with a friend engaged in amorous embrace on a sofa (soon to be broken up spectacularly). But in general, the book is refreshingly wholesome, although occasionally gross, given the duties of a country veterinarian. Its language is somewhat advanced, and it may be best enjoyed by older teenagers."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"I received the book promptly and in excellent condition. This is the third book I have read by James Herriot, and find it to be just as great as the other two. He is now my favorite author, I plan to read all of his works."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"I am reading all of James Herriot's books of this series,and in order. This one is just as wonderful as his others. He is quite a storyteller. You don't have to be someone who loves animals; he writes in a caring, compassionate manner about his patients and their owners. Even though these were written over 30 years ago, they are all timeless....."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"Following his first 2 books, this one adds Herriot's war stories to his animal stories, and the man is an incomparable alchemist. The impossible mixture works brilliantly. Separated from his wife by World War II, he tells of learning to be a soldier, learning to fly, then getting to leave the service before the Germans could fire a shot in anger in his direction, for which the world can be profoundly grateful. He tells a tale near to my heart when a blind man's guide dog falls victim to poison. I've never had to live that nightmare with any of my Seeing Eye dogs, but if I ever did I only wish the vet could be as kind, or as successful. He tells of being man-handled by a military \\"dentist,\\" whose treatment scars him for life. And many more tales fill this third volume of the incomparable series. The fourth was something of a thudder, so it might do you well to stop here."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"James Herriot is not only a vet. He could portray the feelings and frustrations of creaturesthat are simply regarded as animals but have characters and traits more worthy of homo sapiens.After reading it, one wish to be dog!"},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"This the third book James Harriot wrote. The stories are of top quality, although James is remineded of a memory at the oddist times, including while flying an airplane. The book brings back the same beloved characters of Triston, Helen, Siegfried, Ms. Hall, alomg with a guest apperance or two by my favorite character, Grandville Bennett. The stories are funny, then sad, then touching and sad, then touching, sad, and funny, etc. Great quality, but the first book, All Creatures Great and Small, is, in my opinion, the best book Harriot wrote."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"thanks, my nephew wants to become a veteranarian. I got him these books for bchristmas I thought he might like them. Good value."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"I truly cannot get enough of James Herriot. I so wish he was still alive so I could have the opportunity to meet him. He is such an endearing author who draws you in with his hilarious, but often sad, stories about being a farm vet. In 'All Things Wise and Wonderful' he has joined the RAF and briefly tells you about his time becoming a pilot. Most of the book is him daydreaming of being back on the Darrowby farms and living the life of a country vet. Some of the stories are kind of repeated - not the exact same stories as we read in the first two books of the series, but they are very similar (which I am sure he encountered many of the same things over and over). But he brings some new stories to the table that completely warmed my heart. While reading, I always have this slightly stupid smile that appears on my face. I just can't help it! The stories are so rich and fulfilling that I cannot help but smile and feel all warm and dreamy inside. I LOVE these books and I really want to go to England to see if I can find anything similar today to what he speaks about from the 30's."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"Another excellent book about the lives of veterinary surgeons and the amazing dedication to detail that Herriot writes with! He is an amazing writer who brings every character to life. Thoroughly enjoyable!"},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"I read the Herriot books when they were first published. I would eagerly await the publication of each new book. I recently asked my soon to be 12 year old grandson for a list of suggestions for his birthday and was thrilled to see the Herriot books listed. I ordered this book and two other JH books for him. It is heartwarming to realize the multi-generational appeal of James Herriot's timeless stories."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"Watch this series in the seventies, so I thought lets read the book too and I fell in love with it. I wanted to be a vet, but thankfully didn't become one, can't handle disecting anything, but love animals and people that have tender heart and help them. Highly recomend this book to all animal lovers."},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"We purchased this as a gift for a family member who loves James Herriot books and she was very happy with it.

I first read this first work, \\"All Creatures Great and Small\\" shortly after it was published. I was pulling an all night shift watching over young G.I.s in a military barracks and found a copy on the shelf in the office I was using. I started reading and simply could not put the book down. Luck for me it was a quiet night and other than having to kick one door at three in the morning telling the guys to shut up and go to sleep, all went well. I have been reading these books ever since.\`All Things Wise and Wonderful\\" is of course the third book in the series and the author has used a \\"flash-back' method of telling his stories; stories of a young English veterinarian during the days before WWII. Herriot is now in the RAF and each chapter begins by briefly telling of his experiences in the military and then leads into a story from his past. Each story is quite similar two the collections we find in the previous two books. Now it must be noted that this IS NOT a collection of \\"war stories,\\" no, far from it. The author merely uses this \`military time' to hang the real stories he is telling on.We find much more as to the courtship of his wife and much more of many of the characters we were introduced to in the first two books. Of course we also meet a plethora of new characters and most importantly, new animals. Many of the stories here are happy and funny stories; many are sad and are sure to bring a tear to your eye...I know they do mine. All are good though and are on par with the rest of this author's work.There are a couple or three things that must be noted about Herriot's work. First is the fact that he was not just a vet who happened to write books. The author was actually quite a skilled writer before he started this series. The other factor, and one that has cause must discussion, is whether or not all of these stories are the absolute truth. As to this, I personally could care less. They are all well written and all cause an emotional reaction and all keep me entertained. Logic tells me that there is probably a sound basis for each tale but I strongly suspect that many of the stories have been a bit embellished by the author - here and there. Again though, I could care less - I still like the stories and will continue reading them. The last item of note is that despite the fact that these stories were taken from a different place and a different time they have not aged one bit! The stories are timeless and I suspect we will be able to say the same years and years from now.I reread the entire body of Herriot's work about every two years and have done so since the beginning. This is good stuff folks; it is the sort of reading and writing that I personally enjoy.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"All Things Wise and Wonderful","review":"I have always liked James Herriot vet series.

Wally, er, Bill Myers, has a wild imagination that he lets run free in this series! Each book addresses some problem or weakness pretty common to most of us, and then Myers has Wally take it to an extreme to make a point. Wally wants to be a writer, so part of each book is his writing a superhero story, usually science fiction, with events based on what just happened to him, only turning out the way he wished it had instead of reality. But even Wally's reality can be pretty far out. A large bully is after Wally at summer camp, and then he ends up in a canoe on a river with the guy, and they both learn lessons about fear, trust, and God.

Being a writer, being a superhero, writing about a superhero. He has never dreamed of going to camp, but his father signs him up, insisting it will make him a real man. Incidentally, being a real man is another thing Wally's never dreamed about...Yet Wally gets dropped off at the bus, but before he even makes it to Camp Wahkah Wahkah (or Camp Whacko as Wally calls it) he finds himself pressed against the roof of the bus by Gary the Gorilla with peanut butter and jelly dripping from his nose. Yes, it's true. Wally is a dork-oid, which really isn't so bad as long as you aren't the target of Gary the Gorilla and his Goons. Unfortunately, Wally is.What a funny story. Wally has a great sense of humor and I found myself laughing out loud. Here and there we are also entertained with the book Wally is writing about Mutant Man McDoogle, a superhero who is in a battle with a suspiciously familiar villain named Dr. Ghastly the Gorilla.

This is a short book, (98 pages) intended for a younger audience, while providing a well-written and very complete history of this famous unit. Any person of Irish descent would be happy to own this book. Susan Beller records the glory garnered by the Irish Brigade in some of the most decisive and heaviest battles in the Civil War. Ms. Beller addresses the proven bravery displayed by the actions of the Irish Brigade, (made up of the 69th New York, 63rd NY, 88th NY and the 29th Massachusetts) at decisive battles, and she gives vivid descriptions of the actions of the Brigade through some important characters such as General Thomas Meagher (pronounced MAAAHer). For example, at the bloodiest single day in American history, September 17th 1862, Susan Beller not only tells the story of the vital contribution of the Irish Brigade at the &quot;Bloody Lane&quot;, but tells how, when they ran out of ammunition, the Irish Brigade &quot;right-shouldered arms&quot; and marched away in good order from the enemy. She also describes how shaken General Meagher was when his horse was shot and subsequently fell on the General. In this brief book, Ms. Beller provides a complete synopsis of the life of the Irish rebel, Meagher, from his early days in Ireland to his exile in Australia and finally his escape and settlement in America. She also describes important historical events, such as the famous &quot;general absolution&quot; given by Chaplain William Corby. Either one of these individuals would make a fine central character in a movie about the &quot;Irish Brigade&quot;; .... The Irish Brigade, as Ms Beller relates, was involved in some of the most important Civil War battles, and were so effective that it caused Confederate General Robert E. Lee to state, &quot;Never were men so brave&quot;, from which the author draws her title. Perhaps Mel Gibson might consider such a movie"},{"Title":"Never Were Men So Brave: The Irish Brigade During the Civil War","review":"&quot;Never Were Men So Brave&quot; is a &quot;nice&quot; effort for the sixth or seventh grader looking for general information on Irish emigration in the 1840's or about the American Civil War at the unit level. But a high school term paper it isn't. Ms. Beller's book in no way approaches the detail satisfying those interested in reading regimental or brigade histories (e.g., &quot;The Iron Brigade&quot; by Nolan; &quot;The Last Full Measure&quot; by Moe). The book begins with an elementary -- clearly pro-Irish -- summary of 800 years of Irish Catholic persecution at the hands of the English. This is a subject unto itself, and Beller's cursory treatment is neither thorough or balanced.The history of the Irish Brigade (63rd, 69th, and 88th New York and 29th Massachusetts) in the Civil War emerges as nearly an afterthought -- absent of detail or depth, leaving the reader hungry for more. Judging by the bibliography, Beller appears to have had the background research in hand but fails to use it to best advantage, even for the target audience. The pictures, illustrations and many of the quotations (espcially from Father William Corby) are nice supplements to an otherwise disappointing treatment."},{"Title":"Not Just Stories: The Chassidic Spirit Through Its Classic Stories","review":"In this work the distinguished teacher of Torah and therapist Avraham Twerski provides an illustrated introduction to Hasidism.

Put me down for advance purchase on next book."},{"Title":"Bahamarama (St. Martin's Minotaur Mysteries)","review":"Bob Morris introduces the reader to Zack Chasteen, a former football star who briefly played pro ball with the Miami Dolphins. Morris weaves the usual tale of murder, intrigue, kidnapping and general mayhem. However, this effort is a step above the usual pack of action-filled thrillers.Morris paints very vivid pictures of his characters. His characters are more than just one-dimensional bodies to fill the needs of the story. He provides enough twists to keep the reader interested, but not too many to make the story unbelievable.The only complaint I had is near the end when part of the story gets wrapped up a bit too quickly, especially considering the masterful way the story was developed.I don't want to kill the ending, but Chasteen could certainly become the star of many novels to come."},{"Title":"Bahamarama (St. Martin's Minotaur Mysteries)","review":"Whiny baby protagonist; pointless plot; endless blathery exposition. I tried to read this hoping it could get better, but the writing is dreadful. I quit half way through and wasted every moment.

Bob Morris's first effort did that although I agree with others here who felt the book lacked the pace you would like to see in a book such as this. If Morris intends to join the ranks of some of the other Florida/Bahama novelists he is going to have to crank it up a bit, but for a first effort is does have promise."},{"Title":"Bahamarama (St. Martin's Minotaur Mysteries)","review":"The mystery is no big deal and is much too easy.

So, I immediately purchased Bahamarama right after finishing Jamaica Me Dead in hopes that it was just as good.What a disappointment to say the least!!! I guessed who dunnit by page 140, which was less than halfway through Bahamarama... I've never read a mystery novel, where I guessed whodunnit and why so early on in the game. Also, the novel started out fun and fast paced with lots of action and very witty, but got boring in the middle partly due to the fact that I was bored cause I figured all out.The only redeeming features were the humor and that Zack Chasteen and his sidekick, Boggy, are likable characters."},{"Title":"Bahamarama (St. Martin's Minotaur Mysteries)","review":"It's too late for me -- save yourselves. The best thing about the book is that it's short. The hero needs another dimension to be two dimensional. The style -- well, there isn't any. The author starts with a plot, drops it quickly and moves onto a long hiatus of boring description and a character with no emotional or intellectual depth. Shortly after a character introduction, I told my son I can't believe the coming twist would be so obvious and telegraphed. When a red herring is thrown in, it has \\"Red Herring\\" painted on its side. The author didn't believe it and neither will you.In the last dozen pages, the author returns to the opening plot and quickly resolves it. No suspension of disbelief is required, because there is no pretense of believability.My wife will attest to my low standards for thrillers of this sort. This book did not even rise that far."},{"Title":"Bahamarama (St. Martin's Minotaur Mysteries)","review":"While I've enjoyed (in a qualified way) the earlier installments in this series, I'd grown weary of the author's fondness for showy (and often poorly executed) plot twists rather than trusting his writing and his characters to pull the reader through the book. Well, I'm happy to say that this book breaks the pattern and is a solid and entertaining mystery read through-and-through.What we've got here is enjoyable characters, interesting locales, vicarious travel pleasures, and a narrative drive that will keep you popping chapters like potato-chips. An enjoyable beach read, even if (maybe even especially if) you don't have a beach handy."},{"Title":"Bahamarama (St. Martin's Minotaur Mysteries)","review":"Want a comfort read? Bahamarama is a summery romp between Florida and the Bahamas.Zack Chasteen, an ex-NFL player who was framed by smugglers and has just finished doing time as the book begins, is a likeable sleuth with a delightful sense of humor. The supporting cast, especially Boggy, Pederson, and Nixon, are the kinds of people you run into in the Bahamas and Florida and nowhere else. Chasteen, just trying to get reunited with his sweetie, Barbara, after those two lonely years in the pen, encounters murderers, kidnappers, tourists, too much rum, palm trees, and a hurricane. When it's all sorted out, Zack turns the tables on the villains, and it's the bad guys' turn go to jail.Okay, there are cliches and plot holes along the way. Okay, I figured out whodunit before the halfway point. But Bob Morris's voice is compelling and could only have come from a guy who has spent many years in Florida and loves the place very much. You will smell the coconut and conch, folks."},{"Title":"Bahamarama (St. Martin's Minotaur Mysteries)","review":"I must admit, I am a bit of a Caribbean/Florida mystery book fan and love to escape to the tropics on the page.

Bob Morris has captured the feel of the islands in his fictional Harbour Island (I'm sure I've been there...) and believable colorful characters in Zach, his ex-Dolphin main character, Lord Downey and Pederson, the refreshingly intelligent inspector investigating a murder. Morris has obviously spent many days in the islands and his love of their nature and beauty leaps from the page.

Though obviously influenced by Carl Hiaasen, Morris demonstrates a style all his own. Bahamarama is far less over-the-top and not nearly as mean spirited as Hiaasen's literary fare.This fast paced crime story features a very appealing protagonist, Zack Chasteen, a former Miami Dolphin whose frequent use of self-deprecation makes him very easy to like. The engaging narrative unfolds smoothly as it deftly reveals a number of unexpected plot twists and introduces some very interesting supporting characters. As an added bonus, Morris paints a beautiful picture of what life in the Bahamas is like.Bahamarama is a wonderfully entertaining read set in an idyllic locale. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Bahamarama (St. Martin's Minotaur Mysteries)","review":"So Bob Morris has written a book? What could it be? I have been reading his stuff for years. Could be a travelogue. He knows more about the world between Georgia and the Equator than just about anyone. Could be about the environment. He genuinely loves the real Florida, the one that existed before air conditioners, more than the Sierra Club could ever pretend to. Could be a love story; it is dedicated to his bride and sons, after all. Could be a mystery. He is a somewhat devious devil. Could be a comedy. He is one of the funniest people you will ever meet. Could be a collaboration with Julia Child, as I understand that when he appears at a book signing, he will make a batch of conch fritters for you. Whatever it might turn out to be, I expected it to be a great read. And so it is.The setting begins in a Florida prison and follows the release of Zach Chasteen, a former Miami Dolphin, to the Bahamas, the real Bahamas, not Nassau.The plot is a convoluted(gotta have convolutions to make a mystery) tale of money, drugs, various family issues, and some amazing coincidences.The conflict is, or course, good versus evil, within the context of the plot, setting and characters.The theme is loyalty. Zach struggles to be loyal to his love Barbara. Zach's business partner and confidante. Boggy, turns out to be steadfastly loyal to Zach, Zach's misconceptions notwithstanding.The narrative is riveting. The setting and the action captivate the reader. Morris knows the place and the time and the people.The outcome is a brilliant story, told by a writer who has mastered his craft. Trust me, it is worth the read. It compels one to complete the task without interruption.I shall not presume to abstract the plot, as most reviewers persist in doing.Let me simply answer the initial question I posed. Bahamarama is a comedy, and the punchline is 10-9=1. Read it to find out why. You will not regret the time spent.And when the movie is made, we can have coffee and discuss whether it is \\"as good as the book.\\" If so, it will be a movie worth watching."},{"Title":"Bahamarama (St. Martin's Minotaur Mysteries)","review":"This is not a \\"great\\" mystery novel, but it is a decent read if you have a minute. The story centers around Zack Chasteen, a recently released, wrongly acccused ex-football player/ex-con. A little of the action is hokey at times, a couple of the characters hard to believe and one side story that is omnipresent but handled in a rapid, throw it in there at the last minute, manner. But all-in-all the novel was a promising start to a new series. Though not a fan of most of the \\"Florida\\" mystery authors, Morris seems to be off to a decent start. Worth a look at least."},{"Title":"Bahamarama (St. Martin's Minotaur Mysteries)","review":"It must be something about the Florida climate that spawns good mystery writers, Bob Morris being the latest. His first mystery opens with the protagonist's release from Federal Prison Camp/Baypoint, a home away from home for white collar types-- not exactly what we would expect for the makings of a sympathetic character. We soon learn, however, that Zack Chasteen was wrongly convicted and indeed is a most likeable mystery solver. He dresses well, eats and drinks even better and is in general a laid-back dude, even when he has to kill to protect himself. This very well-written novel has an intricate, byzantine plot. Things are not as they seem here. While I anticipated some of the events, Mr. Morris and Zack were usually miles ahead of me. I would call this novel \\"slick\\", and that is not a pejorative term. It goes down as easily as a fine piece of Key lime pie. Actually, I wish Mr. Morris had included recipes for all that wondrously exotic food he discusses.A friend and fellow-reader thinks the writer may have been too hard on Lesbians. (I don't want to give away the plot.) I didn't think so. Perhaps Mr. Morris can give the religious right a hard time next time.I look forward to reading Mr. Morris' next novel."},{"Title":"Bahamarama (St. Martin's Minotaur Mysteries)","review":"Ex Miami Dolpin's Linebacker Zack Chasteen, who also used to be a charter boat skipper has spent his time in a white coller type prison, doing the time I might add for a crime he didn't do, dreaming of the Bahamas and Barbara. However the limo his lover has sent for him abandons him and all of a sudden he's on his own. He thumbs a ride home only to be confronted by bad guys. He kills one and escapes, finally getting to the Bahamas only to find that Barbara's ex-fiance has been murdered and she has been kidnapped. With the help of his buddy Boogy, Nixon, a boy claiming to be a guide and local police inspector Lynfield Pederson, he sets out to find his lady love even as a hurricane is charging toward the islands.This superbly plotted novel full of colorful characters and twists in turns kept me going through a long night. I couldn't sleep, because of the flu, and I couldn't have asked for a better companion then this book. Carl Hiaasen and Lawrence Shames et al have a new member in the zany Florida Characters Club.

Not great literature, not deep plot lines, just something to pass away a winter weekend. Well, this book certainly did it for me.

Good enough that I'll buy the rest of the series from Amazon and know that I've got a decent read on hand when I need it."},{"Title":"Bahamarama (St. Martin's Minotaur Mysteries)","review":"First off, let me say this is a great fun read and once you begin you better be prepared to read, because you will get hooked. I finished this book in about two days and it made me want to read more by Bob Morris.The story revolves around Zach Chasteen, an ex Football player for Miami, who found himself in jail after he was framed for a deal gone bad with some Latin drug lords. Zach is pretty hard bolied and down to earth and his only passions in life are his girlfriend and his boat. When his girlfriend winds up missing on a photo shoot in the Bahamas, Zach finds himself entangled in a game of cat and mouse with the kidnappers.The plot is okay and perhaps like me, you'll be able to figure out the ending before it happens.

Morris moves offshore into the Bahamas, however, providing us with a different locale in the same region. For me, this book lacked momentum but was still enjoyable enough to complete. There is no shifting of scenes as the entire book is viewed through Chasteen, a recent prison release. It's a straight forward day by day journey of the character as he seeks his missing girlfriend. It's not bad for a first book and I'm sure the author will improve in his next few books. I will give him another shot when his next one is out in paperback.This book could easily be turned into a comical movie along the lines of Big Trouble, Big Bounce, or Get Shorty.

Welcome Bob Morris to the fold. His first novel after tons of work in the \\"real world\\" of journalism. He told me that this is the first of a trilogy. It'll be interesting to see if Chasteen, an ex-Dolphin who still believes he can blitz, his protagonist, Barbara, the femme fatale, Boggy, his DR Indian helper (think Igor to Dr. Frankenstein) and Yellow Bird, appear in his next effort. [Hey, Bob! Bring Nixon back!]Other reviewers have outlined the story. But readers want to know, how does Morris compare with others in his class? First off, this is a light read. Start to finish - Tampa to Detroit and back. The plot is simple, bordering on simplistic. The parallel plots don't seem to sufficiently crisscross or intermesh. As a result, the reader isn't sufficiently distracted away from solving the mystery. Having said all that, Morris is one helluva wordsmith when it comes to imagining. His characters are quickly but very succinctly constructed. The tableaus are so clearly worded that you can smell the smoke, taste the salty air, and, yes, feel the pain! [By the way, Bob, if Chasteen was a blitzing linebacker, how come he still had teeth?]So, reader, go ahead. Scour all the Florida writers' works.

He wasn't arguing that there are multiple universes connected to ours in some way explorable through science. Those would be parts of this world, in Lewis' sense. The worlds he's talking about are possible worlds. They aren't actual. That is, they don't exist in any way spatiotemporally or causally connected with the actual world. And yet he says they're as concrete as we are.Philosophers' responses to this view are incredibly interesting. They think the idea is nuts, and yet they have no way to resist the conclusion that he gives compelling arguments that his view solves numerous philosophical problems that no one has been able to deal with in a perfectly satisfactory way. This doesn't convince many people that his view is correct, but the response has been pretty strong among those who want to use his system without thinking that it's true. They call it a modal fiction, and the view is called fictionalism. This is becoming incredibly influential among metaphysicians.Aside from all that, most metaphysicians today recognize this book as just incredibly fruitful and creative in bringing together so many different strains in metaphysics. He deals with so many problems in such a lucid way that the book serves to introduce many problems in metaphysics, making advances in the discussion even apart from the contribution of his main thesis."},{"Title":"On the Plurality of Worlds","review":"Lewis' work always produces mixed feelings in me. There is a long list of good things to be said on his behalf, and, so far as I can see, only one really bad thing. But the bad thing is bad enough to taint my otherwise unalloyed (and profound) respect and admiration for this superb thinker, quite probably the best philosopher alive, and almost certainly the best I've ever read. (Aaron, if you are reading this, you were right about your teacher; he deserves all the plaudits you kept showering on him, and for all I know he may even be right about the crazy things he says.)First, the pros. Lewis offers a modal metaphysics that is a) technically brilliant, elegant, and well-motivated, b) capable of providing reductive analyses of a vast range of otherwise obscure notions, and c) the best game in town if considered simply on it theoretical merits. He shows how his modal realism can be used to analyze modality (necessity, possibility, and the like, as well as restricted modalities) and mental and semantic content, and to make room for properties and counterfactual claims. He shows how to dissolve the debate among essentialists and anti-essentialists using counterpart theory, how to avoid various apparently serious objections to modal realism, and how to understand the debates about de re modality and &quot;transworld identity&quot;. He offers a clear account of ersatzism, especially of the linguistic variety, which (I agree with him in holding) is the only real alternative to his modal realism among the theories so far offered, and is as such clearly an inferior theory. He offers a devastating argument against &quot;magical ersatzism&quot;, probably the most commonly held view on modality apart from linguistic approaches. The argument is decisive, I think, and shows that approaches like those of Plantinga or Stalnaker cannot succeed. His modal realism has its limitations; because he cannot help himself to worlds bigger than a certain size and shape, and because he has all the worlds as concrete objects existing &quot;side by side&quot;, so to speak, he can't countenance the full range of possibilities that an ersatzist can, and his analyses come apart at the edges. (For instance, the thesis of the plurality of worlds itself is, on Lewis' account, necessarily false; thus he must believe in necessarily false truths. Again, he cannot admit the possibility of two spatiotemporally disconnected universes, or worlds that differ as to which non-spatiotemporal abstracta exist in them.) When these defects are compared against the defects of Lewis' competitors, however, his view emerges as the clear winner.Nonetheless, in the end all of this theoretical advantage is not enough. The thesis of the plurality of worlds is simply incredible. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that its falsehood is something like a Moorean fact; it disagrees so badly with common sense that no philosophical considerations in its favor could constitute an adequate reason for accepting it. Lewis's methodology is right; he proceeds in theorizing by weighing the costs of departure from pretheoretical opinion against the benefits in theoretical economy and utility. Unfortunately, this method is here being used by the wrong person; for all his brilliance, Lewis just doesn't have the *good sense*, or wisdom, to see how crazy his theory is--and this is the only thing that lessens my admiration for him. Faced with the evident inadequacies of all the competitor accounts that Lewis surveys, I am forced to make the choice Lewis says I will be forced to make:&quot;Paradise on the cheap, like the famous free lunch, is not to be had. Make of this what you will. Join the genuine modal realists; or foresake genuine and ersatz worlds alike.&quot;Since I cannot join the modal realists (literally, &quot;cannot&quot;; I am psychologically incapable of it), I choose to foresake possibilia altogether. Ersatz or concrete, they must go; and if I can think of no alternative to these approaches--which are after all the only ones now on offer--I shall simply suspend judgement on whether there are really possible worlds of *any* sort, and on their nature and how we can do what we do with them. But I insist on maintaining the hope that some future theorist will tell us how we can help ourselves to possibilia, in a way that we can live with--for it seems absurd to give up the benefits of talking in terms of possibilia just because we have no adequate and credible metaphysics of them."},{"Title":"On the Plurality of Worlds","review":"In the book _On the Plurality of Worlds_, analytic philosopher David Lewis presents his case for modal realism (also called \\"extreme modal realism\\", though why it is \\"extreme\\" is questioned). As Lewis explains, \\"This book defends modal realism: the thesis that the world we are part of is but one of a plurality of worlds, and that we who inhabit this world are only a few out of all the inhabitants of all the worlds.\\" Lewis will argue for this position based on the fact of the utility of modal realism for philosophy provides reason to believe that it is true (just as the utility of set theory provides reason to believe that there are sets), then he will consider the common objections to this position and argue against them. Lewis maintains that he does not provide an argument that effectively requires one to believe in a plurality of worlds, but only that he will provide a cost-benefits analysis of this idea. The idea of possible worlds is a recurrent one in the philosophy of Leibniz; however, Lewis does not mention him because he feels that any interpretation he might offer of Leibniz's works would be inadequate. David Lewis (1941-2001) who taught at Princeton was one of the more interesting thinkers in analytic philosophy and this book is certain to remain a classic and can be appreciated even if one cannot go all the way with Lewis in accepting his arguments for modal realism. It should also be pointed out that Lewis' arguments while often subtle can be followed with some effort and that he presents a very effective case.This book consists of four chapters. The first chapter \\"A Philosophers' Paradise\\" lays the case for modal realism and argues that a plurality of worlds has utility in philosophy. Lewis begins by noting that he will restrict himself to possibilia and by writing off impossibilia. Lewis then goes on to explain how the usefulness of a plurality of worlds makes it likely for one to think that it is indeed true. Lewis considers the case of a possible worlds analysis of modality (showing how the \\"diamond\\" (\\"possibly\\") and \\"box\\" (\\"necessarily\\") symbols are mutually interdefinable and can be understood in terms of possible worlds). Lewis also considers the idea of \\"closeness\\" of possible worlds and defines such notions as counterfactuals and verisimilitude. Following this, Lewis considers content of possible worlds and considers analyses of thought, belief, and language. Lewis then shows how modal realism may be used to explain properties (universals and tropes), the fact that possible worlds are isolated and not spatio-temporally connected, and the fact of concreteness, plenitude, and actuality. Lewis maintains that actuality must be understood by making use of an indexical analysis. The second chapter \\"Paradox in Paradise?\\" shows some of the commonly made objections to modal realism and argues for why Lewis thinks they are inadequate. Lewis considers the objections made that according to his analysis \\"everything is actual\\", objections that try to trap modal realism in paradoxes akin to those of nave set theory, an objection made that there are more worlds than there are (relying on a paradox in set theory), epistemic objections that we cannot know, objections made that the existence of possible worlds provides a road to skepticism or indifference (i.e. ethical paradoxes brought about by the existence of possible worlds), an objection made that modal realism causes the arbitrariness of this actual world to be lost, and finally \\"the incredulous stare\\" (the objection that modal realism flies in the face of common sense). Lewis provides good arguments against most of these objections, but ultimately the most powerful seem to be the objections from common sense. The third chapter \\"Paradise on the Cheap?\\" argues against the alternative to Lewis' view which attempts to make use of the utility of a plurality of worlds without committing oneself to modal realism (what Lewis calls \\"ersatz modal realism\\"). The \\"ersatzist program\\" replaces possible worlds with mere abstract representations. Lewis considers what he considers to be the three leading possibilities for ersatzism: linguistic ersatzism, pictorial ersatzism, and what he calls \\"magical\\" ersatzism. He finds each of these alternatives to be problematic and ultimately not be able to provide the benefits of possible worlds given the modal realist understanding. The fourth chapter is \\"Counterparts or Double Lives?\\". Here, Lewis considers the question of \\"counterparts\\" across worlds and attempts to resolve some of the apparent paradoxes which may ensue. He considers the cases of trans-world identity and overlap. Then, he provides an argument against the existence of trans-world individuals and an argument against what he terms \\"haecceitism\\". Finally, he provides an argument against constancy. From these arguments he concludes that his notion of counterparts is the correct analysis and is superior to the alternatives. Thus, stands the case for Lewis' modal realism.Among analytic philosophers in the last century, David Lewis stands out as one of the most important. His arguments for modal realism in this book are fascinating and are important if one seeks to understand the issue of possible worlds. Ultimately even if one finds such objections as ethical paradoxes brought about by modal realism or the common sense objection convincing, Lewis' work still remains important in that it must be seriously considered. It should also be pointed out that while the idea of multiple worlds or universes appears to be playing some role in the more abstract reaches of theoretical physics (including the possibility that quantum mechanics may best be resolved by an appeal to multiple worlds) that these multiple worlds considered by physicists differ from the possible worlds of philosophers such as Lewis. To begin with there is the fact that the possible worlds considered by Lewis are spatiotemporally isolated. This does not appear to be the case with the multiple worlds considered by some physicists. Further, there may be reason to believe that the speculations of certain physicists regarding multiple universes are unwarranted scientifically (perhaps by an appeal to Occam's razor). Nevertheless, Lewis' analysis of possible worlds remains important and should be read by those interested in the further development of analytic philosophy."},{"Title":"On the Plurality of Worlds","review":"Lewis argues that the semantics of modal logic are best served by postulating the existence of a set of possible worlds, so that our modal operators refer to states of affairs within those worlds. He argues by analogy with numbers that the causal independence of those worlds is no obstacle to their theoretical usefulness, and offers detailed criticism of several attempts to simulate modal semantics without postulating the worlds as really existing. His positive argument for his own view primarily involves looking at other issues in modal logic from the perspective of his modal realism, showing how his view can help shed light on those issues. His discussion of those issues is of great independent interest even to those skeptical of his modal realism."},{"Title":"On the Plurality of Worlds","review":"This is awesome stuff, which everyone needs to know. So what if it's false? There are tons of ultra cool ideas in here, and as far as taking the ball and running with it, there's nothing better this century. -- Benj Hellie"},{"Title":"On the Plurality of Worlds","review":"First of all, it's not about the semantics of modal logic, it's about the metaphysics of modality, in a way that rationalists will hate: we see it as providing an unworkable substitute for modal claims, and dodging serious issues about the ground of necessity. Over half of the book (parts 2 and 3) is of technical interest at best -- the infamous linguistic/pictorial/magical trichotomy is a particularly dire piece of navel-gazing. The book stimulated a good deal of interest in various ways of eliminating apparent existential implications of theories; I must say that I've found some of this machinery helpful in my own work on mind, but probably the interest to serious metaphysics is minimal. More peripheral issues: while the material on persistence through time is interesting and important, the attempts to eliminate belief de re fail and are motivated by a misunderstanding of psychological explanation. The material on properties is not backed up by the most solid argument, though over all of course the writing is beautiful and the arguments tricky. The judgment of history is still in the making, of course; in about twenty years, the dust will have settled and we'll be able to judge the merit of the work more dispassionately."},{"Title":"On the Plurality of Worlds","review":"My understanding is that this book is currently usually read out of idle curiosity and is not taken seriously because of being so at odds with common sense.Unfortunately for the general consensus about this book, the idea that infinitely many parallel universes actually exist now has enough backing in the world of Physics that it can no longer be viewed as utterly insane, however at odds it is with common sense.It is, in fact, becoming increasingly more likely that Philosophers and Philosophy students a few generations hence are going to wonder why Lewis wasn't seen as a visionary by his contemporaries."},{"Title":"On the Plurality of Worlds","review":"Crudely this book has been written to coordinate Cantor's transfinite number and set theory with philosophy.In English, this means that if space is infinite, then there are infinite worlds.

Despite a weak and too-lengthy opening segment on the origin of life and other awkward philosophical questions (the merits of this section are addressed by Irving/Knickerbocker in volume two), once the Dutch colonize the ancient island of Manhattoes (present-day Manhattan), Irving hits a rollicking gallop, going full stride at full speed and doesn't stop until the dubious William the Testy is vanquished at the first volume's end.\\"Diedrich Knickerbocker\\" was arguably the greatest of the several personae Irving adopted during the course of his long writing career. 'Diedrich' penned 'The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow' and 'Rip Van Winkle,' as well as short stories 'Wolfert Weber,' 'The Devil And Tom Walker,' 'Kidd The Pirate,' and 'Dolph Heyliger.' Irving achieved magic whenever he wrote, but when he steps into Knickerbocker's antique Dutch shoes, the combination of humor, history and folklore that results is unique, sweeping, and highly entertaining.Few writers could or would dare to write the kind of poetic sentances Irving/Knickerbocker could, such as \\"the inhabitants were of primitive stock, and had itermarried and bred in and in, never swarming far from the parent hive.\\"All lovers of American literature and history, and of Americana generally, should know this delightful, warm and amusing book. Too often today, when addressing the origins of American literature and our early writers, we turn to names like Hawthorne and Poe, forgetting that Irving came first and was in fact the first American writer ever to be taken seriously by Europeans. (It was Hawthorne and Poe that paid lip service to Irving, who was born a full 21 years before Hawthorne and 26 years before Poe.) Some historians and critics go so far as to credit Irving with the creation of the short story as a literary form; he was also the U.S. ambassador to Spain, a world traveler, a biographer of George Washington, and at one time requested to run for mayor of New York City (an invitation he kindly declined). Thanks largely to Irving, the New York City and Hudson River Valley areas have a thriving plethora of myth and folklore all their own. As Americans, we owe the dynamic, magnanimous and prolific Irving a great debt, which decade after decade we neglect to pay or acknowledge.Knickerbocker's History of New York is not difficult reading, though it is too advanced for children and most teenagers. However, any young adult or adult with a love of American history, particularly with an interest in the founding of our country or the American Revolution specifically, will find it fascinating. Humorists will find it a page-turning delight, and send their volumes of Twain back to the library post-haste...."},{"Title":"A history of New York: From the beginning of the world to the end of the Dutch dynasty : containing, among many surprising and curious matters, the ... that ever hath been or ever will be published","review":"In 1809 Washington Irving published \\"A History of New York,\\" the work that make him instantly famous. Conceived as a parody of Samuel L. Mitchill's guidebook \\"The Picture of New York\\" (1807), Irving's \\"History\\" purports to be written by the fictitious Diedrich Knickerbocker. It was, perhaps, the first American book to be embargoed by the publisher--that is, it was published in Philadelphia to keep its contents secret from the press in New York. Before the book was published, Irving and his friends even coordinated a hoax through the local papers, publishing a series of notices advertising Knickerbocker's inexplicable disappearance: \\"there are some reasons for believing he is not in his right mind,\\" and \\"a very curious kind of written book has been found in his room.\\"The book was such a success that Irving revised it repeatedly during his lifetime, and readers should note which edition they are purchasing. Most recent editions reprint either the original text or the last revision, which are so different that they may as well be considered different works. By the time of the Author's Revised Edition of Irving's collected works, published in 1848, Irving had completely rewritten over a tenth of the book, added about 7,000 words of new material, softened the sarcasm, eliminated the mocking references to Jefferson's presidential administration, removed many risque passages and double entendres, and polished the overall style. The barbs are more personal in the earlier edition; Irving aimed his parody more broadly forty years later. In sum, while the earlier edition was considered more scandalous--even \\"naughty\\"--and cheekier in its wit and tone, the last edition is certainly more polished and \\"mature\\"--and might be considered by many as noticeably easier to read. (The remainder of this review focuses on the 1809 edition.)The book's conceit is that the fictitious Knickerbocker, a Dutch descendant, nostalgically mourns the passing of Dutch hegemony on the island of \\"Manna-hata, Manhattoes, or as it is vulgarly called Manhattan,\\" and he offers a rousing defense (read: mock hagiography) of the Dutch governors. But Irving's satire is aimed not simply at the long-dead colonists of New York; his depictions of various Dutch leaders evoke many of his contemporaries. Thus, Wilhelmus Kleft seems an awful lot like Thomas Jefferson, and Jacobus von Poffenburgh recalls General James Wilkinson (who was caught up in Aaron Burr's allegedly treasonous schemes against Jefferson's government). The \\"hero\\" of the book, however, is Peter Stuyvesant, whose glorious qualities are manifold--even if his rule was considered authoritarian and his last act as governor was to rebel against his own king, who had ceded Manhattan to his brother, the duke of York.Irving, as Knickerbocker, also mocks the pretensions of historical scholarship. He offers philosophical justifications for the obesities of city leaders (\\"Who ever heard of fat men heading a riot?\\") and praises the well-honed Dutch civil defense against Yankee encroachments (\\"Never was a more comprehensive, a more expeditious, or, what is still better, a more economical measure devised, than this of defeating the Yankees by proclamation.\\"). He interrupts his narrative several times with admonishments to the reader or faux biographical meanderings, and, near the end of the book, he acknowledges that his tone has changed from that of a \\"crabbed cynical, impertinent little son of a Dutchman\\" to a \\"most social, companionable regard.\\" Of the many readers that began his book, \\"some dropped down dead (asleep) on the field; others threw down my book in the middle of the first chapter, took to their heels and never ceased scampering until they had fairly run it out of sight . . . Every page thinned my ranks more and more.\\"This last self-deprecatory joke is certainly the case for modern would-be readers: Irving's archaic prose can be a slog, and his historical and literary references will perplex even the most arduous. But not all the humor is dated, and quite often patient readers will be rewarded by a comment or pun that may even cause them to laugh out loud."},{"Title":"A history of New York: From the beginning of the world to the end of the Dutch dynasty : containing, among many surprising and curious matters, the ... that ever hath been or ever will be published","review":"Perhaps 100 years ago, readers considered this to be a great book.

I hadn't seen that episode in years but in reading the story I could see it perfectly in my mind's eye- there was nothing added nor missing from the original. The wit, and madness, of the good Doctor truly came across._As for the story itself, it is a cross between \\"The Thing from another World\\" and something out of H.P. Lovecraft. The action starts out at a science outpost in the Antarctic and moves to a great stately mansion in the English countryside. The action doesn't slacken for an instant._The introduction by Harlan Ellison is especially good. He really \\"got\\" the true character of the Doctor. After all, this is a Time Lord who refused to stand by as a passive, objective observer like the rest of his kind. Instead, he commandeered an old Mk.40 TARDIS and set out on a crusade to protect the weak and innocent from the monstrous and evil. In short, this is The Doctor."},{"Title":"Doctor Who and The Seeds of Doom (Doctor Who #10)","review":"When a British scientific expedition at Antarctica discovers a pair of strange pods, buried in the permafrost, they little realize just what they have found. When the (fourth) Doctor hears about it, he is so alarmed that he immediate heads down there, but he is too late. The pods are seed pods for a malignant, killer plant, called a Krynoid. He succeeds in destroying one of them, but a psychopathic millionaire plant-fancier sent men down to retrieve the other pod for his collection. Little does this mad man realize what danger he has unleashed on the world, and worse, little does he care!This book is a novelization of the Doctor Who episode (which originally aired from 1/31/1976 to 3/6/1976) of the same name. The work was undertaken by Philip Hinchcliffe, the producer of the episode. He did a very good job of staying faithful to the show, and yet giving the story the feeling of being a genuine novel. I must say that I did enjoy seeing the Doctor and Sarah Jane Smith in action again, even if it is in an adventure that I already remember seeing. I found this to be a very entertaining book, and really enjoyed my time spent reading it."},{"Title":"Doctor Who and The Seeds of Doom (Doctor Who #10)","review":"The last story of Doctor Who's thirteenth season, this story saw a substantial change in the Doctor-Sarah relationship: Sarah was now a willing passenger on the TARDIS, as opposed to someone travelling with the Doctor because he says he will take he to some place in particular.But speaking of the TARDIS, it doesn't really feature in this Earthbound story at all. The Doctor has spotted some pictures of alien pods found in the Antarctic permafrost, and takes it upon himself to investigate. His decision corresponds to a crisis at the Antarctic base, and so the Doctor and Sarah head down in time to find that one of the scientist has been infected by the pod and is transforming into a savage plant-human hybrid. A pair of travellers who claim to have gotten lost are trying to find the second pod, and there are forces in play that are not obvious to the Doctor.The story is the last appearance of UNIT for many years, and none of the UNIT regulars are featured. Their absence is made up, at least in part, by strong characters such as Harrison Chase and Amelia Ducat (although the latter is sadly underrepresented in this book).Overall it is an unsurprising story, but amusing all the same."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Interpreting Your Dreams","review":"This book explains many points of view on interpreting dreams, but only gives the big picture, not getting into too much detail.

Cohen undertook this complex task prior to WWII and wrote an epilogue following the genocide that took place in Lithuania during the German occupation, 1941-3.Cohen's judgement seemed to be reserved due to the fact that the genocide came as such a shock to the Jewish community. Vilna was considered to be one of the few safe havens during World War II for Jews. Vilnius had a remarkable history of being an open city, tolerant of a wide array of cultures and religions, which was what Mr. Cohen chose to focus on. He made no excuses for the genocide but rather illustrated the dynamics of this ever-changing city and how Vilnius, and in turn Lithuania, simply was not able to bear up under the pressures of World War II.He charted the various occupations of the city by the Poles, Russians, Soviets and Germans. Lithuanians seemed to be almost peripheral figures in this dramatic ebb and flow. An essentially benevolent nobility that offered its protection to the Yiddish community and constantly renewed its charters so that it could thrive within the often adverserial climate of the city.All that changed with the Russian occupation in the 19th century. Lithuanian Jews found themselves conscripted into the army just like Jews throughout the Russian empire, but somehow they managed to hold together a tight-knit community that had many leading lights including the most famous Gaon Elijah.The book is well worth reading for it provides a rare glimpse into the dynamics of this Medieval city that was shaped by an astonishing array of forces."},{"Title":"SAP ABAP Certification Review: SAP ABAP Interview Questions, Answers, And Explanations","review":"First, and frankly the most important thing to understand about interview questions books is that they help you save time. These books help you understand what deserves your attention and further reading, and what does not. These books help you understand what you need to learn, and what you can safely ignore. As an SAP consultant you can spend several hours each week, if not every day, learning about SAP. It is a major part of being an SAP person (especially a good one), and anything that you can do to reduce the amount of time you spend simply learning is very valuable to you. When you're spending time reading and not billing at a client, it can cost you about $100 each hour. That's expensive reading time! And so why would you even think twice about the cost of a $50 book if you think it will help you learn something valuable that you can apply at your job.Second, the SAP market is evolving. It is evolving in ways that demand SAP people understand more about the product we are working with - It's not uncommon to see requests for an \\"MM and SD\\" functional consultant these days. Also, in my consulting practice, I am focusing on SRM - but each day I am called upon to talk about MM, PP, PS, and other areas in SAP. I think that clients are less and less willing to hear, \\"Well that's a FICO issue - or that's an MM issue.\\"Finally, I use these books myself. Each time I'm asked a question that stumps me, and this happens all of the time (despite what my clients may think), I turn to my own books as a reference. A couple of weeks ago someone asked me a question about a work order in PM. As an SRM consultant, I had little exposure to work orders. So I grabbed my PM Interview Questions book, looked up work orders in the index, and the EXACT question someone asked me was answered in the PM book. So the SAP Interview Questions, Answers, and Explanations series of books help save SAP people time because they show you what is important to learn, and I believe they help greatly in cross training - and so that's what these books are all about. They will save you time, and give you more knowledge about the SAP product.

The book focuses on nine sites, which range from the late Neolithic through the Middle Ages. Each of the sites contains human remains, and the book explains what those remains can tell us about how our ancestors lived in ancient times.What makes the book especially engaging is that it tries to show how these people would have looked when they were alive. Each chapter features either a portrait (often generated with the aid of computers) or a sculpture that puts flesh on dry bones. In one particularly striking case, the author tells the story of Bleadon Man, an Iron Age farmer who died nearly 2,000 years ago. Using DNA from his bones, scientists were able to identify five people who were living in the same English farming village 2,000 years later and who had DNA that was very similar to the ancient farmer--probably, but not certainly, these five are the farmer's distant relatives. Then the scientists prepared a sculpture showing how the ancient farmer probably looked when he was alive. The sculpture was compared to one of the modern villagers with similar DNA--and, as Richards puts it, &quot;from their faces they could have been brothers.&quot; The picture that shows the descendant holding up the sculpture of his ancient forebear is worth the price of admission.If you enjoy this book, you should also try Ian Wilson's &quot;Past Lives: Unlocking the Secrets of Our Ancestors,&quot; which explores several of the same cases and a few besides."},{"Title":"Acts of the Apostles (Anchor Bible)","review":"\`The Acts of the Apostles' in the Anchor Bible series, by distinguished Jesuit scholar, Joseph Fitzmyer, is one of the better commentaries on Acts I have read (with the understanding that I have certainly not seen all those done in the last 25 years, especially the very highly regarded one by Ben Witherington. Fitzmyer's volume has an advantage shared with several others, in that the same author has also done a commentary on the Gospel of Luke, written by the same ancient writer who wrote Acts.I was quite surprised to discover that this work was but one volume long, since \`Acts' is almost as long as the Gospel. The reason is as mundane as an editorial judgment by senior editors at Doubleday, the publisher of the Anchor Bible series. Oddly enough, the foreshortened perspective this forced on the author may actually have been a very good thing for non-professional readers. That is, pastoral and lay readers, who may be using the book as part of a Bible study series. Fitzmyer left out much discussion on the wide range of opinions on many issues which, for the non-scholarly user is largely a waste of time.In spite of this loss, Fitzmyer still provides one of the most valuable resources, the detailed bibliographies after each pericope, giving sources of opinions in interpreting the text. Fitzmyer also includes several features which one does not find very often, and which are revealing, even if you do not read them in depth. The first is the complete text of his own translation of \`Acts'. This is an excellent feature, as one suggestion all advisors on Bible reading agree on is that it is wise to read the entire book through before digging into the details of individual verses and pericopes. It is unusual for him to do this, as he did not do it in his two volume treatment of \`Luke'.A second valuable feature is Fitzmyer's survey of all the different sources of the original Greek texts. Few commentaries on \`Acts' do this, and few commentaries on many books of the Bible do this. It is interesting to see this survey for at least one book, and Acts is more interesting than many, since there seem to be many more such sources than for, for example, the Synoptic Gospels.I have used Fitzmyer's commentary on \`Luke', and found it slightly less useful than some others, especially Joel Green's contribution to the NICNT series. In contrast, F. F. France's NICNT volume is also quite good, but not as deep as Green's, so Fitzmyer comes off (sans scholarly baggage) much more useful than his \`Luke' volume. Fitzmyer's \`Acts' (and everyone else's \`Acts') may also benefit by the absence of the many comparisons between the three synoptic Gospels, which may be interesting for textual analysis, but is not too rewarding for those interested in culling the pastoral lessons from the text. The other side of the coin is that since \`Acts' stands alone, it is much harder to get some sense of from where Luke's sources came. Much of this thinking seems pretty speculative. While Fitzmyer gives us a fair reading of current thought on this, he also wisely agrees that this is secondary to Luke's pastoral message. What is vexing is that we have only the barest sense of why this book was written. Why did no others write similar texts, just as there were four Gospels written. (Of course, I know of all the various apocryphal \`Acts of' this, that and the other figure, but none carry the interest of the book which made it into the canon.One of the few drawbacks of Fitzmyer's \`Acts' is that it relies on your reading his \`Luke' volumes, especially his long exposition on Luke's theology in Volume 1. This is fair, since the overwhelming consensus is that \`Luke' and \`Acts' are very much two volumes of a single cohesive work.I would not go so far as to say this was the BEST 'Acts' commentary, as you may simply want the less scholarly offering by F. F. Bruce or the social orientation of Wetherington, but this is very good, especially for serious Bible study."},{"Title":"Acts of the Apostles (Anchor Bible)","review":"The Anchor series as a whole rarely ever disappoints as far as the authors and size of the commentaries that they put together. This commentary by Joseph Fitzmeyer fits this mold perfectly.The only drawback that I found to be with the commentary was that it felt like Fitzmeyer could have put more of his own voice into it. He does an amazing job of gathering resources and interacting with almost everything that he mentions, but it felt, at times, he could have expanded upon his own thoughts a bit more. Please do not get me wrong, this is an excellent commentary. Especially if you are looking for a commentary that is going to give you all of the facts without an exegete trying at every turn to force their own specialized understanding of the text upon you.If you are looking for a solid, approachable, and scholarly commentary on Acts you cannot go wrong with Fitzmeyer's Anchor Commentary. If you want something that has as much information but may be slightly less conservative in regard to the author sharing their own views on some of the more ticklish verses in the book, I would suggest taking a look at Bock's Baker Commentary. Or, you could always purchase both.Overall, probably the most accessible of the higher level commentaries that will show you the standard approach to the Book of Acts. A perfect starting point."},{"Title":"Acts of the Apostles (Anchor Bible)","review":"If you plan to do a serious, in-depth study of the book of Acts without side-stepping the intellectual arguments, Fitzmyer's book on it is a virtually-essential starting point. He seems to have read everything that has been written by anyone on Acts, and gives detailed summaries of their arguments, followed by full bibliographic information.I was surprised to discover that in this book all Greek text is printed only in a Roman lettering transcription, when one really would have expected the Greek alphabet to be used for a book of this standing. In amazing contrast to this, a Norwegian source is quoted in the original language and without a translation. With theological works of a certain academic level (which this book presumably purports to be), quotations from German are often not translated, on the (arrogant? unreasonable?) assumption that any serious theologian will be able to read German - but no Norwegian would be offended if his words were translated for speakers of other languages - especially in a book where Greek quotations are always translated into English (except for re-quotations of words and phrases from a verse that has been translated at the beginning of the same section).Fitzmyer deals with textual and theological problems, instead of pretending (as do some commentaries) that such problems do not exist. An example of this is his discussion of the circumcision of Timothy as recorded in Acts 16:3 (cf. Fitzmyer pp 573-575). However, the best treatment of this is - as is often the case - in F.F. Bruce's book on Acts.However, because of his background (as a Roman Catholic and a Jesuit), Fitzmyer sometimes sees \\"problems\\" where there are none, for instance, in the phrase in Acts 1:14 referring to Jesus' brothers, and the subsequent references to \\"James, the brother of the Lord\\". On page 216 he writes, \\"Luke uses the same words that he used in the Gospel (8:19-20), where he took over a phrase from Mark 3:31, in which context hoi adelphoi autou [TRA: his brothers] at first sight suggests that blood brothers are meant.\\" Fitzmyer goes on to say \\"In Mark 6:3 Jesus is said to be the adelphos [TRA: brother] of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon.\\" He then says \\"That relationship is further complicated by what Paul says of James in Gal 1:19, \`the brother of the Lord' (cf. 1 Cor 15:7), and of the Lord's brothers in 1 Cor 9:5.\\" Fitzmyer concludes \\"the most natural meaning of adelphos is blood-brother\\", and subsequently in the book when this James is referred to, Fitzmyer uses the phrase \\"the brother of the Lord\\". All of this does however at least serve to show that Fitzmyer engages honestly with matters that he perceives as problems, and does not limit himself by presenting uncritically the traditional Roman Catholic party line.Another blind spot for Fitzmyer is any real understanding of the Holy Spirit and the gifts of the Spirit. For him, the Holy Spirit is imparted (automatically and simultaneously) by baptism, which results in him having great difficulty with Acts 8, which states (in verse 12) that when the people of Samaria believed, they were baptised - but verse 15 states that they had not yet received the Holy Spirit.As one has a right to expect from a serious commentary, Fitzmyer gives very thorough references throughout to other relevant passages of Scripture, and this would be a great help to anyone wanting to prepare either Bible studies or serious, in-depth, Bible-based teaching on the book of Acts.There is also a wealth of relevant historical and geographical background (dates, locations of cities, etc.)Each section of Fitzmyer's book starts with his translation of the relevant portion of Acts. While this is generally very good, it is not always totally accurate, as can be seen, for instance, in his translation of 16:3: \\"Paul ... had him circumcised\\", which implies, incorrectly, that Paul got someone else to do this. In Acts 9:13 Ananias \\"apekrithe\\" [TRA: \\"answered\\"] is translated \\"protested\\" by Fitzmyer and \\"tois hagiois sou\\" [TRA: \\"your saints\\" or \\"your holy ones\\"] is translated \\"your dedicated people\\" by Fitzmyer, who is presumably inhibited by the (non-Biblical) meaning attributed to the word \\"saints\\" by Roman Catholics (and some other groups). While he clearly wanted to avoid misunderstanding by his readers, in a book of this standing one would have not expected him to side-step the issue, but to address it, explaining the Biblical meaning of the word \\"saints\\". Perhaps this would have been a step too far for a Roman Catholic theologian - or perhaps he thought that if he did discuss it, he would run the risk of not obtaining the RC Church's licences to print - the \\"Imprimatur\\" and the \\"Imprimi Potest\\" and the church's acceptance that the book was not harmful to the faithful, the \\"Nihil Obstat\\" - all of which are prominently displayed in the accustomed way at the beginning of the book.While Fitzmyer is conservative, and therefore rejects various outlandish theories concerning the text or the incidents related, he is of course in no way an evangelical, and those with a high view of Biblical inspiration will not like comments such as \\"Luke makes Paul formulate ...\\" (p. 609). Fitzmyer's position is that Luke has made up speeches by Paul and others.After his translation of the original text, there is a section with the title \\"Comment\\". Sometimes (e.g., p. 600) this provides additional information. But on other occasions (e.g., p. 722), it merely summarises what the text says, and one must then ask what purpose it serves.The \\"Comment\\" section is followed by a much longer section with the title \\"Notes\\". This generally goes into considerable detail and is frequently extremely enlightening. However, by the time that we get to chapter 22 or 23 of Acts, we begin to get the impression that Fitzmyer is tiring of his task (or perhaps he realises that he is in danger of exceeding the word or page limit imposed by his publisher), as the Notes sections are a lot shorter and go into much less detail.I can appreciate that some of Fitzmyer's supporters might be outraged that I have not given this magnum opus five stars. I hope that this review explains the rationale behind that."},{"Title":"Acts of the Apostles (Anchor Bible)","review":"Fitzmyer, once again produces a herculian work for the serious New Testament student.

This book has a great appeal to children because it is about animals and celebrates their many different traits. It also teaches the moral that everyone is unique and special in his or her own way, and that one should be proud of who they are. It is a story of a dachshund, Noodle, who gets one wish from a dog fairy. Noodle decides he wants to be a new size and shape, since being a dachshund he has short legs and a long body. The story is Noodle's quest to find out the best size and shape, and along the way he meets many zoo animals who all have different opinions. In the end Noodle realizes exactly what size and shape is best for him. This story was my mother's favorite book as a child, and my brother and I grew up reading this story with our pet dachshund.

He was associated with scandals, but many were not his fault. Grant was a single minded general who pursued victory over the Confederate forces. For this he was listed as a butcher. His earlier travails with alchohol resulted in him being termed a alcholic. His associated with disreputable people was caused him to be associated with scandals. Late in life he was defrauded and his memoirs were a way for him to guarantee a life after his death for his beloved wife Julia.This is a nice read on a noble General and President.

Grant (American Presidents)","review":"In this installment of The American Presidents book series, author Jonah Bunting III takes a look at the widely-misunderstood presidency of Ulysses Grant, our nation's 18th Commander in Chief.Operating primarily under the principle that Grant's two terms were perceived as rife with alcoholism & scandal, Bunting takes this opportunity to \\"set the record straight\\", so to speak. While this book could be conceived as sympathetic towards Grant, it didn't feel overly glossy towards Grant's feats & faults. Bunting just truly believes that Grant was a great man, an almost-great President, and thus makes a compelling argument for that philosophy.One thing that makes this book stand out is its overall structure. Each portion of Grant's life (early, War, First Term, Second Term) are given roughly equal shrift within the book. While some books focus too much on the \\"early stuff\\" and not as much on the Presidency, this one gets the balance right.Overall, this is a very good place to start for amateur U.S. Grant historians or just those interested in Presidents."},{"Title":"Ulysses S.

This is a terrific introduction to Grant from a historical viewpoint as I read Grant's own writings. Thank you Josiah Bunting III!"},{"Title":"Ulysses S. Grant (American Presidents)","review":"Excellent for for those interested in our early history. Covers things you never hear about when it comes to Grant.Good Read!"},{"Title":"Ulysses S. Grant (American Presidents)","review":"Interestingly, the only five post-Lincoln US Presidents who have concerned themselves with Civil Rights (Grant, Harding, Truman, LBJ and Nixon) have ended their Presidencies rated by journalists and historians at the bottom of the list of Presidential greatness. To be sure, it wasn't civil rights that doomed their reputation, it was supposedly corruption (Grant, Harding, Truman and Nixon) or an unpopular war (Truman, LBJ and Nixon), but the corruption charges do not compare with the abuse of the FBI and the IRS by FDR and JFK, let alone the sale of military secrets and pardons by Clinton, and none of those Presidents seem likely to be tainted. And Truman's war had a happy ending while Vietnam was not the fault of either LBJ or Nixon. So their bad reps are something of a mystery.Only slowly have they recovered their reputations. First it was Harry Truman who leaped from the lowest Gallup poll ratings in history to the status of \\"Near Great\\", helped by his oral histories and a Broadway show. Ever since Frank Scaturro's groundbreaking work, President Grant Reconsidered, Ulysses S. Grant has seemed next in line for promotion.Josiah Bunting's inclusion in Arthur Schlesinger's American President series should be welcomed as the establishment's acceptance of a more favorable view of President Grant. Arthur Schlesinger, whose \\"greatness list\\" perpetuated the sour rankings of the civil rights Presidents for many years, was the general editor of the American Presidents Series and he has generally chosen establishment, orthodox, mildly leftist authors for the series who can be counted on to say nothing that will challenge the established order or, indeed, have anything novel or interesting to say.That Schlesinger chose Josiah Bunting, the highly respected general and scholar, is a different matter. Gen. Bunting has written a concise and highly recommended defense of Ulysses Grant, building on Frank Scaturro's work and humanizing Grant in the process. There are the occasional typos, but that is to be expected in American publishing these days. What Bunting does is show just how far thinking and compassionate Grant was with enlightened views toward international affairs, civil rights, civil service, the claims of native Americans and economic matters. He also shows that the scandals were less his Administration's fault than they were those of Congress.I fault him only on his focus. Only sixty pages out of less than 160 are devoted to his Presidency and fifteen of them to Grant's first inauguration, his cabinet choices and the Black Friday gold panic. Only six pages are devoted to the second administration (although, to be fair, some of Grant's actions from 1873 to 1877 are covered in thematic chapters devoted to subjects such as Reconstruction and Indian Affairs). The Colfax Massacre and Grant's willingness to prosecute the murderers right up to the Supreme Court don't get a mention.The result is that this is a first rate introductory biography of Ulysses Grant, highly recommended to anyone who is interested in, but ignorant of, the man, but as a history of the Grant Administration, we will have to wait for the second volume of Brooks Simpson's biography of Grant."},{"Title":"Ulysses S. Grant (American Presidents)","review":"Josiah Bunting III has written a wonderful short, clear work on the life of one of our greatest Americans. While there are many fine books on Ulysses S. Grant now avaiable, this one is recommended for the reader seeking a first or refreshed understanding of this often undervalued leader.

However I couldn't help but wonder if the author (Bunting) intentionally avoided mentioning Grant's most praiseworthy and controversial proposal and one that if adopted, would have provided funding, without the need for an income tax, for all of our government's requirements even to this day! That is Grant's proposal to tax all church property."},{"Title":"Ulysses S. Grant (American Presidents)","review":"I just finished this book, and although I think the author meant well, I found this book to be too apologetic, or supportive of Grant.The book is well written. There is a lot of detail leading up to Grant's presidency. Further, I enjoyed the book greatly. But, I thought the author spent far too much time trying to convince the reader that Grant was above reproach, that his flaws were exaggerated.Historically, Grant has been accused of being a drunkard. The author glosses over this, and, other than a time that he was no longer in the military (before the Civil War) very little information is provided to show whether he was \\"drunk on the job\\" or not. It was almost as if the author believed not mentioning it would make us believe that he was not intoxicated often on the job. Frankly, it doesn't matter too much to me, he was successful in his leadership during the Civil War regardless. But it adds a layer of complexity to the man that I felt was just ignored in this book.I thought the scandals of his presidency were given too little attention. Most of them were discarded in a couple of paragraphs, and frankly, I thought the accusations were hard to follow. Once again, it seems as if little attention or detail were given in the book, it was as if they didn't happen or had little credence. I just want to be informed with more detail about the accusations, and I will make the call whether I believe Grant was culpable or not.Once again, lots of information. I felt like the sections on his Presidency, and his post-presidency, were a little short and lacking in detail. Still, I am just nitpicking."},{"Title":"Ulysses S. Grant (American Presidents)","review":"The author expresses his opinions, just like the news media does. I bought this book for its value as a history book. I am not particularly fond of reading the authors slanted opinions. Not a good read for me!"},{"Title":"Ulysses S. Grant (American Presidents)","review":"Unlike his generalship during the Civil War, Grant's presidency has earned him few admirers among historians. The numerous scandals that took place during his two terms in office, and the Panic of 1873 which wrecked havoc on the country's economy during his second term, have generally diminished history's view of Grant's presidency. His consistently strong stewardship of the difficult task of Reconstruction, including his upholding of the laws which enabled Blacks to vote and hold office in the south, his successful foreign policy, and his fair treatment of Native Americans were often neglected. An historical consensus formed that split Grant's life into halves; General Grant was a heroic and needed leader, but President Grant was an admirable failure, unsuited for political leadership.Josiah Bunting III is the perfect author to correct these misperceptions about Grant. As a former army officer, Bunting understands well the institution that was so much a part of Grant's adult life and the source for his fame which would catapult him into the White House. But he also has enough emotional distance from the army to provide insightful commentary. What's most surprising, however, is the literary skill Bunting brings to the task. His small book on Grant is a beautiful gem of a biography, burnished to a fine work of art. Bunting has written two novels and he shows a fine writer's gifts here. He has the great biographer's necessary gift of understanding the importance of character.The Grant that comes alive in Bunting's pages is highly sympathetic, but always credibly so. Bunting shows how the usual slurs against Grant's character (alcohol, butchery, and scandal) were overdone, while many redeeming characteristics (good to friends and family, steady, moral) were overlooked. Bunting reevaluates the character of Grant in this more favorable light and recreates a president who won two elections by landslides and never was out of favor with the general public.Bunting's defense of Grant succeeds splendidly. I've read all sixteen of these small biographies published so far in \\"The American Presidents\\" series, and while I've found all of them good, and many quite excellent, this one on Grant is the best. It belongs on the shelf of every reader interested in American history."},{"Title":"Ulysses S. Grant (American Presidents)","review":"It has been U.S. Grant's misfortune to rank behind Lincoln and Lee in the pantheon of the major notable Civil War heroes. A Presidency racked by scandal though largely not of his fault didn't help matters. But Grant was a winner - and that's what counts. From defeating the \\"Marble Man\\" Lee to his courageous drive to finish his memoirs as Cancer was taking his life, Grant showed nobility and character, which is the foci of Josiah Bunting's brief tome in this volume of \\"The American Presidents\\" series.In focusing on the character and the nobility of Grant, Bunting does take a different perspective, though by no means new view of this subject. Indeed, Mark Feely, Jean Edward Smith, and to a lesser degree Geoffrey Perrett have already covered and done justice to Grant's character in their works - and I would recommend both Feely and Perrett to the Grant novice, not to mention his \\"Memoirs\\". I might also note that the late Stephen Ambrose, in his \\"To America\\" wrote a very lengthy essay on why Grant was a good President - not just a great General, and how he did do his best to stop the resurgence of segregation and anti-Black animus in the post-Civil War South, and why he could not succeed.This isn't to say that Professor Bunting's book does not deserve a wide readership - it does. But do check out Feely, Perrett, and Smith first, and above all, get a copy of those \\"Personal Memoirs\\" - they are by far the best memoirs ever penned by an American President, and a classic of American Literature."},{"Title":"Ulysses S. Grant (American Presidents)","review":"This short biography, which is a volume in the \\"American Presidents\\" series affords the reader a sympathetic view of Grant as President. Another recent short biography of Grant, by Michael Korda, spends a little less time on Grant's presidency (thus more time on his military career) and views his presidency less favorably. I recommend that both biographies be read, as in significantly less than 200 pages, both offer insights into Grant. Indeed, if you have read a longer biography (and there are many) such as McFeely, Peret, or Simpson, these short biographies do a great job of crystalizing the information and, in fact, they offer additional insights.Bunting views Grant as the most pro African American president up to his time and for many decades thereafter. He tried to make Reconstruction work for the freedmen but, much like the attitude of Americans when the Vietnam War dragged on for many years, Americans lost their patience when Reconstruction dragged on with little discernable progress. Grant was President at a time when foreign affairs were not paramount. Therfore, most of what went on beyond domestic policy involved Latin America, including a plan to acquire Santo Domingo (now the Dominican republic). However, Grant was successful in certain foreign ventures such as entering into a treaty with Great Britain for reparations based on it's role in building blockade running ships for the Confederacy.Another area in which Bunting admires Grant is his treatment of the American Indian. Grant was ultimately unsuccessful but he had hoped to integrate them into American society so that they would be full citizens. Today, we would understand that what Grant was trying to do would strip the Native American of his/her culture but, at the time, Grant's attempts were very much ahead of the general feeling which viewed our original inhabitants as savages.Of course there were scandals during the Grant presidency and Bunting criticizes Grant for being passive in dealing with these. Grant was not involved but he was too loyal to his friends and, therefore failed to act decisively. Where he should have fired certain unethical officials outright, Grant would often ease them out. His gentle treament failed to set an example to others who might be tempted to also act unethically.I have read many histories of the Civil War, McFeely's biography of Grant, and Grant's personal Memoirs. Nontheless, this short volume has given me additional insights into Grant and was well worth reading."},{"Title":"Ulysses S.

Grant (American Presidents)","review":"Ulysses S. Grant (born Hiram Ulysses Grant, but there's a story there, as summarized in this work) was to ascend to the highest ranks in the hearts of his countrymen--from commanding general of the Union forces to President of the United States.His rise to such positions seemed most unlikely to those who knew him in the years after the Mexican War. He grew up in Ohio and, through happenstance, ended up at West Point. He completed his studies, ranking in the middle of the pack in his class. He was noteworthy for his skills as a horseman and for his mathematical ability. His performance in the Mexican War was very strong. In the process of his tour of duty, he served under both Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott, and learned considerably about what makes a general. Thereafter, he had a series of postings leaving him isolated and sometimes \\"on the bottle,\\" where he developed a reputation as a drunk.There follows the familiar story of his departure from the army, failed effort after failed effort at creating a solid economic grounding h=for his family. As the Civil War opened, while he was working in the family store in Galena, Illinois, he served as an officer as civilian military units were formed.After that, his meteoric rise in the Army--from regiment command to commanding general of all Union forces. In between, he displayed the ability to win battles that often led other generals to retreat. In the process, Americans had come to respect him as the war closed.The book chronicles his disagreements with Andrew Johnson's policies after Lincoln's assassination. Then, in 1868, Grant was nominated by the Republicans for president. This book takes a hard look at his presidency--the good, the bad, and the ugly. There were some important contributions--despite faltering, he did try to support the newly won rights of former slaves; he also supported humane treatment of Indians (even against the wishes of his top lieutenants--William Sherman and Phil Sheridan). But his economic policy contributed to the Panic that engulfed his second administration. His blind eye toward corruption of some of his colleagues does him no honor in history. There were also some foreign policy successes, to round out the picture.And, his final years, in which he courageously tried to provide for his families' economic security.All in all, another good entry in this series of brief biographies (155 pages of text, with a useful chronology following the text). As always, if one wishes a quick and accessible view of this American president, this book will do nicely. And, even though this book is brief, the author pouts Grant's performance as president in a nice context."},{"Title":"Ulysses S. Grant (American Presidents)","review":"The short volumes in the American Presidents series offer an outstanding way for readers to get reacquainted with American history and with our Nation's leaders. Each volume is written by a scholar who brings his or her own perspective to the subject, focusing on the factors that make the president in question worth knowing and remembering. In this volume of the series, Josiah Bunting III offers an admirable and challenging portrait of U.S. Grant (1822 -- 1885) who served as the eighteenth president of the United States (1869 -- 1877). Bunting is a former army officer who served as the superintendant of the Virginia Military Institute for many years. He offers a reappraisal of the Grant presidency in this volume, in company with some other contemporary scholarly reassessments.As Bunting emphasizes, Grant has suffered from cliches both as General and as President. He is frequently castigated as a \\"drunk\\" (Grant did indeed have problems with alcohol early in his career) and as a \\"butcher\\", in spite of the extraordinary strategic skill he displayed in the Vicksburg campaign, at Fort Donelson, in crossing the James River en route to Petersburg, and elsewhere (and in spite of the relatively low casualty rates, overall, of the armies under his command). In his presidency, Grant is often found at the bottome of the various rankings, primarily due to the corruption that ensued during his administration.Bunting's book offers a brief portrait of Grant's early life and a good brief summary of his accomplishments during the Civil War. He also offers a brisk account of Grant's activities during the four years between Appomattox and Grant's own election to the presidency, focusing on his increasingly strained relationship with Andrew Johnson and his eventual rejection of Johnson's lenient policy of Reconstruction. This pivotal period of Grant's career is frequently overlooked.But the focus of the book is on Grant's presidency. Bunting properly points out that with the exception of Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt, no person faced greater challenges than did Grant in assuming the executive office. The country was seriously divided over Reconstruction, with the seemingly intractable goals of restoring the Union on the one hand and protecting the rights of African Americans on the other hand. Bunting praises Grant for the efforts he made to protect the rights of the freed people. With substantial justification, Bunting says that Grant's efforts were the strongest made by an American president until the mid-20th Century. Bunting also praises Grant for pursuing a relatively humane policy towards the Indians, for his courageous veto of inflationary paper money legislation in 1874, and for his calm and principled stance during the Hayes-Tilden controversy in the presidential election of 1876.Bunting does not overlook Grant's deficiencies as president, but I think he tends to downplay them. He acknowledges a substantial degree of moral obtuseness in Grant, if not personal culpability, in the manner in which the President responded to the scandals which plagued his administration. Grant showed a high degree of cronyism while in office and a tendency, derived from his success as a general, to be peremptory in has actions and judgments. On several occasions, Grant's policies and inactions led to economic difficulties, including the severe depression of 1873. Even in the area of Reconstruction and civil rights, Grant frequently compromised his efforts due to political considerations. And he was aware that the military presence in the South and the agressive Federal efforts to protect the rights of the freed people would need to end, due to lack of support in the nation, if not during his administration, then in the administration of his successor.Grant remained a revered figure during his lifetime. He probably could have been elected to a third term in 1876, had he wished, and he narrowly missed a renomination for president in 1880. Grant's Memoirs of his Civil War and Mexican War experiences, which he wrote towards the end of his life, is a classic of American literature.I think historians will debate the extent to which Bunting's work, and similar studies, serve to rehabilitate the presidency of Grant. But clearly, Bunting offers a fresh and thoughtful approach which will serve to modify the stereotypes that many informed Americans carry about him. Bunting's book offers a good introduction to a great, if enigmatic, American and to his difficult presidency.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Ulysses S. Grant (American Presidents)","review":"This is one of two brief biographies of Grant (1822-1885) I recently read, the other written by Michael Korda and included among the volumes which comprise the Atlas Books/HarperCollins' \\"Eminent Lives\\" series, with James Atlas serving as general editor. Although both cover much of the same material, there are significant differences between their authors' respective approaches to the18th president of the United States.For example, Korda duly acknowledges the problems which awaited Grant after he was elected to his first term in 1869. \\"What did Grant's reputation as a president in, however, (and continues to do so today whenever journalists and historians are drawing up lists of the best presidents vs. the worst ones), was the depression of 1873, which ushered in a long period of unemployment and distress, made politically more damaging by accusations that the president's wealthy friends were making money out of it.\\" Given that the United States was growing too fast, in too many different directions at once, and the inevitable consequence was corruption and an unstable economy, it would have taken a more astute man than Grant to slow things down or clean them up.\\"It is soon obvious in this volume that Bunting disagrees with, indeed resents the fact that Grant is generally remembered \\"as a general, not a president, [which] explains in part the condescension - there is no better word for it -- from which pundits and historians have tended to write of him.\\" Bunting asserts that if judged by the consequences of Grant's common sense, judgment, and intuition, his presidency, \\"so far from being one of the nation's worst, may yet be seen as one of the best.\\"Korda indicates no inclination to view Grant's presidency as \\"one of the best.\\" He duly acknowledges the problems which awaited Grant after he was elected to his first term in 1869. \\"What did Grant's reputation as a president in, however, (and continues to do so today whenever journalists and historians are drawing up lists of the best presidents vs. the worst ones), was the depression of 1873, which ushered in a long period of unemployment and distress, made politically more damaging by accusations that the president's wealthy friends were making money out of it.\\" Given that the United States was growing too fast, in too many different directions at once, and the inevitable consequence was corruption and an unstable economy, \\"it would have taken a more astute man than Grant to slow things down or clean them up.\\"This last observation by Korda is consistent with a contemporary assessment of Grant by the Edinburgh Review, one which Brooks Simpson quotes in his own study (Let Us Have Peace: Ulysses S. Grant and the Politics of War and Reconstruction 1861-1868), and which Bunting also cites: \\"To bind up the wounds left by the war, to restore concord to the still distracted Union, to ensure real freedom to the Southern Negro, and full justice to the southern white; these are indeed tasks which might tax the powers of Washington himself or a greater than Washington, if such a man is to be found.\\"With all due respect to Grant's admirable personal qualities, I remain unconvinced by Bunting's eloquent but - in my judgment - problematic endorsement of Grant'sleadership as president. The same \\"buck\\" that stops on a desk on a battlefield in Virginia also stops on a desk in the Oval Office.Those who share my high regard for this volume are urged to check out Korda's biography as well as Grant's Personal Memoirs. Both Korda and Bunting cite a number of other sources worthy of consideration."},{"Title":"Ulysses S. Grant (American Presidents)","review":"The first book on Grant that I read was \\"Grant- The Soldier and the Man\\" by Edward Longacre.This was a wonderful insight into Grant and certainly exposing his personal foibles. The details into Grant's life from childhood through the Civil War were wonderfully presented.I had just finished biographies on Lincoln and Johnson and was hungry for more reading on the post civil war era. Unfortunately, Longacre ended the book right after Grant was elected president- which is why I purchased Bunting's work.The first 90 pages are an abbreviation of Grant's life through the war. Not nearly as detailed or informative as Longacre's.The book ends 60 pages later and frankly, it kept me wanting for more. It just skimmed over too much of Grant's presidency (and hardly touches on his life after he was president).Other reviewers have lauded this book. In my opinion, the author seems to have been in too much of a hurry to finish it and could have certainly provided a much more in depth rendition."},{"Title":"Ulysses S. Grant (American Presidents)","review":"Ulysses S. Grant was a simple man (a \\"guy's guy\\" if you will) whose quiet, dignified leadership and composure helped the nation through some of the worst days of the Civil War. It seems odd really to think of a military commander (or a military man of any rank or position) to possess the qualities that Grant did. Humble. Straightforward. Sensitive. And yet he was all these things.He had to contend with the same horrors that Lincoln had to face: the most disruptive and bloody years the nation ever suffered through. And following the war (rather than accept retirement after having served) he accepted a call to the presidency, and with it, the challenges of Reconstruction. The simple statement, \\"Let us have peace,\\" still echo down as a strong reminder to us, to those who never had the chance to meet him... Grant really was the right person for the times in which he passed.The author, Josiah Bunting III, deserves credit and our thanks for having written a very good book. It's language is engaging. As a reader, I never thought I'd be able to sit through pages of descriptive narration of battles, army movements and strategy. It was never really something I could stomach in any of my history classes, and yet Mr. Bunting had me at every move. I was fascinated and along for every moment of the ride.One can't help but be struck with the haunting realization that the Civil War was never a thing written in stone: it was avoidable. As with any other historical moment, it was something that came, something that followed the actions of other leaders (Franklin Pierce, Stephen Douglas, James Buchanan all spring to mind) who couldn't see that they were walking down a dangerous path. And yet, the war also lifted some men into national prominence: men of great character... men like U. S. Grant."},{"Title":"Selves (Poets, Penguin)","review":"Philip Booth is today's Robert Frost.

His inclusion of the Yajnavalkya smriti as well as a (albeit small) sampling of late medieval tantra and bhakti literature makes for a good base of scripture to build any Hindusim course on.

Ranging from fascinating discussions of how the actual chemical composition of film stock was engineered to maximize the representation of caucasian skin on celluloid to race in cheesy Italian sword-and-sandals films of the 1950s, this is a real triumph for academic writing--a work that's actually compelling for a non-specialist, but an important intervention in the field at the same time.

Nobody else seems to know who he is. Anyhow: River of Dust is his most powerful to date. The society is riveting, its history mysterious, and the central tale -- the tale of three siblings (one of whom we never meet) -- is tragedy as Shakespeare would have written if he had written science fiction. I only give a 10 to a novel that I want to immediately re-read, but this one makes it to my &quot;I will re-read it when I run out of new books to read&quot; list (the 9 list)."},{"Title":"River of Dust","review":"_River of Dust_ by Alexander Jablokov is a science fiction novel set on the planet Mars several centuries into the future. Humanity has resided on the Red Planet for several hundred years and has started to develop its own culture there. Early, starry-eyed attempts at surface habitats and terraforming have been abandoned, as Martian society is an urban and underground one. There are large cities on Mars, or rather in Mars, tunneled through the Martian rock, sometimes peeking at the sky above through heavily shielded windows, but more often very deep underground.The best thing about the book is its portrayal of the Martian cities (particularly of the main setting of the book, the city of Scamander). The author did a good job of portraying Mars as a distinct culture, as a country, with its own fashion, fads, sense of decorum and of honor, relationships between government and the governed, politics, holidays, festivals, dreaded figures from its past, etc. The reader is not eased into Martian society but rather pretty much thrown into it and for a time it was difficult going but eventually understandable. It almost reminded me of watching Shakespeare performed or hearing the quick banter of interwar British high society types in a _Poirot_ movie; hard to comprehend at first, maybe even baffling, but after a time you get used to it and don't even notice it after a time.The worst thing about the book though is its complex, difficult to understand plot, one of politics, intrigue, and family feuds. In one sense, the novel is about who has control over Mars, which political faction, whether Earth or one of the ones native to Mars, whether its own government (nominally independent of Earth) or another faction, that of the Pure Land School, lead by an individual named Rudolf Hounslow. Within this struggle various organizations fight politically with one another even though they agree on overall goals (two military/police organizations - Internal Security or InSec and the Vigil - clash quite a bit over jurisdiction and methods in the book). In another sense, it is also a tale of family tragedy, of the rise and fall of a once great family and in particular two brothers, Hektor and Breyton Passman and their father, Lon, a family still haunted by a past in which the Passman brother's mother and sister had died and torn apart in the present by divided loyalties in the Byzantine politics of Mars.Byzantine plots in and of themselves might not be such a problem and I knew going into the novel that Martian politics would be a major theme, but I was hampered by the fact that I never really understood some of the actors. What motivated Hounslow and the Pure Land School (or one of their acolytes, Brenda Marr, who was a major character)? What did they want? They wanted to control Mars, but what made them different from any other faction? They were described as Neo-Confucian, but what did that mean? They spoke a few times of the purity of the Martian surface, but was that just a sense of aesthetics or did they seriously think that Martian society would give up the vast underground cities, given how difficult if not impossible life would be on the surface? Brenda Marr herself was a complete enigma; I never once understood her motives. Was I supposed to?With regard to the Passman brothers, I felt Jablokov didn't quite flesh them out well enough. Despite them being the main characters, I never quite understood why they were estranged, or why they chose the sides that they did, which detracted some from any sense of tragedy that the author was building towards. He did a nice job of describing their great home, Xui House, once a fine noble building that was the center of attention, now largely empty, but their motivations never quite clicked with meIn the end, I have mixed feelings about the novel. I thought it had a promising beginning, and the end, while exciting in some ways was also confusing in others. On the one hand the book had one of the finest portraits of a possible, future Mars but on the other hand its heavily political plot to me at least never quite gelled. A good effort though."},{"Title":"River of Dust","review":"River of Dust is a prequel of sorts to Jablokov's first novel, Carve the Sky. An expansion of his novella \\"Syrtis,\\" it tells the story of brothers Hektor and Breyton Passman, sons of famous Martian political figure Lon Passman. Hektor, the younger brother, is pursuing the political career Breyton abandoned. Breyton, more passionate and exuberant than Hektor, is waiting for inspiration to strike and show him his path in life.The Passmans live in Scamander, a city located underneath the hostile surface of the red planet. The subterranean populace of Mars is divided into two classes-the well-educated upper class, which includes the Passmans, and the rough and tumble working class. This centuries old caste system is experiencing upheaval, due to the radical philosophies of Rudolf Hounslow. Hounslow's followers, known as the Pure Land School, have launched a terrorist strike, assassinating a relatively harmless colonial official.The assassination triggers a series of events which eventually find the brothers on opposite sides of a civil war. Breyton joins the Pure Land School, while Hektor deals with the political fallout, eventually designing a Machiavellian plot to crush the rebels. The conflict takes its toll on the Passmans, costing the lives of friends and family, and forcing the two young men even further apart.Jablokov's characters are complex, colorful and believable, as are their relationships. The setting, the claustrophobic caverns of Mars, is intriguing, as are its effects on Martian society. Martians are a special breed, and Jablokov revels in their idiosyncrasies. Especially enjoyable is the Martian penchant for theatrical gestures, the catalyst for many memorable scenes.The book's major problems stem from the author's failure to detail the underpinnings of the societal conflict at novel's center. Rupert Hounslow's beliefs initiate momentous events, yet are never fully expounded. The aristocracy's side (i.e. preserving the status quo) is reasonably clear, but the agenda of the Pure Land School is never fully explored. Was this a sizable movement, or merely a bunch of rabble rousers who succeeded in disrupting Martian society? The reader never knows what is really at stake.However, these flaws are far from fatal. Jablokov delivers a finely crafted story with several well-drawn characters and intriguing plot twists. Having had a taste of Mars, discerning readers may hope that Jablokov will soon revisit this fertile territory."},{"Title":"River of Dust","review":"When I first started reading this, I though dull, dull, DULL. I stuck at it, and and was amply rewarded for doing so, because the ending is superb.

Lilley, minister of the Church of Religious Science in Palo Alto. Judging from its production as a paperback, TAKE TIME TO THINK was meant to serve as a book of meditations, many of them merely one page in length. Each story has quite a lot to offer and does stimulate thinking, believing--a life-changing proposition. The variety is keen and you'll be pleased with the gentle manner in which Lilley guides you into Infinite Truth. Inspired reading!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I think that it is evident that Neal Stephenson put a lot of time into the creation and development of the plot. At first the book seemed to jump around and not have any pattern, but as I continued to read the book seemed to fall into place. Hiro Protagonist, who is the main character of the book, is a man of many trades; pizza-delivery man for the Mafia, greatest samurai sword fighter in the Metaverse, and last freelance hacker. Together with his girlfriend, Y.T., they set out to destroy the culprit of the computer death virus known as Raven. This death virus if not stopped could end America. For me, the novel seemed to drag at points, it was a hybrid of worlds. At times the book moved at a neck-breaking pace only to yield a subsequent chapter that crawled as if it were a tortoise. This created a schism in the plot and put me in a polar mode; &quot;I love it, I hate it, I love it, I hate it.&quot; For this reason it was mediocre at best."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This book was a really enjoyable. It is kind of slow in the beginning but after the first few chapters I really began to get into it. It takes a little bit to understand all of the technical terna and slang but once you get the hang of it it really is fun to read. It is a whole word created within that book with just enough truth to make it seem possible, and that is part of the appeal. I recommend this book if you like to read science fiction."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is a fantastic book. I could'nt put it down. The charactors &amp; story are as clever as Gibson's. You never stop cheering the odd cast of Hiro's. I am suprised that Keanu hasn't been looking at a script of this sci/action/thriller. Of course the big screen is never as good as your own imagination so buy it &amp; read it. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I mainly read fantasy with occasional forays into scifi. I ordered this book on the strength of the acclaim from other readers. For the first several chapters I really enjoyed the read, with the biting satire and ultra hip characters. But the book lost steam mid way through, and was a bit of a chore to finish. Frankly the lectures on the nature of religion and verbal viruses were incredibly dull. It ruined the momentum created by the fast paced beginning. Also the humor virtually (pun intended) disappeared at the same time. I kept anticipating another amusing vignette but it never happened. As in many science fiction or fantasy hack jobs, the characters never rose above their stereotypic introductions. My advice is to check it out in your local library. When you get to the section involving the Librarian, if you still like it, then fork over the bucks for your own copy. Me, I'm rereading Hyperion."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"For the most part this was a decent book. Stephenson is a better writer, in my opinion, than William Gibson based on what I've read in Neuromancer. He makes a fairly interesting plot that weaves Sumerian mythology with computer hacking, and I liked his vision of an ultra-libertarian society. But if his handling of male/female interactions is any indication, Stephenson must be one socially inept dweeb (Again, he's still better than Gibson in this regard).Honestly, his treatment of the story's main female character sounded like nerdy masturbation material at times (I mean, who has an orgasm THAT quickly?). Furthermore, the ending was so abrupt it seemed like Stephenson just gave up. He may as well have punctuated the last sentence of the book by blowing his brains out all over it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I really did like this book much more than I thought, but, then again, I've liked other books by Neal Stephenson (such as &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;), so this is no big stretch for me. And, actually, reading this book and search for more &quot;cyberpunk&quot; books like it led me to one called &quot;Darkeye: Cyber Hunter&quot; that was really strangely written, but was still good and, in my humble opinion, a good companion piece for any &quot;cyberpunk&quot; books."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The book is quite a rollercoaster ride. It's mostly a showcase for images and ideas, tons of them, thrown at you a mile a minute. The breaks in the narrative, and even the Sumerian mythology dissertations, didn't distract me. I even liked those parts, and felt they gave more substance to the book than it would have otherwise had. Granted the &quot;language is a virus&quot; riff was copped straight from William S. Burroughs, but Stephenson played it well.The characterization and plotting reminded me very much of an anime, something that other reviewers have pointed out accurately. Unfortunately, I don't care for anime very much. Most anime is thinly plotted and poorly characterized, and Stephenson's book suffers from the same problem. To be honest with you, the character I sympathized the most with was the cyber-dog.Stephenson created an interesting world that I liked spending time in, but he didn't seem to know quite what to do with it, and overall &quot;Snow Crash&quot; is overwhelmed by its author's florid imagination. Sadly, Stephenson followed this tendency in his subsequent writing instead of focusing on learning how to write plots and characters. His work since &quot;Snow Crash&quot; is imaginative, but didactic to the point of being incomprehensible, and plots and characters are low on his priority list.&quot;Snow Crash&quot; is by far Stephenson's best work, and because of this it remains the only one that most science fiction readers know him for. Hopefully one day Stephenson can get his imagination under a bit more control, learn more about plot and characterization, and produce more humanistic and less manic work. Until then, this is his best, and it's worth reading."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash is the exquisite story of Hiro Protaganist, Pizza Delivery Driver for the Italian Mafia, and last of the great freelance hackers. Through attacks against those he holds near and dear, Hiro is drawn into the machinations of high powered players in the world economy. Fighting for nothing less then freedom of thought, Hiro makes some unlikely alliances, and goes to some truely weird lengths. My Personal favorite piece of cyberpunk literature to date. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"My husband and I originally listened to this book on tape. We enjoyed it so much we purchased copies for our daughter and her boyfriend. This book opens the mind to so much. Even though this is set in the somewhat near future, the seeds of that future can definately be seen now. It is doubtful it would happen...but you never know. The information given about Sumeria prompted us to actually do research to find out how much of it was true. The very fact that we did this was very telling as far as how the book really grabbed us. It is not something we would normally do. At times the book could be considered a little slow, but it is worth bearing through."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Hiro Protagonist is not a normal guy. He delivers pizzas for the mob, and if they are late, so too will be Hiro. They give Hiro a gun to protect himself, but he prefers the precision of his samurai swords. Hiro is a hacker as well, one who works better freelance. He is half-Korean half-black and he is a citizen of Mr. Lee's Hong Kong franchise, but he lives in a U Store it. The world he lives in is not the United States of present, but one were the United States is one of many franchises struggling to survive. Hiro's world is technologically advanced and ethnically diverse. This world is a very dangerous place.We meet Hiro as he is delivering a pizza, a pizza that looks as though it is going to be late. Although Hiro wrecks his car, the pizza is delivered thanks to a skateboard currier name YT. This act saves Hiro's life and indebts the Mob to YT. This book only gets more interesting as it goes. The central plot line of this novel is that of a virus called snow crash. Snow crash not only infects computers but also hackers who's brains understand binary code. There is a physical form of the virus that affects normal people as well. Hiro's friend is infected with the snow crash virus so Hiro sets out to discover who is responsible. YT's newly formed relationship with the mob gets her involved also. The virus turns out to be a program that affects the bios of the brain. It resets the brains of the people infected back to pre tower of Babel days. Everyone infected is able to communicate in this early language. The virus is being spread in order to control the people infected, because like a computer they can have commands written directly into their brains.Stephenson meticulously researches Syrian history and mythology. He crafts a virus as unique as his world and then pumps in enough history and fact to make it all seem almost plausible. His writing is so descriptive and detailed that it forces the reader to research the facts themselves. Stephenson takes something as seemingly boring as linguistic theory and draws an intriguing novel out of it. This excellent research is not limited only to Snow Crash. Stephenson repeats this with most of his works. Diamond Age goes deep into the theories of nanotechnology and Cryptonomicon is so bogged down with math and code breaking that it turns off many readers. That said, the mythology presented in Snow Crash is somewhat overwhelming.Stephenson is known as a cyberpunk author and this book definitely falls into the cyberpunk category. Hiro becomes a gargoyle, someone always patched into the net, and owns a house right off of main street in the Metaverse (a representation of the world wide web). Hiro himself is half-Asian and lives by the samurai code. The franchises are ruling the world and society is being divided into the haves and have-nots. Orwell's 1984 is a reality, except that it is not just three nations controlling the world but three hundred. This book brought cyberpunk back from its presumed death. If William Gibson is the god of cyberpunk, Snow Crash makes Neal Stephenson Jesus.The story flows along following the perspectives of different characters. Hiro Protagonist, as his name would imply, is the main character, but we also see Stephenson's creation through YT and other minor characters. A well-placed view from Spot the dog is refreshing if not a little sentimental, and the misadventure of a Mob flunky adds humor to the story at just the right time. The use of different character perspectives maximizes Stephenson's ability to cast different moods and tones in a way that would be impossible just following Hiro. It also gives the reader a different worldview. Stephenson is able to show how the rest of the world operates outside of Hiro's limited view.Stephenson does have a weakness in his endings though. He writes such a colorful and lively story and then it just suddenly stops. The story hits its climax and ends there. There is no resolution. This is a common theme with other works of his as well. Snow Crash, Diamond Age, Cryptonomicon, and Interface (written as Stephen Bury) all have a tendency to end at the climax. The upside to this style is that it allows the readers to finish the story themselves.I would highly recommend this excellent book. You do not have to like cyberpunk to enjoy the fast-paced action of this novel. In fact, this novel could be the launching pad to a love of cyberpunk. It is a quick and enjoyable, high octane joy ride into an alternate present. Some may be sensitive to the religious themes explored in this book, but this book does not take a theological stand in any regard. I would not recommend this book for children due to some sex and violence, but the book is not graphic in either aspect."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I came to _Snow Crash_ on the recommendation of a few people who had read it (they called it &quot;great!&quot; and &quot;hilarious!,&quot; and knowing that Neal Stephenson is sometimes listed as a &quot;cyberpunk&quot; writer along with William Gibson et al.I had liked William Gibson's books, so I gave _Snow Crash_ a try._Snow Crash_ is primarily about Hiro, a young man who delivers pizzas and collects information for the Central Intelligence Corporation (freelance), for a living. He lives in a storage unit with a cult-hero rockstar named Vitaly Chernobyl. He owns a futon, two awesome Japanese swords, and a laptop computer, where he stays &quot;jacked in&quot; to the &quot;Metaverse&quot; a lot of the time, where he is the world's greatest swordfighter.Hiro witnesses a crime while interacting with others in the Metaverse. One of his friends is deliberately exposed to a dangerous block of text, which fries his brain (in the real world), and renders him a vegetable. Hiro and his friend Y.T. (15-year old skateboarding female, and knee-slappingly funny smartaleck) set off to find out why, and save the world in the process.From the getgo this is a funny book. Sure, the vision of the near-future is dark, a little alarming, and at times depressing (there are NO general laws in _Snow Crash_, for example, and private corporations run everything, even the police, just as an example). That's what cyberpunk is like. But the HUMOR is one thing that sets Neal Stephenson aside. Hiro Protagonist? Come on, that's FUNNY, PEOPLE! One reviewer called it an 'odd' name. Yes, it's odd, and it's absurd, and it's funny! Did this author mean it is an unusual choice for a character name? I don't know. I hope not. It would be an odd choice for a character's name in a Jane Austen novel, sure. But this is cyberpunk, or something like it. Among this genre's leading inspirations are the works of Thomas Pynchon, and &quot;Hiro Protagonist,&quot; as a character name, would fit in perfectly among his merry bands of misfits, especially in _V._ or _Gravity's Rainbow_.Repeatedly reviewers are slamming Stephenson for his use of Sumerian myth, exploration of Sumerian culture, etc. in the book... calling it inaccurate, poorly connected to the rest of the story, and, (my personal least favorite), BORING. I tell you, besides the great sense of humor, the Sumerian-myth link is what sets this novel heads above so much other cyberpunk. I don't care if it's inaccurate (this is FICTION, see?). Stephenson &quot;traces&quot; computer/textual viruses and biological viruses quite nicely back to Sumerian times, and he links them to one another, biological virus to digital/informational virus (a debt to another pre-cyberpunk luminary, William Burroughs, who said &quot;Word is Virus?&quot;)-- it's all very well connected to the metaverse/here-and-now portion of _Snow Crash_'s plot.This is a funny, riproaring tale. I raced through this nearly 500-page paperback in half the time I read most books of this length. I enjoyed it beginning-to-end. My only complaint with the book was that, at times, it too much resembled a Hollywood action movie, what with all sorts of incredible stunts being performed, by boat drivers, skateboarders, swordsmen, etc.I say, if you like William Gibson or Thomas Pynchon, or if any of this review makes _Snow Crash_ seem a bit appealing to you, give it a chance. I enjoyed it 10 times as much as I thought I would.ken32"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"...of someone who took a previous reviewer's advice to have another buy the book, then lend it and be forced to buy another copy when it doesn't return!From the opening description of Hiro Protagonist (the main character--couldn't you tell?), I was caught by the irony, sarcasm, wit, and sheer fun with the English language that Neal Stephenson has in his repertoire. Snow Crash is gutsy, innovative, witty, and fun. It rewards anyone who churn out code for a living. Anyone who wonders what happens to our brains with all the advertising thrown at us. Anyone who is tired of the same old science fiction. Anyone who has wondered if the Tower of Babel story, combined with Sumerian mythos, would make a good computer-age read... the answer is yes.It's almost impossible to review a cyberpunk book without comparing it to uberauthor William Gibson's works. I find Gibson to be cooly intellectual, reserved, methodical--a great read for a day when I'm ready to think hard. Stephenson is white-hot, down and dirty, in the trenches, while not losing touch with the thoughtfulness and underlying structure that makes Gibson satisfying."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"To the extent that a book can be described as original, \\"Snow Crash\\", by Neal Stephenson is deserving of the moniker. About the only common ground that his work shares with others is that ink is applied to paper using the same letters, and then pages are bound to create a book. Much beyond that and you are in the midst of this Author's view of a given world he has modified and created. He is not only incredibly unique; his wit passes the cutting edge to the bleeding edge of razor sharp sarcasm, and irony. And when he uses words he assembles them in arrangements you have never listened to before. An important aspect that sets his work apart in this genre is that while delivering enormous amounts of information, he keeps the reader informed, he does not lose you, he ensures you stay with his wickedly fast pace by keeping you educated. Other Authors of Science Fiction are weak on this point, and it weakens their books.One date to remember when reading this work is that it was first released in June of 1992 after three years in the making. This is critical, as so much of what was absolute fiction then, may now be found within the pages of Wired Magazine. There are even words he originated that are common to most people who use a computer, especially if you have ever tried what he calls the Metaverse, touring it as an Avatar.One of the reasons his work is so authentic and exceptionally good is that he knows his material. If he talks about code he's qualified, as he has written it. When he is speaking of Sumerian Mythology an Author who spent years researching his material is again relating it. And when he just lets go with dialogue or descriptive prose it is mind binding for being clever, unique, and hilarious. He also has raised sardonic prose to an art form. If he were any less a craftsman, a main character named Hiro Protagonist that at one point delivers pizza for Uncle Enzo's Cosa Nostra Pizzeria, would be moronic.Technology, a version of what today's society might look like one day, viruses that share traits whether attacking a human or a silicon life form, the origins of language based on Biblical text, it just never stops. He is an extraordinary artist who chooses to express his art through words. It is a unique ride if you have yet to take it, and one that you will never forget."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash: The idea of a virus being both biological and technological. Intriguing concept - but its explanation, rooted in Sumerian myth, comes off as if the author knows way too much about the subject and couldn't make it accessible to his audience (but read the novel's acknowledgments to find out the truth). For the most part, explanations involving the application of Sumerian myth to the novel's conflict take part in long, involved passages, which equate to Hiro Protagonist having long, involved conversations with a computer program. This literary set-up smacks of Stephenson researching Sumerian mythology, and rehashing conversations that he might have had with experts on the subject. It is rather clumsy: The reader will cruise along Stephenson's action-packed, cyberpunky adventure, then suddenly hit a chapter that explains why it is all happening. Kind of like the bad guy telling you his plan before he executes you: It's not subtle. An essay on the possibility of verbal viruses - condensed from explanations in the novel - would be an enjoyable read.On the other hand, Stephenson is at his best when he dabbles in cyberpunk pursuits rather than scholarly ones. The idea of 'franchulates', corporate ownership, and religious fanaticism tying together in the near-future is a common one (suggest reading Palahniuk's &quot;Survivor&quot;) but pizza delivery and courier service are envisioned especially well [Stephenson takes skateboarding to an entirely new level]. Snow Crash is full of puns, and bits of irony and wit, which shouldn't be overlooked.Although Hiro renders avatars with the greatest of ease in the Metaverse, Stephenson's main characters are a bit flimsy - on the whole, they give off the impression there was a labored attempt to make them three-dimensional. Or: Characters may be introduced once, serve a purpose, then simply fade away or are very conveniently disposed of. The characters are loosely tied together - or just ridiculously (read: the protagonist and his nemesis share a rather unlikely connection). Characters - especially secondary characters, which there are (in my opinion) far too many of them - also tend to come off as stereotypes: hero, nemesis, love interest, boss, fiesty girl, brooding sniper.The novel's structure is a bit disjointed and unbalanced. There are many loose ends. The first few chapters are unique; the ending is contrived.(Alternative title that involves harpooning - since Snow Crash seeks to tackle many varied subjects, including references to Moby Dick: Ahab's Wife.)"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I give the book 5 stars, as I love the style & the humour. What I give 1 star is the Kindle edition compared to the printed book. Did this book not exist as an electronic file prior to the Kindle version? I find that hard to belive, but nevertheless, Amazon must have thought so because the Kindle edition has very obviously been scanned & OCR'd from the printed page, and the OCR software they used must have come from the same year when Stephenson wrote the book longhand on paper, apparently.There are many, many OCR errors in the text, particularly misinterpretation of rn as m, which often makes non-words, or, worse, makes actual words which make no sense, or, even worse, makes actual words that change the meaning of a sentence and bring your reading to a grinding halt.Amazon; if you must OCR books to Kindle, spare a few hours to proof-read them. This is my first bad Kindle experience. Very amateur electronic publishing job."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is a great book, and I was excited about making it my first Kindle purchase for the iPhone/iPad app.What a disappointment!The layout is poor; lots of text that should appear different from the body text is badly presented, but the real killer is the number of typos - simply atrocious. Literally (or so it seems) there is an error on every page - missing punctuation but also basic spelling errors. The name of the main character, Hiro often appears as 'Hire' and so on. It reads like it was fed through a cheap OCR system and then not actually checked by anyone at the publishing house or Amazon (or whoever digitised it for Kindle).If I was Neal Stephenson, I'd be pretty angry about by work being presented this badly. The Kindle app is good, and Whispersync, enabling me to carry on reading from where I left off on one device, on another, is a really nice feature, but if the other titles on the Kindle store are like this, I won't be making any more purchases (and I'd like my money back for this one)."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Have your friends buy this book, then steal it and make them buy it again!Seriously. Stephenson is great at illuminating the world of the hacker. This book does so, but not the overly self-aware coolness associated with Cryptonomicon or Heavy Weather (by Bruce Sterling).It's fun, it's never serious - even when someone is trying to destroy the world - and it makes you turn the pages.I read a lot of science fiction, and am a rabid Gibson fan, and when I read this book, all I could say was 'cool'. The world, and the cyberworld. The arcane references to the Sumerians. Da5id. My personal favorite, Sushi K.And of course, Hiro Protagonist - freelance coder, swordmaster, information seller and pizza deliverydude.Remember, Americans do 4 things better than anyone else: music, movies, microcode and pizza delivery.And the position of baddest mother is taken.Piques your interest? You'll like Snow Crash. Think the attitude is childish? Pass this book up. Read Zodiac instead. Or Diamond Age."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I finally managed to finish Snow Crash. I have so many friends who love it that I forced myself to get through to the end. Normally I'd read a book this length over the weekend, but Snow Crash took me over a month. Every time I set it down, days and weeks would pass as I felt no particular urge to see what happens next.There were a lot of reasons I didn't like this book. Hopefully, other reluctant readers with similar taste can see this and save some time. This is in order of how much it bothered me, but any of these would be enough alone to make me dislike the book:1) The writing style was really distracting and irritating to me. It had that clunky, sloppy, slapstick style that I know other people find funny or creative. But I prefer writing that allows me to be fully engaged to the point I don't notice the words. If I do notice the words, I prefer a more graceful or intricate style. In truth, I think he's not a very good writer, but I recognize the strong possibility that I am wrong and this writing is just not at all my cup of tea.2) There were really really long chunks throughout the book where one character would muse about and slowly develop some random theory (thinly disguised as dialogue). The topics ranged from religion to ancient history and more. I would love to read an essay about them in a reputable journal with sources and citations. In a novel, I found it half-baked, irrelevant, and incredibly boring.3) For the most part I found the characters likable and interesting. But I wasn't really moved by them. I didn't particularly care what happened to them. Also, I was a little disturbed that the main 15-year-old girl character had so many odd relationships with men twice her age.There were some cool concepts too. I love the skateboard, and it's definitely interesting to see how the internet has developed compared to his descriptions. But without better writing and character development, cool concepts are not enough for a novel. (I often feel this way about scifi and think it's better suited to short stories.)"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I enjoyed the book, I won't go in depth about its plot as plenty of other people have already done that. I liked the story and thought it was a fun weekend read.The Kindle version has a ton of formatting errors that make me feel like my $10 wasn't well spent. There are typos galore as if it were scanned and quickly OCRed (words like \\"chaos\\" appear as \\"chacs\\"), and words that were hyphenated due to the end of a line in print remain hyphenated... in the middle of sen-tences. It's distracting and very annoying for a $10 product.At the end of the book it appears Snow Crash was created as an eBook in 2003. This Kindle store version is a quick cash grab and it would be nice if Amazon would convince the publisher to fix it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I must admit that Stephenson has a vivid imagination even if his general vision of the future seems to be consistently bleak in his novels about them. &quot;Snow Crash&quot; is another book in the tradition of &quot;The Diamond Age&quot; that imagines what the next era will be like. &quot;Diamond&quot; looks farther down the line, into the next century, while &quot;Show Crash&quot; looks at how things will be just decades from now. It sees a world in which the US has collapsed under its own weight, in which the Mafia controls pizza delivery, and the FBI has its own city-state. Electronic guard dogs patrol the Asian community and skating is now even more firmly rooted as its own sub-culture.The main character, the not-so-subtly named Hiro Protagonist, is a sword-wielding freelance programmer who stumbles upon a shadowy conspiracy by powers unknown that threatens hackers worldwide with a virus that seems to leave them in a vegetative state. He takes on the challenge of finding out who is behind it and how to stop them mostly through a series of accidents. He is joined by a plucky young skater who has drawn attention from the local Mafia king. Lurking in the shadows is a dangerous Eskimo who goes by the name of Raven and rides a motorcycle powered with a nuclear bomb in its frame.Like I said, Stephenson has an active imagination. His characters are colorful but not really that broadly drawn. We get a sense of what they are like from what they do, but we only get snippets of background information about them. It was hard to really root for the characters because I did not feel I really knew or identified with them. Still, I really enjoyed his descriptions of the strange places they travel to, including the Mafia and FBI states, and an aircraft character that houses its own nation of people from every culture.As far as the conspiracy goes, it was unclear to me what the motivations of the people behind it were supposed to be. The technical aspects were also pretty hard to follow; it gets heavy in the nature of languages and programming. Even as someone who has dabbled in programming languages I had trouble understanding it. Other than Raven, who as a villain is fleshed out pretty well and is the most interesting character, I got the sense that the threat was really a clothesline on which to hang Stephenson's world vision and weird characters. I felt unsatisfied when the conclusion rolled around, since it is so abrupt and had little to do with the nature of the people involved.Still, I had fun reading this book. It has a wild and strange vision of the future that may prove eirily accurate if things continue to move in the direction they are in. I liked the characters even if I didn't completely identify them. And the story is gripping even if you can't follow the plot. It is the mark of a good writer that he can bite off more than he can chew and yet make it palateable."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I'd read the book before as a paperback but thought I'd get the kindle version to reread it. It was a bit of a waste of money.It looks as though it was converted from the book using bad OCR software. The text keeps naming the main character (Hiro) as \\"Hire\\". Whenever an interstate road is abbreviated as, for example, I-405 this appears in the kindle text as 1-405. These are just the most frequent mistakes, there are many, many more. While it doesn't make the text unreadable it does lead to several double takes which really breaks the flow of reading the novel.All it would have taken would be for someone to proof read the text for five minutes and they would have spotted at least one of these errors."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"\\"Snow Crash\\" is neither dead serious, nor a comedy. If you want a darkly serious look at the future, read \\"Neuromancer.\\" If you want a realistic future populated by everyday people, read Jack McDevitt. If you want a creative, fun look at the future that takes speculation to the extreme, read \\"Snow Crash.\\"PLOT:\\"Snow Crash\\" has a lot of plot, and it's a confusing read for the first time. But the unique setting, great characters, and action-adventure might make you want to come back and read it again (and again, and again). After a couple of reads, the plot becomes clearer, and is quite clever.Just to help some readers get started though, I'll give a summary of the plot here:In the near-future, the U.S. has collapsed into anarchy and is now ruled by corporations. The Internet meanwhile has evolved into a virtual reality called the Metaverse. Trouble begins when someone starts to hand out a drug called \\"Snow Crash,\\" both as a street drug in real life, and as a computer virus in the Metaverse. \\"Snow Crash\\" takes over the user's mind, seemingly driving them insane and making them speak in Tongues. Since there is no government agency anymore to investigate this sort of thing, a hacker named Hiro Protagonist joins a group of other hackers and mobsters who are working to solve the mystery for themselves.SETTING:\\"Snow Crash\\" starts with the same \\"dystopian\\" future that many cyberpunk stories feature; the U.S. government has collapsed into anarchy, and corporations rule the people. But in \\"Snow Crash\\" this world is not entirely dark and evil; the characters regard the corporations that rule them the way that many Americans today view their government (distrustful, but not tyrannical). Stephenson applies humor to this corporate-ruled future, making for an outrageous setting: one corporation in power is the Italian Mafia, which controls all pizza delivery; skateboarders harpoon cars with giant magnets and ride behind, with no laws to stop them; and a new denomination of Christianity incorporates Elvis into its Trinity; just for a few examples.\\"Snow Crash\\" also employs the \\"virtual reality\\" clich&eacute; seen in cyberpunk, but again, with more humor and craziness. Rather than resembling the Matrix, the Metaverse is more like a virtual-reality version of the internet, populated by all of the weird figures that hackers and teenagers on the web would chose to represent themselves (Barbies, dragons, giant talking penises, etc.)WRITING STYLE:Stephenson's narration sounds more like a friend on the street telling you the story, rather than a typical author narrating a novel. Some readers complain that this makes it \\"poorly written.\\" But others find it more engaging than traditional forms of storytelling. It certainly makes for a more clever way of wording things. Many of the best lines--both serious and funny--come from the narration, rather than the dialogue.Narration style aside, Stephenson also writes dialogue very well. His characters speak realistically, using improper English and incomplete sentences like most of us in real life do.There are a ton of fast-paced action scenes, and they're cleverly written. The characters don't just run and shoot each other tiresomely (like in so many cyberpunk books). They skateboard under trucks, leap from helicopters, and have sword fights that are well \\"choreographed.\\"The only downside to Stephenson's writing is that the two or three dull moments in the book are torturously boring and much too long. But the excitement and humor in the rest of the book completely compensates for them.CHARACTERS:The characters are as fun as the most bad-ss action heroes, and as relatable as the every-day-men/women in sitcoms. They are not flat Hollywood stereotypes, but neither are they the bland \\"everyday\\" people that \\"realistic\\" authors like to use. Stephenson treats his characters with the same amount of seriousness, humor, and outrageous action as the rest of his story.The protagonist, aptly named Hiro Protagonist, is much better written than most leading characters, especially in cyberpunk. Stephenson does not try make Hiro an \\"average\\" person, like most authors would. Hiro is just as distinctive in his personality, flaws, back-story, and ethnicity as any normal secondary character might be. Even more impressive, Hiro is the hero by his own choice; no prophecy makes him the \\"chosen one,\\" and no corporate fairy-god-father suddenly shows up to hire him for an adventurous job (as in most cyberpunk stories). Instead, Hiro sees a problem, and decides for himself to investigate and save the day.The other characters stand out from others of their types, in the same way. Hiro's sidekick Y.T., a thrill seeking female skateboarder, is as sarcastic and feisty as most action- heroines--but her personality is more realistic; she's not a dress-hating tomboy stereotype, nor a valley-girl. Hiro's love interest, Juanita, is an average-looking woman who wears no make-up, attracting him with her brains and wit. And the villain, Raven, is active and fearful in his own right, doing his own dirty work, rather than sitting back and letting a hoard of minions do it for him.OVERALL:\\"Snow Crash\\" offers something that's easy to find in films, but difficult to find in books; a serious story with ideas that make you think, and exciting escapism."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I've been on a cyberpunk kick lately, and a friend recommended Snow Crash as a foundation of the genre so I've been meaning to check it out.There are a zillion summaries posted, so I'll get right to my thoughts. I found this novel to be the type where I deliberately slow down my reading so I can process more- I like that, but if you're looking for something light and simple- this isn't it. This book was thought provoking despite being published well over a decade ago. Stephenson's predictions of the internet, or \\"metaverse\\" and the connection between viruses and thought/language have kept me busy daydreaming.Despite how thought provoking the book was, there were a TON of action scenes- too many for me, but that's not my thing. If it's yours- you will love this book.NOTE ON THE KINDLE EDITION- several previous reviews mentioned editing issues in the Kindle Edition, namely Hiro's name being consistently misspelled as Hire- I almost didn't get the book because of these issues, but finally decided it was worth it for the convenience, when I found the misspellings and other issues has apparently been corrected. So if the negative Kindle reviews were holding you back don't miss out on a great example of cyberpunk!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"\\"Snow Crash\\", published in 1991, has never ceased to be listed among geekdom's most mandatory reads, and it may well be remembered as the greatest science fiction novel of the 90's when all is said and done. The powers that be have classified it as cyberpunk, and indeed it shares the common characteristics of that forlorn subgenre: focus on computer technologies and virtual reality, decaying social structure, and fast pacing. The success of Stephenson's book rests on three characteristics that keep it widely seperated from pervious cyberpunk efforts.1. It's comprehensible; normal people can understand it. Stephenson largely eschews stream-of-consciousness, computer speak, and excessively complicated prose. You can read the book and grasp it in one try, without needing Cliff's Notes or a friendly Ph.D. in modern lit. The storyline is clear, and when Stephenson does bring in high-tech jargon and references, he explains them in layperson's terms.2. Humor. This book is funny, though I'll have to acknowledge that Stephenson's sense of humor probably isn't for everybody. He tosses in witty banter and colorful narration, as when music is described as having the falvor of \\"butter mixed with broken glass\\". Mostly, however, he uses situational humor derived from his head-busting vision of the future. Which brings us to:3. Stephenson's unsubtle critique of American society. This one hasn't been mentioned by the critics much, but it's unquestionably there, at the heart of \\"Snow Crash\\". He sees a world where government agencies disintegrates or change to meet the needs of the time (The Library of Congress and the CIA merge to form the ultimate intelligence service), America fractures into \\"burbclaves\\" and other small social units, and individuals are left at the mercy of private police and the Mafia, who now deliver pizza. What makes \\"Snow Crash\\" stand out is how Stephenson ties this future directly to the attitudes of the present, as when angry customers somehow believe that they not only have a god-given right to a pizza in thirty minutes, but also to abuse the \\"deliverator\\".All in all, it's a good read, a thought-provoking trip to a future that's at least fifty percent present."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I must confess that this book was giving me some hard moments to digest. Although English is not my native tongue, I needed to concentrate pretty hard to understand some of the things in the book.I still have trouble I guess with the Sumer mythology parts, but overall I found the book a very enjoyable read. Whoever is interested in modern cyberpunk science fiction should read it.First of all because it is very picturesque and always have surpises until the end.Generically I expected the science fiction ideas to be introduced first and then used throughout the book, describing this new world, but Stephenson always kept on adding some extra ingredients as the story unfolded. Every page is crammed with thoughts to digest, it is not a book you can read during a weekend.The book was compared to Neuromancer (William Gibson), but I liked this one much better because of its fresh ideas about the society (franchises - e.g. Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong), technology (e.g - the Rat Thing) and perfect villain (Raven).Now I look forward to read some of his other books too.Go ahead and boggle your mind a bit with Snow Crash, it is great fun!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash is the first example of positive cyberpunk I have seen, Hiro &amp; YT are both (for a change) the best at what they do. A sk8er and a swordsman, this is how we all wanted our shadow run charecters to be. the book is a non-stop trip told in the hardcore techno-jive we all want to speak. People have a problem with the boring middle section about linguistics but this is one of the most educational plotlines I have ever read. Anyone who thinks it's all rubbish should consider the effect porn stories have on the body. Words can affect you without real meaning.

This is the first time cyberpunk has been the triumphant cheer it should always've been. Check it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash captures your imagination right from the opening lines. The first part of the novel is wildly imaginative, funny, edgy, and highly entertaining. In the opening pages Stephenson introduces us to our hero protagonist (aptly named Hiro Protagonist) a sword wielding, computer hacking, pizza-delivery driver. We soon learn that the Mafia is in the business of selling pizza, that Kouriers get around by \`pooning cars from their planks', that people can \`jack into the Metaverse', and that California is home to numerous City-states called Burbclaves. There are no laws and corporations run everything.Unfortunately, after a great opening, the novel quickly loses its edge. The irreverent tone of the early chapters gives way to an unnecessarily detailed exploration of linguistic theory and Sumerian legends. Stories from the Old Testament are linked to Sumerian myths and then connected to computer viruses. These links involve some serious stretches in thinking and some pretty thin theorizing as selective information is used to tie the evolution of human language and religion to a deadly metavirus. It all becomes an overly complicated, unconvincing mess and momentum killer.While the early chapters brim with wildly preposterous ideas that have just enough truth to them to constitute great satire, the \`Sumerian myth/linguistic theory/metavirus idea' is tedious and bogs the narrative down. The novel picks up speed again near the end and there is a bright spot late in the novel when a character who works for the Federal government is required to read (in 15.62 minutes) a multipage memo on \`intra-office toilet-paper policies', but by then I'd pretty much lost interest. I did enjoy this hilarious skewering of Government Bureaucracy but it wasn't enough to re-engage me in the story.For me, a promising start gave way to uneven pacing and an unconvincing and largely uninteresting premise. Despite my enthusiastic reaction to the first part of the novel and that bright bit of satire near the end, I can only give this novel three stars."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Here is a very fun and creative, though sometimes tedious, novel from the early crazy days of cyberpunk. More fun to read and easier to identify with than the more eggheaded William Gibson, though at this point Stephenson needed some practice keeping his wild ideas from collapsing under their own weight. In this bizarre near-future (or alternate present) computer viruses are traded like drugs and hackers create real physical havoc online. This is an occasionally wild and fastpaced romp through the crazier realms of the cyberbunk genre, though things get bogged down badly in Stephenson's quite bizarre philosophical theories. He attempts a connection between binary programming code and the genetic human understanding of language, by way of ancient Sumerian mythology (yes you read that correctly). There are clear signs that Stephenson was wrapped up in the rickety new-age craze about \\"mind viruses\\" that was popular around the time this book was written.Characters who are usually swashbuckling cyberpunks or gun-toting mafia goons drop what they're doing in reality and sit forever in what are basically chat rooms, spending dozens of pages discussing deep theology and ancient philosophy while their real life selves are engaged in wild action scenes at the same time. This really drags down large chunks of the book into a longwinded mess, with theories that aren't wrapped up by the end. However, one very cool aspect of this book is Stephenson's vision of a dysfunctional future in which corporations run all aspects of society for profit, with no social safety net from the government. It seems kind of farfetched in the book but may be a very chilling vision of the future. This is an engaging book but is two or three steps away from greatness."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is a review of the abridge audiobook version:1) The reader of the book did a very good job of having different voices and attitudes for the differen cast of characters.

The characters are well-developed and like-able. His view of the future is sufficiently dark and yet somewhat plausible. However, his endlessly smug tone and his self-indulgent sense of humor slow the storyline of the book to a veritable crawl.This book has tones of Umberto Eco's _Foucault's Pendulum_, Gibson's _Neuromancer_, and even some Elmore Leonard in it. The effect would be spectacular if Stephenson was a strong enough author to pull it off. Sadly, he isn't. I will keep my eye on his later books and perhaps future titles... but probably borrow them next time rather than buy."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This book is incredible! It reads with a very fast pace, and never really gets boring or slow at any point. Neal Stephenson has definitely done his research, as the information on Sumerian myth is incredibly detailed and rich. The book has a lot of action and it's also a great satire of what today's culture may become in the future. I loved this book!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"it is rare to find books that are as all encompassing as snow crash. i read this book for a sci fi class during college, and i was enthralled. stephenson portrayed a future corporate america - digital, territorial, with super pizza delivery boys. combined with a tantalizingly cyber take on ancient near eastern mythology, this book credits 'hackers' from 4000 years ago.possibly the best scifi book i have ever read."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:G,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],M={key:0},S={key:1};function B(s,e,n,u,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",D,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",S,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",M,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const C=c(P,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-9afa21fd"]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/39.md","filePath":"drive/39.md"}'),q={name:"drive/39.md"},R=Object.assign(q,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(C)]))}});export{W as __pageData,R as default};
