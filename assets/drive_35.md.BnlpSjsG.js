Martin Foreman skillfully develops two very unique and distinctive voices, detailing the day to day lives of the main characters. It is his eye for the little touches that really makes this book work. This is not an action adventure story, as one might presume of a kidnapping story, but an in-depth analysis of the traumas and mundanities of the time spent waiting for the release of a hostage.... With it comes a layman&#8217;s understanding of world sociology. A worthy read."},{"Title":"The Butterfly's Wing","review":"First published in 1996, The Butterfly's Wing is an affecting and engaging novel about a relationship between two men, and what happens when an act of terrorism forces them apart. Andy, an officer in a world aid organization, is kidnapped and held hostage in Peru, leaving Tom alone in England, not knowing what is happening to his lover or if he will ever see him again.The power of this story lies in the two voices that are telling it. Tom, who has been alone on their jointly-owned English smallholding for over a year now, tries to relieve his pain by starting a journal, in the form of a long letter to Andy. This device is wisely chosen by the author, for Tom, who has had a hardscrabble life moving from one waitering job to another, lives an existence that is centered on Andy, and the second-person narrative powerfully conveys his need.Elsewhere in the world, in a miserable cell where he doesn't even have enough food or blankets, Andy at least has pen and paper, so he's writing as well. He's a well educated man and his journal takes a more conventional form, though there is raw emotion there too. All of this means that reading this book is no walk in the park. And yet, if that's a downside to the book, it's also part of the upside. There is nothing inauthentic in these pages. Martin Foreman has done important work in HIV in the developing world, and his grasp of world politics and economics convincingly informs Andy's writing and his arguments with his captors. Just as tellingly, every detail of Tom's life on a struggling farm seems real. To an important degree, this book and these lives have been lived by the author.Tom and Andy also reflect on their lives as gay men. When Tom came out he was disowned by his family, while Andy met with only grudging acceptance from his parents. The two men are, in their own ways, amazed by the love they have found for each other. But there is nothing private in their world, and when the media \\"break\\" the news that Andy is gay and has a lover waiting for him at home, the new angle to their story has the potential to harm them both. Will Tom's sexuality gain him ill favor among those who would otherwise help him? Will Andy's captors kill or torture him because he is gay?The well-read Andy is familiar with the work of Joseph Conrad and Graham Greene, and invokes those names in his journal. I would add Malcolm Lowry to the short list of fiction writers who have painstakingly explored the intersection of the political and the personal, seeking out those profound moments when something as slight as the stir of a butterfly's wing changes lives on the opposite side of the world. Oh, and add Martin Foreman's name, too: he has earned it."},{"Title":"Elementary differential topology;: Lectures given at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, fall, 1961 (Annals of mathematics studies)","review":"Munkres' \\"Elementary Differential Topology\\" was intended as a supplement to Milnor'sDifferential topologynotes (which were similar to hisTopology from the Differentiable Viewpointbut at a higher level), so it doesn't cover most of the material that standard introductory differential topology books do. Rather, the author's purpose was to (1) give the student a feel for the techniques of differential topology and practice in using them, and (2) prove a couple of basic and important results that at the time (1961) had not appeared in book form. Thus this book could not serve as a textbook for a course in the subject, but could be useful perhaps as a workbook for a student who wanted to practice solving problems. The word \\"elementary\\" in the title merely indicates that no algebraic topology is used in the proofs (with one minor exception, to show that a disk cannot be mapped homeomorphically onto an annulus) - its use was not intended as an indication of the level of the book, although it is pretty elementary anyway.That this is not suitable as a text for learning differential topology is apparent from what material has been omitted: Sard's theorem, Whitney's imbedding theorem, Morse theory, transversality (except for a brief mention in the last couple of pages), the degree of a map, intersection theory, differential forms, vector bundles (except for the tangent and normal bundles), etc., to say nothing of more advanced topics such as cobordism or surgery.So what is covered? Aside from basic definitions of C^r manifolds (i.e., manifolds with charts that have transition functions that are r times continuously differentiable), submanifolds, immersions, diffeomorphisms, bump functions, partitions of unity, and the inverse and implicit function theorems (proved only for Euclidean spaces), the results are divided into 2 sets: Those having to do with approximating a map with certain features by other maps (generally, showing that the set of maps with certain properties, such as imbeddings, immersions, diffeomorphisms, etc., is open in a certain function space). From this follows the well-known result that all C^r (r>=1) manifolds are smooth, the highlight of the first 2/3 of the book. Along the way, a few results are demonstrated that are needed in the proof, such as the existence of tubular neighborhoods and an imbedding theorem that is much weaker than Whitney's, but not much time is spent on them. This part ends with a proof of the uniqueness of the double of a manifold. Virtually all of these results can be found in Hirsch'sDifferential Topologyin the first 2 chapters, proved much simpler and with modern notation. However, by keeping his presentation more geometric and with a minimum of formalism, it may be easier to follow Munkres' proofs (not that Hirsch is hard). As an example, Munkres uses for the topology of his function spaces the strong C^1 topology, rather than the compact-open topology that Hirsch uses.The second part of the book, the final 40 pages or so, is devoted to proving that smooth manifolds are actually PL manifolds, and that the triangulation of a smooth manifold with a given smooth structure is essentially unique (a kind of smooth Hauptvermutung - this is not true for PL manifolds in general). This classic result is not usually included in differential topology (or PL topology) books - in fact, I can't think of another book which does contain this proof, making this the best (only?) reason to own this book. The proof itself is not that interesting, consisting of the standard manipulations of simplices that one usually sees in PL topology or older homology theory.There are many \\"exercises\\" through the book, which generally ask the reader to fill in the details of proofs or extend the results of them. These tend to be pretty easy, whereas the many \\"problems\\" are harder. For these, hints are often given, so they usually aren't that difficult either (although one problem is labeled as \\"unsolved\\"). Aside from the proof that smooth => PL, the only other benefit of reading this book is to practice doing these exercises. But overall, this is far inferior to the aforementioned works of Milnor, Hirsch, Wallace (Differential Topology: First Steps), or Guillemin and Pollack (Differential Topology)."},{"Title":"Golden Boy: Memories of a Hong Kong Childhood","review":"I'd never heard of English author Martin Booth before. He wrote this personal memoir, recounting 3 years of his childhood in Hong Kong in the early 1950s, just before he recently died of brain cancer. He dedicated the book to his own children, as a way to pass on the story of his life to them. It reads like a novel - one incredible adventure after the next of a boy of 7 let loose on the streets of Hong Kong in the wild years after WWII. It also details the breakdown of the marriage of his mother and father. This is a real treasure trove, a look at the world through the new eyes of a child, but guided by the wise older hand of an older author. I feel like I have traveled and lived in Hong Kong - the sites, sounds, smells - the culture, food, weather, animals, people - all brilliantly alive and real. I also have a better sense of the Chinese and what it means to be Chinese, and a desire to learn more. I only wish Martin had a memoir of his entire life!"},{"Title":"Golden Boy: Memories of a Hong Kong Childhood","review":"I've always been fascinated by Martin Booth's writings about Hong Kong, in particular, his book on triads, which was an inside (and somewhat lurid) look at the Chinese underworld.By contrast, \\"Golden Boy\\" is his memoir: first published shortly after his death (originally under the title \\"Gweilo\\"-- once a term used to describe foreigners--with some derision--in southern China). As a young, golden-haired boy amid the bustling Hong Kong of the 1950s, Booth shows how his relationship with friends, neighbors, and even perfect strangers gives the word a whole new meaning as a term of endearment. His memoir of living in Hong Kong is an extremely powerful and rare work. If you have ever lived in Hong Kong, no matter what era, you will be moved by Booth's book and will nod in fond remembrance as Booth perfectly captures the sights, smells, and colors of Hong Kong. I found Booth's mother to be one of the most sympathetic and likeable of people, while Booth's father I wish I could just give a swift kick right in the arse. I don't want to give too much of the book away, but suffice it to say that if you have spent any length of time in Hong Kong, you will realize exactly how the city and its people can capture your imagination forever."},{"Title":"Golden Boy: Memories of a Hong Kong Childhood","review":"Running free among the tiny, crowded markets, opium dens and shantytowns of 1952 Hong Kong, British writer Martin Booth had the sort of idyllic, adventurous childhood that is scarcely conceivable now. At age 8 Booth roamed the streets almost at will, confined only by school hours and his mother's direct prohibitions, which were few and usually circumvented at the first opportunity.Booth's father, Ken, was posted to Hong Kong as a mid-level functionary in the provisioning of the British army. While young Booth and his mother, Joyce, were drawn to the culture and beauty of the place immediately, Ken remained resolutely standoffish, the epitome of the clich&eacute;d British colonial.Booth began this book near the end of his life at the request of his children, after being diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor. Though there's undoubtedly a certain amount of nostalgia in these vivid memories, it's not all dazzle and wonder. In a place so teeming with refugees, there are many stories of cruelty and tragedy. Several fires engulf the squatter shantytowns of impoverished Mainland Chinese who had already lost everything in their flight from the communists. And, more personally, Booth's parents seldom exchange a civil word.His father comes across as a humorless, small-minded bigot, a man who detests England, but encases himself in his British identity, despising all that's foreign. His mother, who had lost her father young and known much sadness and privation, blossoms in Hong Kong. She learns Cantonese, cultivates Chinese friends from all walks of life, and takes Martin all over the island to Chinese festivals and Russian bakeries and old colonial hotels for tea.But Martin's real education is all on his own. On their first day in Hong Kong, a friendly officer introduces him to shrimp and gives him some advice: \\"As long as you are in Hong Kong, whenever someone offers you something to eat, accept it.\\" A naturally adventurous boy, Martin has recourse to this advice numerous times. Once a boy in the hotel, after teaching him how to fly beetles on a string, offers him a boiled one to eat: \\"It tasted slightly muddy, yet the overriding flavour was like the smell of stagnant freshwater ponds mixed with smoked fish.\\"His willingness to eat anything and go anywhere makes him many friends among the street stalls in the city. His age and instinctive respect for other cultures allows him entry to places where foreign adults cannot go, while his blond hair, seen as a bringer of luck, makes him a welcome attraction.During the three years of his father's posting, the family lived in several different areas and Martin explored every nook and cranny, on foot at first, then by tram as well. When the Booths moved to their first flat, his mother warned him against Kowloon's nearby Walled City, a place of the criminal Triads, opium dens and prostitution, though he was not to know that until later.Naturally he makes a beeline for the place at his first opportunity and is soon befriended by a young Triad member who takes him to places his mother would blanch to discover, including a weapon filled meeting place. He keeps many such secrets from his mother - like the whereabouts of the crazy homeless Russian lady with the uncut diamonds - though he senses his mother's approval of his avid curiosity.Booth beautifully recaptures the child's sense of newness, whether it's his first magical excursion on the streets at night or the revelatory moment when the silent waiter in a tea shop filled with birds and old men turns out not to be rude or disapproving, but a soldier who lost his tongue to the Japanese.Whatever the wonder and joy of his childhood explorations hilarity and wonder seldom exist without tragedy or at least cruelty. Remnants of the war abound, from the stories of soldiers and former prisoners, to ruined buildings and the skeletons of Japanese soldiers killed in revenge. His parents' acrimony pervades the most enchanting memories, like splashing in the phosphorescent sea with his mother while his father stands on the shore hectoring them to go.By the end of his father's posting, Joyce is wild to stay in Hong Kong. \\" \`I don't want to go back,' \\" my mother said emphatically, breaking our silence. \`England is dreary, colourless, down-in-the-mouth. Lifeless. Just look at this.' She turned and faced distant Lan Tau, the rays of the setting son fingering between the mountains. \`How can I live in Rumford or Woking or Basingstoke after this?' \\"Though the memoir ends with them leaving for England, the Booths do come back and Martin completes his growing-up in this magical place, an experience which infused his writing - eight non-fiction books, including \\"Opium: A History,\\" 11 novels, and five books of children's fiction. Readers of this enchanting memoir will certainly seek out this Booker short-listed writer's (\\"The Industry of Souls\\") other work.-- The Portsmouth Herald"},{"Title":"Golden Boy: Memories of a Hong Kong Childhood","review":"Although I've been living in the States for years now, I am a Hong Kong \\"local\\" who grew up not too far away from the Fourseas Hotel where young Booth began his adventures in Hong Kong.

Booth's description of Hong Kong is so vivid and lively that I felt I was right there with him roaming all over Kowloon and the Peak. The way Booth intertwined the story with his adventures in Hong Kong and his parents strained marriage makes the book a very interesting read. I can feel Booth's love for Hong Kong throughout his writing, and as a local, I'm proud to know that a Gweilo loves my hometown as much as I do.For the curious folks out there, I checked with my Dad, who informed me that the Fourseas Hotel was remodeled into a bowling alley, and then got torn down and rebuilt as another hotel which is still in operation nowadays, called The Metropole. \\"Coronation Road\\" mentioned in the book has been renamed \\"Nathan Road\\", the hill behind Fourseas with the refugee squatters is present-day residential area \\"Ho Man Tin\\", dai-pai-dongs are still gourmet of street food, and no, people don't eat dogs anymore (I believe it's illegal), but yes, snake is still a wintertime favourite!I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Golden Boy: Memories of a Hong Kong Childhood","review":"Martin Booth, as a youngster from England, resides in 1950s Hong Kong with his father, a plodding minor civil servant, and mother, Joyce.

Martin Booth felt safe among unusual friends during his adventures, because Chinese people believed rubbing his golden hair brought them luck.Booth's superb prose pictures brothels, opium dens, Chinese drug-lord friends, forbidden temples and also the wild life and flora in both Kowloon and Hong Kong. Often lonely, Martin's independence was encouraged by correspondence and gifts from his grandfather in England. He never told his parents the extent of his explorations into forbidden and dangerous areas.The boy also endured the hostilities between his bigoted, bureaucrat father, a man who never quite succeeded, and his out-going mother who was fascinated by Chinese culture.The author calls himself a \\"curious, somewhat devious, adventurous and street-wise child whose heart never left Hong Kong\\" after his father's job sent them back to England four years later.Anyone who likes biography, history, adventure, Chinese culture and beautifully written literature will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Golden Boy: Memories of a Hong Kong Childhood","review":"Martin Booth had an amazing memory for the details of post-WWII Hong Kong and the times he had there as a seven to ten year-old boy. His civilian father gets transferred by the British to the far-flung colonial outpost. While his father is more of a spoilsport, his mother tries live life to the utmost--wherever that life may be--and she allows Martin the freedom to do the same. He takes her fully up on that offer, befriending hotel staff, local storekeepers and more and tasting practically every Chinese dish and joining in every local festival with eyes wide open. However, there are actually very few stories of his escapades with fellow children, mostly stories with the adults that surround him and the nature and culture of Hong Kong.Hong Kong is ruthless with its built history, so a book like this is the only way to get to know the Hong Kong that existed only fifty years ago. It includes one of the few descriptions of a westerner in the \`Kowloon walled city.' And from an eight year-old boy too!I am grateful that Mr. Booth was able to finish this book before he died. I wish he had lived a few more years for selfish reasons--so that he could have finished a book on his second time around in Hong Kong. I am sure he had just as many adventures as a teen as he did as a young boy.Richard Mason's \`World of Suzie Wong' takes place at approximately the same time and is a great and recommended look at a decidedly different part of Hong Kong. So it was neat when Booth's world and Wong's world intersected (innocently) in a few of Golden Boy's pages.

At that age you have not had time to become so set in your ways that when a whole new life beckons you can jump in to the fullest. Learning a new language, even Chinese, just happens like you learned your first language. And when your memories are fond, you can report on the characters you met with kindness and humor.One way to make yourself popular is to have blonde hair, a sign of good luck among the Chinese and certainly a color that would stand out in Hong Kong. But more than that is to have an attitude of openness and willingness to try the different. Oh yes, it also helps to have parents that, although they fight a lot, allow you to go out into the world.The story, like most stories, mainly involves people.

If you're interested in Brazil, this is the book you want. Thank you Joeseph Page for this fantastic novel that could easily qualify as a sociological journal. This is without a doubt my favorite book in years."},{"Title":"The Brazilians","review":"Being a Brazilian myself, reading this book was like revisiting a very well known place, with the help of a different and outstanding &quot;tourist guide&quot;. I could see my country, its history, its past and its present through highly qualified and sensitive eyes. Page's book is a brilliant analysis for a complex society. He gets exactly what is it that makes us Brazilians: diversity, multiplicity of influences, variety, lack of clear limits, lack of clear boundaries. I think Brazil is unpredictable, difficult to catch, even for people that have lived there all their lives. Page got the main traits, the most important aspects of Brazilian personality, the features that really make us Brazilians. Of course, one does not agree with everything that is written in the book. And, as a Brazilian, it is not easy to read the chapter about \\"the culture of brutality\\", for example. Also the author has some kind of \\"bias\\", probably related to the places where he lived in Brazil, towards Rio or Pernambuco (I am from Bahia, I can't help complaining...! If you read the book, you'll understand). But when my friends from other countries - usually curious and amazed about what they hear and see on the news - ask me what Brazil is, I have no doubts about where to send them to find an answer..."},{"Title":"The Brazilians","review":"From the outset this author warned us that the image of Brazil as a frolicking, fun-loving paradise among the most beautiful of South American coasts would be misleading. This proved to be true in more ways than one. As he suggested, Brazil can be both \\"a lot more\\" and at the same time \\"a lot less\\" than meets the eye; for the reality of Brazilian life is a much more complex kaleidoscope of cultures, religions, smells, tastes, arts, politics and a whole new spectrum of other sensibilities and sensitivities that can assault -- even astonish the imagination. As but one such example of many surprises he gives in the book: Even the most beautiful woman in Brazil (literally the metaphorical Girl from Ipanema), until a sex change operation, was a man.Yet, throughout the 90s Brazil looked very much like it was rapidly unraveling, becoming an economic basket case, literally a \\"failed State.\\" Its economy was in shambles, it was leading the world in crime, deforestation, and with death squads roaming the cities in an undeclared war on gangs of homeless street kids, it left a disturbing image in the international mind and was unsafe even for Brazilians. Plus, as the rain forests were being systematically dismantled, Brazil was losing prestige in the UN community even as it was losing its mojo on the soccer field: It was knocked out of the World men's Soccer tournament four times during the last decade. When Brazil lost the championship 3-0 to France in the 1998 finals, the coach said it was a good day to die. In short, the tropical Eden that still hosts \\"La Carnival,\\" had begun to lose its luster and frightened off tourists in droves. Even Brazilians themselves had begun to leave the country. A million had left the country by the end of the decade, 330, 000 of which have settled in the U.S.But these dismal facts are not even half the story. They must be balanced against all the good things that have happened since and all the richness that remains Brazil's complex multiethnic cultural history. A decade or so later, Brazil with all its problems has risen like a phoenix, the bird of Egyptian mythology, from its own ashes to become a regional and international economic superpower. And along with its other budding Non-aligned regional superpowers, India and China, Brazil has begun \\"strutting its economic stuff\\" and is flexing its newly found political clout in the UN and on the international scene; and as a result, Brazil has begun to gain renewed respect as a nation, respect that a decade ago it never would have dreamed of. This book is a conversation about how this amazing turn around came about and what it foretells both for Brazil's future and for that of the world.The book is all the more impressive that even though it is now a decade old and is non-academic, it still remains an essential cultural and historical guide. It is structured like a conversation among friends, and told brilliantly by a \\"Brazilianist\\" - although the author claims not to be one. However he wants to represents himself, his love for Brazil comes through clearly and leaves a profound impression on the reader. I was especially impressed with the way he covered sections on the \\"Haves\\" and \\"Have nots.\\" Even though he minimized the fact that the major difference between them involved the issue of race as much as it involved class, his sketch is nevertheless telling. [I have read enough about Brazil to know that speaking openly about race is as much a \\"no-no\\" in Brazil as it is in the U.S.]The cause of the destitution of Brazil's poor is the same as is the case in the U.S. There too it is firmly rooted in the institution of slavery. Concentrations of large plantations (of coffee and cotton) fueled the need for cheap labor, which was supplied by slaves imported from Africa. This led to a two-tiered society based on an ethos of white exploitation of blacks and devolved into a rigid set of distinctions between master and slave as well as between rich and poor. And as was the case in the U.S. after the Civil War and emancipation, abolition of slavery in Brazil brought only nominal changes. The structures and mindsets remained the same. For all intents and purposes, after slavery Brazil became a semi-feudal society based on debt peonage (which we called \\"sharecropping in the U.S.). It is a system that even today has barely evolved beyond what the U.S. was in the 1930s. The essential societal framework of a slaveocracy remains intact 120 years after slavery was abolished.Add to this the fact that large exclusively white landowners were, due to the colonial policies coming from Lisbon, little more than petite monarchs, and later colluded among themselves and with the military, becoming an even more corrupt and oppressive force than they had been during slavery, and it is easy to see that what exists just beneath the surface in Brazil today are just the remnants of a fascistic Racialtocracy -- the same as in the U.S. The only difference is that in Brazil they call it \\"A Racial Democracy.\\" In the U.S. we call it \\"racial equality?\\" Five Stars"},{"Title":"The Brazilians","review":"The Brazilians by Joseph A. Page Addison-Wesley, 540 pages, $27.50 1995reviewed by D. D. Dunkerson 1000 words.Mr. Page, a professor of law, in his first chapter introduces the reader to Brazil and Brazilians as derived from his sixteen visits to the country over thirty years. He has also authored books on NE Brazil, a Nader Report, and Peron. He informs the reader that his themes are selective and not comprehensive; but one cannot be selective in the general attributes he places within his \\"Brazilianness\\".His \\"Brazilianness\\" encompasses qualities of graciousness, great anticipation of greatness, pleasantness, hospitality, politeness, tenderness, and delicacy. Without native words for \\"understatement\\", Mr. Page then adds grandiose, sweetness, energetic, sensual, extraordinary adaptability, carefree, mawkish, intense personalism, and current attainments rather than the two in the bush. As for quantities of Brazil derived from such qualities, they are most impresssive: 5th largest country, more Brazilians than all but five nationalities, 153 million people, largest Roman Catholic population, 50% of the population under 20 years old, largest black population outside Africa, and more Japanese except for Japan itself. In a land where the world's largest concentration of wealth is located, there is an abundance of ores, sugar, soybean, and corn for a populace of 66% poor, 71% without running water, 79% without refrigeration, 85% without sewage disposal, 50% without schooling.Brazil has for so long a time been characterized by the SE sliver of coast - by Rio and Sao Paulo. The interior, a vast place, has been mostly rural and very poor, even by Brazil's standards. Climatic conditions, overpopulation, and pharaonic governmental projects can force the rural poor outward to the periphery of Brazil in the NE and SE. Their pressure against a tiny slice of coast where cariocin Carnival in mild form prevails at all times vs. the paulistian hardworking heavily industrialized dynamo has promoted an urban criminality of poor vs. rich.The poor press hard enough that a low value for life prevails, a more subtle than USA's racism is accentuated and some of those pressured undertake measures, with impunity, to relieve the tangible and almost suffocating hindrance of daily activity. They resort to magical religions. They melt in a pot in which no single taste sums the ingredients. Some finally use surrealism, however primitive, for rebuttal to such a bewildering morphism.After his introduction, Mr. Page devotes most of the remainder of the book to chapters concerning a broad survey of Brazilian factors with profiles of prominent personages.The Portuguese -- disparaged, but having had Family as a definition of social, economic and personal relations that arose amidst a monarchy and an empire in Brazil that had a distaste for organization.The Africans -- In Brazil it is neither black nor white as all the intermediate shades are accepted in an ongoing process of miscegenation which is to \\"whiten\\" the people. Brazilians brought in six times the number of slaves as did the USA and Brazil did not end slavery until 1888. In 1891 the slavery archives were burned. People of \\"color\\" are in the majority. In the cities blacks are 80% of the population, but government is 90% non-black.The Have Nots -- There are places like Sao Conrado having a glass cylinder as a hotel, with an apartment building deluxe, tennis courts, swimming pools, golf course, glistening beach, sanitation, health care, and education. Going up the hills above Sao Conrado is Rocinha, a favela of 300,000 people, like many others to which the poor have flowed from worse conditions in the countryside. Many of these poor are perhaps destined to become a dehumanized subspecies. They travel in the favela on foot through animal stench, sewage flow, no police, no fire department, and a too expensive private medical care. They need public health care in a matrix of understaffing, poor maintenance and malfunctioning equipment. They take hours to get to a job not paying a living wage. They ride overcrowded,undependable and unsafe trains or buses. The worst conditions are in the NE which contains the largest concentration of wretchness (rural or urban) in the Western Hemisphere. Children who \\"want to die\\" are allowed to do so.The Culture of Brutality -- The national, state, and local military or police have used terror, torture, and repressive means against the governed. The have-nots use force against all (themselves included). This vast cycle of violence is as the animal whose head feeds itself by devouring its own tail. Brutality becomes routine, ordinary.Suffer the Little Children -- Murder, or street kids, who can be violent themselves, is conducted by death squads. The lawless children enjoy an impunity matched only by some Brazilian elite but the children number 32 million in poveruy and the elite aren't being hunted down. The kids want to run away to what they see on TV. They know \\"nobody is born stealing.\\"Where is Brazil? The author notes that Sao Paulo does not have a \\"there\\" there, no localizing locality. In this city is the most powerful commercial and financial center in the Western hemisphere outside the USA. If not in Sao Paulo, then perhaps in \\"Amazonia\\" -- 40% of the country and a gossamer cover for an Amazon Basin becoming debased far too rapidly? Or in Rio where one's appearance is the ne plus ultra living?There has to be a \\"where\\" for the \\"there\\" and where are the Brazilians? Look to the soccer fields where there is sustained a degree of involvement that not even Carnival can match. Look to Carnival where there is an astonishing dedication, diligence, imagination, and enthusiasm. Look to the telenovelas where there one finds viewer ratings approach 100% for television productions akin to soap operas but only more so and not so.Look to a national circus where there is no center ring. One doesn't find capitalism there ( Catherine Deneuve is quoted as asserting that the Brazilians are too carefree) but foreign investments are increasing as exports boom and inflation eases. Despachantes act as guides through bureaucratic mazes; and there is jeitinho -- a rapidly improvised creative cultural response to potentially confrontational situations.Lastly look to the heart, Brazil has been mentioned as the heart of the planet. Look among these people named for where their \\"there\\" is located -- the paulistas, cariocas, mineiros, nordestinos, gauchos, and curitibanos. There you will find hardworking, funloving, frugal, introverted, and fiercely independent individuals. But a Brazilian \\"individual\\" isn't an American one. The author quotes Roberto da Matta, and I paraphrase, to the effect that there is a Brazilian destiny and the freedon within it to practice loyalty to friends, anything for family and, most of all, to be where there is the knowledge that Brazilian relationships will not allow for one to be walking alone in life."},{"Title":"The Brazilians","review":"This is just first class - entertaining and informative.

At one point he says, \\"Brazil is now a leading producer of human misery.\\" All good, then he goes on to talk about the issues supporting his claim about the misery. But to make such a claim, if one were a true scholar, one would need to back it up with the data from around the world, the misery index, how it's determined, what is the criteria for comparison, etc.? It's not there, it's his subjective opinion based on what he is determining as misery and then using the claim to substantiate his argument. Just about every page is filled with these subjective pronouncements, again, with little or no source notation to verify his so called facts. Having traveled to Brazil many times over the course of 15 years (I'm actually here now in RIo for 3 months) I see a different Brazil. I hope anyone who reads this book will reserve judgement and also see for themselves."},{"Title":"The Brazilians","review":"Having read most of the introductory books on Brazil, I find the books by Joseph Page to be an excellent basic resource and an enjoyable read to boot."},{"Title":"The Brazilians","review":"The author is not a &quot;brazilianist&quot;, he cover all the aspects of braziliam culture, even details like brazilians japanese descend dekaseguis"},{"Title":"The Brazilians","review":"Page provides an overview of Braziilian history and culture, but is far too free with his often economically nave and leftish comments that add nothing whatever to the story. He seems to operate from the notion that profits equal ill, while labor is equated with virtue. One wonders how the Soviet Union, where profits were outlawed and labor (skilled and educated) was plentiful managed to force its way into the ranks of the third world over 70 years of Marxist experimentation and misery. Page's views might have been a little less out of touch had they been published 10 years before Gorbachev, when there were still some serious economists who were still ignorant of what von Mises had shown six decades before --- that in the final analysis socialism could not work because of how it distorted human incentives.Page goes so far as to suggest that the United States may follow Brazil into economic ruin because of the market based policies that are increasing the size of the \\"economic pie,\\" which necessarily increases the gap between rich and poor. Since the logical leap necessary to make such a conclusion requires the equivalent of rocket power, one can only wonder whether it instead represents an expression of the author's hope (perhaps unconscious).Like so many of his apparent ilk, it would be better for low income households to be even poorer so long as, in exchange, the affluent are less affluent. This \\"hope my neighbor's barn burns down\\" philosophy may warm the hearts of comfortable elites who would never have to feel the pain of such policies, but would make the real poverty daily experienced by others even more desperate.A good example of Page's gratuitous comments is on page 491. After having praised the comparative economic success of Curitiba, capital of Parana, he goes on to attribute part of it to not having \\"allowed itself to be overwhelmed by ... extensive, oppressive poverty.\\" This is akin to crediting good health to not having allowed one's self to be overwhelmed by disease. Perhaps Page is not completely aware of the special conditions that have made Curitiba and its less impressive than Chamber of Commerce hyped success possible. Or perhaps, he believes that Curitiba policies would have made Sao Paulo an urban planning paradise that would have successfully repelled the inconvenient impoverished millions who have moved there from the Northeast (where hopelessness sprawls even more than in Sao Paulo).All in all, what could have been a literary triumph deteriorates into an extensive ideological pamphlet. I am in the market for a good history of Argentina under Peron. Page's is not on my list."},{"Title":"The Brazilians","review":"I wish my college textbooks had been written this well!

This book takes you up to about 1995 ... I'm busily researching now to see what happened in areas concerning the environment, the government, the economy, etc. that Page so successfully introduced. It's as if Page wrote the beginning of a great story...now I want to continue reading about Brazil, to see what's happened since then.I can't finish this review without saying how sad much of Brazil's history is, and how much I admire the people's spirit."},{"Title":"The Brazilians","review":"Joe Page cautions that this is not a work of scholarship butrather an effort by one who has been seduced by Brazil andthings Brazilian to record his impressions for the benifitof other non-Brazilians.

He understands thenuances, he gets most of the facts right, he reports historycorrectly, he discusses the most important issues, he profilespeople who are the most Brazilian of the Brazilians, and--believeit or not--he even understands economics.

It's obvious that the author did extensive research on the subject and he does a very good job explaining how some of the cultural traits developed.

The text is clear and often poetic, a delightful read. Scholars, tourists and enthusiasts will benefit from the book's insights."},{"Title":"The Brazilians","review":"Joseph Page's &quot;The Brazilians&quot; is a very enjoyable portrait of modern-day Brazil, quite possibly the best book on the country in English. Anyone traveling to Brazil for business or pleasure should read it. The book's jacket describes Page as a law professor at Georgetown, and with a lawyer's thoroughness and balance, Page explores the characteristics that make Brazil special -- the warmth, spontaneity and sensuality of the people, their unique blend of African, European and indigenous heritage, the music, soccer, Carnival, telenovelas -- without overlooking the country's often overwhelming problems, such as crushing poverty, environmental degradation, a boom-and-bust economy, violence and corruption.Although Page presents a comprehensive view of Brazil, he unfortunately neglects two topics that should be part of any portrait of the country. The first is its much-maligned capital, Bras&iacute;lia, which gets hardly a mention in this book. Bras&iacute;lia's founding in the late 1950's, its rapid growth and its decline into a moth-eaten, sun-baked museum of outmoded architectural ideas could have filled an entire chapter. For an engaging and upbeat view of Bras&iacute;lia -- more positive than anything I've ever heard from the Brazilians themselves, all of whom seem to loathe their capital -- check out Alex Shoumatoff's &quot;The Capital of Hope.&quot;Page also doesn't say much about Brazilian food and drink, which is too bad, because from the moquecas of Pernambuco to the huge steaks of the South to the fish of the Amazon, Brazilian cuisine is a delight. A cup of Brazil's strong coffee accompanied by po de queijo, a kind of popover laced with cheese, makes a breakfast fit for an emperor. Brazilian beer is just right for a hot afternoon, its wines are underrated, and the caipirinha -- a refreshing concoction of cachaa (a spirit distilled from sugarcane), crushed limes and sugar -- is surely one of the best cocktails in the Western world. Brazilian food and drink deserve wider recognition outside Brazil, but they don't seem to get any here.These minor complaints aside, Page has written a superb book. If you read only one book on Brazil, read this one."},{"Title":"The Brazilians","review":"I've lived in Brazil, and read many books about various aspects of Brazil's people, economy, history, government, military and culture. This book contains a lot of information that I hadn't known, and that I find fascinating. So it's well worth reading.But it's a foreigner's view; Page has visited many times, knows many Brazilians, and is married to a Brazilian. Even so, I found many of his comments and views unrecognizable to me; perhaps one must live in the country and work there, in the local economy, paid in Brazilian currency and working with ordinary Brazilians, to absorb various subtleties of life in Brazil and of interaction among ordinary Brazilians, that Page omits, or may even be unaware of. For example, his account of economic activity in Brazil makes it clear that connections are vital for business success and that many of the most successful firms in Brazil are family firms. But what he doesn't say, surprisingly in view of the fact that he's a professor of law in the US, is that Brazilian commercial law is so different from commercial law in the US that it is very hard, and takes a very long time, to get a commercial dispute settled through the Brazilian legal system. So, as a practical fact, any sensible business owner in Brazil depends on family connections and close friends to straighten out and resolve problems involving contracts.Page also plays down the size and vitality of Brazil's middle class. This seems to be because of his own political views, but it seriously misrepresents the way Brazil actually functions. A good example of the true Brazil of today is the aircraft company EMBRAER, which I recently saw referred to as \\"the Boeing of regional jets\\"; indeed, right now in the US I keep seeing EMBRAER turboprops and EMBRAER regional jets in use all over the US by a lot of airlines. EMBRAER started out as a Brazilian government initiative, but became truly successful after it was privatized. I knew a number of the engineers and technicians who helped to found EMBRAER and make it successful, and they were neither members of the elite nor from impoverished backgrounds. A very few came from rich families and a very few came from impoverished backgrounds, but the large majority were from families of professionals or families that owned small businesses. What they had in common was extremely high intelligence, a good education, and determination to make EMBRAER succeed in the commercial market, which it has. Most of them got their primary, secondary and university education in the public educational system, which is much better, at least in the Southeast, than Page gives it credit for. People I have since encountered, from similar backgrounds, are at the heart of the steady effort in Brazil to master nuclear technology.US government treatment of Brazil and the government of Brazil has often been shabby, to put it kindly. Everyone I knew in Brazil welcomed Americans, including me, provided we identified with Brazilian views on international relations, rather than with US government views. I don't know how many times, but it was many, while I lived there, that the local CIA station chief visited me so that I could tell him what lay behind some grievance that had Brazilians badmouthing the US government; he lived in an American compound, drove an American automobile, and was regarded with deep suspicion by almost all the ordinary Brazilians he met.As for the destruction of rainforest and the awful treatment of the few remaining clans of wild native Americans, it is no worse, and in most ways less destructive, than the way in which the European settlers of North America treated indigenous people and despoiled the environment. Many Brazilians, possibly most of them, resent being lectured by people from the US and Europe about how Brazilians should conduct themselves in the Amazon basin, in the Pantanal, in the remaining fragments of the original coastal forest, in the extensive grasslands of Goias and in the part of the Northeast that is subject to frequent drought. Almost all the Brazilians I knew when I lived there were as aware as people in the US and Europe of the ecological and social problems involved in opening up the backlands. But what would you have had them do? Turn 3/4 of Brazil into a wilderness preserve? impossible. I think Brazil has done quite well to preserve its ecology and the culture of its remaining native Americans as well as it has, and, what's more, Brazilians are still learning in these topics, just as we are, and the record is improving steadily.In summary, Prof. Page's portrayal of Brazil is analogous to what I would expect to find in a book by Jacques Chirac purporting to explain the United States to French readers; there are a lot of good facts here, but a conceptual disconnect."},{"Title":"The Brazilians","review":"This book is marvelous. It offers plenty of keen insight into Brazil, and helps explains why Brazil is such an enthralling country. Page has the learned discipline of an academic, but covers interesting and serious topics in a style that is easily understood and digested. All English speakers will enjoy reading this book before they journey to Brazil, and you'll be able to appreciate and understand Brazil much better after reading this book. Furthermore, this book has no serious competition. There isn't another book that can so concisely give you a better understanding of modern day Brazil."},{"Title":"The Brazilians","review":"Brazil has certainly captured the imagination of most people around the world mainly because of its biological diversity, the carnival in Rio, and its soccer superstars. In fact, people tend to glamorize the country and its people, thinking of the sensuality and docility of Brazilians, the nice rhythyms of 'bossa nova' and 'samba', and the colorful tropical setting. There is, however, a strong, violent undercurrent in Brazilian culture, and Page's book exposes all the sources and manifestations of these in a clear way. There is violence against nature (as the despoiling of the Amazon forest and the sad case of Cubatao show); there is violence against homeless children in the streets; there is violence against women in order to 'save the honor'; there is violence against the poor in the 'favelas', mostly by neglect and drug trafficking... One wonders, by the end of the book, how Brazilians have been able to strive thus far and how they'll be able to cope with the serious challenges posed by overpopulation and poverty, among other things.Page does a good job at trying to explain what is Brazilian by delving into the history of the country. The colonial past certainly branded the country, with its strong slavery component (slavery was abolished only in 1888 in Brazil) and almost medieval social stratification of masters and slaves or, later, peons. Page contends that many of the attitudes and dynamics generated by these have perdured, in one way or another, to this day, even in big cities. Also, Page emphasizes the influence of the many immigrant groups (Portuguese, Japanese, Italians, and Germans)and religions (Roman Catholicism, Protestantism, and 'candomble' and 'umbanda') in marking the country. It is, indeed, so rich a tapestry of influences, that one sometimes feels somewhat lost in trying to grasp what is truly Brazilian.I highly recommend this book to anybody interested in this fascinating country. Page is sometimes condescending in his exposition, but he is always interesting and provides good food for thought and discussion."},{"Title":"The Brazilians","review":"My wife and I met in Seminary.

I could see my country, its history, its past and its present through highly qualified and sensitive eyes. Page's book is a brilliant analysis for a complex society. He gets exactly what is it that makes us Brazilians: diversity, multiplicity of influences, variety, lack of clear limits, lack of clear boundaries. I think Brazil is unpredictable, difficult to catch, even for people that have lived there all their lives. Page got the main traits, the most important aspects of Brazilian personality, the features that really make us Brazilians. Of course, one does not agree with everything that is written in the book. And, as a Brazilian, it is not easy to read the chapter about \\"the culture of brutality\\", for example. Also the author has some kind of \\"bias\\", probably related to the places where he lived in Brazil, towards Rio or Pernambuco (I am from Bahia, I can't help complaining...!

Page openly admits that the analysis presented in the book is through his eyes, which is an honest admission that this is not necessarily a scholarly study of Brazilian culture. That said, the book does not lack for adequate research and Page obviously knows his Brazilian history and culture and spent years putting this book together. The fact that it is not a &quot;scholarly study&quot; is probably what makes it an interesting read.This is a great book to get a basic understanding of Brazil, its culture and its wonderful people.

The chapters on telenovelas, the Carnival, and Soccer were particularly interesting and enlightening. I think it is great that he refers to book and movie portrayals of various events in his discussion of certain events - it helps bring everything together when he mentions, that scene in &quot;The Mission...&quot; A flood of images returns and suddenly everything is in a larger context. I thought it was superb that he spend careful attention discussing the history and character of various states. All too often, life outside the 'captial' cities of a country are neglected. Who would characterize the US by New York City or Russia by Moscow, or Japan by Tokyo?The only downside is the portrayal of poverty and violence. While important topics, I came away with the impression that the author was arguing that Brazil was especially violent, poverty-stricken and unjust... I doubt that it is much more so than other lesser-developed countries, and probably some US inner-cities. Some un-baised comparative data would have been appropriate here to put it all in context.For anyone planning to travel to Brazil that wants to get beyond the basic tourist-guide understanding of the country, I highly recommend the book."},{"Title":"The Brazilians","review":"This is a wonderful book and a must-read for anyone who wishes to either live in Brazil or to travel in Brazil.It covers Brazil's contemprary history in depth and from the optic of a realist.

As the afterword states, this book is not \\"original\\" in the sense of its plot or themes, since \\"Don Segundo Sombra\\" falls into the tradition of \\"coming of age\\"/bildungsroman stories where the wise older mentor guides his young charge into the ways of the world. What makes this book worth reading is its portrait of the Argentine gaucho world, in vivid detail. The chapters are short and punchy, and the novel goes briskly as a whole.It should be noted for those with PC-antennae that in this very macho world, men are men, and women don't serve much purpose except for the gratification of male urges or as dance partners to try to pick up. In addition, a few racial epithets do fly from a few of the characters, but it's endemic to the characters themselves.The most important thing for potential buyers to note in this listing is that this version is the Signet translation by Harriet de On&iacute;s, with an afterword by her. This paperback is most definitely **not** the translation by Patricia Owen Steiner, with an introduction Gwen Kirkpatrick and multiple critical essays. The description on the website of this version needs to be corrected. Please be aware of the particular edition that is on offer here, namely the old Signet Classics edition."},{"Title":"Don Segundo Sombra (Spanish Edition)","review":"This is a must-read for students of and experts in Spanish and Latin American Studies.

The book provides some grammatical explanations and a middling amount of vocabulary that will help anyone who wishes to pursue further study of the language. It is not a detailed, complete course. It is, to my knowledge, the only treatment of Maltese that allows the student to hear the language, and this alone sets it above all competitors.Explanations are clear, the recordings, all of them transcribed in the book,are also of excellent quality.A search of the internet turns up a respectable number of sites by Maltese or expatriot Maltese with stories, essays and poetry, and this, I think, is proof that the language is still alive and vital--important, even though most Maltese are fluent in English and many in Italian.While Amazon no longer stocks it, it may be available by mail from the author--that is how I obtained it--or from the university.See my review of \\"Teach Yourself Maltese.\\""},{"Title":"Beginning Maltese","review":"I bought this product during my recent trip to Malta. The only good thing about this course is the audio material. Other than that it is totally insufficient. It's totally low beginners material. The best course so far, which I also purchased during my trip to Malta is \\"Learn Maltese, Why not?\\" both the textbook and the workbook. The only thing is that the latter does not come with audio files. But then again it makes it very clear how letters are pronounced, and this book and watching an online Maltese TV channel does it. I paid 32 euros for the Beginning Maltese course in Malta, and in my opinion it's only worth 7 euros, if not less, just because of the CDs that come with it.

Looking forward to getting more at a later date."},{"Title":"The Furies","review":"The fourth book of John Jakes' Bicentennial series is Amanda's story from start to finish. When last we saw this granddaughter of Philip Kent, at the end of the third book, \\"The Seekers,\\" she was applying a rather disturbing approach to her horrifying circumstances of essentially being sold as a slave to an Indian tribe. She survived that, and a whole lot more, as the beginning of \\"The Furies\\" jumps ahead quite a few years.By now Amanda is an accomplished woman -- accomplished meaning not wealthy per se, but well-experienced at life and at surviving the worst and best it has to offer. We meet her smack-dab in the middle of the Alamo, and when she gets done surviving that, she becomes captive to a member of the Mexican army. She weathers that storm, as well.\\"The Furies\\" takes this determined female through many years and many ups and downs, but thankfully it's not as brutal as the third book, which held constant catastrophes for its characters. As Amanda winds her way through this book's events, however, outliving her relatives to achieve a pretty remarkable age for this era, Jakes develops a large overall theme of the restoration of the Kent family. The Kents lost a lot in the third book -- basically all that Philip Kent had built up in the second. Now, Amanda is out to get that back, and she's a formidable foe to the evil Hamilton Stovall of the second book and anyone else who crosses her. She speaks her mind, and she does what she wants, but thankfully she is on the side of right! She's even levelheaded enough to reassess her own actions.Amanda was an inspiration to me, I have to admit. That's why I had to give this fourth book a top rating. Jakes manages to execute a female perspective from a male brain, and he does it pretty well. That's one thing. But unlike the third book, which made me wonder if Jakes was ever going to cause anything at all GOOD to happen to these characters, this fourth book really encouraged me with a female character who never let the awful events of life drag her down. She's quite an amazing survivor, and I don't think at all unrealistic. And I like that."},{"Title":"The Furies","review":"I enjoyed the Kent Family Chronicles years ago and I am re-reading them again 25 years later.

It's not like the other book's with the war's and the great stories this book is boring. I found the charactors really boring and have no life in this book. I hope the next one is good."},{"Title":"The Furies","review":"&quot;The Furies&quot; is excellent. Though &quot;The Seekers&quot; got a little boring with unsettled Abraham, this book is full of the excitement of the first two. This time, the story is told from the perspective of Amanda Kent. When the story opens up, Amanda is one of the few women holed out in the Alamo mission as the Mexican troops approach. Her journey from there leads her into two relationships, a couple of business ventures, the birth of a child, a shocking reunion, and an even more stunning revelation about the family business that was left behind in Boston. Amanda confronts Santa Anna, tolerates the men with &quot;gold fever,&quot; makes the acquaintance of Frederick Douglass, inadvertently gets dragged into the slavery issue, and makes plans to regain the family business and restore honor to the Kent name. On the outskirts of the story, Jared's preacher son, Jephtha, is struggling with the slavery issue in his church and in his family. New friends introduced include a flowery romance novelist and a young Irishman who comes to work for Amanda. While some things are looking up, the future of the family is brought into question as the next heir of the Kent fortune shows little interest in the principles of the family. The most exciting stuff happens at the end of the book, and the last couple of pages are very emotional. Amanda Kent will remind you of the young Philip Kent, and you'll love her fiery spirit and clever business maneuvers. John Jakes scores again!"},{"Title":"The Furies","review":"The line of the Kent famiy is followed through with Amanda Kent as the main player. Amanda, daughter of Gilbert Kent was kidnapped and held as a wife by an Indian brave until his death when she was released.She then married a fur trapper who also died,leaving her to m ake her living as a bar keeper until she was caught up in the Battle of the Alamo and again taken prisoner as the woman of a Mexican Officer.She was treated well by him and gave birth to his son,Louis. By chance, she met,very briefly, with her cousin Jared who had been searching for her for years and inherited, on behalf of his son Jephtha,the control of his share of a gold mine.

How she makes it from the Alamo to the California gold rush to the throes of abolitionist New York strains belief, but ultimately the wild ride is worth the trip. Compelling characters help the journey: Bart McGill, Isaiah Hope, Jephtha Kent, Michael Boyle, Luiz Cordoba. And there is the usual liberal sprinkling of historical figures like Santa Ana. Not necessarily a page-turner, but a strong depiction of key events in American history, very indicative of the hardship and conflicts of the time. Better than \\"The Bastard.\\""},{"Title":"The Furies","review":"So far in the Kent Family series, Amanda is my favorite character. She has more guts than most of the men in her family do and she's inspirational. I also like how Jakes ties in different people from the historical stand-point with her story.This novel opens with Amanda trapped inside the Alamo with the Texans during that fateful battle with the Mexicans. Captured as a Mexican war-of-prisoner, Amanda finds love and comfort with the man who rescued her from a certain death. When he died, she was eventually free to go back to Texas. And this is just the beginning of a long adventure. After Amanda gives birth to a son, Louis, she travels to California. And throughout her years, Amanda's main obssession was how to regain the control of Kent and Sons from Hamilton Stovall.This is a fast-paced novel ~~ perhaps more so than the others ~~ and somehow it feels like it's seeped in more historical details than the others. Jake covers the Alamo, the Gold Rush, the expanding business in the Northeast of the USA, Texas becoming a state, slavery and abolition. Also in this novel, Amanda becomes reunited with Jared, her cousin, for a very brief time. This is also an introduction of Jared's son, Jephtha Kent, who is a minister in Virgina, also uneasy with the Slavery question. He soon becomes ostracized by his family and friends for his beliefs.If you're expecting a historical novel with details on our ancestors' lifestyle back in the 1800s, this novel is definitely one of the better ones!

What makes this book so fun is Zelazny tells his tale in a completely different tenor and tone then the first book. In the first book we had no idea what was going on. We were as lost as the main character is through out the book. In this novel the main Character, Corwin, is more aware of events and so we are allowed, as the reader, to be more aware of events.I think it is a remarkable coincidence that I had just picked up \\"The Fabric of Reality\\" by David Deutsch just prior to reading this novel and it is remarkable how well Deutshe's theory of Multiverses fits into the Amber Chronicles. Don't get me wrong. I am not one of those people who wish to make their favorite fantasy into reality, but thinking scientifically while reading a classic fantasy yarn was very enjoyable.A worthy sequel to Nine Princes of Amber. Please make sure you read Nine Princes of Amber first. It will make this novel much more approachable. This, and most of Zelazny's novels, are usually out of print. It would be worthwhile to attempt to get a copy of this book either through Amazon's out print book search or your local used books store. Good luck."},{"Title":"North of Monadnock","review":"I found this book at a library sale. I was sucked right in. What a wonderful bit of nostalgia.My family has been going North to NH for all of my 41 years. Characters like the ones in Mr Tolman's wonderful and light book, bring back the wonderful memories of my youth. When you went to the local store, the McCormack spinster sisters ran the show and clearly weren't there for the money. Old timers sitting near the potbellied stove smoking pipes and cigars, told deer hunting stories or whatever the local gossip was. Always friendly.Mr Tolman tells us about his life and adventures over by Keene NH somewhere back in the 30's through the 60's. He seems to convey that having fun is what it's all about and seems to spend most days birdhunting with his accomplished wife and other local characters. It really reflects priorities in a slower but changing age. All the local characters and their often amusing and sometime sad tales are told in a wonderful conversational style. Even got a story about a monkey in a tree in the middle of the NH woods. A monkey?

All the books are skimpy fast reads. I hope my opinion is changed, but I'm unwilling to invest in any more of them to find out.He has a some of good advice for sailors at sea. However, I have to say, that like most of his books I take what he writes with a grain of salt. And, some of what he recommends, I doubt he ever did himself.That is not to say his advice is bad, just not practical in some cases. I doubt many seaman would follow all of his advice.For example, he recommends that single handed sailor drag a line behind the boat hooked up to a trip wire arrangement to heave the boat to. Great advice. I doubt anyone follows it or that Tristan Jones did so. That doesn't mean it is not good advice. This sort of thinking is smart thinking, planning ahead for an emergency.Likewise his advice for having a triangular patch of canvas ready and rigged on the bow with control lines all set ready to cover a hole below the waterline should the unlike event happen that one gets holed below the waterline. This is just something that would get in the way, foul up something else on the boat and cause more trouble than it's worth. I think a better idea is have one ready to go and practice rigging it.Perhaps these ideas may make sense when you are sitting at a typewriter trying to put enough substance in a book so you can sell it to a publisher. This is my impression of Tristan Jones.If you get something out of a book like this, you got something that may give you an idea that will save your boat or yourself.I gave it 3 stars because I felt it was like some of his other books, short books made in an attempt to make money to fund his roving lifestyle as a wandering seaman.Hey he pulled it off.Maybe you can too!

In this text, Jones again confounds everyone with his expert knowledge on all of the many aspects of sailing solo around the world.

High adventure of the old type. The journey was intended to demonstrate the possibility of transoceanic vaoyages in ancient times, using the most primitive of crafts. He proved his point, in the most direct way possible.But as well as being a daring adventurer, Heyerdahl was a master story-teller, and he enthralls his readers with accounts of the ancient legends of Peru; of the Virachochas, led by Kon Tiki, who were said to have fled from their Andean homeland westwards across the ocean. We hear of the ancient and mysterious ruins around Lake Titicaca, which the Incas told the Spaniards had been built by the Viracochas. These people were said to have been a white-skinned race which had originated far to the north and west.In subsequent years Heyerdahl traced the origin of the Viracochas and the other \\"white\\" Indians of the Americas to the Atlas region of North Africa; and he demonstrated, in the Ra expedition, how ancient sailors from that region could have crossed the Atlantic to reach the Americas.Before he died, Heyerdahl had the satisfaction of seeing everyhting he said fully vidicated by science. To start with, in the early 1990s a forensic toxicology team in Germany, led by Dr Svetlana Balabanova, discovered traces of tobacco and cocaine, two American narcotics, in an Egyptian mummy. After repeated the tests many times, and examining other mummies, they found the same thing again and again.In the meantime, it has become clear that a whole host of American drugs (such as the notorious jimson weed) were known in the Old World in ancient times, and used in the various Mystery Cults to provide initiates with out-of-body experiences. Almost all of this knowledge was suppressed in Europe and the Middle East, where Christianity and Islam took a dim view of such things. It was preserved, however, in the Sanskrit literature of India.A little later in the 1990s an American team of geneticists dicovered a type of European/Middle Eastern mitochondrial DNA (the x haplogroup) in Native American populations. Again, after checking and rechecking for errors, they published their findings. And the percentage of this Old World DNA was highest in groups of Native Americans that were traditionally known as \\"white,\\" such as the Ojibbewa in North America and the Yanomamo in South America.When this is added to the clear evidence that Clovis Man was essentially Caucasian (as Kennewick Man has shown), then there's no doubt that Heyerdahl was right. But how long will it be before this is recognised, and Heyerdahl gets the academic recognition he deserves?"},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"I recently saw a list of bestsellers from my birth year of 1951. Kon Tiki had been #1 throughout most of that year so, out of curiosity, I bought it. It has opened an entire new world to me! Adventure, culture, bravery, aquatic life, and so on! The best book I have read in years!!! Mr. Heyerdahl writes like he is just talking to you in your living room, so down to earth and very entertaining in his calm, methodical approach to situations most of us would run screaming from! I highly recommend this book to everyone, young and old! It is a classic. My dream is to one day travel to the Kon Tiki Museum in Oslo and actually see that magnificent raft. Read this book! You will never forget it."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"Heyerdahl was either extremely ignorant of the sea, completely sure of his hypothesis that ancient peoples traveled the sea in rafts, or both.I worked offshore, and couldn't imagine doing what Heyerdahl did. I've spent my life on the water and the sea just has never been so forgiving in my case. To build a raft for the first time without testing it first against the sea was just madness. But to put out, without the technology we have today, that was just ballsy.In the end, history proved him right, over and over again. Heyerdahl is a man who certainly knows how to put his money where his mouth is. If you want to know about the spirit of those who have the faith to really lean on their convictions, this is a great book.-H"},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"I was very pleased that I stumbled across this book and thoroughly recommend it. In terms of history and the movement of people the book is very important. The idea that the Polynesian islands were populated solely from Asia had to be re-thought after this unbelieveable journey was made, even history books had to be re-written. Before the incredible journey was taken not many poeple thought it possible that a raft could leave the west coast of S.America and reach the polynesian islands solely by nature alone ie current and wind. Most people excepted what scientists wrote ,that is the polynesian islands were populated from the west side of the Pacific(asia)only and no native South Ameicans could have made such a journey especially before technology came into play. But these men had done there homework on sea currents,weather patterns(winds) and construction of the raft, which was constructed using the same materials as they had used in inca times.If you want an insight into how ancient peoples risked everything by sailing into the unknown this is the book for you,its compelling stuff."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"Kon Tiki is one of the best books I have ever read.

He did so by setting sail on a balsa raft from Peru and going thousands of miles into the Pacific, with a small crew of friends in a remarkable adventure. Heyerdahl was a genius to realize that ancient man need not have been hindered by oceans, which in fact could have acted more like conveyer belts than barriers. (I also recommend his books about the Ra expeditions in reed rafts from Africa to America.) The success of the Kon Tiki mission was a bold and evocative backing up of this general theory, though he also offers other kinds of fascinating evidence along the way. (By the way, I always grit my teeth when I hear modern scientists trying to discredit Heyerdahl by asserting that today's Easter Islanders are Polynesians who came from farther west, which isn't in doubt and wan't to Heyerdahl either. But they are not reading him closely - he suggested an *earlier* migration from South America, which was replaced by Polynesians later on. Perhaps Easter Island was settled twice.) Anyway, a good sea yarn and one of the world's rare radically eye-opening books."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"I read this book when I was in my teens, and I'm happy to see that it has been reprinted. Although I always preferred to read fiction over nonfiction, for some reason I picked this book up and began to read -- and I couldn't put it down. I found great excitement in the real-life adventure of Heyerdahl and his crew building a raft in Peru, then sailing the Pacific in order to prove that people from South America could have sailed to and settled Polynesia long ago. The details of building the draft and getting it to the ocean make the book come alive, as do the details of being on the ocean on nothing bigger than a raft held together with ropes and vines. A wonderful true-life adventure story."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"I have read this book several times over the years. If you like sea stories, this should be in your library. It's a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"This was a wonderful sea adventure. It was true and an epic seastory that is true. It was an attempt to prove that Tahitians came from Peru via raft. I recommend it for anyone who sits on the tip of the adventure chair."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"Besides being an excellent explorer, the author is an excellent story-teller. He start his narration telling the difficulties of having his studies accepted by scholars. They doubt his theory on the South American natives being the ones to populate the Polynesian islands, because they thought it was impossible for them to reach the islands using just a small raft.That triggered the desire for the author to prove himself right. He started looking for ways of doing this travel, finding crew and financial resources. After solving the financial problems through the sponsor of people from the explorer's club in New York, he start traveling multiple times to Washington to get licenses and approval for using military food and he find his first travelmate, Herman Watzinger. They are joined by Knut Haugland, Bengt E.Danielssen, Erik Hesselberg and Torstein Raaby. The book describes this incredible and marvelous journey taken by six people (five Norwegians and one Sweden) through the Pacific Ocean. Some photos taken by the author are presented in the book. This book shows how much courage those guys needed to have to expose themselves to the wind, the rain, the lack of comfort, and the risk of death just to prove a theory.This book is more than just a traveller's journal. It is a masterpiece and it should be in the permanent library of any serious reader."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"I had read Kon-Tiki as a boy and enjoyed the adventure. As an older man, I wanted to take the raft trip again, and it was even better the second time around. A stunning snapshot of the Pacific in 1947 and a tale of man's spirit of exploration and fellowship."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"I read this book fifty years ago as a young man and enjoyed it very much. It was one of the first larger books I read. Just lately I retired to take care of my wife and sat down and reread this book.

It is an adventure that captures the imagination. It might be old, but it is good."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"Although with my luck it would probably sink.Heyerdahl was one of the last great adventurers of our time, and his memoir 'Kon Tiki' is a testimonial of his trials before during and after his grand expedition accross the Pacific. In true adventure fashion he leaves no detail ignored, from the building of the raft, to the opposition he encountered to the myriad of marine life he encountered on the way to the polynesian islands.The reading can be a bit dry at times, but in the end it's worth it. Because when he finally strikes dry land you feel like you've been on the boat with him the whole time and not reading his adventures 50+ years after the fact."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"From the opening sentence to the final period, \\"Kon-Tiki\\" is a page-turner.The story is absurd on its face: One man, obsessed with the idea that the Polynesian islands were colonized by voyagers from South America, can't get anybody to take his theory seriously. \\"They didn't have proper boats,\\" was the argument.Heyerdahl insisted that the colonists had set forth on balsawood rafts. This assertion was met with derision.To prove his theory, Heyerdahl decided to do it himself: to sail from the coast of Peru roughly 4,000 miles to Polynesia. The story of how he assembled a crew of like-minded fools, put together his unlikely craft, and made the incredible journey reads like the best of fiction.Heyerdahl never bogs down the reader with pointless minutia, but he nevertheless treats the reader to details that make the story come to life: the phosporescent plankton, the daily breakfast of flying fish picked up off the deck every morning, the tiny crab who became a pet of the crew. And he doesn't stint on adventure, from the man nearly lost at sea to the harrowing wrecking of the raft on the reefs.\\"Kon-Tiki\\" is simply a great story, engrossing even to those not usually given to reading survival stories."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"Wow! I loved the book. It appealed to me immensely for its unusual and exhilarating combination of scientific mission and adventure.It was amazing how 6 men of different disciplines, who have never met before, are drawn towards an unusual goal and make a perfect team.While reading I travelled with these 6 men into the amazing amazon jungles, over the endless seas, and met with exotic sea animals.Truly inspiring!"},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"Few, if any, authors can claim the same realism and drive that Heyerdahl accomplishes in Kon-Tiki. It is a story of a journey of unparalleled magnitude and importance. Six men in a balsa log raft against 4,000 miles of the blue unknown. Simply put, a spellbinding chronicle of amazing human acheivement, the like of which will not soon be equaled."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"this book is an absolute classic.

His voyaga is inspiring. This book is great..

It was read to me first by my father, and I have since read it twice, soon to be three times. Highly reccomended!"},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"I first heard of this book from my father. It was always his favoite, and I remember seeing it in his bookcase when I was a child. I stumbled upon an old first edition, like my Dad's in a bookstore, bought it, and read it in two days. This book is so good -- and so astonishing -- that it reads more exciting than any fiction that I've ever read. This is a great story for anyone yearning for adventure. These six men, alone on a hand-made balsa raft, adrift in the pacific -- by their choice! Just to prove the validity of a theory. What makes this account so astounding is the conviction these men had in their belief and their willingness to risk everything--including their own lives. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"When I was very young my father used to read my brothers, my sister and I books from his collection. Yesterday I picked up this book, by chance, in a store and could not put it down. I bought it, read it last night and realized that this was one of those books that had been read to me so long ago. It's funny to think this, but looking back on it I realize that I always believed the story to be fiction. Nothing like this could ever really happen!...but it DID happen, and not too long ago either. Last night I sat down with this book and could not put it down until it was finished. You are drawn into the planning of the expedition, the day-to-day life of the crew and, by the end of the book, you feel as though you were ON the Kon-Tiki with these six men. You reach the end of the book and instantly crave another adventure, or another thousand pages. I would be doing this book an injustice by trying to explain the feeling it gives the reader, but to say that it has effortlessly toppled every notion I ever had about what makes a &quot;good&quot; book would be very accurate indeed. A must read--for anyone of any age in any country."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"In this classic, Heyerdahl constructs a raft to sail 4,300 nautical miles from Peru to the South Pacific Islands in order to prove his theory that the natives of Peru could have migrated to these islands thousands of years ago. This book contains a great deal of information of interest to scientists. These include the appearance of previously little-known fish, the scope of marine bioluminescense, the deployment of ocean currents, etc. It is interesting to note that the Polynesians realized that the Earth was round. A re-examination of the common belief that prescientific peoples invariably believed in a flat Earth is clearly warranted."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"This book is for the voyeur that wants a window into the lost age of adventure, those years before 1940. The book is rightly regarded as one of the greatest accounts of real life adventures ever written. It paints exhilarating, vivid pictures of risk taking, and of the human hunger for adventure and desire to return to experiencing life through ones primal instincts. This book is about survival, a chase, and pushing the boundaries of what is possible. It sets The Sea against Man, thin odds against practical ingenuity, conventional academic thought against independent, irreverent, defiant thinkers. Reading about the author's 4,000-mile journey across huge expanses of treacherous ocean brings out the would-be adventurer in the reader. The adventurers' single mindedness and determination against all odds and in the face of nay saying experts (who condemned the journey from the start as foolish, and said their voyage never would or could succeed), sets an inspiring example of how determination and perseverance can lead to accomplishing what self-appointed experts and nay Sayers declare impossible. During their voyage the author and his team pushed the boundaries and commonplace notions of what is possible. The author in part wants us to understand that not all seemingly adventurous fools and are so foolish; that determination can see one across barren, stormy oceans, be they real or metaphorical. On completing the book, all that remains is for the reader to respond to its heed, to push ones own limits to their edge. In a corporate world where too often money is the primary force in leading us to act, where the value of an activity is measured by its potential financial payback, it is refreshing to be reminded of other motivations for action, and of other rewards. The ultimate reward of this book is that it can reawaken in the reader a primal instinct to pursue, instincts which often seems irrelevant or far away in our modern, comfortable lives... this book also reminds the reader of how to dream and the virtues of following dreams. The book serves to remind us of how, why, and where to find adventure ... personally, I walked away from the book exhilarated, and convinced that anything is possible, should I choose to look beyond conventional thought or lifestyle and reach for the stars. ***** Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"The theory suggested by Thor Heyerdahl that the islands of Polynesia were settled from sea-faring travelers from South America has been doubly disproved by both language and DNA. So why read this old book copyrighted in 1950?For the sheer adventure of it. Never has an escape from the war-torn modern world come at a greater seductive appeal than in KON TIKI: Across the Pacific by Raft.Crewed by five nutty Norwegians and one brave Swede, Kon Tiki is built from giant balsa trees freshly felled in in the forests at the foothills of the Andes and floated down the river to a naval yard on the coast of Peru. Surrounded by modern warships, the logs are lashed together with rope and a deck and cabin of plaited bamboo is added. Towed out to sea, the strange little craft and crew (six men and one parrot)is caught in the cold Humboldt Current and taken north, then the sail fills with the tradewind and it is swept east toward the islands.Sadly, after two months, the parrot is washed overboard. The remaining crew (six men) learn that the steering watch must wear a safety rope, that it is possible to catch sharks by hand and that the easiest way to make breakfast is to gather up all the flying fish that have jumped on board overnight. The grainy black and white photographs alone are enough to start the reader on a reverie of escaping to Tahiti. This is beach reading of the most dangerous sort!But aside from the sheer adventure, an important point was made by Thor Heyerdahl's voyage. In our modern era we are so impressed with our own technology that it is easy to lose sight of how clever our \\"primitive\\" ancestors were. Heyerdahl built a boat from ancient descriptions and discovered halfway through the voyage that it had a sophisticated steering mechanism which he didn't use since wind and current were taking him in the right direction. Kon Tiki could have made landfall sooner had he aimed for nearer islands. That this remarkable craft survived contact with a reef that had ripped up more modern boats shows that even amateurs could arrive safely. One wonders what the original builders of such crafts could do?"},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"As a youngster, I saw the documentary of this amazing story and was thrilled from the start. Soon thereafter, I read this book entirely in three days, completely enthralled in the narrative. Dr. Heyerdahl had proven his skeptics wrong, demonstrating how an early civilization (in this case, the Native Americans of Peru) could cross the Pacific on a raft to populate what is today Polynesia. Based on the Peruvian legend of the hero Kon-Tiki (later deified) who successfully built and sailed a similar raft many centuries ago.I have since read other Heyerdahl authored works, including &quot;Fatu-Hiva&quot; and &quot;Aku-Aku.&quot; Although they too are extremely rousing, I personally feel a greater spirit of adventure in this story, hence it is my favorite.As mentioned in the title, there is one sad commentary to make: on the day of writing this review (4/18/02), I learned that Dr. Heyerdahl died of a brain tumor at age 87. May he rest in peace."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"Forget idiotic movies like 'Jaws,' these Scandanavian maniacs grab sharks by the tail and kill them for fun.

Not Thor and his band of merry men; they were theoretically convinced and determined to put their tails on the line to prove it. I have never read anything in my life so full of intensity, danger and heroic, romantic adventure.

It's also a great travel epic complete with the quirky locals, the gadget guru, and a group of men willing to risk their lives for an ultimate adventure.Parts of the book did read like a 1960's documentary. I could almost envision the \\"exciting world of color\\" technicolor intro and Thor narrating over the action. But I think it all adds to the ambiance of the book. It makes you realize in days before GPS and sattellite radios how crazy this band of pioneers really were. Also Thor doesn't really get into the emotional implications of first signing on to the expedition, then being at sea with a handful of men for three months. Instead he spiced up the day to day desciptions with detail about sea life and what the crew did to entertain themselves. I would have imagined the trip to be much more monotonous and morale killing then he makes it out to be, but it definitly makes a much more exciting read.I woudl recommend this book to any travel book lover.

Highly recommended for all readers."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"With fond memories of poring over a colorful \\"youth\\" version of Kon-Tiki when I was a school boy in the 1960s, I recently picked up a copy of Thor Heyerdahl's full-length recounting of his exhilarating 4,300 mile open-sea expedition, to understand the background and motivation behind the voyage in more detail. Kon-Tiki is a fascinating book, documenting the even more fascinating true story of why and how six courageous men set sail on a primitive balsa wood raft from Peru in April 1947, blown along on their hundred-day journey to Polynesia by westward trade winds, the same air currents that might have carried early (possibly even the earliest) settlers to these islands 1,500 years ago.Ostensibly, the purpose of the voyage was an exercise in experimental archaeology and ethnography, to demonstrate that a fair-skinned, reddish-haired people, originating from \\"where the current comes in from the Atlantic . . . instead of in the more temperate [Asian] regions where civilizations . . . have had easier conditions for their development,\\" could have, as some cultural clues suggest, sailed westward from the Americas to become the first human inhabitants of the South Pacific, including Easter Island, Hawaii and Tahiti, beginning around 500 A.D. However, as the author himself points out in the brief Appendix, \\"My migration theory . . . was not necessarily proved by the successful outcome of the Kon-Tiki expedition. What we did prove was that . . . the Pacific islands are located well inside the range of prehistoric craft from Peru.\\"Beyond its (controversial) ethnographical underpinnings, Kon-Tiki contains a wealth of interesting ancillary information about botany (how the sap in the core of freshly logged balsa wood prolongs flotation, while the softness and absorbency of its outer layers protects ropes and prevents fraying), ichthyology (the gigantic and ugly whale shark, deadly snake mackerel Gempylus, pilot fish, flying fish, how to catch sharks with one's bare hands, how to harvest plankton for a meal, etc.), agriculture (the origins of the sweet potato and palm tree), and cultural anthropology (generosity and warm spirit of the native people on the island of Raroia, where the Kon-Tiki landed, later studied by crew member, Bengt Danielsson).But, most of all, Kon-Tiki is an enthralling and inspiring adventure of a driven man (Heyerdahl) with an idea and a mission, who succeeds, against the advice of experts (\\"If we added up all that the different experts, each in turn, had pointed out . . . there was not a length of rope, not a knot, not a measurement, not a piece of wood in the whole raft which would not cause us to founder at sea\\"), in accomplishing what common opinion deems impossible. Apparently, such enthusiasm is contagious (or at least genetic), as the author's grandson (Olav Heyerdahl, Tangaroa expedition, 2006) recently completed a retracing of the Kon-Tiki's 1947 voyage. In the author's enthusiastic words during the raft's harrowing reef crossing at voyage's end, through bubbling \\"witches' cauldron\\" with green walls of sea water towering 25 feet above, \\"Hold on!\\" and \\"Hurrah!\\" Definitely a thrilling story!"},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"4550 Kon-Tiki Across the Pacific by Raft, by Thor Heyerdahl translated by F.

It tells of a 101-day tip from Peru to French Polynesia made in 1947 by six Norwegian men on a raft using balsa logs. It is a very interesting story, and one stands in amazement at the daring of these men, making such a fearful journey, with no support, though they did have radio equipment on board. I found the account totally interest-holding. The author was convinced that people from South America in about 500 A.D. settled in Polynesia. His trip at least proved that the trip was possible. I think the book ranks with other great adventure books I have read, such as Touching the Void, by Joe Simpson (read 9 Sep 2003) and Alone, by Richard E.

It is a book written by a world-renowned archeologist, Thor Heydrahl, about his real-life adventure. To prove his theory that a long-extinct race in South America was actually descended from a people that came from, and then later returned to Polynesia, Heydrahl set out on a remarkable journey. He, along with five others, made a raft out of balsa logs, and without using metal of any form, sailed thousands of miles across the Pacific Ocean. Their adventures and struggles, both on and off the raft, combine to make an incredible tale of knowledge, bravery, and luck."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"This was one of my summer reads and I found it incredibly entertaining. The story of how a bunch of crazy Norwegians, many of whom were WWII vets, floated across the South Pacific on a balsa raft during the middle of the 20th century is one of the best adventure stories I have ever read. The line between scientific investigation and insanity is thin on this one. The men set off to prove a link between Ancient Peruvians and Polynesians by proving that the Peruvians had sailed as far as Polynesia on balsa rafts. The group procures its wood from the dangerous, lawless countryside of Peru, floats it down a river to the sea, and sets forth on an epic adventure on a scrappy looking sail driven raft they slapped together using diagrams based off ancient documents.The accounts of flying fish, battles with sharks, and struggles against the elements are highly entertaining. They drifted across seas drawn by the currents through areas of the ocean free of shipping lanes, an adventure unparalleled for its time. Their raft literally became a home to hundreds of sea creatures. They encountered sea creatures that nobody had ever seen before. Although their voyage seems crazy, it was really done and I was actually relieved when the raft broke up on a reef on a South Pacific Island and the men were able to swim to safety.If you've ever dreamed of doing something crazy in the name of scholarly pursuits, or if you like a good adventure tale, this is a good read. Its also an interesting piece of history and Thor Heyerdahl went on to receive hundreds of awards for his incredible accomplishment."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"I read this book and its companion book, \\"The RA Expeditions\\" several years ago and enjoyed them both very much.

It represents the best of that magazine and best of exploration into ancient technologies -- by emulating and testing long-standing theories. In this case, Thor launches himself into the vast blue waves and has the adventure of a lifetime. Even if you don't study history, this is a great read."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"Immediately after WWII, young Thor Heyerdahl tried to submit a paper to academia outlining his idea that the Polynesian islands were not settled from India and Asia, as was the current wisdom, but rather by people from South America. The problem with this idea, pointed out by a number of people, was that the only boats available to the natives of that area were balsa-wood rafts. It was almost impossible to imagine that such a raft could possibly travel 3,600 miles across open ocean to arrive at the Polynesian Islands intact and with living crew. Some people laughed outright at the idea. Many of them thought the idea was crazy.So, in true mad-scientist form, Heyerdahl said to himself &quot;I'll show them. I'll show them ALL!&quot;. Rather than building a mad-scientist deathray, which would not only be cliche but also out of his field (anthropology), he decided to literally show them. He, himself, would build a balsa-wood raft, adhering precisely to the old designs, and he would personally sail that raft from the coast of South America to one of the Polynesian islands a quarter of the world away.The saga of his quest to first find someone to back him on the journey, someone to crew his raft, a way to BUILD the raft, and finally the incredible adventure of actually taking the _Kon Tiki_ across the greatest ocean on Earth, makes fascinating reading. Such a voyage was something of an effort even for modern machines of its era; had Heyerdahl not done it, no one would have believed it. Instead he set sail and brought the future with him.This did not end Heyerdahl's adventures, but instead began them. Later he developed a theory that the Americas themselves were, at least in part, visited by or settled from ancient Egypt. Since the only boats THEY used to cross oceans were made of reeds, no one would believe it was possible..."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"After noticing numerous similarities between aspects of Polynesian culture and Inca culture, Thor Heyerdahl postulates an ancient connection between the two peoples: he argues that Inca traveled to the South Pacific islands and at least partially colonized them. His theory is immediately dismissed by anthropologists for many reasons. Foremost is the argument that the Inca did not have boats capable of crossing the Pacific. All they had were balsa wood rafts, which the experts argue would never survive the trip. Heyerdahl is so sure he is right, he sets out to prove that it is possible to cross the Pacific in a balsa wood raft by making the voyage himself!He recruits five Scandinavian shipmates and heads down to South America to build a balsa wood raft. After wading through much red tape, his crew finally builds a replica raft and sets sail. Everyone thinks they will likely die on the trip, but they are determined to prove them wrong. And they do. On the way, they have fantastic adventures with sharks, unexplained huge creatures far below the raft, fish jumping on board for breakfast, men overboard, and a final exciting crash landing on a South Pacific island.I can't say enough about how enjoyable this book was, but I also can't help but be sad that in the days of satellite mapping, GPS, and red tape, such adventures now seem out of reach. This book has a bit of everything: science, history, engineering, philosophy, and of course loads of maritime adventure from an era when the world's geography was a little more mysterious."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"It's a great read and an epic journey. What amazed me, even more than the raft itself, was that the crews' relationships with each other survived the trip.

I am totally buying this book as an addition to my library I'm building up for my children. I think the author's passion for the sea, adventure, history and the Polynesian people are inspiring. This book will make you want to see Peru and the Polynesian Islands, and if like me, you've been there already, you'll want to go back with the book in hand. The only slow point in the writing is in the beginning when the trip is just being put together but once the journey is under way Heyerdahl comes into his own and you are engulfed by the exciting world of the sea, the last great frontier!"},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"Heyerdahl's book succeeds on many levels--it is both an intriguing scientific/anthropological speculation and an enthralling tale of adventure.

I recently ran across the book and reread it. Kon-Tiki is an amazing story of Heyerdahl's determination to prove a theory that it is possible to sail from Peru to the South Pacific islands by raft. He puts together a successful expedition, and with a lot of luck manages to prove his point. Along the way, you get a history lesson, geography lesson, marine biology lesson, and a wonderful sea-faring adventure story all in a fast-paced book. And with the photographs accompanying the prose, you feel like you too are on the raft with them."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"Adventurer Thor Heyerdahl was not only a pioneer of exploration and experimentation, but he pioneered a genre of writing: survival in nature, particularly on the sea. Nobody does it better than Heyerdahl, who makes science and nature instantly relatable and intriguing...exciting and relevant. This is a classic story, vividly told, of the monumental task of building a raft, assembling a crew, and setting out for the great unknown in dangerous, shark-infested waters. Simply put, this is one of my favorite books of all time. Read it now, and thank me later."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"I respect Thor a great deal for his endeavors.

Heyerdahl's exploits indeed do come across as completely fantastic, as if from an imaginged story. This is mainly because important misadventures were not included in his text, and only after interviewing island natives and a careful look at his discoveries and methods were such things discovered. I reccomend this book to anyone who wishes to read about the great adventures of a single man and his crew aboard a raft, I do not reccomend this work to be taken completely literally and as a scholarly report. If such a book appeals to you, by all means, read it and enjoy it, but I highly suggest doing your homework before accepting his journey as full truth."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"I made some Mormons angry over my reviews of books that defend the Book of Mormon, and they have been slamming my reviews. Your \\"helpful\\" votes are appreciated. ThanksOn Kon-Tiki: I absolutely got lost in this magnificent adventure. Nevertheless, Heyerdahl's theory that civilization was spread around the world by some lost white race is simply bogus racism. Still, I enjoyed all his books, including \\"The Ra Expeditions,\\" and \\"Aku-Aku.\\"It is sad to think that Heyerdahl's career as a fearless adventurer is marred by his zealous devotion to a dated idea. Yes, Peruvian Indians could have crossed the Pacific, but it is more likely that contact came from the other way. At any rate, Heyerdahl manufactured the archaeological evidence he found on Easter Island.In the July 2002 issue of the \\"Smithsonian Magazine,\\" Richard Conniff demonstrated that Heyerdahl actually paid the natives to make reed-boats relics (Kon Artist?\\" was the title). \\"A good story,\\" said Conniff, \\"can be so compelling that teller and subject become entrapped together in its charms....\\" (p. 28). This astute observation could apply to novels claimed to be actual history, and anyone interested in the Book of Mormon should give it long thought.Heyerdahl wrote about Pedro Pate, an Easter Islander and how Pate found a two-masted reed boat in a cave. Conniff wrote: \\"I showed Pate a two-page photograph of the reed boat from Heyerdahl's book, and he grinned. He'd carved the boat himself, he said. Dubious, I offered him $100 to carve such a boat now, 37 years later, and he accepted.\\" \\"A few days later, he presented me with the 18-inch-long reed boat he had carved. It was as good as the one in the book\\" (p. 29).In \\"The Ancient American Civilizations,\\" Friedrich Katz asked some very hard questions of Heyerdahl's theory.\\"If the Polynesians really do come from America, why do their chronicles record the exact opposite direction, naming South-East Asia as their place of origin? Why is their language first and foremost related to South-Asiatic and Malayan languages? Finally, as Trimborn remarked, 'Were not the Polynesian Vikings, rather than the Indians, not the sailors who crossed the high seas?'\\" (p. 18).Heyerdahl should also be criticized for playing word games, selecting a word here and there, but ignoring the whole language. Many linguists criticized this erroneous method of relating two ancient peoples. See Robert Wauchope's magnificent little book, \\"Lost Tribes and Sunken Continents: Myth and Method in the Study of the American Indians.\\" See my review.Lost Tribes and Sunken Continents Myth Method in theMormon writers frequently cite Heyerdahl because he proved that ancient voyages across the oceans were possible--an idea going back hundreds of years and not new with Heyerdahl. Very few scholars ever denied that such ancient voyages were possible.But ah, there's the rub, as Hamlet said. If they occurred, what would be the effect on an entrenched native culture? The Book of Mormon has ancient voyages (the Jaredites were supposed have crossed the ocean on a 344-day voyage in eight submarines in about 2,000 BC). It is primarily about the great civilizations the Jaredites and Nephites established in the Americas.Robert Sharer summarizes the modern state of knowledge in his heavy and authoritative book, \\"The Ancient Maya.\\" Sharer writes:\\"After more than a century of gathering and analyzing archaeological evidence, we have discovered nothing to support the idea of intervention by people from the Old World.\\" \\"This is not to say that accidental contacts between the Old and New World peoples could not have occurred before the age of European exploration\\" (p. 6).\\"On the basis of the available evidence, then, the courses of cultural development in the New and Old Worlds seem clearly independent of each other and devoid of significant contact until 1492\\" (intro., p. 7).The ancient Maya civilization, Sharer continues, \\"are to be \`explained' not as a product of transplanted Old World civilization, but as the result of the processes that underlie the growth of any culture, including those that develop the kind of complexity we call civilization.\\"\\"The idea, which either explicitly or implicitly asserts that the peoples of the New World were incapable of shaping their own destiny or developing sophisticated cultures independently of Old World influence, is still popular in quarters.\\"\\"But this is but one more popular myth devoid of fact, for the evidence points unmistakably toward the evolution of civilization in the New World independently of developments in the Old World.\\" See Sharer's book and my review.The Ancient Maya, 6th EditionNone of these serious criticisms of the claims of Mormons or of Heyerdahl's theories, however, should detract from Heyerdahl's great adventures. His accounts of his raft voyages are breathless and compelling reading.For a masterful telling of Polynesian history (especially about Easter Island) by a scholar with a Moari heritage, read the essential book \\"Vikings of the Pacific,\\" by Peter H.

Not that I need loss of life or violent hurricanes for excitement, but a &quot;major event&quot; was the daily circling of dolphins, which Heyerdahl calls to our attention at least ten times. This alone attests to the opinion that the book is not organized or written well. It is a loosely conected batch of ramblings. Perhaps some of the power was lost in the translation, but in general, the story rates right up there with my 3rd grade narrative on my summer vacation."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"With each passing year, less and less of the world remains to be discovered. With GPS and satellite imagery, our oceans have been charted and the jungles surveyed. Our world is no longer a mystery. No longer do we have maps fringed by threatening pictures of dragons and sea monsters warning sailors and explorers of the unknown that lies out there. But when I picked up this book I was taken back fifty years in time. Back to a time when men ate meat raw and walked around with clubs hunting big game. OK, perhaps I am getting carried away.Thor Heyerdahl believed the Polynesian islands were inhabited by sea faring travellers from Peru. But his thesis on this topic was ridiculed because no one would believe that the pacific ocean could be crossed by a flimsy raft made of balsa wood and bamboo. So Heyerdahl decides to prove IT IS possible by building a raft using exactly the same materials the ancient Peruvians used and sailing off the coast of Peru hoping to eventually reach Polynesia.Nearly every step off his journey was filled with nay sayers who said he was crazy and \\"experts\\" who variably told him he was going to die, the raft was going to break apart, or the balsa wood would absorb the sea water and sink. He ignored them all. When they told him balsa trees of the size he needed no longer existed along the coast, he took a jeep deep into the jungles through flooded roads and GOT his trees. Which then they floated down to the ocean in a river.Heyerdahl is keenly aware of his surroundings and describes his voyage vividly and in simple prose. I could smell the sea breeze and feel the spray of the ocean. It was like taking a mini vacation every time I sat down with this book. You'll swim with whale sharks and get caught in ferocious storms. The six men caught sharks with their hands and even had a pet parrot. I suppose all self respecting seamen need to have a parrot.The ending to this book was surprising but perfect. It brings the story full circle and could not have ended any other way. So prepare yourself a margarita, kick back, and begin a sea adventure."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"Kon-Tiki starts with an idea, conceived during Heyerdahl's stay on a South Seas island researching his doctoral thesis: could Polynesia have been colonized by trans-Pacific emigres from the pre-Colombian cultures of South America?A true scientist, Heyerdahl isn't satisfied with deciding &quot;yes&quot; - he must test the theory! In the hands of a lesser man this would have produced a musty old thesis collecting dust on the back shelf of an anthropology library. Instead, Heyerdahl marshals five friends of heroic spirit, acquires 9 giant balsa wood logs and some other supplies, and within a few months he sets sail from Peru to cross the Pacific. Drinking fresh water stored in hollowed-out bamboo shafts and eating fish that leap aboard the raft, they make their way across the ocean, well knowing that despite the advanced radio technology of 1936, their chance of rescue in the event of mishap is nil.The only sea book I can think of to rival this for sheer interest and adventure is Verne's &quot;20,000 Leagues under the Sea,&quot; - a fantasy. Heyerdahl's work is true, and his heroic heart shines through in every word. His love and reverence for the ocean and the primitive culture he sought to imitate, combined with his scientific clarity of exposition, make it a joy to read and will instill the sea-lust into even the most devoted landlubber.I think everyone ought to read this book, for sheer pleasure, and as an example of what can be done with stout heart, clear head, and good will. I recommend it to you without any reservation."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"\\"Kon Tiki\\" is one of the great adventure stories of all time. In 1947, six young Norwegians floated in a balsa-wood raft from Peru to the Polynesian islands of the South Seas. The trip took them 101 days and they traveled 4,300 nautical miles across the Pacific without seeing a single other boat or ship. Only occasionally were they able to communicate with the outside world by radio, and the possibility of rescue should their primitive raft sink or break up in the heavy seas they often experienced was slim to none.The journey was inspired by the theories of Thor Heyerdahl who speculated that the ancient civilizations of Peru had floated across the Pacific to reach the Polynesian islands. Scoffed at by scientists, Heyerdahl organized the expedition to prove that a raft crossing of the Pacific was possible. It was a foolhardy stunt -- but makes for a great story.\\"Kon Tiki\\" tells the story of the expedition from beginning to the end when the crew of the raft is marooned on an idyllic paradise isle in the South Pacific. Rereading the book after many years, I was most impressed with how isolated and empty the Pacific Ocean was and how unexploited was its sea life in 1947. I fear that such is no longer the case.Heyerdahl's theories of oceanic migrations from the Americas to Polynesia are still pooh-baahed by archaeologists today, although it seems that the sweet potato by some means made it from Peru to Polynesia in pre-historic times. Whatever your opinion may be regarding Heyerdahl as a scientist the story of the \\"Kon Tiki\\" is unique and original.

In and of itself this statement alone is high praise for any book since I have only done that a few times prior. The story grabbed me hopelessly, only to release me upon it's unwelcome finale. Even then my psyche was thoroghly unwilling to release the warm embrace of Kon Tiki's quest into the primitive and yet tranquil oneness with our world's awesome power and beauty. &quot;Whether it was 1947 B.C. or A.D. suddenly became of no significance. We lived, and that we felt with alert intensity. We realized that life had been full for men before the technical age also--in fact, fuller and richer in many ways than the life of modern man. Time and evolution somehow ceased to exist; all that was real and that mattered were the same today as they had always been and would always be.

Then Kon-Tiki by Thor Heyerdahl is the book for you. Kon-Tiki is about a few explorers that wanted to prove that the inhabitants of a certain island in the Pacific came from Peru. The explorers start off at Peru, build a raft, and set off to prove their theory on their 2000-mile journey. On their trip they discover interesting things about sea life. They encountered whales, dolphins, sharks and other amazing creatures of the sea on their journey and learned a few things about them. One of my favorite parts about this book is when the explorers catch their food and interact with some of the sea creatures. They use the resources around them to catch their food and discover that living at sea is not as boring as it seems. This is one of the best books of its time. It has every thing to make you enjoy the story. Kon-Tiki will make you laugh and make you nervous. It will keep you in suspense and you will discover amazing things about the sea."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"Early in \\"Kon-Tiki,\\" as Thor Heyerdahl and his compatriots are a assembling a make-shift raft to float across the Pacific, a government official calls Heyerdahl to his office.\\"Are your parents living?\\" the official asks.Yes, says Heyerdahl.\\"Your mother and father will be very grieved when they hear of your death,\\" says the official.It was a reasonable assumption. What Heyerdahl and his five Norwegian friends were proposing was beyond audacious -- it was foolhardy, by any standard. Here were six young men, none with sailing experience, who were building their own Inca-style raft out of balsa logs and hemp ropes and planning to sail it across thousands of miles of ocean from Peru to the South Seas.Surely, they would die.Of course, they didn't. For over 100 days, the Kon-Tiki bobbed along like a cork in high and low seas making slow but steady progress before eventually landing the men on an island in French Polynesia. In doing so, Heyerdahl, an anthropologist, had made his case that it was possible that the South Sea islands had been populated by immigrants floating on rafts from South America.It was a remarkable accomplishment, and while it is a tale imperfectly told, \\"Kon-Tiki\\" is quite worth reading.This is a book where the events carry the writing. For the most part, Heyerdahl does an able job of presenting the story, but he curiously skips over some parts. For instance, he doesn't explain clearly why he allowed the voyage to begin by having the Kon-Tiki towed out of port and many miles out to sea. After all, wasn't the point of the expedition to show that the raft could make it all the way on its own? (There may have been a good reason -- perhaps to avoid shipping traffic -- but he doesn't say what it is.)Because the trip actually turned out to be easier than expected, the middle section becomes somewhat flat. The crew had plenty of fish to eat, and collected rain water to drink. They found ways to make the craft easy to steer.Also, while Heyerdahl is detailed in his descriptions of the fish they saw while crossing the ocean, he fails to illuminate the personalities of his five crewmates. Even by the end of the book, they remained indistiguishable in my mind.These are weaknesses, yes, but hardly fatal ones, and the overall boldness of this adventure is what carries this book. There are exciting moments -- when one of the men falls overboard and is nearly lost, and when the Kon-Tiki dramatically crashes into a reef at the end of its voyage. And the crew's short stay on an island inhabited by just 127 villagers is memorable for its idyllic picture of the South Seas lifestyle."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"Although the middle part of this book drags (which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5), I was really satisfied when I finished reading this book. I was on vacation in Oslo and had visited the Kon-Tiki museum. I had never heard of Thor Heyerdahl before, but from what I saw at the museum, I was very fascinated and intrigued by the story of his trip across the Pacific on a balsa-wood raft. The week I came home I immediately started reading this book, and I was not disappointed. I was really fascinated by the accounts of interaction with sea animals, whales, sharks, dolphins, etc. that I immediately wanted to go sailing on a wide open sea in order to see all these exotic animals that Heyerdahl and his crew encountered. This book allows you to live vicariously and experience three months worth of sailing on a raft in the Pacific Ocean. This is a definite read for the sea lovers and travelers out there in the world who yearn for adventure."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"The voyage of the Kon-Tiki ranks as one of the great adventures of ourera. But was Heyerdahl's journey that of a &quot;luckyadventurer&quot; whose theories could be justly dismissed as&quot;junk science&quot; by the archaeological establishment? Or didhis knowledge that the seas were virtual conveyor belts unveil thepossibility that ancient peoples were not limited to migration overland bridges but could more easily have voyaged in rafts over openseas? Tom Dillehay's dating of the Monte Verde site in Chile to 12,500years ago -- hundreds of years before the Mackenzie corridor openedthe remote possibility of Beringia (dry Bering Sea) migration -- seemsto have driven a stake into the theory that man first migrated by landto the Americas. Now paleontologist Walter Neves has revealed that a11,500-year-old skull from central Brazil (&quot;Luzia&quot;) has theround eyes, large nose and pronounced chin characteristic ofAustralian aborigines and native Africans.

Heyerdahl's other works such as &quot;Fatu-Hiva,&quot; and &quot;Aku-Aku&quot; are also rousing stories of his real-life exploits.

It sets man against sea, thin odds against practical ingenuity, conventional academic thought against the independent thinker. This four thousand mile journey across barren, treacherous seas can't help but inspire the would-be adventurer. The adventurers' single mindedness and determination, in the face of naysaying world experts (who said they would never succeed, and that their boat would sink at mid-sea), shows how determination and perseverance can lead to accomplishing what some may view as impossible goals, and in so doing it pushes the boundaries and commonplace notions of what is possible. We see that not all adventurous fools and are so foolish; that determination can see one across a massive barren and stormy ocean, real or metaphorical. On completing the book, all that remains is for the reader to respond to its call for adventure and begin plans for achieving personal goals or adventures ... all the tools needed for accomplishment are demonstrated in this voyage. In a corporate world where too often money is the primary force in leading us to act, where the value of an activity is measured by its potential financial payback, it is refreshing to be reminded of other motivations for action, and of other rewards. Can this book reawaken a spirit of adventure which may seem irrelevant to modern social or commercial life? Can it remind us how to dream and the virtues of following our dreams? I am reminded in these pages how, why, and where I can find adventure ... one walks away from the book convinced that anything is possible, should I choose to look beyond conventional thought or lifestyle and reach for the stars."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"I finished this book a few months after Heyerdahl's grandson completed his own Kon-Tiki adventure taking the path of his grandfather from Peru to the South Sea Islands on a balsa wood raft.

This is a wonderfully clear read for all ages and a self-portrait of a good, decent, brave man who did something because he knew it could be done.The highlights for me are the descriptions of the marine life Heyerdahl and his five compatriots encounter on their trip, including the massive blue shark whale, the dolphins, and the playful flying fish. The \\"homecoming,\\" in which the six Scandinavians are welcomed by the Polynesian people in an elaborate ceremony, is also delightful and a wonderful way to conclude the adventure.KON-TIKI deserves its classic status and should be read by anyone looking to see how resillient the human spirit (and body, for that matter) really is."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"Kon-Tiki is the story of some Scandinavians who sail across the Pacific in an Incan raft made of balsa, in order to lend credence to a cultural-diffussionist theory hypothesized by the author and leader of the \\"adventure,\\" Thor Heyerdahl.

However, the voyage does not prove Heyerdahl's theory.) The book goes into great detail describing the encounters of the crew onboard out on the open ocean including an encounter with a whale shark, a rare Gempylus, circling dolphins, flying fish so abundant that they fly onto the raft's deck whereupon they can be gathered for food, whales, and sharks.

Heyerdahl wanted to prove it possible for ancient Peruvians to colonize various Pacific islands, and managed instead to prove man's ability to realize the impossible fortified with little more than bravery. As feats go, it's a little like missing the Moon and landing on Mars. No one would remember the Kon-Tiki 65 years after its voyage, or spoken about it in classrooms around the world for two generations, if it had achieved a mere scientific objective.As a literary endeavor, \\"Kon-Tiki\\" the book leaves me somewhat flat. Published in 1948, one year after the expedition itself, it's an adventure story in which adventure is nearly entirely absent apart from the fact Heyerdahl and his companions are on this creaking raft in the first place. Other than early steering troubles on the Pacific's unforgiving Humboldt Current, a rough encounter with a whale shark, a close shave with another shark, and a wave-ripped landing, all described in a curious, detached way, what we get is a fairly placid ride. There are arresting observations of oceanic life, especially as the Kon-Tiki becomes a kind of lifeform itself, with crabs and barnacles finding safe harbor in its wood, plants growing around its edges, and pilot fish swimming in formation beneath. But there are many lulls in the story, too.What was it like for six men traveling in such close quarters and such uncertain circumstances? \\"No two of these men had men before, and they were all of entirely different types,\\" Heyerdahl states early on, warning of \\"the danger of psychological cloudburst\\" there. But nothing more is ever stated about the interpersonal relations aboard the Kon-Tiki; we don't even get to know any of these Norwegians (and one Swede) well enough to tell them apart beyond their names.The book does make a strong case for the fortitude of man, whether ancient or modern, provides some fine nature writing, and occasional gleamings of welcome humor. Heyerdahl makes a strong case for his belief in Mesoamerican settlement of the Pacific islands, even if his voyage doesn't prove anything. [The Kon-Tiki not only required towing out to sea but made an inauspicious landfall if one is to believe in the viability of his theory.] More than anything, it's time well spent with an interesting group of men doing a rather incredible thing, even if they were more impressed with the theory behind it than the feat itself."},{"Title":"The Kon-Tiki Expedition","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Kon-Tiki by Thor Heyerdahl.

Instead, I found an introduction to ants with little style, and techniques of control that are easily (and more cheaply) found in articles on the web or in magazines -- techniques such as keeping your kitchen counters free of food, buying ant baits at the store, and hiring a professional when the invasion gets bad.The book notes that it's important to know the species of ants~~ in order to control them, but it fails to provide sufficient detail about each species to determine what type are in your home. The book also fails to distinguish between species in its recommendations for control.The text is scant and padded with similarly high-level (and thus not terribly useful) information about other pest insects.~"},{"Title":"Outwitting Ants","review":"This books answer on how to get ants out of your house is to call an exterminator.

Save yourself a couple of bucks and Google \\"ants\\"."},{"Title":"Outwitting Ants","review":"This is one of the best ant books I know of for the general public. Ants are typically regarded negatively as \\"pests\\" for a number of reasons, but rarely are ants in or around the home or yard a serious problem.Pest control businesses and companies that manufacture and sell insecticides have made fortunes on people's fears and misunderstanding of ants. Consequently, far too many people assume that every ant is bad and needs to be doused in poisons. This is absolutely untrue. Although a few species of ants can be a nuisance (sometimes serious)in the house, even ants that may enter the home can usually be controlled through I.P.M (Integrated Pest Management) which in this case is a fancy way of saying A.C.H. or keeping A Clean Home.Outwitting Ants provides tons of useful information on ants, primarily because it is a book that helps the average person understand ants without having to take a course in insect science. Outwitting Ants gives a rational, sane perspective on the ant/human interface by shedding light on the behavior of ants and and explaining the profound ecological value of ants.Any book on a widely misunderstood insect that makes many people unnecessarily spray toxic chemicals (many of these widely available products are proven to have adverse effects on humans and animals in very small doses)is a book to be valued.Before you reach for the spray, buy this book. Outwitting Ants is an easy-to-read, fun little book that anyone can enjoy and learn from.

I like to read business stories. The author's goal was to teach the reader about investing in bankrupt companies and the method used was with detailed narratives of past deals. This was perfect for what I wanted.The book went into great detail about the hierarchy of security claims and how they work in bankruptcy. The examples showed how the investor classes work with and against each other in bankruptcy and the roles the b/k judge and attorneys played. With many different narratives the reader is able to see different outcomes and the extreme risks and rewards involved in this type investing.The book's main focus was on the personalities involved in buying distressed debt and then trying to influence the b/k process mainly through the courts but sometimes in prepackaged b/ks.In summary, I learned a lot and enjoyed the stories also.

Topics include: investing in distressed debt; the reorganization process under Chapter 11; the contests for control between conflicting classes/interests in the reorganization process.But, the book doesn't cover these topics in mere textbook fashion. Rather, it introduces us to some of the most famous vulture investors of all time and provides exciting narratives of their significant investment successes and failures. The cast of characters is fascinating. One ends up with a very good feel for the type of personality needed to work in this field: financial/legal wizard who combines the ferocity and tenacity of a wolverine with the haggling skills of a hat merchant from the garment district.One of the most famous of the vulture investors is Marty Whitman, whose book &quot;Value Investing: A Balanced Approach&quot; forms an invaluable companion text to this book. &quot;Value Investing&quot; provides the theoretical underpinnings; &quot;Vulture Investors&quot; shows the theories in action."},{"Title":"The Vulture Investors: The Winners and Losers of the Great American Bankruptcy Feeding Frenzy","review":"What a great read!

Here we're talking of the fruits of meditation, the work of the Soul, so to speak. In this book Alice Bailey explains the mental training we have all experienced, both in the East and in the West, due to our education and socialization. We have been using our brains the way society wants us to use them...without having access to the truths that we can discover by using the brain in meditation so that Universal Truths may be recognized as they are. A good primer for learning meditation, FROM INTELLECT TO INTUITION brings us through the stages and helps us make the necessary mental and emotional adjustments, albeit with practice and not only with reading."},{"Title":"From intellect to intuition","review":"Alice Bailey wrote this book under the tutelage of the Master Djwhal Khul (the Tibetan), a Master of the spiritual &quot;Hierarchy&quot;, headed by the Christ. These books comprise genuine, albeit advanced teachings about the Ancient Wisdom (this book however was written by Alice Bailey herself, and is a good introduction/less complex).Spiritual advancement can be expedited by these teachings to those willing and able to learn and grow spiritually. Most of what we know and have been taught about spirituality, the after-life, God, angels, souls, and spiritual evolution is basically erroneous information (analagous to children realizing their is no santa claus or easter rabbit when the higher truth is revealed). This has been further distorted by misguided zealots of all faiths, who accept as dogma the distorted and biased teachings of man-made theologies, and not the one true universal Religion of the Ancient Wisdom (as revealed in the Bailey books). The spiritual truth and reality has been kept alive (besides the Ancient Wisdom) by the mystics and secret esoteric shools throughout the ages. However, even they only have portions of the whole spiritual truth. if you read the Alice Bailey books and are unable to comprehend them fully, another (intermediate) area of study is recommended- Rosicrucian/AMORC (800 88-AMORC).Also recommend reading (besides all the Alice Bailey books)- Vera Stanley Alder; Zachary Lansdowne; Douglas Baker; Cecil A.

Otherwise it is badly dated, verbose and written in the absurd over-earnest manner that makes a great deal of esoteric literature hard to tolerate.The prescribed method is a prayer-mantra, the effectiveness of which depends on the intensity of one's religious convictions. In short, meditation works best for the true believer. Mrs Bailey seems blissfully unaware that people without any religious faith whatsoever can attain - via an entirely secular mantra - exactly the same inner freedom.The most serious flaw is Bailey's proselytising in the final chapters. She dishonestly uses quotes from the great mystics (that she has used appropriately in the book to this point) to suggest they agree with her own eccentric cosmological and theological views.Buyer beware!"},{"Title":"Caleb's Curse","review":"Hands down one of the best books I have read.

Dr Eriksen is a professor of Social Anthropology, and therefore the book is written more or less on an academic style and perspective. It covers most possible aspects: kinship, gender and age, politics and power, local organisation, religion and rituals, nationality and minorities, etc. In addition it contains brief biographies of the most important Anthropologists, quotes and references of Anthropologists and other renown Sociologists (Durkheim, Weber, Marx, etc.) as well as numerous examples and case studies -both from &quot;traditional&quot; and &quot;modern&quot; societies- relevant each time on the topic concerned. I believe apart from being informative, it is a highly stimulative book catapulting the reader with food for thought.

Hsu's groundbreaking work-- the first ethnographic survey to simultaneously study three different forms of medical education-- is an anthropological examination of the various ways in which both ancient and modern Chinese medical knowledge is spread (or alternatively, withheld) in modern times. It is definitely not something I would have picked up on my own or read for fun; but I certainly found it interesting in the context of learning about Chinese medical anthropology, particularly as Hsu intersperses her more abstract epistemological conclusions with first person observation of real Chinese medical practitioners and interesting background on the medical tradition itself.The Transmission of Chinese Medicine is divided into three parts that reflect the three different modes of knowledge transmission that characterize Chinese medical education: the secret mode of transmission, the personal mode of transmission, and the standardized mode of transmission. In each section, Hsu calls on her personal experiences as an ethnographer and her observations of each of the modes of transmission. In her section on the secret transmission of knowledge, she cites her observations of the qigong practitioner, Qiu and his interactions with his brother-in-law and disciple, Qiudi. In the personal transmission chapters Hsu cites her own experience as a student in the class of Doctor Zhang where she participated first-hand in the personal, interpretative transmission of knowledge. Finally, the standardized transmission section is comprised of Hsu's interpretations of the formal interviews and surveys she conducted, as well as her own observations of medical education at the Yunnan TCM College. Each section is further subdivided into headings giving further information of interest on a procedural level, as well as thematic and subject headings which break the wealth of observation into digestibly packaged information bytes. In this way Hsu makes main points easily understandable by packaging each conclusion within the context of its supporting observation.The Transmission of Chinese Medicine is, in short, a lucid and insightful foray into the way in which the different modes of transmission of Chinese medical knowledge affect the way in which Chinese medicine is understood as a system, a tradition, and a modern medical force. I recommend it to anyone with a serious interest in the field."},{"Title":"The Quotable Feline","review":"As a lover of cats and the written meaning of words, this book is extraordinary.The contents express the true thought of the cat, plus the siteful interpretation, of man, thru photograph and word.The strength of picture and meaning leap at you, as you turn the pages.

The book's focus on Muslims, who comprise the largest minority in both Britain and Europe, is an added plus. The book comes out in a time many Western analysts discuss the future of Western Muslims. Modood takes the discussion beyond Europe to include comparisons with the situation in the United States.Modood broadens the discussion of multiculturalism to include a focus on secularism. He argues that \\"fundamentalist\\" secularist ideology that is anti-religion has had an adverse impact on the treatment of religious minorities. As a result, Muslims for example have faced stagnation in upward mobility. The current challenge to Britian's treatment of its Muslims is to assure that these new Britons are able to advance like their white Christian cohorts. The alternative, of course, is the emergence of a second-class citizenry group.The irony of this bleak prospect is that is has been enhanced despite a growing participation of the new minorities, particularly Muslims, in British and other European public discourses. Modood argues that this Muslim assertiveness should lead to a rethinking of what pluralism means in today's European societies. The new thinking must include a fresh look at the secular state as it attempts to offer greater inclusion for religious minorities. Here Modood opens up a new line of inquiry that integrates sociology and political science. Multicultural Politics is a must reading for those who are serious about considering the status of minorities in the new Europe and the future of Islam in the West."},{"Title":"Multicultural Politics: Racism, Ethnicity, and Muslims in Britain (Contradictions of Modernity)","review":"Multicultural Politics is a VERY worthwhile read. Modood challenges traditional conceptions of identity and racism by exploring the experience of South Asian Muslims in Britain. He seeks to achieve an understanding of society that is \\"anchored in the comprehension of agents themselves.\\" The most persistent voice is his own, which infuses his arguments with the passion of a child whose \\"privileged middle-class life\\" in Pakistan was disrupted by his family's immigration to Britain in 1961.After analyzing ethnic statistics in Britain, Modood argues that the divide is not a black-white divide but \\"a divide between white, Chinese, African Asian, and Indian men on the one hand, and Bangladeshi, Pakistani, and Caribbean men on the other.\\" Referencing the 20% of whites under 35 who admitted to being prejudiced against Asians in the 1986 Survey Report, Modood argues that this prejudice is primarily against Muslims and that \\"cultural racism\\" exists in tandem with and often as a second step to \\"color racism.\\" While a quarter of whites attend a place of worship at least once a month, two-thirds of Muslims attend at least once a week. These statistics form the basis of Modood's claim that the movement to eliminate color racism excluded Asians by lumping them into the \\"black\\" category with which they could not identify.\\"In locating oneself within a hostile society,\\" Modood writes, \\"one must begin with one's mode of being, not one's mode of oppression.\\" Modood cites evidence of Britain's \\"hostile society\\" in the BNP, adverse immigration laws, and \\"Paki-bashing\\" in the police force when Muslims confront the highest level of attacks on person and property. He also alleges discrimination against Muslims in education and employment. Muslims are underrepresented in prestigious jobs, and a BBC Radio experiment discovered that identical CVs submitted to 50 firms yielded interviews for 23% of applicants with white names compared to 9% with Muslim names. Modood also points to indirect discrimination that favors locals, requires work on Friday's, or frowns upon Muslim dress. However, he rejects Rex's theory that ethnicity is artificially determined by group conflict and Smith's theory that it is formed by resistance to oppression. Ethnicity is not, as Miles contends, a \\"false doctrine\\" and it is not \\"voluntary,\\" as Banton suggests. Modood asserts that real collectivities exist, and defines them through five dimensions, including \\"cultural distinctiveness\\" and \\"identity.\\"He extends this analysis by arguing for a \\"state policy of multiculturalism\\" that views the country as more than a liberal association of autonomous individuals. He asserts the \\"positive right\\" of minorities to \\"share in the public domain, including law, in order to live by communal values even where those values run counter to majority values and lifestyles.\\" While criticizing the effective \\"establishment\\" of Anglicanism in the British constitution, he argues that radical secularism also privileges the dominant ethnic group by forcing minorities to follow its normative legal ideal. Instead he proposes a \\"plural state,\\" which recognizes both communities and individuals as actors and gives the former \\"a formal representation or administrative role\\" to play in the state, thereby offering a holistic emotional identity.Modood's proposal fails to take Islam's pluralism into account. The very act of \\"institutionalizing some public space for religions\\" runs contrary to his fluid concept of identity. Modood asserts that he does not believe in \\"discrete, bounded populations of cultural absolutes\\" and expects a group to \\"change, develop, adopt, borrow, and synthesize\\". His proposal would marginalize minorities within Islam by creating a formal dialogue in the public sphere. Who will represent the Shi'a? Who will represent the 50% of Muslims who do not approve of state-funding for parochial schools or the youth who continue to identify with Islam without speaking South Asian languages, attending a mosque, or having arranged marriages?A second cause for concern lies in Modood's definition of incitement to religious hatred. He compares the statement \\"Jesus Christ was a homosexual\\" with \\"Prophet Muhammad was a lewd, dishonest, dissembling power seeker\\" and concludes that the former is permissible but that the latter isn't because it criticizes a belief that is \\"part of the primary self-identification of a group.\\" By forcing speech to contribute to \\"constructive dialogue,\\" Modood places speech under subjective control. This act is a slippery slope to stifling academic inquiry. The ability of subversives within a religion to challenge the ascendant interpretation is essential to its fluid identity. Like his call for a \\"plural state,\\" restricting offensive speech hardens the boundaries of identity that Modood ostensibly prefers remain \\"soft.\\""},{"Title":"Maryland Basketball: Tales from Cole Field House","review":"This book presents a history of University of Maryland basketball, with profiles of it's most outstanding players and coaches, from the prospective of Cole Field House -- Maryland's decades-old and recently-replaced basketball venue.

Unfortunately for her, the year she turns thirteen is 1940, when the Nazis are in France. On September first, her birthday, her parents send her away to live with her Aunt Josephine in the country because they think she will be safer there than in Paris. Lisette is not happy about going there, partly because she thinks here parents don't want her, and partly because she hates her cousin, Cecile. When she arrives at Aunt Josephine's house, she finds out her aunt is hiding Jews and Gypsies and there is a ghost in the woods. I liked this book because the story is told with a lot of detail. When you read this book, you almost feel like you are there with the characers in the story."},{"Title":"A Coming Evil","review":"This is my favourite of all the Vivian Vande Velde books I've read so far...and that's saying something! I loved it. Once I started it, I couldn't put it down. I really felt for Lisette and the awful situation she found herself in, being sent away during wartime without her parents, banished to the south of France to live with not only her aunt, but also her bratty control-freak of a cousin and a motley collection of strange children that her aunt had given refuge to. It seemed to her as if her life could not get any worse...and yet it did, and she was forced to take action...Lisette is a wonderful, brave, intelligent heroine who I found utterly believable and likeable. The other characters in the book are similarly realistic, multi-dimensional and compelling, and in the end, even the bratty cousin was redeemed by her bravery and compassion for others. These are ordinary people being forced to deal with extraordinary situations, and the author never loses sight of their human strengths and weaknesses. Such was the utter realism of this story that I had no trouble accepting the paranormal side of this tale--a ghost coming to life through his interaction and friendship with Lisette.I liked the way the author made comparisons between the way the Knights Templar were treated in medieval times, and the way the people of France were treated by the Nazis. It's a stirring reminder that even though centuries may pass, unfortunately people don't necessarily learn from the mistakes and injustices of history...the fight for freedom, for religious and racial tolerance, and for human rights is an ongoing one, even in today's society. Fortunately, though, this book doesn't suffer from any preachiness in teaching us this lesson, but remains a wonderful, quick-paced, exciting read that even people who couldn't care less about history will enjoy.I'd recommend this book to adults as well as kids, not only because of the maturity of its writing, but also because it's just so good!"},{"Title":"A Coming Evil","review":"Vivian Vande Velde turned away from her usual fantasy to produce a sort of ghost story set in WW2. A Coming Evil, while a very readable book, had a number of plot flaws that prevented it from being an excellent one.The plotting around Gerard is especially weak. His unexpected return to life with the appearance of Lisette was given no logical reason and his 'archaic' speech seemed particularly inaccurate. While reading the book, it was almost as though Vivian Vande Velde was just making illogical things happen to service the plot. Apart from the lack of reasonable grounding, the ending (while certainly suspenseful) seemed rushed and abruptly cut off.On the other hand, VVV is excellent at creating the right atmosphere, and the WW2 setting works unexpectedly well with the contrast to Gerard's life. Not bad, but on the whole, if you like historical ghost stories, you're much better off trying Elizabeth Marie Pope's The Sherwood Ring."},{"Title":"A Coming Evil","review":"Vivian Vande Velde is a fantastic writer, but her research leaves something to be desired...A Coming Evil is the story of a young French girl who is sent away from Paris in September, 1940 to her aunt in the country--where she discovers--among other things--that her aunt is hiding Jewish and Gypsy children from the Nazis. Their parents have been deported or are dead. Eventually, with the help of a 14th-Century ghost, the girl realizes that the deportees are all being murdered by the Nazis.Except... in September, 1940, this wasn't happening yet. The Madagascar Plan had been suggested in July, and was still being considered. According to [...], the first deportations of French Jews wouldn't take place until October 22nd, and that would have been from Alsace-Lorraine into Vichy France.Expulsion and immigration were still very much the goal--the mass killings didn't start until 1941, and then in Eastern Europe.And the first deportation of French Jews to Auschwitz? March 27, 1942.I could not put down this novel, a testament to Ms. Vande Velde's talent, but virtually any book giving an overview of the Holocaust would have told her that the \\"Final Solution\\" might have been discussed in Mein Kampf but it wasn't being implemented when this story takes place. The Jews were not being rounded up and deported, so there would have been no reason at all for Aunt Josephine to be hiding them.I'm not sure why this novel couldn't have been set two years later, in 1942. As it is, the errors detract significantly from what is otherwise a compelling story."},{"Title":"A Coming Evil","review":"I visited an author's forum a couple of months ago and I met Vivian Vande Velde. It was really nice because most authors were for young children and there were few authors for teens there. I had a teen with me and he was very interested in Velde's Mordred story. I ended up buying one for myself and one for him. Velde was very nice and one of the easiest to talk to. You could tell there was something very special about her. I have read several books by many of the authors who attended the forum but none have moved me as much as Velde has. Her writing and plot development are superior to many other teen authors. Her stories are moving and well developed. They demand more of the reader in terms of understanding and subtleness but offer a much greater payoff. In A Coming Evil, the story takes place during German Occupation of France. There is a lot in the plot which makes it realistic fiction except for a character of a ghost, a Tectonic Knight from the 14th Century. He guides Lisette through some dangerous situations and does not hide from the fact that Lisette is in real danger. There is no Superman to rescue her. I would think of the book as being somewhat similar to Pan's Labyrinth. Fantasy takes over when the real is too dangerous to even contemplate."},{"Title":"A Coming Evil","review":"Now almost 18, I can still remember taking this book out from my library every week as a 10 and 11-year-old. The juxtaposition of World War II and the Crusades, the relationship between Lisette and Gerard, and the wonderful period details about both eras always kept me coming back for more.The story is so unique that I remembered it eight years later, and googled some key terms in order to find the title and author again. I thoroughly recommend it to any fan of historical fiction, as I was and still am, and anyone interested in studying World War II and the Holocaust NOT from a Jewish perspective, as so often seems to be the case in young adult fiction these days.The story of slightly spoiled Lisette (who eventually matures with the help of Gerard the ghost and the presence of the Jewish and Gypsy children in her aunt's home) and her experiences during World War II really rang true, despite the clearly fictional pretense of a ghost in the backyard! I remember being struck by the concept of what it must have been like to be an everyday person in World War II--not a Nazi, and not a victim, but a bystander--and how difficult it must have been to decide whether or not to take action.The history of the Knights of Templar is also interesting, and while I remember finding it less compelling than the events of the \\"present day\\", it definitely adds to the dimension of the book. I truly recommend this book to any history buff, fan of ghost stories, or even fans of simple coming-of-age stories--\\"A Coming Evil\\" has all of that and more."},{"Title":"A Coming Evil","review":"This is a good book.

Like everything else of hers that I've read, I was DEFINITELY not disappointed by it! Lisette is believable - she's selfish at times, not a perfect little lady.

Now."},{"Title":"Smith and Other Events: Tales of the Chilcotin","review":"Paul St. Pierre does for ranchers in British Columbia what James Herriott does for animals in Yorkshire. He has a knack for turning some of the most insignificant events of daily life into interesting stories. His characters start out as impulsive oddballs, but by the end of the story they become quite rational folks. This is one of those books that sneaks up on you. The first time I read it I thought it was entertaining, but nothing to visit again. But every once in a while one of the characters from the book pops into my mind and I dwell on the character and story for a few days. I usually re-read it every couple of years (I have a worn 1987 edition, now in retirement.)"},{"Title":"Smith and Other Events: Tales of the Chilcotin","review":"When you read enough western literature you regretfully start finding fine books by fine writers that are no longer in print and will no doubt stay that way, which unfortunately is the case with this one. St. Pierre's stories in this collection are just wonderful - wryly humorous and sharply detailed in their understanding of his characters' behavior, motives, and feelings. Set mostly in the Chilcotin of British Columbia, the stories take place in the 1950s and share the same dozen or so characters - ranchers and their families, Indians, a cowboy or two, and a storekeeper. The longest story, \\"How to Run the Country,\\" involves a handful of politicos in Vancouver who persuade a local rancher to run for office. The author, having served a term as a Member of Parliament himself, tells this story with considerable apparent delight as he interweaves the complex ironies of political careers and ambitions.My favorites of the bunch include the premature funeral for an old Indian from the local reservation, the long suffering of a ranch wife who literally spills the beans on her husband, an elderly recluse's long-distance romance with a young woman, a mid-winter trip to town that evolves, thanks to a cowboy's gambling winnings, into a days-long bacchanal in a hotel room, and a husband and wife's indecision about whether to sell the ranch. Smith, the title character, is vividly drawn, perfectly believable, and as likable as he can be obtuse. The others, his wife Norah, sons Sherwood and Roosevelt, Arch McGregor, Morton Dilloughboy and his son Abel, cowboy Henry James, Ol Antoine the Indian patriarch, Frenchie and Frenchie's wife (who gets her own story), and Ken Larsen, whose arch-conservative values are no obstacle to his loyalty to the Liberal Party, all of them are equally memorable. Find a copy, kick off your boots, and enjoy."},{"Title":"Smith and Other Events: Tales of the Chilcotin","review":"Paul St. Pierre is a treasure discovered twenty years ago in Steve Bodio's book review column in GRAY'S SPORTING JOURNAL. St. Pierre was a man of parts, not unlike Roderick Haig-Brown: a life both of letters and public service. For fans of \\"western\\" fiction, a glimpse into the Chilcotin country with be a welcome breath of (cold) fresh air, with memorable unrepentant characters, both native and white, rendered with a sharp eye and sharper wit. I just bought a copy for my cousin, a horseshoer of refined literary tastes, recovering from hip replacement surgery. I envy his titanium-reinforced arse: he gets to read for the first time what I've read many times over in the past two decades. Quote from St. Pierre's website: \\"Likes hunting, bird dogs, fishing, reading and travelling.

The author's skill with descriptions was enough to make me share the heroine's emotions (after listening to all those salmon pushers -- and thank goodness we have only a hint of their burblings -- I'd be wanting to sink my teeth into some beef, too). Beck does as good job with the minor characters as with the main. I admire the way the obnoxious or boring characters were brought to sufficient life that I wanted to sneak away from them. The comments about Americans who try to force their own views on the rest of the world were appreciated.Too bad the woman whose boyfriend dumped her before she got around to dumping him allowed herself to feel depressed. There's no need for that. I've had one of those calls. When the guy asked me if I minded, I referred to his new girlfriend as my savior. (No, that didn't start a feud. They've been married for years and we're all friends.)Sampling an author's work for the first time is always a risk. It's good to be able to say that I didn't waste my money. Ann E.

I have no idea what her house is like, what kinds of clothes she wears, etc. Also, I just did not believe what she was able to accomplish and how much wool she pulled over how many eyes. Also, I prefer when these types of books are in first person. I could then really be in Jane's head and hear her thoughts. Also, a bit too much scenery description.

Read this book and begin your journey to a healthy lifestyle spiritually and physically."},{"Title":"The Fat Demons : Breaking Demonic & Generational Curses","review":"I want to start by stating I was looking for this book for a very long time. It was an extremely hard and rare book to get. Before I bought it off Amazon.com I went to many book-stores only to be told no. I tried ordering it from Borders.com, but was refunded as it was out of print and they were out of stock. I even tried purchasing it via a paypal link from the author herself (and was refunded by paypal because the link I used to buy it was old and out of date). I also contacted publishers and researched the net regularly for any clue to where I could get it. At one point it was over 150 dollars from a 2nd hand seller but eventually I got it for cheaper. After all that trouble, was the book worth it, you ask? I will say both 'yes' and 'no'.The book is self-published through Dr. Hunt's church. According to the blurb she is wife of Pastor Dwayne Hunt of Abundant Grace Fellowship in Memphis, Tennessee. However the church website says Pastor Dwayne is married to a Diane. Unless Dr. E. Marlene Hunt is a pen-name I am quite confused as I don't see how the initial 'E' can stand for Diane.Dr Hunt is also her own editor, graphic designer and cover artist for the book. While I admire her diversity of skills, I feel the book could have used a professional editor as I found many errors and felt the writing style was at times too colloquial. Not that I always minded the chatty style, but still feel it could use some tweaking here and there.Another criticism is that the author sometimes made assumptions or stated information that needed to be referenced/sourced to give it validity. For example on page 19 Hunt states that many US states are known for their culinary excellence and homosexuality rates at the same time. She was attempting to make a connection between the evil spirit responsible for homosexuality and overeating. I am not dismissing what she is saying but feel this could be supported by statistics.Another point is the book is purely theoretical in the sense that it doesn't offer any real life examples of oppression or possession by demons. The author doesn't give any examples of actually casting out demons from a fat person. A better book in that regard isDeliverance from Fat & Eating Disorders (Power for Deliverance Series)by Bill Banks.I wanted this book because I believe weight-gain can have spiritual roots. I don't believe weight is purely a physically matter. I wasn't disappointed with everything in this book. It had many interesting points. Some points in the book really stood out and challenged me which I will share below.-The 'fat' mentioned in the Old Testament is often metaphorical, not literal (e.g. 'the fat of the land').-In the OT the fat of animals was sacrificed to God. \\"All the fat is the Lord's\\". See Leviticus 3:16-17-Hunt suggests the old sacrifice of fat doesn't have to be old any more and advises offering it to God again either by cutting (most) fat completely from the diet or going on a short or long-term fast from fats (including meat and dairy products)-She mentions King Eglon and the Priest Eli who were both physically fat in the bible.-When we are fatter we are better looking and tasting to the Predator. We are also easier, slower targets. Our Enemy the devil is a lion on the prowl for us.-People can be inspired by spiritual entities that cause them to eat.-She mentions that the body creates special cells that use up alcohol, so more alcohol is needed the next time to create the same effect. The same thing happens with caffeine and sugar in cola and chocolate and it's how addictions begin. When you eat more and more junk \`I-like-junk' cells grow in numbers. It creates twice or four times the amount of \`junk-cells' which want to eat. (If this science is true I would like to read more about it).-Many well meaning relatives speak words over you such as \\"If you don't stop eating you'll be as big as a house\\" or \\"Just wait til you get a bit older you won't always be that size.\\"-Fat Prophets are people who prophecy fat over you.-We have dominion over our bodies and can be any size we choose to be.-The spirit of obesity can be 1) Generational - running in families to 3rd and 4th generations 2) Transferred- by contact, association, relationship, marriage 3) Influencing - making suggestions to the victim to follow 4) Oppressive - weighs down by sin or bondage of sin. 5) Possessive - resides with the person all the time.-The spirit of obesity is under the head \`spirit of whoredoms'. Under obesity are many other demons such as Dining Demons, Snack Demons, Chocolate Demons, Eating Demons, Coffee Demons, and Ice Cream Demons.-Whoredoms is a spirit. Under its umbrella is lusts for money, prostitution, adultery, fornication, idolatry, chronic dissatisfaction, and excessive appetite.-The soul has appetite. It hungers, thirsts, desires, wants, pants, and yearns.-Other fat demons include the spirit of bondage, addiction, worries, phobias, anger, unforgiveness, pride, shame, guilt, self-pity, infirmity, alcohol, drugs both prescription and illegal (sorceries), heaviness (depression), chocolate, apathy, slothfulness, procastination, late-nights and crowd-pleasingIt's a really interesting book despite it's flaws. It could be improved with some editing and the incorporation of real-life examples. I also feel the prayers and affirmations she gives could be improved by offering the bible verses that support them. It would also be interesting to have some testimonies of people who have read and been helped by the book included in any future editions."},{"Title":"Microsoft Excel 2004 for Mac Quick Source Guide","review":"There is nothing in this guide you can't pick up from excel itself, though it may be useful to have on hand because it summarizes all of the basic Excel operations like entering data, creating a new worksheet, inserting and deleting text, etc. It does not provide any assistance with functions."},{"Title":"Microsoft Excel 2004 for Mac Quick Source Guide","review":"We loved Excel 2004 for Mac Quick Source Guide so much we got 2!"},{"Title":"Unknown Shore: The Lost History of England's Arctic Colony","review":"This is a tale about an English pirate-turned-explorer who few people have ever heard of, and the establishment of British colony on an Arctic island that is perhaps even less known...but that's short-changing this elaborate true adventure. Bought this one because I liked the author's last book, \\"Jericho,\\" which was a history of a place, but also of archaeology itself and of wave after wave of quirky scientists who came to study the ruins of the famous city. This new book has an even broader sweep, from pre-naval power London where morality always took a back seat to fortune-seeking, to the coast of West Africa where a ship's crew was worth less to investors than a few tons of pepper, to the Czar's palace in Moscow, the roiling North Atlantic and the confusing, ice-packed passages above North America. This is a tale festooned with accurately-drawn characters. The scholarship is so clearly reliable that you know that you're not getting the pop-magazine caricatures of, say, Sebastian Junger's \\"The Perfect Storm.\\" Also, with Ruby's style of examining a place through the eyes of multiple adventurers from several eras, you're getting a deeply-textured tale that makes Krakauer's \\"Into Thin Air\\" seem one-dimensional. And you also get a fun - and often funny - yarn featuring modern reporters in polar bear pants, privateers who seize all shipping - even that of their countrymen - a pompous alchemist, mutual puzzlement as white man meets Inuit, horrific storms at sea, and discussions of the how Queen Elizabeth's sex life affected exploration. By the end, I had not only enjoyed myself but absorbed an extraordinary amount of the FEEL of an era - or two - and a place. In this sense it's also comparable to Patrick O'Brien's seafaring Maturin and Aubrey series."},{"Title":"Unknown Shore: The Lost History of England's Arctic Colony","review":"Robert Ruby's Unknown Shore is a little misleading in its subtitle (The Lost History of England's Arctic Colony) in as much as the history was not quite lost nor was there actually a colony, only the briefest of attempts at a colony in a farcical plan to mine the soil for gold. That said, the book is quite entertaining as it pieces together the story of Martin Frobisher and his ill-fated Elizabethean Arctic adventures and the always fascinating Charles Francis Hall's discovery of the location of Frobisher's Meta Incognita in the nineteenth century. (For a wonderful and full account of Hall, see the very fine Weird and Tragic Shores by C. Chauncey Loomis). The two stories blend fairly well and the author keeps the narrative sparkling along at an entertaining clip. This was a good Arctic read for those addicted to these books and a good place to begin for someone who wants to learn what the addiction to these Arctic books is all about from a book that shows men whose addiction to that cold world ran so much deeper than merely reading about it."},{"Title":"Unknown Shore: The Lost History of England's Arctic Colony","review":"An unfortunately rare example of an eminently readable work of history. Ruby does an outstanding job of setting his story in the context of the times with a modern historian's insight into social and cultural history. This is far more than just another in a series of the latest vogue in Arctic exploration narratives. Through skillful use of his sources, the author brings both his European and Inuit protagonists to life. The reader is left with the haunting image of fragments of a remote Arctic island studding the landscape of a prosaic London suburb as testimony to both the folly and awe-inspiring tenacity of the sixteenth-century explorers. This is fascinating complementary reading for students of the colonization of other areas of the world."},{"Title":"Unknown Shore: The Lost History of England's Arctic Colony","review":"I was very interested in Frobisher Air Base now Iqaluit Airport. My interest centered around the part it played in the US nuclear war plans, early warning, communications and strategic location during the 80s and 90s. First I needed to learn about the history of the area and exploration. Unknown Shore provided that first glimpse of early life and exploration. The cast of characters and the way their names became geographic locations are explained to a lesser degree though.

It could use a few more maps and pictures but I say that for every book I read."},{"Title":"Unknown Shore: The Lost History of England's Arctic Colony","review":"I've read plenty of historical non-fiction. This was an excellent read, good adventure story and importantly, it held my attention better than the last six books I've read.

The book had some interesting little tidbits about Elizabethan courtly life and of course the Inuit then and now. I had no idea the Canadian government i'ded them with a series of numbers and assigned surnames, sad. I guess ours isn't the only government to dehumanize and subjugate indigenous populations."},{"Title":"Unknown Shore: The Lost History of England's Arctic Colony","review":"This is an OK read about the Arctic. There are actually two stories here. The first revolves around English explorer and pirate Martin Forbisher and the second about an American Charles Francis Hall. Forbisher was searching for the northwest passage to China and found what he thought was a passage way and a black stone. Assayers felt the stone could yield a fortune in gold. The passage Forbisher found was a bay and the stone contained little in the way of precious metals. Hall searched for the survivors of an earlier Artic expedition of Franklin. He was disappointed too. What he found were the traces of Forbisher's expedition. Both explorers searched for something that was not there.The book is of interest to those historians who like the explorations of the Arctic and Antarctic. What is facinating is the life of the Inuit or native peoples who inhabit this inhospital land. It was interesting to read of how these people adapted to their environment. The white man may have thought them savages. They were far more civilized than the white man. As stated an OK read about a little known expedition."},{"Title":"Washakie, Chief of the Shoshones","review":"The author of this book, Grace R. Hebard, was a professor and it shows. This is an awkward book to read. She hops around in space and time and that can be quite confusing to someone who doesn't have her familarity with the history of the region.What the book lacks in structure, it more than makes up for with its compelling subject: Chief Washakie. I'm sure that few Americans outside of Wyoming have ever heard Chief Washakie's name, yet his accomplishments as a statesman, unifier and leader of his people is unequalled.He led the Shoshone people through most of the 19th century, into the 20th century. He was a remarkable individual speaking English, French and Shoshone. His charismatic hold on his people only ended when he died in 1900 at the age of 102.One thing that repeatedly struck me is, in the scheme of things, this was so recent. Another aspect that I enjoyed was that Chief Washakie encountered so many of the characters that we identify with the settling of the West: Kit Carson, Scajawea, Jim Bridger and many others.The sensibilites of the times described in this book are not what we expect now, and the author brings contemporary (1930) biases to her interpretation. The updated introduction in this edition tries to alert the reader to some of the biases that influence Hebard's comments.As difficult a read as this book is, I couldn't put it down. As a footnote, Chief Washakie will be memorialized in Statuary Hall the U.S. Capitol in the fall of 2000. He is one of two individuals chosen to represent the spirit of the State of Wyoming."},{"Title":"Washakie, Chief of the Shoshones","review":"This is the first published biography of Chief Washakie, the legendary leader of the Eastern Shoshone Indians, and is reprinted from Grace Raymond Hebard's original edition, \\"Washakie: An Account of Indian Resistance of the Covered Wagon and Union Pacific Railroad Invasions of their Territory \\" (1930). Hebard (1861-1936) was a professor of politcal economy at the University of Wyoming and became enamoured of Chief Washakie and the Shoshones during the early 1900s. Her book is basically an unstructured anecdotal read that jumps around in time and place.I used her as a resource in my own book, \\"People of the Wind River: The Eastern Shoshones, 1825-1900,\\" but only with great care and corroborating evidence. Hebard's sources were sons of Chief Washakie (including Dick, Charles, and George Washakie, all of whom were paid informants), the Reverend John Roberts (Episcopal priest on the Wind River Reservation from 1883-1948), Fincellius G. Burnett (Wind River agency farmer & ancestor of former Wyoming Senator Alan Simpson), and retired Indian agents and Army officers who had personal contact with Washakie. She also relied on some of the published annual reports of the Office of Indian Affairs (forerunner of the current Bureau of Indian Affairs).That said, Hebard reveals family stories and legends about Washakie and often quotes verbatim from published government documents. Hers is a good introduction to the the famous chief and his people, but should be read with a cautionary eye. It is not a biography in the modern or scholarly sense, but functions more as remembrances of a cherished relative. Many of the events or actions attributed to Washakie by Hebard cannot be substantiated with other archival evidence and thus her work borders on hagiography. On the other hand, the very fact that such stories exist are testimony to the impact Chief Washakie had on those who knew him. He was a fascinating individual, leader, and statesperson during a difficult time of transition for the Eastern Shoshones."},{"Title":"Washakie, Chief of the Shoshones","review":"Well researched and referenced, this history of Shoshone Chief Washakie during the 1800s provides valuable historic insight into his contributions to his own people and to pioneer Euro-Americans moving into Northwestern territories at that time."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Copenhagen","review":"As with the only other Sally O'Brian authored-guide that I've used (for Sydney, Australia), this guide leaves much to be desired.

The vivid descriptions of the key players caused me to seek their biographies. If I were a history teacher I would make this book required reading as a worthwhile overview of the period. One aspect of our revolution that has always intrigued me is the role France played. Without the infusion of French gold, weapons and eventually direct military assistance our revolution would not of succeeded. This point has been sadly overlooked, downplayed or \\"forgotten\\" by the casual survey courses taught in High School. This book clearly make the point that without France we may still be part of the British Empire. Highly recommended as an engaging introduction to the military and political events that resulted in America's independence from England."},{"Title":"Homeland","review":"When I picked up this book I was intrigued with his concept of a journey across the country to document the changes in American consciousness since 9/11.I was startled and enthused as Maharidge uncovered the underpinnings of various and diverse, highly charged, emotional crosscurrents affecting the nation.His dedication begins, \\"To the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights . . .\\" So it is no surprise that parts of the book focus on the repression of opinions differing from mainstream conservative. Many accounts cover intimidation and lost jobs. But Maharidge doesn't stop there; he searches out and interviews both sides for their stories, which underneath have common threads.Maharidge digs deeper than the surface tensions of neo-conservatives versus liberals, to address the economic crisis that has been building in the country for the last 30 years; the emotions of which, September 11 catalyzed to the surface in deeply divided positions in America.The book is full of information, and reveals more controversial actions taken by the current administration after 9/11, such as the destroying of gun purchase records, (supported by the NRA) after the FBI had begun to find correlations to terrorists in the records.He sets to rights such misquotes as, \\"my country, right or wrong.\\" The correct quote, actually spoken by Carl Schurz, a U. S. Senator in 1899, goes: \\"Our country, right or wrong. When right, to be kept right; when wrong, to be put right.\\"In the last part of the book, Maharidge points out some parallels between the U.S. today, and W.W.II Germany, and actions taken by Hitler. While there are some similarities, he says the comparison is by no means exact, but it is worth taking note of.All in all an engrossing and educational read that peels back the layers of extremism dividing the country, to expose common struggles and concerns."},{"Title":"Homeland","review":"Dale Maharidge and Michael Williamson's \\"Homeland\\" is the best book of 2004, and one of the most important nonfiction works ever published about the United States.Maharidge travels through the United States observing the ways in which the attacks of 9/11/2001 have changed America and Americans. Many of these changes are obvious, but others are more subtle. With the seasoned eye of a trained reporter, Maharidge picks up on these changes and analyzes them with an amazing degree of insight. His conversations with ordinary Americans around the country reveal the different ways -- many of them downright scary -- in which the USA has changed over the last few years.Much of the book deals with neo-McCarthyism and the distressing willingness of many Americans to give up their constitutionally-protected freedoms after 9/11. Maharidge chronicles many recent attacks on the Bill of Rights by local governments, the federal government, and \\"concerned citizens\\" alike. He also details the ways in which the 9/11 attacks fueled the latent racism that many Americans feel toward Muslims, resulting in tragedies like the white mob that attacked a Chicago-area mosque on the evening after the attacks.Maharidge makes no secret of his left-wing perspective, but that doesn't mean this book is a political tract. On the contrary, he bends over backwards to be fair and non-judgmental toward the people he interviews, even when he's talking with white supremacists and other unsavory characters. Maharidge has his own opinion, but thankfully, he also has a genuine desire to understand events from the perspective of those who differ from him politically.Michael Williamson's photographs are also superb, as usual. Whether it's a telling shot of weary workers riding home in a subway car, or a shot of racist white motel owners trumpeting that their establishment is \\"owned by Americans,\\" Williamson's photos poignantly capture the America that exists today.This book takes you to places where the places mainstream media refuses to go, and covers issues that most so-called \\"reporters\\" would never touch with a 10-foot pole. With the 2004 election coming up, now is the most important time for Americans to understand and act upon the issues Maharidge discusses in this book. Do yourself a favor: If you read only one book this year, make it this one. Few more important works have ever been published."},{"Title":"Homeland","review":"&quot;Homeland&quot; is Dale Maharidge's best work to date, and he's done a lot of wonderful work over the years. His research is thorough-going, his connection with his subjects is spot-on, and his anecdotes are insightful. &quot;Homeland&quot; is much more than a prosaic string of interviews. Maharidge threads them masterfully and meaningfully to draw revealing and often frightening conclusions.

It mostly recounts politically-relevant news happening in the 2-3 years after 9/11. There is very little focus on the economic troubles of families existing before 9/11 (as promised in the book summary). The first 1/3 of the book follows the trial of Katie, a high-school student. The other 2/3s of the book simply relate loosely connected interviews and news reports with very little insight that can't be gained by looking around the internet. Even the white supremacist who was interviewed is given only a very shallow description, and this person, whom the author calls a \\"failed product\\" of US society, is actually remarkably similar to the hero Katie in some respects. The author seems to be heavily influenced by internet media and opinions. I would recommend this book to people in other countries who have a hard time understanding the presence of US nationalism after 9/11. For the most part, though, it is not particularly insightful or unique."},{"Title":"Homeland","review":"This book offers a good look at the rise of nationalism in this country after 9/11. The stories of dissenters offer a peak into this country's fear of non-Christian foreigners. Couple this fear with racial prejudice, ignorance of history, ignorance of non-Christian religions and an economic shift from middle class paying manufacturing jobs to low paying service jobs and you get a society primed to follow an authoritarian leadership that offers a source for the public to vent it's anger. Non-Christian foreigners become the enemy and anyone that does not blindly follow the government's message becomes ostracized from the society with labels like \\"liberal\\" or \\"unpatriotic\\".The author also makes comparisons between post 9/11 America and the period before the rise of Hitler. His theme is: when a country faces economic uncertainty they tend to follow more authoritarian leadership and an event like 9/11 can be exploited by the authoritarian leadership to instill fear and a sense of security through blind faith and loyalty to the government. Many call it patriotism because it makes them feel good, but it is more accurately defined as nationalism. The real stories of teachers, students, lawyers, etc. offer some unique insight into the post 9/11 culture and what \\"freedom\\" means to many American's when they feel threatened."},{"Title":"Homeland","review":"I read most of the book last night and was disturbed by several things - The author deliberately blurs the line between \\"Arab\\" and \\"Muslim.\\" He calls non-Arabs \\"whites,\\" and makes whites sound like low class, trailer trash, uneducated red necks. Aren't Arabs white? I was offended that he mentioned Danny Thomas as an example of all the fine Arab people who have come to US to find a better life. Yes, Danny Thomas was Arab, but not a Muslim. Maharidge quotes an Arab comedian as saying that there's so much discrimination against Arabs. But unless they point out that they are an Arab, how would one even know? How can you treat someone different, unless they point out how different they are?I have personal involvement in two of the stories quoted in the book, and know that facts presented are incorrect. I think it's grossly incompetent and irresponsible for an author to present a work of nonfiction without verifying his information.Knowing that some of the facts are wrong, I would look at the rest of the book with reservation. Maharidge treats those he perceives to be the underdog with sympathy, but paints those who speak against them as ignorant, uneducated bigots.Maharidge's premise that contemporary America dangerously resembles the Weimar Republic, or \\"Heimat,\\" that led to Nazi Germany is an oversimplification of the current government of the US. This proposition is deliberately anti-administration, inflamatory, and a grab for publicity."},{"Title":"Quest for Justice: A Compendium of Statements of the United States Catholic Bishops on the Political and Social Order, 1966-1980 (487p)","review":"This book contains statements from the USCCB from the period when they never found a left wing cause they did not love.

As such, the authors witnessed the emergence of many new democracies. The authors knew, however, that there was more to democratic systems than simply structures and formal institutions. The authors felt that aside from the creation of democratic institutions, it was necessary that a political culture that supports democratic ideals also emerge. Almond and Verba defined this necessary cultural subtype as civic culture, a \\"culture based on communication and persuasion, a culture of consensus and diversity, a culture that permitted change but moderated it\\" (8).The purpose of The Civic Culture is to quantify the ideals and attitudes which compose the civic culture of \\"operating democratic systems\\" (11). By doing so, the authors believe that the cultural ideals necessary for a stable democracy will be readily disseminated to newly emerging democracies.In order to quantify democratic ideals, the authors undertook a comparative cross-national survey of five operating democratic systems: the US, UK, Germany, Italy and Mexico. In order to limit the research to the attitudes of individuals, the authors avoided questions about government, and rather posed inquires \\"about the individual's perception about government in relation to himself\\" (70). As testing attitudes of individuals is a complex task, the attempt to do so in a comparative fashion across five nations is especially difficult.In order to create an environment of comparability, Almond and Verba place respondents into one of three categories of political culture: parochial, subject and participant. In the parochial culture, the respondent \\"has neither knowledge of nor interest in politics.\\" In the subject culture, the respondent is \\"at least dimly aware of politics and political symbols and institutions (and) he understands that his life is touched by government policies.\\" Lastly, in the participant culture the respondent \\"has a keenly developed notion of his own political efficacy and competence as a political actor\\" (Walter, 1965).The three categories can combine and change. They are not mutually exclusive. Political cultures are not homogenous and each category can be subdivided into a number of cleavage groups. Almond and Verba believe that the combination between all these orientations (parochial, subject and participant \\"lead to a balanced political culture\\" (32).In order for Almond and Verba to make sense of these combinations and cleavages, they attempt to explore the differences and similarities between variables, and then compare the relative relationships of variables between nations (70). By evaluating the data collected in the five nations regarding political culture, the authors are then able to \\"validate inferences...and develop independent measures that can be used to explain other phenomena\\" (50). The next section will attempt to illustrate the practicality of Almond and Verba's methodology.For example, Verba and Almond seek to explore levels of individual political competence among nations. The authors hypothesize that a democratic system must have a political culture in place in which the citizens believe that they possess the ability to influence government. In order to validate their hypothesis, Almond and Verba ask respondents in all five nations whether they feel they can influence local, and national government, and at which level their influence is most effective. It was discovered that the respondents in all five nations felt they were more able to influence local government as opposed to national government. But upon closer inspection, the levels of political competence varied between nations.Table 1Nation Local Competence* National Competence*USA 77 75UK 78 62Germany 62 38Italy 51 28Mexico 52 38*Percentage of respondents who felt themselves politically competentData from The Civic Culture (1963)Almond and Verba explain this discrepancy by arguing that in the case of Mexico and Italy, local competence is greater than national competence because \\"local government autonomy and the accessibility of local government officials is most firmly institutionalized\\" (188).From this one section of The Civic Culture, Almond and Verba can claim three assumptions regarding political competence across nations. First, \\"local and national competence is related\\". Second, \\"local competence is more widespread then national competence\\". Third, \\"local competence is related to the institutional availability of opportunities to participate on the local level\\" (188).Throughout the subsequent chapters of the book, the authors continue to explore political attitudes across the five nations using methodology similar to the example above. For example, in chapter nine, Almond and Verba seek to draw a correlation between political competence and participation, and the influence of these variables on the effectiveness and legitimacy of a political system (230).Further chapters explore political emotion and participation, political obligation, and a number of other relationships regarding political attitudes and their effect on political structures. Still, in order for this large amount of data to be used more broadly, it is necessary for the authors to create generalizations regarding political culture that can be circulated to other emerging democracies. The authors use their compiled data to create a picture of the political culture of each nation studied, then they \\"attempt to relate these patterns of attitudes to a theory of the functioning of democratic governments\\" (402).In order to form a generalization regarding democratic systems and political attitudes, it is necessary to quickly revisit the idea of civic culture. Almond and Verba define civic culture as a \\"culture based on communication and persuasion, a culture of consensus and diversity, a culture that permitted change but moderated it\\" (8). From this definition, it becomes apparent that contradictions exist in the idea of civic culture. However, this only illustrates the compatibility of civic culture and a democratic system.A democratic system, like civic culture, is composed of contradictions. In a democratic society, elites governing the system must be responsive to the wishes of the citizenry, but also maintain the ability to make \\"authoritative decisions\\" (477). As such, \\"the civic culture, which sometimes contains apparently contradictory political attitudes, seems to be particularly appropriate for democratic political systems, for they, too, are mixtures of contradictions\\" (476).Almond and Verba contend that of the five nations studied, the United States and the United Kingdom provide prime examples of the most developed civic culture. These nations possess citizenry composed of both the passive and active orientations. As such, the government is able to address the contradictory nature of its main purpose. There are those who place a high degree of responsibility on the government, while there exists still more who readily allow the government to carry on its business with little or no interference.Almond and Verba offer that the political culture of the US and UK has emerged over a long period of time. Political change came slowly, and with it the emergence of a civic culture. The question then arises whether new developing democracies are capable of creating their own civic culture without having the extended time frame that characterizes both US and UK cases. Disappointingly the authors write, \\"If our study has taught us anything, it is that there is no simple formula for the development of a political culture conducive to the maintenance of democracy\\" (501).However, some generalizations can be drawn by the authors' research. First, education plays a large role in the development of civic culture. Although not a direct catalyst to democratic stability or the emergence of civic culture, if developing nations can insure an increase in education, civic culture will begin to emerge.Aside from education, the civic culture can be furthered through the development of a myriad of \\"channels of political socialization\\" (502). As civic culture is in many ways based upon differences in political orientation, by developing a variety of means to further political socialization, the diversity necessary to ensure democratic ideals emerges.Lastly, with education and channels of political socialization in place, it still remains necessary to ensure an attitude develops which supports a \\"commitment to the political system and a sense of political community\\" (503). This is most obvious in recently created democracies that have not the time to develop a sense of political community. The authors used the example of the Mexican Revolution as a catalyst to a sense of nationality, drawing individuals into a politically joined community."},{"Title":"The Civic Culture: Political Attitudes and Democracy in Five Nations","review":"In their classic studies of political culture, Almond and Verba attempted to use \\"civic propensities\\" to explain the stability of governments. There method was quite groundbreaking, for comparative political scientists of those times were heavily into analyzing constitutions. But just reading these legal documents was not proving much explanation for social changes. This was the context in which their work progressed. In the opening chapter of the Civic Culture, Almond &amp; Verba define a civic culture as \\"a pluralistic culture based on communication and persuasion, a culture of consensus and diversity, a culture that permitted change but moderated it\\" (pp. 6). For them, Britain and the United States were prime examples of such cultures. The reason was that the citizens of these countries operated in a culture with a highly effective set of orientations towards politics. These orientations include a tendency to have pride in one's government and expect good t! reatment from it. Citizens of a civic culture operate under a myth of sorts-they are not actively involved or interested in politics, but they believe that \\"the people\\" are politically powerful. There is just the right mixture of pragmatism and emotional commitment."},{"Title":"The men of the last frontier","review":"Grey Owl lived and worked among many people who survived by canoeing, transporting goods, trapping, hunting, fishing, and often living at great distance from other human beings - with whom they might have enjoyed talking and comparing stories.

But the messages they received from an entity named Tahkamenon made it impossible not to. Whispers From Our Soul: The Voice Of Tahkamenon is both an account of Tahkamenon's very powerful message, and the effects it had on the authors.Wilkinson, a CPA, is the president of a multi-million dollar health care company. Her job often requires political lobbying. Reed is also firmly grounded in the business world, currently operating his own successful consulting business. Tahkamenon contacted him while he was still a child. After Wilkinson told Reed about a &quot;visit&quot; from her recently-deceased father-in-law, he confided in her about Tahkamenon. Shortly after that, Tahkamenon established contact with Wilkinson.Reed &quot;hears&quot; Tahkamenon, while Wilkinson is inspired to record his messages in the written word.Tahkamenon brings a message of universal love and hope. His words are exceptionally lyrical and filled with the beauty of unfaltering love. He advises humans to tear down the &quot;walls [of] color, race, religion, origin, and sex.&quot; To those with questions, he says &quot;truth is eternal. Your soul is divine. The answers are within you if only you will allow yourself enough peace to hear the melody, to flow within the rhythm, to find comfort in the words.&quot;Wilkinson concludes with the insight that &quot;the world does not constrain you. Your walls do not constrain you. Only your fear can withhold you and then only with your permission and lack of faith.&quot;Whispers From Our Soul is for all those seeking the &quot;courage to act in accordance with your heart.&quot; Truth, beauty, light, divinity, and love are &quot;all at your disposal if only you choose to reconnect with your soul.&quot; Through Wilkinson and Reed, Tahkamenon tells us in a beautiful and loving way how to find courage and make our reconnections.Sandra I. Smith"},{"Title":"Whispers from Our Soul: The Voice of Tahkamenon","review":"What I appreciate so much about this book is the fact that the authors never reckoned on their life altering journey. It is one thing to pursue a metaphysical path, to consciously develop one's psychic abilities, to take a class in channeling, or to read books about other people's outlandish experiences in order to hopefully have them yourself. But for these two unsuspecting business executives joined by telephone, both with families and living in different states, it was quite another story. Neither of them had any prior interest in the above mentioned areas of psychic development and were sceptical to say the least. It is amusing as well as deeply moving to read Russell Reed's and Valerie Wilkinson's magnificent account of how they came into contact with a powerfully loving and poetic spiritual presence without even desiring it. In fact, it could have almost ruined their fairly predictable and clearly down-to-earth lives. How did they finally come to terms with this mind-boggling new reality that wouldn't go away? Why did this have to happen to them? Russell and Valerie do a wonderful job of answering questions like these with humor as well as deep respect. Beyond the amusement and fascination is the terrific force of love which emanates from their mysterious guide, Tahkamenon.

He examines the attitudes of various groups in America regarding such subjects as the legality of the trial, its purpose, and its predicted legacy. The book includes a tremendous amount of research with many lengthy footnotes and an exhaustive bibliography of books, periodicals, newspapers, documents, and letters. The groups considered were: American policy makers, international and domestic attorneys, congressional leaders, religious leaders, historians, foreign affairs writers, military officers, behavioral scientists, and the American public at large. His results are valuable albeit not terribly surprising.In addition, Bosch also extends his research to the Vietnam war. He examines whether or not Nuremberg principles should be used in the trials of Vietnam soldiers who disobey supreme commands or if two American pilots captured in northern Vietnam should be tried for war crimes by Ho Chi Minh's court. By noting the relationship between Nuremberg and Vietnam, Bosch demonstrates that the Nuremberg Trial was not just an event left to the past but is an event that has a significant influence on present and future issues regarding international military law.If you are interested in this subject, I highly recommend seeking out this book. It is very well written and contains a mountain of valuable information on American attitudes toward the Nuremberg Trial (the trial being undoubtedly dominated by American ideals).

The central action of the story concerns a giant bear worshipped by a tribe living on the southern limits of the great Beklan empire. This tribe, the Ortelgans, believe that Shardik's purpose is to lead them to greatness, and so when he appears they follow him in a glorious campaign to conquer the Empire. But is Shardik really a god, or just a very big bear whose thoroughly animal-like actions are given meaning by his followers? Adams wisely never really answers this question, and this is the great fascination of the book. Adams faces head-on the charge that religion is simply a tool for oppression and exploitation. He avoids a simplistic answer largely through his complex portrayal of the central human character, Shardik's prophet Kelderek. Kelderek is a simple tribesman who sincerely believes himself to have been chosen by Shardik for great purposes. While many of his actions are evil, we are never allowed to lose sympathy with him or to suspect him of hypocrisy, while at the same time we come to sympathize more and more with the characters who oppose his fanatical regime. At the end, Kelderek sees the evil he has done in the name of God, and begins to understand what Shardik's true purpose is--or does he simply misunderstand yet again? The greatness of this novel is in the fact that while it has a strong moral message, it always conveys this message through the actions and words of its characters. Adams lets the world he has created speak for itself. In the end we can choose to believe or not to believe.For readers like myself who themselves practice a religion, the novel is a powerful portrayal of the way the divine can be distorted and misunderstood by even the sincerest believer, even while God always remains transcendent, able to pierce through our comfortable blindness with the shocking light of his grace."},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"Richard Adams followed up the success of his animal fable, \\"Watership Down,\\" with this epic fantasy novel. However, you couldn't have imagined a more different novel from \\"Watership Down.\\" This is a very stark, mature, and philosophical fantasy work that explores the nature of religion, human interpretations of god, and the sacrifices and compromises of a war fought for supposedly idealistic causes. With the exception of a disappointingly tepid finale, this is an astonishing, absorbing novel that deserves rediscovery. I promise, you haven't read fantasy like it before. Without magic, fantastic monsters, or any overt supernatural occurrences, Adams sweeps the reader into a world of brilliant imagination -- the mark of a great fantasy.\\"Shardik\\" occurs in a hidden world with a hint of the ancient Middle East.

Kelderek declares that the bear is Shardik, a messenger of God, and soon the Ortelgan people rise to \\"follow\\" Shardik (who must often be coerced or drugged into fulfilling prophecies) to wage war against the mighty city of Bekla. Kelderek finds himself as the high priest of the great bear, but also learns the heavy responsibilities, and eventually, the doubts and fears.The novel is filled with war, a strange romance, bizarre and frightening new lands, and violent shifts in the story that rise from the heights of spiritual victory to the depths of slavery. Adams's prose is beautiful and inspiring. Unfortunately, after many excitement moments throughout the book, the lengthy last chapter sputters to a conclusion and probably should have been left out. Regardless, \\"Shardik\\" is a fantasy of great scope that leaves the reader with much to ponder.This new edition comes with a thoughtful introduction by author Robert Silverberg."},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"I just finished rereading Shardik for the third time. Boy, do I love this book.Richard Adams has long been my favorite 20th century novelist. His ability to make an epic fantasy feel intimate and utterly believable, in addition to his brilliant imagination, sets him apart from every other fantasy novelist I've ever read.Shardik is no exception. I just finished reading Shardik for the second time and can't help but marvel at Mr. Adams' genius. The world he describes in Shardik (and again in Maia) is as unforgettable as its denizens.Shardik and its companion piece/prequel, Maia, are no longer available commercially, but there are still a lot of copies floating around out there that I'm sure Amazon could hunt down for you.

The characters fought and killed a giant robot bear and found a label naming it &quot;Shardik&quot; after the bear in this book. Then I found the book &quot;Shardik&quot; in a second-hand book store and thought, &quot;Hey! Like in The Waste Lands!&quot; It cost only a dollar so I bought it and read it. When I finished I thought, &quot;that was pretty good, a little slow in parts, but still pretty good&quot; but then as a few years passed, I found myself remembering scenes from it. I would take the book down and re-read parts I liked and parts I didn't quite understand the first time. I think that is a sign of a truly great book. One that sticks in your memory and makes you think. Its too bad that it is no longer in print, but it isn't too hard to find in second-hand stores, and for cheap too (Second-hand book stores are truly magical places). What makes this book so good, is that it simply tells a good story and doesn't get bogged down with its theme, characters, and the writing. Although all of these elements are superb, its really the action of the story that drives it (As with Watership Down). There are many surprising twists that change the whole course of the story, and drive the story forward until the final, stunning revelation of Shardik's purpose which is astounding in its simplicity and morality. Its more complex, more profound, and darker than Watership Down and just as exciting.

S. Lewis does in his &quot;Narnia&quot; series...reveal the power of God through an animal avatar. This is no kids book, though children may enjoy it at some level. The Great bear Shardik, mystical blend of animal and God, on the one hand brute animal at its most naturalistic, on the other the palpable hand of God, stalks through the story like an Old Testament figure, avenging, redeeming, confounding human expectations for him..as God always does...until His will is done. Lives are shattered and reshaped...and a terrible, evil is ended. The villain of this book is one of the most chilling figures in all of literature. Though it drags in many places, SHARDIK is full of scenes of raw iconic power and beauty, vivid images of the power of God manifest through this great beast. This a wonderful book, one that inspires rereading, and gives one pause to think about the nature of good, evil, mankind, and the deity."},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"I first heard about this book through Stephen King's The Waste Lands.

We witness the voyage of Kelderek &quot;Plays with children&quot; from lowly hunter to worshipped royalty then once again to the lowest of the low.Its is from his voyage that we learn the true importance of faith and how cruel the human species can truly be because of it.Hidden within Sardik there is a deep and important meaning hidden within the words of this book that can truly move the reader when discovered.Adams has proven time after time that he is one of he most skilled writers of this century, and along with Watership Down and the Plague Dogs, Shardik will continue to live on through its readers for generatons."},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"Richard Adams has long been my favorite 20th century novelist.

It's a well-told story that is one of the most satisfying books I've read.Shardik is the enormous and allegedly divine bear that is the title and center of the story. With the exception of the first chapter, the reader never gets a glimpse into Shardik's mind; only into the minds of those affected by Shardik's actions. The first person we meet is Kelderk, a lowly hunter from Ortelga, and nicknamed \\"play-with-children\\" by his peers. One day when Kelderek is hunting, a leopard corners him, and he's certain that he's dead. But out of nowhere, a huge bear comes and kills the leopard with one swipe of his paw. After towering over him for a moment, the bear vanishes. Kelderek feels certain that this is Shardik, the Power of God, who is believed will return some day and restore greatness to the Ortelgans. Eventually, Kelderek goes to the island of Quiso, where the leader of the Cult of Shardik, the Tuginda, resides. (The Tuginda and all of those on Quiso, are women; an interesting plot feature.) The Tuginda, some women from Quiso, Kelderek, and a few others from Ortelga go in search of Shardik, and eventually find him. Unfortunately, things take a turn for the worse when Ta-Kominion, an Ortelgan leader, insists on drugging and capturing Shardik to use him in conquering neighboring Bekla and building an empire. The Tuginda wants nothing to do with it, and Ta-Kominion effectively puts her under house arrest on Quiso. Ta-Kominion eventually catches a fever and dies. However, in the battle with the Beklans, Shardik breaks out of his cage at a crucial battle and kills several Beklans, including many soldiers and a key general. The Ortelgans go on to conquer Bekla and much of the neighboring provinces, since there's no longer anyone to stand in their way. Kelderek eventually becomes the Priest-King of Bekla, and is re-named Crendrik.Three years later, the Beklan Empire is engaged in a war against the forces of the neighboring provinces and the Beklans who managed to flee before the Ortelgan takeover, led primarily by General Santil-k&egrave;-Erketlis. To finance the war, the Ortelgan generals revive the slave trade, to which Kelderek consents. Nonetheless, Kelderek is not portrayed as the villain, and he is dismayed by the corrupt military regime that he supervises. He is always more concerned about Shardik than the goings-on of the empire.Kelderek's world falls apart when Elleroth, a leader in the rebellion against the Beklan Empire, tries to burn down Kelderek's house with Shardik inside. Elleroth is captured, but both he and Shardik escape (I will not reveal now). Kelderek then follows Shardik alone. And here I will stop the plot summary, leaving it to the readers to discover and enjoy the rest for themselves.\\"Shardik\\" is a provocative book that has something for fans of many genres. Religous fiction fans will be gripped by the exploration of the issues of sin and atonement in the book; the author of the introduction says that \\"Shardik\\" is a Christian story with no Christian apparatus, and I would agree. Philosophy buffs will enjoy the ambiguous characters of Shardik- is Shardik really a divine incarnation, or just a big dumb bear who's alleged divinity is just an invention by his followers? Furthermore, it's not entirely clear how the Cult of Shardik developed in the first place. Of course, fantasy fans will love this, even though there's no swords and sorcery type stuff. Plus, there's plenty of battle scenes and suspense for action/thriller fans. There's even some romance, although it doesn't come into play until near the end. In conclusion, anyone who appreciate good literature and a good yarn will love this. 5 out of 5."},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"This book touches at the spirit. At the heart of the book's theme, is the question: \\"how much are we willing to do for the sake of our beliefs?\\". The prose is excellent, the pacing is good and most importantly, the writing seems natural and fluid. Adams seems to have that rare talent of letting a story run seemingly, on its own free will. Adam has created great characters like Shardik and Kelderek, without settling for predictable character building.It's a great book that I recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"Having loved Watership Down, I grabbed feverishly at the first pages of the &quot;bear&quot; version only to be asleep in minutes. This book is almost unbelievably slow. It is about strange tribes on strange lands and a giant bear-god.I know that talking rabbits is not exactly reality, but this book should reside in the fantasy section of your local library alongside Terry Pratchett, Tolkien, or even in the bin. I am sure there are many out there who can find comparisons with our own world, with some extremely meaningful message to save mankind from everlasting doom etc etc, but I simply found it awful.It is no surprise that no-one has ever heard of Richard adam's follow up to Watership Down. Most people are probably too embarressed to mention the two books in the same sentence"},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"\\"Shardik\\" must have seemed something of a shock to readers who had adored Adams' \\"Watership Down.\\" The author's first book was thoroughly enjoyable and accessible, a modern fable that read like a magical adventure. \\"Shardik,\\" by contrast, was epic fantasy, steeped deeply in philosophical questions, especially those concerning the nature of religion and the apparent need in the human soul for spirituality.I confess I have not read this novel as many times as I have read other books by Adams, especially \\"The Plague Dogs,\\" which I would rank as my favorite. Yet there are tremendous rewards here for the patient reader. First of all, Adams' gift for language is as deft as ever. Second, the story itself is absolutely compelling.But in the end, \\"Shardik\\" emerges as a canny exploration of myth and an examination of our hunger for sacred meaning in life. This is not, in my view, the author's best book, but it is one of his most ambitious."},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"I read Watershipdown by Richard Adams and wanted to read more of his books. If you liked Watershipdown you will probably like this one too."},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"I don't usually read books dealing with imaginary societies, but this one so engrossed me I couldn't put it down. Whether you respect religious cults and ancient societal mores or not, the characters of this novel will indubitably pull you in. I loved the humanity and erudition of this masterpiece. It isn't quite on the level of creative genius of Adams' Watership Down, but humans are a poor comparison to the lives of rabbits. A thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"I have read every novel that Adams wrote, and I can definately say that Shardik is his best. It is a gripping, imaginative work that sucked me into the bizarre Beklan Empire. His characters are amazingly deep and developed, each with a history and motivation of his own. Adams raises critical questions of the nature of faith and belief, authority and corruption. Overall, he fails to answer these questions and has essentially written himself into a corner. Still, his words are thought-provoking and a noble effort to uncover the power of corruption and the corruption of power. I heartily reccomend Shardik to readers, both as an exciting story and an intellectual exercise."},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"Sad to see that Richard Adams' 1978 classic &quot;Shardik&quot; is categorized as &quot;hard to find.&quot; For this reader, Shardik was Adams' tour de force, which is not at all to disparage Watership Down, Plague Dogs, Maia, or others.The story ages the witness several years in the reading by weaving characters who were introduced in early chapters into important figures in latter plots. Truly epic structure for a marvelous tale well told. I gained several bromides from the reading of Shardik. Adams' coining of &quot;Of what value is the grain of sand at the heart of a pearl?&quot; could pass for Biblical wisdom.A recent personal conversation, regarding calling one's representative in Washington, D.C., elicited the vision of &quot;The Streels&quot; Adams created in Shardik. A dismal and eerie valley that had the haunted acoustic property of amplifying echoes. Anyone who spoke aloud into the Streels from its defining ridge lines would be driven mad by the cacophonous roar that emitted from that awful place. Not unlike the black hole we call Foggybottom.Shardik holds many lessons and pearls of wisdom for this age and beyond. A complex and unforgettable story line."},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"Richard Adams next effort, after the wonderful 'Watership Down', attempts to transfer the sweep and mythos of that book to a human arena with mixed results. A huge bear fleeing a forest fire stumbles into a poor backward island of Ortelga and is proclaimed to be an agent of God heralding a return to fortune for Ortelga.The book starts promisingly, but loses its sense of mystery and myth after a third of the story (after the conquest of Bekla). Adams has interesting points to make, mainly how a religion can be corrupted with even the best intentions. But its not done well enough to sustain the story..."},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"Alas. Richard Adams wrote two books set in his wonderful Beklan Empire, but only one remains in print. \\"Shardik\\" is a difficult read. It is worth reading, certainly, but I wish \\"Maia\\" would come back into print. Mr. Adams wrote \\"Shardik\\" first, but the events of \\"Maia\\" predate it by ten years, and show the Empire in a very different and exciting light, through the eyes of much more loveable (and some magnificently detestable) characters.

I read it for the first time when I was ten, and have read it many times since, and I still love it!"},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"For everyone who just finished &quot;Watership Down&quot; and is looking at Richard Adams other novels, searching for another tale of happy, bouncing rabbits, don't pick up Watership Down. Firstly (this is of course opinion) Adams has not equaled that masterpiece, secondly none of his other books have the light, mythological feel. Adams has begun moving on the ground towards social commentary...a dangerous and quite boring one for authors. Luckily this novel is the first step in that road.On the up side, Shardik still possesses the mythical quality to it, even more so than Watership Down (for this happens on a different world). The main character is likeable although we are not given enough time IMHO to see him develop on his own. The plot is also an intriguing one, although ultimately less so than Watership Down (great novel, if you haven't read it go out and do so).This novel however in my opinion moves too slow (this coming from a guy who reads Robert Jordan) and sometimes, luckily not often, it feels like the author is trying to say something to us, a moral to the story. FOr example, to me it felt like times Richard Adams almost wanted to turn to the reader and say -- look! look! This is how religions started!In any case, this novel ultimately did not whet my appetite to attempt reading Maia again (the prequel which I failed in my first attempt to read)."},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"Ursine avatars can be a bit tedious.Shardik being that avatar in the religion of the native people, and more particularly, the native character that this book is about. He convinces people of this really big bear's religious significance. This gets him a position of religious power, and what do people often do with that? Yep, want to go and do a bit of that large scale killing war stuff.It isn't all quite that simple though for the main guy as his attitude changes throughout."},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"After reading its prequel, \\"Maia,\\" I've rediscovered Adams' spectacular \\"Shardik.\\" Both novels are set in Adams' fictitious but meticulously-created Beklan empire. As a devotee of this fantasy world, I was rather disappointed with \\"Maia,\\" but this has made the return to \\"Shardik\\" all the more rewarding.Adams' writing in this work shows him at the pinnacle of his art. All of the skill of \\"Watership Down\\" comes through in a story that is both a great story in itself and a remarkable allegory for its readers' lives. Kelderek Zenzuata, the humble fisherman from backwater Ortelga, finds himself chosen as a vessel of the Power of God. What he chooses to do with this knowledge gives us searing insight into the human condition: using power as a tool, letting ambition get ahead of wisdom. Kelderek abuses the power he is given, and abuses the God he claims to worship as he takes the great bear Shardik in chains to Bekla. (Previous reviewers have commented on the never-resolved question of whether Shardik actually is the Power of God or just a bear - I agree that this is one of the things that makes the novel so powerful.) Adams does make it clear that the characters in the story are subordinate to a power above themselves, though whether Shardik is that power or only its instrument is unclear.The events leading up to the end are shocking, in some cases disturbing, and always compelling. Adams leaves his readers wanting to linger in the world he has created, and considering what the story says about themselves."},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"Being in Iraq for so long now I picked up one of Richard Adams books. This was the second one that I read. I have quickly become one of his biggest fans. This book, deals with faith, power and evils that fall upon man. The hero, what you may can one, rises to become a great man but his heart begins to stray. He loses what made his such a pure being. There are many acts of faith that Mr. Adams brings to live with makes it all the more beliveible. A very wonderful book."},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"Richard Adams knows how to create worlds of originality and complexity with ease. Shardik is another one of his tales that thrusts the reader head first into a world of savagery. Religion and how one deals with the issue of it is, in my opinion, the underlying theme of the novel. Adams impresses upon the reader through his depiction of characters and events the negative role religion can have upon the individual and society. The story is a riveting ride of emotions as the reader is swept from various cities across Adam's world. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy literature that has something to say about the human condition and how it interacts with the spirit and laws of religion. Richard Adams is a spellbinding story teller with much to impart upon society."},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"I would have liked this book more, had it focused entirely on the religious/mythical theme, especially on the question whether Shardik is a natural or supernatural creature; this aspect of the story is very well crafted. But unfortunately Adams tried to pack into the book a lot of extra luggage, as for example a panoramic and not too successful view of the inhabitants of the land; or a moralistic and sociological message awkwardly embodied in the figure of the giant bear. The portion that deals with Genshed is overdone and excessively grim; the final chapters are too melodramatic and preachy. However the novel contains some truly powerful and haunting scenes, like the Streels of Urtah and the Foothills battlefield.In sum, this was a book worth reading."},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"This book starts with a city with lost power and glory. After being oppressed by neighboring powers, the people of Ortelga hear news of a gigantic bear (lord Shardik) spotted near their city. They take this as an omen of the return of their long awaited lord incarnate.Kelderek, the hunter who spotted Shardik, gets swept up in the events and is deemed a priest who can control and understand the bear. The people of Ortlega wage battle against the neighboring oppressors using the massive bear to inspire the fighters.Adams presents us with questions of morality and uses his fantasy world in a juxtaposition of reality. Both these tools help to spark the critical thinkers interest. The bear Shardik is the perfect metaphor for how fickle life can be. A bear is dangerously unpredictable and uncontrollable as life is.Richard Adams has created a dynamic epic, which is nothing short of a masterpiece. I would suggest this book to anyone ready for a thrill-ride tale and vividly descriptive read."},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"I just completed a re-read of my old yellowed, limp paperback of Richard Adams' SHARDIK, and am delighted to report that it impressed me even more than I had remembered from the first time around--about 30 years ago. I'm older now. I'd known little tragedy on the first reading. Now in my 70s, I've experienced my parents' deaths, the helplessness of a brilliant, bipolar husband's collapse, and the past eight years of horrors created by my own government. SHARDIK is now not only nightmarish, but much more real.Others have described the loving details, the deep characterizations, the plot lines that seem (like the development of a Mozart symphony) both completely original yet inevitable. Anyone who thinks torture is \\"useful\\" needs to read this book, yet it is more a deep study of the perils of fanaticism and rewards of a faith based on reality--which appeals to me, a devout Unitarian Universalist--than a political polemic of secular national identity. Adams gives us a society combining elements of Neolithic-Bronze Age-Iron Age political and economic structures, emerging gradually from theocracy into a tyrant-dominated, sexist, slave-worked city-state ethos. Not a good culture, but with good people in it.The only dubious notion in the book is that any nation or minor empire of this period would EVER have been willing, on their own, to give up slavery even temporarily--especially people who lack draft horses and mules. I'm a historian and have trouble thinking of any society that ended slavery and/or serfdom until maintaining a high level of business morality based on conscience, plus enough industrialization to enable the economics to exist without involuntary servitude. In fact, no society today, including that of the U.S.--with an estimate of 55,000 hidden slaves in 2001--is entirely free of the taint.But if you accept that single unlikely element, the story is absolutely marvelous. It's over 600 pages long and I could scarcely put the book down. Adams' approach to writing seems much closer to that of Gene Wolfe than of Tolkien, although there are good reasons for comparing him to both. All three share the detailed world-building, the sure-handed Jungian use of universal myth and legend, an emotional sine curve from despair and violence into physical and ethical redemption, prose that often goes beyond poetry to the level of psalm and elevates the reader to a startling epiphany. All three can really write.But Tolkien was not the master of in-depth human character that Adams or Wolfe are. There are no Orcs and High Elves in Adams and Wolfe, only a recognition that both demon and angel dwell within each of us. Anyone who likes SHARDIK would do well to read Wolfe's BOOK OF THE NEW SUN, a compilation of connected, evolving stories which are themselves works of art as well as religiously allegorical quests. If you do, don't overlook the often-forgotten sequel or \\"coda\\", THE URTH OF THE NEW SUN. Then go on to Wolfe's other works. You'll be pleased."},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"Finally finished this the other day. The third book by Richard Adams I've read. The other two: Watership Down and Plague Dogs, and my second favorite of the three behind WD (yeah, yeah, yeah - it's hard to shake the nostalgia of this one going way back to my youth). I read somewhere that Richard Adams considers Shardik his best work, and I can see that, as it is a rousing and well-rounded adventure that covers all the bases. The third act was superb, always the sign of a great anything - the 'third act', I couldn't put it down at that point.It's an adventure/journey type story that takes a person from humble beginnings and then throws him to the wind and powers much greater than himself and he travels across the world and experiences great highs and lows and then in the end it all comes together to make sense and the effect of which gives his life meaning, his purpose, much from the past transgressions that in turn shape his view of the future to come. In a way, the hero comes full circle through his trials and deeds. Great book, better even than Salmond Rushdie's Midnight's Children which I read before this - although it is a powerful and visionary book as well."},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"I am in agreement with many others that Richard Adams' Shardik eclipses his other books, like Watership Down and The Plague Dogs.The story grips one right away, with the tale of an ancient culture which encounters a great bear, who they say is the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy.Kelderek,the main character, finds the bear, or should I say, the bear finds him. He becomes the follower of Shardik, eventually prophet, and a priest-king by those who want to use the bear and the prophecy for their own ends.But the bear has other plans.Shardik has a lesson to teach which is totally unforseen by all. It is revealed in one of the most stunning twists in all of literature. I must say that the book does get a little slow in the middle, but I recommend that the reader persist. It's well worth going through, and ties up nicely in the end.I wish I was a movie producer, as this epic deserves a spot on the big screeen. A book well worth reading."},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"What can I say that hasn't already been said? Richard Adams is an incredible storyteller, with a mastery of the English language beyond any other author I've read. I've read this book pretty much annually for the past 6 or 7 years, and it amazes me each and every time.If you can, also pick up a copy of MAIA, Adams' prequel to SHARDIK. The two books complement each quite well, and should be reprinted as a set, in my opinion. (Although SHARDIK remains my favorite.)"},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"I'm not going to talk like a fancy pants reviewer- I'm just twelve, and I don't know super big critic-type words. I'm just going to say what I think about this book.This is a good book.This book is fascinating, even to a kid. It's adventure, romance, but at the heart of it, it's wisdom of the human spirit- how man believes that anything unlike them is wrong; the lack of knowledge of your enemies and, in truth, how close they are to yourself; and how you never know who the &quot;bad guy&quot; is, especialy if it's you.It always holds your attention, so you are sure never to miss anything that will come up later on in the book, which is of the greatest importance to this story, so you don't ever wonder,&quot;Who's that again?&quot; This is a feat that Adams accomplishes almost easily, while I get lost in most other books and several chapters later am frustrated just because I wasn't paying attention for a page.This book, most importantly, though, is just fun. All you need to enjoy this book is a developed vocabulary and an understanding of human nature. Three and a half cheers for Richard Adams!"},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"Richer, grander, intensely more rewarding than \\"Watership Down\\", at least for an adult.

Most people probably won't explore much beyond \\"Watership Down\\", and that's a shame, and actually the reason why I am writing this -- to encourage more people to go further.In any case, I know I need to seek out more of his novels for myself."},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"The first time I read this book I was no more than 14 and I liked it,I found it interesting and different.

This book opened the door to the likes of Joseph Campbell and the hold that myth and religion have on mankind.

His excellent storytelling ability paints a (mostly) barreling saga of religion perverted for human use and a king's morally questionable policies gone awry.I loved the beginning and end of the book (it was in these sections that the action was most intense) but the middle was so dense I literally slogged through it. Adams' heavy philosophical tangents, intensely long and convoluted metaphors, and pages-on-end introspections by the principal character often bring the storyline to a complete halt. Still, if you have the necessary willpower to finish the book (I had to start it four times before I actually finished it), you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"This book was amazing, with the use of rich description and detail. Although a few parts dragged a little, it is one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"This is Richard Adams greatest book. It not only contains the excitement and adventure of Watership Down and Maia, it also contains the most involving unpredictable plot, the most complex and passionate characters, and the most interesting locations. Locations? I generally hate descriptions of how someone is dressed or how an office is furnished ad nauseum. However, I have never enjoyed and visualized the look and feel of a place I have read about as I have in this book. Methalys' description of Zeray is perhaps the most descriptive passage I have ever read. The book is hauntingly real. I wish it would simply continue beyond the end."},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"The saga of Kelderek, the bear priest/king is a blend of seemingly mythic, significant encounters and a naturalistic narrative. The only fantasy element in this overlong tale is the setting, and it is indeterminate, though Robert Silverberg's Introduction to the 2002 edition seems to favor an Ancient Near East milieu. (Silverberg also claims to find Christian overtones in the story; he is mistaken)The strongest elements of fantasy are fused with the religious cult of the island of Quiso where \\"The Tuginda\\" presides over a number of female devotees who invest themselves in Shardik the bear as a manifestation of God. Off the island, though, the magic isn't put to the same effect that unnerved its male visitors in the first part of the novel. The priestesses are simply present for Shardik in his cage in Bekla or are adepts at preparing medicinal potions when injuries occur.One problem with the fantasy of Shardik is that some of its characters strike us as contemporary in their behavior, e.g. Elleroth and Siristrou. In a world of charged with mystery, the supernatural, and the wildness of nature, their world-wise ways are a jarring presence in the story. Think of the ubiquitous British actors in the run-of-the-mill roles of Roman officials in Bible movies and you'll get the picture.Another problem for me was the loss of the sense of place once Kelderek left the revolt in Bekla to search for the escaped Shardik. Adams stopped using the helpful maps that buttressed the story up to the arrival in Bekla. Despite, or because of, the mention of various rivers, towns and mountains, I grew disoriented as the novel galumphed along for another 300 pages through Adams' landscape. And don't even get me started on the growing cascade of bewildering character names: Ta - Kominion; Tan-Rion; Siristrou, son of Balko, son of Mereth of the Two Lakes, etc.Adams is, however, capable of some good stretches of writing, as in the opening chapters of the book devoted to the forest fire and the meeting of Kelderek and Shardik. The battle of the Foothills is also compellingly written. But I cannot help suspect that Adams, the middle-aged British civil servant, had stored up an overabundance of narrative that, in his 50s and with the runwaway success of Watership Down, he could not resist effusing. This IS a 600 page book and many other parts unspool at a plodding pace, such as Kelderek's protracted march through the streets of Kabin, a smallish frontier town, to banishment where we sense each faltering footstep through the dusty streets. The five pages this took could've been handled in a paragraph or two.However, readers who manage to stay alert through this sprawling tale will appreciate Adams' full-circle device of a story that ignites in a fire also ends there as a kind of summary. Siristrou the ponderer of metaphysics and ethical matters, \\"sees\\" dreamily the events of the preceding story in the dancing flames of the fire in his room - a nice touch, even if the circuit took 600 pages to complete."},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"I read this book years ago in hardcover, and enjoyed it so much when I saw it offered as a Kindle HD version I had to have it.

It took some effort to get into the story, but once I was in it, I was hooked."},{"Title":"Shardik","review":"This book is amazing!

Trail (Sagebrush Large Print Western Series)","review":"Without doubt, this is the single greatest western novel that I have ever read. It was a gift given to me as a boy, and I have reread it periodically ever since.This is a magnificant epic of a novel in a single volume. The collossal enterprise of building the first transcontinental railroad from start to finish connects everything, but is really about Neale's love for Allie Lee- and everything he and their friends go through to rescue her. I know that sounds more like a romance novel than it does a western, but, trust me, this is THE western. You actually care about the many skillfully drawn characters- and it hits you hard when they die in heroic sacrifice. I know that some readers will see the characters as western charactatures and stereotypes, but that is only because Hollywood later overused them- the book came first.By the way, Larry Red King's rescue of Allie Lee from Belle's \\"Dance Hall\\" is still the greatest single scene in any western novel, or film, as far as I am concerned.Oh yeah, not all the language is \\"politically correct\\" these days. That's because the men who built this nation weren't politically correct- empire builders never are.One more thing, the hero of this novel is an engineer, a civil engineer, and a great role model. At least to me, he was."},{"Title":"The U.P. Trail (Sagebrush Large Print Western Series)","review":"This is an ambitious novel, as Zane Grey tried to weave the tale of a pair of star-crossed lovers with the story of the building of the Union Pacific Railroad. The novel includes every piece of action that becomes the staples of Hollywood Westerns: deadly gunfights, redskins' attacks, corrupt politicians, dastard villains, forgotten treasure. Unfortunately I think the author included too much, diluting the impact of simpler story lines in his other classics such as Riders of the Purple Sage, or Last Man Standing. Replaceable minor characters appeared and disappeared only to serve to drive the story forward. The male protagonist, Warren Neale, is not a very well-drawn, rather inconsistent character, a victim of episodic disappearances from the narrative. Allie Lee is a bit better drawn, but she served no more than damsel-in-distress role. The female characters in the other mentioned novels are much stronger characters who played crucial roles in the stories.That said, the story does have its amazing moments. The escape of Allie Lee from the Indian camp. The burial ground in the dying Benton."},{"Title":"Usptr Manual for Coaches (Item No. 4162)","review":"I have been coaching tennis for over 20 years and I find none have simplified the business of teaching tennis more than these two gentlemen.

And with large differences in income and skills. Yet many are urbanising. Driven in part by the diffusion of technology throughout the world. And also by expanding populations. The book is an attempt to give a systematic overview, across a vast area, of these changes.Of the areas studied, Papua New Guinea gets the most attention. The largest in area, with very rugged terrain in New Guinea, and an archipelago of associated islands. In population, it far outweighs Fiji, Samoa etc. Many sources of instability are cited for PNG. One is simply the high levels of unemployment and underemployment in the towns. Especially Port Moresby. Migrations from villages has led to an underclass that is unskilled, with little prospects of betterment. This has led to endemic violent crime by gangs of \\"rascals\\" and to instability of the PNG government itself. The spectre of a failed state looms. Worsened by ethnic differences with the people in Bougainvillea.The book's survey of Micronesia gives scarcely better hopes for that region.A depressing analysis. Especially if you are Australian. Because as the pre-eminent power in the region, Australia might have to intervene if PNG or others become failed states."},{"Title":"Hunters of Gor (The Gor Series)","review":"I read the Gor series as a boy in the 70's and early 80's. IMHO the series is most appealing to teenage boys. I recently pulled \\"Assassins of Gor\\" off the shelf one night while bored, and re-read it. I was shocked that there was no real sex, and only a handful of pages of philosophy and psychology that I had to skip over. The book was really excellent, although in a straight forward, uncomplicated sort of way. These are escapist novels, richly detailed, which immerse you in an exotic world, not real thinkers. My enduring memories were of the later books in the series, which were almost unreadable because whole chapters were devoted to philosophy and psychology.I am not offended by the idea that it is natural and enjoyable for women to be submissive to men. Although I recognize it as wish fulfillment fantasy, still I consider it harmless, especially in such an obviously fictitious setting. I even found it mildly interesting the first time it was mentioned. It is the umpteenth repetition that I find boring. I just turn those pages, skipping ahead to the next action sequence. Speaking of wish fulfillment, I wish someone would edit the series, and re-publish it without these parts. Maybe Eric Flint could do it? He likes to edit, according to his afterword to \\"1633\\" and he's good at it. Of course, if you take the sex out of Gor you get Barsoom, and that story has already been written.I looked on Amazon to see if there was anything new going on with the series, and there was. It is being reprinted, starting at the beginning, and at least 2 new books seem to be published, or at least in the works. I was disappointed though that Amazon didn't have the whole series listed under one easy to find heading. I guess there are, after all, millions of books and only so many Amazon employees. So I'm listing the series, in order, along with some brief info. Some of these books I haven't read, as noted.1.) Tarnsman of Gor - 1966. Earthman, Tarl Cabot, goes to another planet, hidden on the opposite side of our sun, and becomes a master swordsman and Warrior. This is the book that is most like \\"Princess of Mars\\" by Edgar Rice Burroughs, which I highly recommend. Note - the 1966 copyright is held by John Lange, the author's real name.2.) Outlaw... - 1967. Tarl Cabot returns to Gor, to find he's been outlawed.3.) Priest-Kings... - 1968. Tarl Cabot goes to lair of Priest-Kings to clear his name.4.) Nomads... - 1969. Tarl Cabot goes to Southern Plains, and meets Mongol type nomads.5.) Assassin... - 1970. Tarl Cabot returns to Ar, greatest city-state on Gor. Note - this is the first copy I have by Del Rey books, and it has cover art by Boris. I may not like reading about the Gorean philosophy on sexual roles for men and women, but I can't get enough of Boris' artwork depicting it.6.) Raiders... - 1971. Tarl Cabot goes to Port Kar, pirate capitol of scum and villainy, and learns the meaning of shame. More Boris art on the cover of the Del Rey edition.7.) Captive... - 1972. A new character, Elinor Brinton, is captured on Earth and becomes a slave girl on Gor. The first time this is done, it may be slightly creative and a little interesting, but it is a radical departure from the earlier books and I consider it to be the beginning of the end. At least Tarl Cabot has a few pages at the end, to tie this book into the rest of the series. This is also the last book published by Ballantine books, which I think is significant in the content and direction of the rest of the series.8.) Hunters... - 1974. Tarl Cabot goes to the Northern Forest and meets amazon type women. This seems to be the first time there was a break in John Norman's writing, undoubtedly related to his switch to Daw books as a publisher.9.) Marauders... - 1975. Tarl Cabot goes to the land of the Norsemen and meets Viking type Marauders.10.) Tribesmen... - 1976. Tarl Cabot goes to the Tahari desert.11.) Slave Girl... - 1977. Earth girl Judy Thornton enslaved on Gor. Again. No Tarl Cabot at all.12.) Beasts... - 1978. Tarl Cabot goes to the Arctic ice pack and meets Eskimo type people.13.) Explorers... - 1979. Tarl Cabot goes to the equatorial rain forests.14.) Fighting Slave... - 1980. Earthman Jason Marshall is enslaved and forced to fight in a pit on Gor.15.) Rogue... - 1981. Jason Marshall wanders free on Gor.16.) Guardsman... - 1981. Jason Marshall earns a homeland.17.) Savages... - 1982. Tarl Cabot goes to the great plains and meets American Indian type savages. Note - If you like this, John Norman also wrote \\"Ghost Dance\\" in 1970, a similar type story about real American Indians. I'm impressed that he kept the writing schedule he did on the Gor novels, and still wrote other books on the side. He also wrote \\"Time Slave\\" in 1975.18.) Blood Brothers... - 1982. Savages and Blood Brothers are a two-part set. Just recently read this conclusion to Savages. Brings closure to Ubar of the Skies.19.) Kajira... - unread. Another Slave girl story.20.) Players... - 1984. Tarl Cabot joins the Carnival. Cos goes to war with Ar.21.) Mercenaries... - 1985. Tarl Cabot returns to Ar again to try to save it.22.) Dancer... - unread. Another Slave Girl novel? This is where I stopped even looking in the bookstore.23.) Vagabonds... - unread.24.) Magicians... - 1988, unread.25.) Witness... - 2002, unread. I read on amazon that this is a story about Marlenus with amnesia, told by a slave girl.26.) Prize... - unread. This is not yet published."},{"Title":"Hunters of Gor (The Gor Series)","review":"This was always one of my favorites of the Gor books because of the constant misfortune befalling Tarl Cabot. Usually he is the master of the situations in which he finds himself, but that is not the case here. It makes for a welcome change, and sets up his rediscovery of his true self in the following book."},{"Title":"Hunters of Gor (The Gor Series)","review":"Hunters of Gor introduces us to a brand new geographic area of Gor for the first time since Nomads of Gor (Book #4). Like Nomads of Gor, Hunters of Gor showcases both the denizens and the flora and fauna of the area (Northern Forest). Simply put, the Panther Women are absolutely incredible! For the second time John Norman showcases them in all their resplendent glory! Women who are not afraid of men and who are in fact able to give as good as they get. I loved this premise! It was first alluded to in the fifth book; Assassins of Gor.The Northern Forest is a coniferous forest land biome that hosts outlaws and Panther Women. Both of these groups cannot co-exist. So naturally there is great conflict between males and females when they encounter one another. The exception for this is at the trading/exchange points where booty is traded to merchants for the sundry goods of Gor.The story has Tarl Cabot entering the forest to save his long lost love Talena from the degradations of slavery. Talena has been captured (Since Captive Of Gor), and is in the custody of Slavers. With a detachment of his men he journeys up the Laurius River in search of his former Free-Companion. But before he can intercept her he is captured by Panther Women. However, Marlenus of Ar rescues him from the ignominy of a gang rape by Panther Women. After his rescue, Tarl becomes embroiled in the machinations of Marlenus of Ar, who himself is later captured by warriors from Tyros.This is when Tarl Cabot is at his best. By the end of this book Norman showcases the ruthless skill Tarl Cabot uses to dispatch his foes while wrapping up the riveting plot. This will set the table for Marauders of Gor, the direct sequel of Hunters of Gor.The descriptions of the forest floor and its animals are surreal and truly engage one's full imagination. This is a book that can only hook you to the Gor Series right on through to Explorers of Gor (Book #13) and Blood Brothers of Gor (Book #18). These novels showcase a bonanza of Gorean locales that truly will mesmerize any true Gor fan! By all means you must buy this and the above mentioned books!A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr."},{"Title":"Hunters of Gor (The Gor Series)","review":"This is Volume 8 in the Gor series and Volume 7 of the Tarl Cabot saga since the protagonist in the previous volume was someone else. After the disappointment of Captives of Gor I was hoping that Norman would get back on track with this story but, alas, it was not to be. The book is 370 pages long and has a flimsy plot that would normally support a book about half that length. The rest of it is taken up by Norman's obsession with female enslavement. Every time Cabot binds a slave (which is frequently) it is described in excruciating detail with loving description of the devices used and types of knots employed. This may be fine for the bondage crowd but for the rest of us it's just plain booorrriiinnnggg! Also, the level of violence against women and outright sadism seems to have escalated compared to the first 6 volumes. Another flaw in the book is the outrageousness of some of the scenes. I've complained about this with Assassin of Gor but none of them in that book can compare to this one: Cabot knowingly walks into the stockade of his enemy Sarus of Tyros where he is quickly locked in and surrounded by 55 Tyrosians and 22 panther girls all of whom have good reason to kill him on sight. He demands that they give up their prisoners immediately or he will kill everyone there. A melee ensues. Guess who wins. Oh, puh-leeze. One final complaint: In the past Norman's thoughts on bondage had been presented as part of the plot. You could always maintain the fiction that Norman didn't really believe the things he was saying, that they were there for the sake of the story, the Gorean ambiance if you will. In the final chapter of this book, however, for the first time Norman seem to step out of the shadows to lecture the reader on how Gorean philosophy can be justified by Darwinian principles. The arguments are easy enough to refute but this is not the place for it."},{"Title":"Hunters of Gor (The Gor Series)","review":"Tarzan this is not. Tarzan spoke multiple languages, and was a very Victorian kind of fellow. There was never anything improper about his conduct. This is the world of teenage male fantasy, a world where they have power, and can follow their hormones, you might say. I read this in high school. I think a movie was actually made of this. I did go on to research the history of cultures, to find out what Norman used in his pastiche, and the book is useful for that. Parents who want to keep their teenaged boys sheltered may not like this book. I have a cousin who kept his sons sheltered, even home schooled them. One of them went into the Army last year. I suspect he is in an unpleasant situation, which his life experience did not prepare him for. High school is painful for teenaged boys, escapist stuff like this is one way to escape the pain, without using addictive substances. The Dept of Justice estimates that 80% of American high school students regularly use drugs, alcohol, or both. My daughter agreed with this, for her high school. Now that is just not healthy. If you need addictions, the printed word at least doesn't cause physical damage. One outgrows this sort of thing, eventually. One moves to books likeThe Art of Chi Kung: Making the Most of Your Vital Energy;The Way of Energy: Mastering the Chinese Art of Internal Strength with Chi Kung Exercise (A Gaia Original),Path Notes of an American Ninja Master,Journey to the Ancestral Self: The Native Lifeway Guide to Living in Harmony with the Earth Mother (Bk.1),Redneck Shaman,The Tracker, andUltimate Guide to Wilderness Living: Surviving with Nothing But Your Bare Hands and What You Find in the Woods. Still, books like this made high school bearable. The basic story is our hero goes to a counter-earth, which has a culture any high school male would enjoy. It is swords, action, women, rather better than the Forgotten Worlds series my nephew enjoys, to my mind."},{"Title":"Hunters of Gor (The Gor Series)","review":"This might have been the best Gor book to date. Tarl Cabot / Bosk of Port Kar gains more depth of character, more experience, and though he spends all book coming off like Jack Know-it-all, in the end he finds out he could have saved himself a lot of time and trouble if he had just listened to his friends who know better - but I get it, it IS hard when you think you know better than everyone else... I share his weakness."},{"Title":"Hunters of Gor (The Gor Series)","review":"Once I had doubts after first reading HUNTERS OF GOR, placing it further down on the short list of really good Gor novels than I now do. A second reading was instructional, a third enlightening. I believe HUNTERS is almost as good as PRIEST KINGS; and it completes the transformation of Tarl of Bristol into Bosk of Port Kar begun in RAIDERS OF GOR.If you have doubts, start reading HUNTERS again. You'll discover you're 50 pages in before you know it, the story flow is that engrossing. In the northern forests Bosk duplicates the same archery heroics at the end of HUNTERS as he did in the beginning of RAIDERS when slavers attacked the rencers in the marshes. The former New England professor turned red-tunicked warrior takes out dozens of enemies sniping with a longbow from the brush. Both times are convincing.I'd originally forgotten Cabot's inner dialogues in HUNTERS are funnier than anything that left the mouths of NOMADS' Harold or PLAYERS' Boots Tarsk Bit. There is an underlying comedy of manners going on when Bosk reflects often and at length about the Kajira known as Vella (Elizabeth Cardwell) after bumping into her in a tavern in the Gorean backwater Lydius. Our man from Bristol would've bought and freed her in a heartbeat, but not Port Kar's newest noxious resident. Bosk leaves Vella to stew in her own juice after a visit to one of the tavern's alcoves since the serving wench comes with the price of a cup of paga. Cabot suffers defeats real and imagined at the hands of panther girls and Marlenus; plus mental setbacks aplenty as his delusional ambitions, nonexistent renewal of vows with Talena, and Telima doing a runner on him drive him nuts. So throughout the book he takes petty comfort in his lot being superior to Vella's, who previously disobeyed his wishes in the Sardar and, worse, went bye-bye on his Ubar of the Skies. At least a dozen times in various portions of the novel Bosk's thoughts turn to Miss Cardwell and, as his self-esteem shrinks and his paranoia grows, he reiterates: 'She had gambled, she had lost.' The embittered gag gets funnier and funnier each time he repeats it.The single most hilarious comment in any Gor book occurs when Bosk becomes thoughtfully concerned that a coffle of slave girls he's secured in the woods might grow hungry or malnourished during his absence. To correct this situation he brains a Gorean rat and feeds it to them raw. I had to stop reading for several minutes after Norman induced a laughing fit via Cabot's deadpanned delivery of the line: 'One girl did not care to feed.' Friends who've also read the book told me the same hilarity overtook them.Before the fat lady sings Tarl/Bosk recollects the honor he lost back in RAIDERS in HUNTERS OF GOR, in retrospect one of the finest hours of the Counter-Earth cycle."},{"Title":"Hunters of Gor (The Gor Series)","review":"A lot of people seem to think Norman goes off track during Captive and thereafter. I disagree. Captive is different but still goood. Hunters is as good as any of the previous books. If you llked the first 6, you'll like Hunters. It's no better, nor worse than those books."},{"Title":"Hunters of Gor (The Gor Series)","review":"While I enjoy the Gorean series for adventure and some fantasies I will first give a bit of background of myself. I am far from a politically correct woman and celebrate the enjoyment of consensual safe exciting BDSM with my life partner for years. I can also appreciate BDSM fantasies that are too heavy to act on, they are simply fantasies. However, I think John Norman's constant bombardment of his philosophy that women are never happy unless they are slaves broken down in the the cruelest manner possible crosses a line. The cruelty towards slaves gets worse with every book. A few examples, using women as live bait in the water to hunt for rats, keeping a woman in a freezing room for hours until her lips turn blue and she submits. To me this is a flaw in his writing. I know he is a professor of Philosophy. All I can imagine is that he might have had women in positions of authority over him or bad experiences with women. Just like Michel Angelo painted some of the people he disliked in hell in his very famous ceiling painting, these same women may have turned up as female characters in his Gor novels."},{"Title":"Hunters of Gor (The Gor Series)","review":"I started reading the series from the beginning and am progressing through it, just having finished reading the \\"Hunters of Gor.\\"The story line was good and answered a few questions about Elizabeth Cardwell and Talena but left me wondering if the was the last we might read of Miss Elizabeth Cardwell of New York.As has been the case so far, Tarl finds himself in situations that appear to have no way for him to extricate himself from and yet he manages to escape and survive.I like it though. Granted, the prose is somewhat stiff at times (a characteristic of the novels I've read so far) but I cannot help finding myself caught up in Tarl's adventure and anxious to see how they turn out.Most of the major characters have been mentioned in the previous books so it is just not Tarl that we learn more about. I think this reappearance of previous characters makes for interesting reading and helps to build an interest for later novels. It left me curious to obtain the next volume in the series to see how Tarl fares upon his return to Port Kar after being grievously wounded.For the most part I found the book mostly readable and at times rather enjoyable. A good read for fans of the Gor series."},{"Title":"Hunters of Gor (The Gor Series)","review":"This is the last Gor novel in which we see Tarl Cabot in his weak \\"Earth man\\" guise. His failings are manifest in this book, and like in Raiders of Gor, it causes the reader to feel more empathy towards him, by making him less of a master swordsman and more of a man who's lost his way. This novel sets up the epic Maurauders of Gor in which he finally triumphs over weakness and becomes a true Gorean.Though this book is replete with his failings, Tarl did \\"recollect his honor\\" at the conclusion. I enjoyed the telling of his very complicated relationship with Marlenus of Ar, the only male in the series portrayed as more dominant than Tarl - and the only male that Tarl openly expresses his jealousy of.For me, this is one of the more enjoyable Gor books."},{"Title":"Hunters of Gor (The Gor Series)","review":"Three lovely women were keys to the Tarl Cabot's career on Gor, Earth's orbital counterpart. They were: Talena, daughter of Gor's greatest ruler and once Tarl's queen; Elizabeth Cardwell, who had been Tarl's comrade in two of his greatest exploits; and Verna, haughty chief of the untamed panther women of the northwestern forests. 'Hunters of Gor' finally reveals the fate of these three--as Tarl Cabot ventures into the wilderness to pit his skill and his life against the brutal cunning of Gorean outlaws and enemy warriors."},{"Title":"Hunters of Gor (The Gor Series)","review":"To be sure, I was ready to be open-minded. Some people like s/m/b/d fiction, heck, I've even written some. I like classic pulp fiction, of which this is a late, but not bad example. I'm aware that there are women, intelligent, confident, attractive women, who like the books, and even want to live the life of a collared slave. And then...Perhaps I ought to have read the first book first, though many people consider this a fairly representative book of the series. I got about two-thirds of the way through. And then...I just hit a wall.OK, so Gorean women love being slaves. (Except for Panther Women, who hate men, and get all hot and bothered because they can't have normal sex.) OK, so why do you have to tie them up all the time? And, although they mention housework (I'm kind of amused at the fact that this includes ironing, since there seems to be few clothes that really need it.) no one seems to do any, since that would mean less time for hanky-panky. The forests are supposed to be jumping with panthers and sleen, which means that there's more megafauna than there are prey species. Men are always screaming the equivalent of \\"Resistance is futile!\\" and \\"Obey or die!\\" which means the ladies all start with the waterworks and pleading: here again, they're supposed to *like* this kind of treatment. And of course, if Norman/Cabot is supposed to be comfortable with the arrangement, then why does he feel as if he has to explain (and explain, and explain) why women and men are the way they are.In real life, slaves, and people forced into coercive living situations, tend to adapt, not by some mystical \\"surrender\\" but by becoming simply cynical and resisting in other ways -- African-American society is built on it, and people have reported doing the same thing in concentration camps and other places. (On the 'master' side, nothing is worse than having someone obey you for the wrong reasons.) Fantasy slavery works, if only because the 'slave' is usually the one who's really in charge: no matter how bad the bad boy is in your dreams, he's unlikely to do anything you *really* don't like.But don't you like the *book*? No, not really. It made me want to read Harry Harrison's Deathworld, if only to feel heroic and slightly silly."},{"Title":"Hunters of Gor (The Gor Series)","review":"By the eighth installment in the Gor series, John Abnorman had almost completely jettisoned the Burroughs pastiche of the early books and by now had given the series over completely to his obsessive topic: women are only happy when they are enslaved. They love being raped and even beg for it. They are joyful when a knife is held to their throat, or when they have a chain around their neck and have to heel, like a dog.After the first six books, one Gor book is pretty much the same as another. There is a wafer-thin plot, which is just an excuse for windy disquisitions on why woman should be enslaved, raped, and beaten, because it's what makes them happy. It's worth noting that the women in the series are almost all abducted from Earth, as if Earth girls are somehow more attractive than plain old Gorean girls. Perhaps Abnorman is indulging his fantasies about some of his educated female colleagues.Incidentally, Abnorman loves to use the words \\"incidentally\\" and \\"interestingly\\" ad nauseam, during his lengthy lectures of Gorean culture. Sometimes he will say \\"incidentally\\" two or three times in a single page. In one book (I think it's this one) he actually says \\"Incidentally and interestingly\\". Interesting.90% of these books are more or less xeroxed from the same boilerplate. It's the same tired old scenario every time, with a mere excuse for a plot. After the first six books in the series, which were a lot of fun, I browsed through a few later installments, hoping to find something like adventure entertainment. But there's not enough to make it worth wading through the incredible tedium of interminable dialogues on slavery, over and over and over again.Incidentally and interestingly, there is no actual sex in these books. There are allusions to it but no actual descriptions. In that sense, interestingly, it is perversely a bit like Burroughs, whose romanticism was extremely prudish.Still, this series enjoyed a cult following in the 70s and 80s, and appeals to those who like S & M.

But I must tell you, this is one of the greatest deceptions I have ever seen from a book publisher.The words TECHNIQUE & MATERIALS for example. What this book is mostly about is drawing \\"MATERIALS\\", and very little, less than 10% about drawing \\"techniques\\". Sure, I admit, there is something in this 96 page book on \\"Hatching\\" & \\"Cross-Hatching\\". But that's about all there is on drawing \\"technique\\". For that matter, I think HATCHING & CROSSHATCHING are covered in about every drawing book ever printed.All of that cover language about \\"STEP-BY-STEP\\" you can forget. It is not there. There may be \\"steps\\"; but only steps on in terms of different drawing mediums, and not the usual facets of drawing technique such as Figure Drawing, Landscape, Perspective. The majority of the text is a coverage of MATERIALS, all kinds of drawing materials, and the author would have you learning all of them at once, which is entirely impractical.Remember, this book is about BEGINNERS. It claims also to be a \\"COMPLETE, STEP-BY-STEP....etc.\\" and to teach TECHNIQUES. I cannot imagine any beginner, just learning how to draw, who needs to learn about all the variety of drawing mediums when starting out. Usually, it is suggested that a BEGINNER use pencil or charcoal. If this book were primarily about pencil or charcoal, and was thorough in drawing TECHNIQUE with either pencil or charcoal, it would make sense. It just does not make sense.

What begins as a documentary becomes a story that wraps the author into its own telling. If you've ever been a religious skeptic, Dorsey's careful journalistic discipline will comfort your appreciation of an objective accounting of the people in the congregation, their possible motives, their habits, decisions, attitudes, and the consequences of their thoughts. Likewise, if you have ever become aware of your own faith journey, Dorsey's keen-edged portrait of his own emerging search will drive the story in your direction. Skeptic or believer, the level of writing matches the complexity of story and the observer's growing relationship with the subjects. I kept holding my breat, waiting for Dorsey to take easy shots at the vulnerable or to become squishy about acting on one's faith. That never happened. But what is a breath of fresh air is Dorsey's willingness to drop an easy skepticism and do the hard work of real reporting. If you've ever been a member of a congregation of any denomination or faith, this book will ring true to you.

Fisk, St. Joseph, MIGary Dorsey, professional writer, seeking to write a \\"different book\\" chose to spend a year with a New England Congregational church whose history dates back to 1630. \\"How I wondered could Van (the senior pastor) lead an authentic spiritual journey in a place where the rehearsal and preparation for any event could no longer be separated, even by death or miracles, from the steady downpour of timebound courtesy and customs? How could he continue to promise growth if the congregation kept getting mired in the sucking mud of church politics and bad theology? Worship-making wore on and on like a particularly vile brand of Protestant water torture.\\" Although too frequent committee meetings with time consuming discussions drained the pastor's spiritual resources, nevertheless at other times he would encounter unexpected moments of great depth. \\"Just a few weeks ago a devoted member, had fallen down a set of stairs and broken his hip. He was getting his affairs in order as he lay dying. Van stayed only for a short while, but before he left the bedside, the old fellow touched his hand and blessed him with the benediction. What had he done to deserve that?\\" The author provides abundant humorous relief with accounts such as: \\"Dick McCarthy filled in for Fran by playing solo piano at Sunday morning services. Unlike the formal, liturgically correct pieces chosen by Francis Angelo, Dick McCarthy's relaxed repertoire masked a capricious jazz style. Slowing rhythms to a meditative pulse and draping cloudy flourishes around melodic lines, he played \\"Old Man River,\\" Mack the Knife,\\" and \\"I Did It My Way\\" all summer without anyone noticing.'From the signs in and about the church the congregation seemed to be more interested in their history than their religion.

The task of coming to terms with such a loss is what faces the protagonist of Kuhlman's debut novel, set in early '90s Illinois. The book follows the Harrelson family as they struggle to keep living in the wake of the their golden-child Francis' death at age 19. The bulk of the story revolves around Stephen, an engagingly clever and imaginative13-year-old, although ample time is given to 9-year-old Crispy, their parents Gene and Helen, Stephen's next-door neighbor girlfriend Nicole, and Francis' college girlfriend. While the temptation must have been strong to concentrate on Stephen and his story, it's greatly to Kuhlman's credit that he's able to take us into the heads of all these other characters and come to care about each and every one.As with so many families subject to such tragedy, the four remaining members cope by drifting apart into their own worlds. The barely communicating parents start sleeping in separate bedrooms. Ever-distant Gene spends more and more time sitting in his furniture shop with the blinds down and the \\"Closed\\" sign on the door. Meanwhile, Helen robotically goes through the motions of life until driven to a satisfying act of violence which leads to some long-overdue introspection. Crispy retreats into television and fantasies of being swept away by Mark Wahlberg (at that time he was a preteen idol known for his awful band and his Calvin Klein abs, I mean ads). However, it's Stephen we spend the most time with, as he has visions of his brother over the course of the year and tries to understand why he died. His main outlet is a quasi-autobiographical superhero comic-book he writes, Nicole illustrates, and they self-publish together. In what might be considered a gimmick (not by me, however), parts of these comic books appear in the novel, adding another layer to the storytelling and providing a particularly effective window into Stephen's grief.In general, I tend to stay away from novels and films about tragedy and dysfunctional families. There are enough tough things to deal with in our own lives that I'm not particularly keen to use leisure time to grapple with fictional representations of even more. However, this is one of the few such works I can wholeheartedly recommend. Yes, it's very sad to see this family slowly fall apart, and the parents are especially painful figures to follow. But it's also hard not to root for Stephen to make it though the hard times and realize happiness with Nicole. There's a lot of gentle humor and sweetness that never gets cloying, and Kuhlman's simple, straightforward prose sets just the right tone. A very solid first novel about a very tough topic, skillfully handled. If you like Mark Jude Poirier, John McNally, or Tom Perrotta, check this out."},{"Title":"Wolf Boy: A Novel","review":"On January 9, 1993, the Harrelson family's lives were changed forever. That was the day they got word that eldest son Francis, a budding mycologist, was killed in an auto accident in a car driven by his fiancee, Jasmine, who survived. Each Harrelson deals with grief in a different way: father Gene hides in his furniture store with the CLOSED sign on the door and considers cheating on his wife with a former employee -- their already extant marital problems are brought into sharp relief by the extra stressor of Francis's death.Meanwhile, sister Crispy writes letters to pop star Marky Mark (of Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch), asking him to come rescue her, and figuring out a way to meet up with him in the meantime; and mother Helen walks the ledge of a nervous breakdown before seeking help from a support group.Only Stephen channels his grief for the loss of his big brother and best friend (and his visions of Francis swimming in the sky) into something creative -- a superhero comic book called The Adventures of Wolf Boy, with art by Stephen's girlfriend, Nicole Strussman. This and Stephen's other attempts to keep Francis's memory alive are saddening and joyous, making me wish I knew the boy personally.In one of the most blazingly original bursts of creative brilliance I have seen in quite some time, first-time novelist Evan Kuhlman (his short stories have appeared in Glimmer Train Stories, among others) has combined the literary family-grief story (think Ordinary People without the downer ending) with the superhero comic in his debut, Wolf Boy. Interspersed within the story of a family's loss are panels of The Adventures of Wolf Boy. (The comic is actually illustrated by identical twins Brendon and Brian Fraim -- check out examples of their clean lines and traditional approach at Fraimworks.)In Wolf Boy, Kuhlman combines the best parts of John Irving, Jonathan Lethem, and Jonathan Franzen. This semi-autobiographical tale (Kuhlman lost his own brother at a young age) charms and delights; Kuhlman has managed to focus on a sad subject without making it depressing. The comic was a terrific idea, and watching how it parallels the novel's story is a wonder. But I especially admired how Kuhlman realistically portrayed the family's relationship with Jasmine following the accident -- a gradual separation followed by an almost complete cut-off, with only the smitten Stephen still in contact. One day she's practically their daughter, the next she's a pariah. It's maybe not the right way to do things, but it's the way that often goes.I was consistently surprised by Kuhlman's choices in Wolf Boy. Not only in the imaginative format of the novel, but also in the way Kuhlman never makes the expected choices with his characters. He doesn't seem to have favorites, treating all of them with equal respect. This, in turn, causes us to root for all of them to successfully get through their struggles and come out stronger on the other side. And the ambiguous ending allows us to think that it might actually happen, if not necessarily soon."},{"Title":"Wolf Boy: A Novel","review":"To steal and change a line from a Tom Cruise flick, \\"You had me at Prologue.\\" This book opens with a bit of a shock to the system, a fine young man has died, and follows the lives of those affected by the loss, especially the family, especially the younger son Stephen, over the next year. The writing is clear and captivating, and the included comics, a surprise, fit well and added much to the story. There are also some humorous moments, which you might not expect in a book like this, but they came off as quite natural. I truly cared about each of the characters, especially Stephen and his oddball girlfriend Nicole and his sister Crispy, which is quite rare for me (at most I usually only care about the protagonist, if that). If you are looking for something sweet, sad, and original, give this book a try."},{"Title":"Wolf Boy: A Novel","review":"This debut novel took my breath away. It's so haunting and real in its depiction of grief and loss, and yet realistically portrays a typical dysfunctional family as well as coming-of-age: while Stephen tries to grapple with the death of his idol, he is also trying to deal with his first kiss, going to high school, and how to reach his estranged father. All very relatable themes. I highly recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Wolf Boy: A Novel","review":"This novel is both wonderfully strange and wonderfully written, sort of literary fiction but with added comics. When I first heard about this novel I was worried that the comics would be cutesy or distract from the plot, but that wasn't the case at all, they fit in perfectly (especially when I got to know Stephen, the protagonist) and added much to the book, though I wouldn't mind if there had been one or two more. The subject of the novel is tough, the loss of a cherished son, but the writing is strong and the characters are endearing (though Gene, the father, will test your patience), and the art is as good as any comic book art you'll find. I read this book in two days instead of the more typical two weeks, probably because I had two concerns weighing on me, what happens to Stephen and girlfriend and his family, but also what happens to their comic book counterparts, the Laredos and Lila Butterfly. If you're looking for something unique and satisfying and a little bit odd, I'd highly recommend this book. I don't think you'll need to love comics to love this novel, since they only make up about 10-15 percent of the book. I've never seen anything like Wolf Boy and wonder if it will spur some imitations/rip-offs, and I do hope there will a sequel by the author (Kuhlman) and the illustrators before too long. Quite a debut."},{"Title":"Wolf Boy: A Novel","review":"I'll be honest, what drew me to the book when I first ordered my copy way back when was the illustrators, the Fraim Brothers. As a comic fan very familiar with their work, I chose to support another of their projects, even if they were second-string on the bill.In any event, as I finally got around to read the book, I couldn't put it down. \\"Wolf Boy\\" may be a misleading title, considering it's mature subject matter of the unexpected death of a young family member. Evan Kuhlman, who I had never heard of before, makes you feel for every single character in the book. The depth of emotion felt off the page is unimaginable until you read it. It stunned me that this book, in it's intensity, cleverness, humor and availability to multiple demographics, didn't become more of a hit or even win an award.Don't let the addition of the comic illustrations fool you, they are as much a part of the story as the text is, even stirring what I believe to be the redemption of one of the characters. Read it to see what I mean!I highly recommend this title to anyone who likes to read, loves character driven stories and doesn't mind a semi-ambiguous ending. I personally feel the book ended on a good note, it left me wanting more. Which is more than I ever expect out of many books I get these days."},{"Title":"Wolf Boy: A Novel","review":"An enjoyable, imaginative, observant, well-written and all-around excellent book that you will want to read straight through. Yes you will. You can get the details from Compulsive Reader, Amazon, the book jacket..."},{"Title":"Wolf Boy: A Novel","review":"Even Kuhlman's debut novel, \\"Wolf Boy,\\" treats a common literary theme -- a family's response to the death of a beloved son -- with uncommon insight, tenderness and sympathy. The author understands that grief seeks expression in a variety of ways, some constructive, others destructive. When Francis Harrelson dies as the result of an unexpected car crash, his parents and siblings find themselves disintegrating by the centripetal forces of loss and despair. Kuhlman's compassionate treatment of those who bear the brunt of mourning makes \\"Wolf Boy\\" a sensitive examination of how the heart finds the ability to heal itself.Thirteen-year-old Stephen Harrelson emerges as the pivotal character of the novel. Acutely aware of his marginal status in the family and bruised by his understanding that his parents favored either Francis or his younger sister, Stephen grasps the reality that he must, on his own, come to grips with a stunning loss. His technique is the creation of a comic-book super hero, Wolf Boy, whose fantastic abilities in combating evil compensate for Stephen's powerlessness in confronting death. Wolf Boy's willingness to face danger, fight wrong and accept his unique physiological and psychological make-up symbolizes the confused and anguished boy's hopes for release from pain.As a novel, \\"Wolf Boy\\" travels in a unique direction. Kuhlman collaborates with two comic book artists, Brendon and Brian Fraim, and incorporates Stephen's comic book into the text. This inclusion gives \\"Wolf Boy\\" the texture of a graphic novel and permits the reader to actually see the product of the teenager's imagination. Stephen's imagined family mirrors that of his real life. His father has been broken by the death of the oldest son; he retreats from life and nurses a sense of cosmic injustice but refuses to act as guardian of the household. Stephen's mother shuts down and then melts down; the imagined version portrays her as a sympathetic android whose emotional control system has gone terribly awry. Stephen's girlfriend, Nicole, whose encouragement and rough-edged fondness inspire Stephen, emerges from a cocoon as Lila Butterfly.Kuhlman is not above tweaking social workers and psychologists who rigidly adhere to the five-step process of grief. When Stephen's mother assaults an office clerk and his father wrestles with his conscience in deciding whether or not to have an affair with an employee, the author reminds us that dealing with death is no tidy, linear process. Instead, each of his characters reflects a myriad of emotions, ranging from detachment to anger, resentment to kindness, surliness to congeniality. One of the delights of \\"Wolf Boy\\" is that we never know what emotion will surface.Although the novel has some trouble with voice and several of its episodes defy belief, \\"Wolf Boy\\" satisfies. Evan Kuhlman knows that even the most imperfect of families contain elements of resiliency and that even the most brokenhearted of children discover the resources to face, comprehend and accept death."},{"Title":"Wolf Boy: A Novel","review":"I knew nothing about the novel \\"Wolf Boy\\", or its author Evan Kuhlman when I picked it up at the library. I was drawn to the title of the book and the idea of a family coping after a lost loved one, but what sold me was the graphic storyline of \\"Wolf Boy\\". A comic book infused into a novel! What a great idea. I am a big fan of graphic novels and love to read novels, but combining the two, well, that would be like mixing chocolate and peanut butter. A yummy idea that can't miss.This book is about a family that is torn apart by the death a Francis, the oldest of three children. Stephen, the middle child, feels that not only has he lost an older brother that he idolizes, but he also lost his mother and father, both who are so grief-stricken that they become empty shelled aliensto him. Stephen's only recourse is to deal with his lost by creating a comic book character called \\"Wolf Boy\\" with the help of his already off-balanced girlfriend Nicole.I find it hard to actually pinpoint the main voice of this book. Stephen is definitely the glue that holds the story together, but the mother and father, I think, are the true voices of this story. They already had marriage troubles before Francis died (Gene and Helen have separate bedrooms). Watching them shamble around like zombies you want to take and smack them a good one and say \\"Stop grinding your gears about what happen to your dead son and concentrate on your two live ones. Concentrate on what you have and not what you lost.\\"Bottom line: The graphic comic book infused in \\"Wolf Boy\\" didn't move the story along as well as I would have liked, but the idea is still a bold move. The characters didn't seem to blend well together, which, in this case, works because this is a family in trouble. The family feels like a real family that at one time worked fine but now is broken. Great job for a first novel."},{"Title":"Wolf Boy: A Novel","review":"An excellent story about loss, art and the excruciatingly slow healing process. I'm a bit puzzled as to why \\"Wolf Boy\\" didn't receive more exposure. I suspect that when people looked at the book and the subject matter they assumed the story would focus mainly on the comic book aspect of the novel, and wrote it off as a glorified graphic novel. I feel sorry for those who did because they've missed out.The Wolf Boy sequences are well drawn (by brothers Brendon and Brian Fraim) and told, revealing the discord in the family and clarifying the themes of death and creation. But Wolf Boy is only part of the story and it's the family's all too real despair and struggles over the next year that kept me turning the pages. The father drifts off into a lazy affair and lets his business suffer, the mother sinks into a depression so deep that she can barely feel anything (the subplot involving multiple death certificates is an excellent detail), the young daughter wants to run away and the surviving son takes his grief (and visions he keeps having of his dead brother) and creates an alternate world.I had no idea of who Evan Kuhlman was before reading this novel but now I'd like to see what he does next. I'm hoping that with the inevitable paperback release of this novel that its reputation grows and finds a larger audience. This isn't a book to be missed; if you did look at it once in the library or a bookstore and then put it down, pick it up again."},{"Title":"Amanda/Miranda (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"If you got swept away by the simple story of life, love, and loss presented by the film Titanic, you should enjoy this book as well. The ill-fated luxury liner does play a key part in the novel, but there is so, so much more. Amanda is a snobby, spoiled rich girl. Miranda is a good-natured, soft-spoken peasant girl who becomes her maid. Their personalities clash in every way. They are completely different, except for one vital detail--they look exactly the same (although they are not related). Scheming Amanda realizes that she can use this similarity to her advantage. The plot twists and turns. And there are lies, lies, lies. The characters' lives are dramatically changed forever, as a result of all these lies told. Yes, the title of the book reflects the names of the two main characters, but there is a much deeper meaning to the title. Miranda becomes Amanda. Just what exactly do I mean by that? You'll find out if you read the book. Believe me, it's worth your time. My compliments go out to Richard Peck, who did a wonderful job. He managed to write a thoroughly intriguing story that you do not want to end. When the text runs out on the last page, you are, somewhat, left hanging. But, all in all, the novel is neatly contrived. Amanda/Miranda has been my absolute favorite book ever since I read it. It changed me. It made me laugh. It made me cry. Day after day of reading it made me start talking in genuine English terms (the story is set in Great Britain, during the early 1900s). This book made me think about how sometimes it seems that everything is connected on a higher level. How everything seems to work out a certain way, as if it was always intended to do so.

A few things that I saw the same in the book and the actual sinking of the Titanic were when Miranda was on the great ship, she described the people that were on the ship in first and second class. People such as, Molly Brown and Mr. and Mrs. Macy. Another similarity was the description she gave when only a few people on the sinking ship knew that the ship had hit an iceberg and that they were sinking. Some of the upper-class men and women thought nothing of it and did not bother to put on their lifejackets only to be the first ones escorted off the Titanic.

The historical period clothing and home decor are vibrantly described, especially by a male writer.I picked this book up originally because of the fact that a voyage on the Titanic figures prominently in the story; however, the interlude does not seem terribly original, and a lot of what happens is foreshadowed quite heavily earlier in the book.Otherwise, though, I did enjoy the majority of the book."},{"Title":"Amanda/Miranda (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Amanda/Miranda was abridged in 1999 from the original 1980 version.

Amanda is wealthy while Miranda (as named by Amanda) is but her maid.The mistress/maid situation allows for interesting events through the lives of the pair, both in society as well as romance. Their lives are entwined till death, along with the men in their lives. There is scarcely a moral line drawn in the affairs of Amanda/Miranda. Eventually, in a timely fashion, Amanda, with Miranda attending, takes a voyage to her American fiance via the Titanic. The portion of the book about the fictional character and the activity before, during, and after the sinking, adds an interesting perspective on the Titanic story. That is not unlike the movie, which, however, was NOT taken from this book.Events following the sinking, add story related to WWI, and the affairs of marriage in a peculiar situation. Other than saying that, I'll avoid spoiling the story for a new reader. The book offers history, romance, suspense, and a look at class-life in the early 20th century. WELL WORTH THE PRICE.I hope to find myself a 1980 copy and compare. If the 1999 revision is worth 5 stars, what is the original like?Recommended as an adult book. Being conservative and older, I'd not buy it as a gift for a teenage grandchild. But on the other hand, if it were a movie, it would be rated PG in today's world. It would likely have been rated \\"sinful,\\" in 1911, the year the book's story begins."},{"Title":"Amanda/Miranda (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I really loved this book because of it's historical back round and it's story.

It is very methodical and it gives younger students concrete tools that they can use. It helps students break away from boring, static 5-paragraph themes that state the painfully obvious.I use the book as the only textbook in a college-level Rhetoric and Writing class. The book is honestly a revelation for most of my students, and it improves their writing and thinking exponentially.The book does suffer from tone problems, and it is occasionally condescending. It does indeed relate to the reader as a teen/novice, but then again that is who the book is for. It is also not the book for those who need help with style, basic clarity or grammar.

It proves to be a timeless classic to me. Many times when I try and sit down to read a book I can read it for a while but eventually slip away from it, and never finish what I started. I found this to be one of those books that kept me interested the whole time though. The one thing I would compare this book to would have to be the classic sitcom Seinfeld. The reason for this is simply because they are both very well written and regard things we all relate to in some way, but in the end when all is said and done don't have a major plot to it that really jumps out at you. Of course I do not mean this in the bad way at all. I really enjoyed this intricate and groundbreaking way the whole book is brought together. The book is narrated the whole way through by the main character, Holden Caulfield, starting as he has just recently been expelled from his last school, Pencey Prep. Pencey Prep is different from most other schools. To attend the school you must stay in dorms they have like you would for college. It is also broken into semesters with a christmas break splitting up the 2 semesters. The Catcher in the Rye takes you on Holden's journey as he decides to leave Saturday night before everyone else who will be going home for Christmas break on that next Wednesday. It follows him as he travels around New York. He isn't going home yet because he is waiting for his parents to get the letter of his expulsion and giving them time to cool off. Although it is many people's belief that Holden is, as he would call himself, &quot;a madman&quot;, as I read the book I couldn't help but relate myself to him in some ways. He really is the epitome of a teenage guy in many ways, just in a way over-dramatized. It's my belief he really has a good heart. It's just sad he doesn't see anyone's actions as &quot;real&quot;. He interacts with everyone the same as most teenagers really, he just won't see past the negative in people. It's funny how he creates excuses for things just like any teen would too. For example he's &quot;never in the right mood&quot; to call Jane, a neighbor of his when he's at home, who you can tell he has a big crush on. This is really in my perspective just him doing what all of us seem to do by creating an excuse he views as a good reason not to do something that he really wants to do deep inside. I think he does this because of fear of rejection in some ways and also nervousness. The one thing he never will put down is his family. I really like the fact that no matter what other flaws you may see in him u will not see a moral decay when you look at the way he treats his family. He loves and respects all his family members and is very genuine in his feelings for them. The book basically concentrates on Holden, the main character, struggling with great depression that's overcome him. He can't get away from it. He tries to overcome it by talking with others all the time but keeps turning the people he talks with away for some flawed reason. He's trying to fit in this society but at the same time pushing himself away. We all can relate to this, especially as teens, when you want to see the reasons behind things we all are obligated to do, such as getting our education in school, but sometimes find ourselves becoming fed up with the way our system is. I hold this up as one of the best books I have read to date, and highly recommend you read this book no matter who you are."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"\\"The Catcher in the Rye,\\" is one of the books in my life that I had actually taken the time to read and enjoy. I first heard about the book from a friend, and he told me it was one of the most enjoyable books he had ever read. I was shocked to hear this, because my friend is one of those kids that only reads a book if he has to, and he usually doesn't enjoy anything he reads. So, I took his advice and read \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" and to my surprise, I wasn't able to put the book down. The reasons I couldn't stop reading was that I enjoyed the fact that I was reading about a kid who is roughly my age who has a lot of problems and events going on in his life, just like any other teenager.Holden, who is the main character in the story, is one of the reasons why I liked the book. Holden is someone who I would say to be a semi-normal teenager. He is normal in the fact that he isn't sure about the world, and he always wants to experience what others are experiencing. He constantly feels the need to be sexually involved with a woman, and goes to such extent as to flirt and dance with women that are 3 times as old as he is. Holden's character is very entertaining, because he is so rebellious. One way he is rebellious is the fact that he has failed out of three schools, and when the story begins, he has just failed out of his fourth. He entertained me because, he is always mad about something. He likes a girl named Jane Gallagher, who he has dated in the past, but his roommate Stradlater is dating her now. This angers Holden, because Stradlater is constantly teasing Holden about what he does with Jane. Holden attempts to fight Stradlater, but Stradlater is to strong and the fight ends up with Holden getting a bloody nose, which shows Holden's cocky side.Even though Holden is going through a tough time in his life, he still has time for his sister Phoebe, who is the one person that makes him happy. Holden's love for Phoebe is another reason why I enjoyed the book. I liked the fact that being a big brother to his sister was important to him, it helped show Holden's softer side. When he got kicked out of school, his sister Phoebe was the only family member that he personally told. He never even told his parents that he was kicked out of school. That proved to me that Phoebe was very important in Holden's life, and that he was most comfortable around her.Overall, I would have to say that \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" is a great book. I was glued to the book the whole way through. The only aspect of the book that I didn't completely enjoy was the ending. When the book is concluded, it leaves the reader without a conclusion of Holden's story. Instead, it allows the reader to decide and predict what will happen to Holden as he journeys to his new school and how the rest of his life turns out. \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" is a very easy book to read and will be able to keep your attention throughout the whole story."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield cocks a skeptical eye on everything &quot;phony&quot; in mid-20th century American life. He's a flawed but funny narrator.Also recommended: Too Much of Nothing, by Michael Scott Moore, for a sharp take on pretense and high school in the mid-1980s."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"There are two kinds of books in my opinion, one is the kind of book which you hope it never has an ending, but it ends quickly. The other kind of book is the one that you want it to end quickly, but it&iexcl;s so boring and looks like takes forever to finish it.The catcher in the rye is the first kind of book. It ends so quickly before you start to realize it. The author J.D. Salinger portrayed the character so well that it almost sounded like the book is written vividly through the mind of a 16-year-old teenager. The book explores character&iexcl;s mind but not really showing the motive of his actions. Therefore there is a lot of space for the reader to kind of guess of what is going on in the character&iexcl;s mind. Salinger uses little symbolism and he doesn&iexcl;t focus on imagery descriptions.The theme of this book grabs the reader in; it is dealing about how teenager always think there believes are correct and would not accept other people&iexcl;s opinion or think about challenging their own. This kind of viewpoint that is used to look at the world will create and cause the generation gap to occur.The generation gap is often used to express the contradiction and the dispute between parental expectation and teenager&iexcl;s behavior. Most of the time teenagers are facing lots of unknown and can&iexcl;t figure the way out. The harder they tried the more depress they might get. That&iexcl;s the depression which is all that mattered. You can retreat to the shell for safety or try again facing another unknown or even go to diminish yourself. It&iexcl;s not so easy for the signs of depression to ware off. Nevertheless you have to live with it and each time when one faces a different situation they have to take it in an optimistic way or either a negative way.What&iexcl;s more, J.D Salinger imitate the writing style of an immature narrator and thoroughly captured his emotions which are why I appreciate this book so much that not only it is well written but I can also relate to Holden Caulfield who are one of those teenagers who are very conservative and wanting to keep the innocence of childhood alive. Sometimes I feel the same way too from which captures me and fascinated me about how this book is written so the reader can judge the narrator with their own perspective and experience. Because I believe that everyone has their own story to tell and uncertainties in life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"After you read this book, go search out the Too Much Joy song, &quot;William Holden Caulfield&quot;. It's on the Cereal Killers release.&quot;They called me William Holden Caulfield; it was no compliment. What's wrong with William Holden Caulfield? All that stuff that bummed me out ten years ago still bums me today, and boy I wanna know - who died and made you my mom and me some stupid kid? How can we forget all those things we did?&quot;&quot;I'm afraid of people who like Catcher In The Rye. Yeah I like it too, but someone tell me why people he'd despise say I feel like that guy. I don't wanna grow up cause I don't wanna die.&quot;I'm just a few months away from turning 40. Maybe it's my midlife crisis that caused me to want to go back and reread this book for the umpteenth time. I go back and read it every few years, and it always moves me. The line from the song notwithstanding, I think alot of people relate to Holden, because alot of us are still struggling to figure out who we are - just like Holden.I've always gotten a kick out of the things that bug Holden, and how he hates them specifically, not generally. Wish I had the book in front of me, but to do that I'd have to go back into the bedroom and run the risk of waking my wife. For Holden, that would be something like &quot;It bugs me when guys are reviewing a book and won't go back into their bedrooms to get it because they are afraid of waking up their wife. I hate that.&quot; See what I mean? He says it as though it's something that has happened thousands of times over instead of something that just happened.Holden is a lovable, insecure kid who is struggling to &quot;keep it real&quot;, whatever that means. I think we all find something to relate to in his insecurity and his frustration with how the world doesn't meet with his pathological view of it. It's sad to think that high schools would have banned this book. Oh no, we can't have our students actually thinking. We just want them to feel good about themselves...It just hit me that the Replacements song &quot;Sixteen Blue&quot; fits nicely here as well. And let's not forget &quot;Roller-skate Skinny&quot; by The Old 97s. (That's how Holden described Phoebe - &quot;she's skinny. Roller-skate Skinny.&quot;) Hey, that's a good idea for a mix - what should I call it? &quot;Blues for Holden Caulfield&quot; maybe?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've heard a lot of things about this book, how it was banned, or how it drove a lot of kids to commit suicide and so I went and got it from the library, to satisfy my curiousity. I have to admit, it hooked me right at the beginning. I didn't read this book for school though, so I wasn't forced to analyze it, but I almost wished we did. I'd been expecting Holden to commit suicide at the very end, but his life turned out the way he feared it would be. I think that's worst than being dead. Sometimes, it made me laugh whenever he hit u with another of his endless wry comments. But sometimes, it makes me wonder, if it really is like the way Holden think it is. I mean, he views everyone as if they have an evil agenda lurking behind their masks. He almost convinced me that everybody are like that. It also made me think twice on how I perceived kids like Holden who get kicked-out from school. For me, they're just another bunch of losers who doesn't care for their future or their parents' money. But Holden, he is different. I mean wat kind of loser who worries about his little sister and her classmates seeing the \\"F***-You\\" vandalism on the walls and who gets depressed when he only gave 10 bucks to those nuns. And then there's the Mr. Antolini guy. I thought he was one of those person who Holden can trust and all, and then he turned out to be a pervert. Im not even gonna share Holden's doubts, but I was almost sure that he can't trust anybody anymore except for his sister and his dead brother, Allie. Im still not done thinking about this book. and that's probably why I gave it a five-star rating. It's one of those books that leaves u baffled. Most books makes things clearer to u. This book, well, let's just say, it cleared some things to me in a weird kind of way. I'm not dumb or anything, and I admit I dont understand a lot of things about Holden, but I'm pretty sure it's not a happy ending for Holden. I know how Holden feels when he told Phoebe that all he wanted to do in his life is to be this catcher of little kids on a rye field. It really is a simple dream, yet it doesn't exist. He has to go through all the garbage in the world, before he can find one good thing. It's sad when that one last good thing turned out rotten."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye is about a troubled teen by the name of Holden Caulfield. At the beginning of the book, Holden is thrown out of his highly prestigious prep school. In fact, this the 4th school that he has been expelled from. Holden is very connected to his sister and sympathizes about his dead brother a lot in the book. I am also very connected to my sibling just like him. Throughout the book Holden refers to people as being &quot;phony&quot;. I can relate to this greatly because nothing bothers me more than people expressing themselves differently than their true selves. Holden's struggles during the book were interesting to follow because at times they would remind me of my past. I specifically liked the ending because the author does not leave a definite ending. He allows the reader to create and ending in their own mind that would fit the way that they perceived the book.J.D. Salinger does a magnificent job of creating a character that can relate to so many young people. He takes the reader on a 48 hour journey of Holden's life, and it makes you never want to never put the book down. I would suggest all teenagers to read this book. In fact, I would strongly recommend this book to be a must read in high school's across the country due to its extraordinary portrayal of a troubled teen in society. I give this book 4 out of 5 stars.Mrs. Spehar is the greatest teacher in the world!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the RyeThe Catcher in the Rye was a enjoyable book. The book is told by Holden Caulfield and the days before his Christmas vacation break. He is a troubled boy with depression problems that will be visible encounter as the book is told by him. The part I thought was interesting is how a person can exclude themselves from the world and become depressed. Holden attended Pencey Prep, and all boys' school. This would be the fourth school he attended and got kicked out of or chose to leave. I believe if he is already on the fourth school, something must be wrong. I feel bad that this keeps happening to him, but it is also his fault for allowing it to happen. Holden is now being kicked out of Pencey Prep, he didn't apply himself so his grades where really poor and they asked him to leave the prep school. The major problem that he has with this world is that he thinks that everyone is phoniness. I think he is also phony because there is a guy Ackley who he can't stand but he still talks to and is kind of nice to. Holden decides to leave early from Pencey before Christmas break starts. He and his room mate got in a big fight over a girl. Holden gathers all of his belonging and catches a train to New York City where his family lives. He doesn't go home to his families' apartment. He decides to spend two days consuming alcohol and loneliness in New York. I think he should have gone home to get help from his family other then getting drunk and not solving any of his real problems. His problems were still there when he became sober the next morning. Also if he went home he wouldn't be lonely because he would have his little sister and his parents there with him. He decides once his money is gone, nothing can get any worst so he goes back home to his parent's apartment and visit his sister Phoebe. She seems to be the only person he is able to communicate with in the entire book. After talking to Phoebe he feels better and decides to see an older teacher of his before his parents get home. He visits with Mr. Antolini thinking that it would make him better but really he leaves his house feeling more depressed. He doesn't understand how hid world is so full of phoniness and thinks it is such a horrible place to grow up in. I feel bad for him because he needs help, his world can be bad but with his problem it is making it so much worst and harder for him to live in. He all the sudden decides that he is going to move West. The first person he thinks about telling first is Phoebe, he meets her in the park and watchers her with fright as she plays. Holden decides that there can be no catcher, that all you can do is hope kids develop in this harsh world on their own. Holden is now being hospitalized and recovering from his illness that had taken over him. I hope he comes out seeing the world differently and isn't as lonely, and is able to make a direction for himself. I thoroughly liked this book. It wasn't a happy cheerful book but you got to see inside someone with an illness of this kind. There are so many people suffering with this disease and it is so hard to understand how this could happen to a person but it occurs everyday."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I recently read the book The Catcher in the Rye for English class. When I first started the book I thought it was going to be another boring classic. But I was wrong. I completely loved the book.Holden Caufield is the main character and narrator of the novel. He is very cynical which I found amusing. He tells this wild story about 3 days of his life before Christmas break. As I was reading the book it seemed like a lot more than 3 days.I think Salinger did an excellent job writing this book. He wrote this book and it wasn't really based on anything. It didn't have some huge plot structure or anything fancy. The book just had extremely well developed thoughts and characters. I simply couldn't just put the book down I read almost the whole thing at once. What made me stop was the fact that it was 3 AM!On some levels I could relate to Holden's despair at being in a world full of weirdo's and wackos. And also highly dislike or hate most of the people around you. But you have to put up with them because they are the only ones around. The Catcher in the Rye is a good vehicle to demonstrate how society was taking a turn for the worse. Like in the one part he keeps talking about how sick it is how he keeps seeing \\"F@%$ You\\" written all over the wall.Salinger uses a lot of popular slang consistent with the setting of the story, which made reading tedious at times because I didn't understand half of it. But other than that this is definitely a book to read!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"If you are a person who appreciates honesty, I believe Catcher in the Rye will appeal to you. This book is one of the most honest and true books I have ever read. Holden, the main character in the book, gives his thoughts about people and everyday life. Just reading about the reality of these thoughts kept me wanting to read more the whole time. You get caught up in his opinions and views and forget that he is only a sixteen-year old boy. It was refreshing to read something and to feel like it wasn't sugar coated or only part of the truth.The book as a whole did not show an overwhelming amount of love or compassion, but there is one certain area when it did. Holden admits to not liking many people. However, the person to whom he cares most about, in my opinion, is his younger sister, Phoebe. When he shows his feelings for her, it makes the effect greater because he does not do this for anyone else. It provides an escape from all of the negativity and therefore makes you appreciate it even more so. He treats Phoebe with great love and respect, in spite of the fact that she is only a child. This warms you and lets you even more into the heart of Holden.If you look deeper into the novel, you will notice that it is about loneliness as well as the need of others. Holden's loneliness strikes out at you as throughout the book he continues on his search for a girl. He mentions at several times that he does not like being with a girl names Sally, yet he creates this extravagant idea of them sneaking off and getting married together. This shows how lonely he actually is. I believe it is easy to relate to him because he shows how he is scared of change, and in some ways, relationships. I liked that aspect of the book.Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in reading more about thought and feelings over a significant plot. I enjoyed reading it and believe many others will as well. I appreciated the truth in it and how easily it was to apply to your own life at times. Catcher in the Rye is definitely worth your time."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The first time I read this, I was in seventh grade. I liked it, but didn't really think much of it. It was only last year when I read it in my junior English class that I realized how great it really is. Whenever a teacher assigns a book to read, I am always pretty sure that I will hate it, but this was a rare exception. I think that it is essential to every high school English cirriculum, and if you didn't get to read it in high school, you definitely need to check it out. You won't be sorry!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"My review is aimed to kids 12 and over. Read this book before it is assigned in high school. The book should be read purely for enjoyment the first time around -- before it is dissected in class on topics of symbolism and foreshadowing. Not that there's anything wrong with that. I just think readers should enjoy a \\"pure\\" read first and then study it in school. The first time I read this book at age 12, I though it was the funniest book I'd ever read. When I read it again at age 14, I thought it was the saddest. I read it again at age 15 for school and was amazed at how beautiful the book was. Read it for pleasure first, read it later to learn."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a book that would suck you in within just the first paragraph. Houlden Caufield is a character that's sure to remain with you days after you are done reading the book. Throughout his journey home from being kicked out of school Houlden takes you on a trip around New York city visiting some of the places the city is infamous for and on the way you see him work out his frustration and rebellion. By the timeHoulden gets home he realizes that he can't run away from life anymore but rather live it as best as he can with what he is given.Salinger's use of profanity and his laid back and easy going tone appeals greatly to teenagers. While reading you are sure to forget that you are reading and as Houlden makes his way home you in turn leave feeling a little bit more accepting of your own life. I truly think teenagers will appreciate this book and will also gain from it immensely."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I graduated high school a couple years ago, and the years that were to supposed to be the most fun and memorable, were the worst. Some teens have good experiences, and some have bad, but surviving the bad experiences would not have seemed so worth while, were it not for Enlgish class. I was never let down by any of the authors we read, including Hugo, Salinger, Dickens, Bronte etc., but Catcher in the Rye was always my favorite. I never knew, and still do not know a book I could relate to as much as Catcher in the Rye.Holden is so three dimensional and life-like, I could almost reach out and touch him. I know I won't be the only one to say this, (or at least I hope not) but I felt as if this book was mine. If you're looking to someone to relate to, or a book to call your own, I would highly suggest reading Catcher in the Rye."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"&quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; is such a flagship book of American literature that even without reading the book, one must be familiar with the plight of Holden Caulfield. Any book/story/movie that deals with teenagers' coming-of-age angst has undoubtedly been influenced by Salinger's dual portrayl of the troubled Holden, at once insanely immature; at the other, wise beyond his years.&quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; gives us a weekend in the life of its main character, a troubled sixteen-year-old who has just been thrown out of another school for failing all subjects, except English because he is a master at writing compositions. He also credits himself to be a master at lying and always finds himself spinning wonderfully impossible yarns to strangers. Holden is disaffected and somewhat emotionally withdrawn. Through his flashbacks to the past, we learn about the death of his brother Allie and his experiences at other schools. Allie's death has affected him more than even Holden realizes and he finds himself unable to connect to anything or anyone permanently. And when he finds himself kicked out of school again, he fears having to confront his parents at home so he goes on a whirlwind trip to New York City, which only enhances his feelings of loneliness and isolation.Salinger has created a prototype character with Holden Caulfield. He is witty and wise, but at the same time foolishly naive and over-sensitive. Yet his insights into the adult world and the phonie ways that people behave are bitterly correct. Holden knows at once what he doesn't want to do or be, but couldn't tell you what he wants to do. And when he realizes what that is, it truly is one of the most eloquently written pieces of dialogue in American literature."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Some how Mr. Salinger seems to create the most real charactor, Holden Caulfeild. When i read this book i discovered how deeply Holden understood the base of the worlds problems, more than most adults. Caulfeild wants the world to stay as innocent as a childhood memory. After falling in love with Holden i started to change. I think after reading Salinger's story , everyone is caught in the rye. All people are captured by the words and willing to create new ways when the book is done."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Like Twain's &quot;HUCK FINN, Crane's RED BADGE OF COURAGE or even TO KILL A MOCKING BIRD, this coming-of-age novel is and will always remain, a classic. The novel begins with Holden, a boy in his late teens who has experienced a life with many mishaps and unjust occurrences. Pencey was the school he attended most recently, being one of many schools he had dropped out of during the past few years. He left school, ventured out on his own in the busy, chaotic city of New York. There, he met up with many acquaintances, experienced the truth in his life, and learned lessons to help improve his future. He faces the decision of what he is to do with his life, and ends up making a predictable pick. The main difference bettween either HUCK FINN or MOCKINGBIRD is that while those novels were rural, CATCHER IN THE RYE is set in New York. Still, it's amazing to see the smilarities in the two; the way all adolescents have to make decisions. There were many educational, enjoyable scenes in CATCHER IN THE RYE. One that kept me on my toes was when Holden was first beat up by his dorm mate, Stradlater. It was suspenseful, and the way he handled the situation helped reveal his personality. Another exciting part was when Holden met up with a fellow student's mother on a trolley. He told many lies to her, and ended up regretting it after he found out she was a genuine, generous woman, much unlike her own son. When the prostitute arrived at Holden's hotel room, something rotten was bound to happen. The description of this chapter kept me reading. I enjoyed reading about the way Holden described his everyday surroundings, and what he liked, disliked, which was obvious, because he was such an open character. There were many aspects that vexed me, because he was repetitive with his attitude. He seemed to despise nearly everything, all of the time. Even cheap luggage would make an impact on his judgment of a person, and he had many other prejudices along with that. At times, the writing style seemed dull and boring because he irritated the reader with meaningless remarks. Many topics that were discussed seemed quite pointless, and Holden lacked alot of common sense as a character. I would recommend this novel to readers 14 years and older. Some material is inappropriate for younger people. The book is easy to get into, and mostly keeps you interested. The main characters are complicated and easy to both adore and abhor. The book taught me a lot about life alone through the eyes of a teenager. Because of his peer pressure, he had to make many decisions that hurt him and hurt people he loved. The novel expressed bravery and a boy able to forgo his past and attempt to start a new life.Also recommended: HUCK FINN by Twain, THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE by Crane, and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger's, The Catcher in the Rye, is an exceptional portrayal of the problems and situations that teenagers experience in their lifetime. Holden Caulfield, a seventeen-year-old boy, writes about his previous expulsion from Pencey Prep. He tries to cope with the death of his younger brother, his obsession for lying, and the problem relationships with his peers and teachers. Before Holden came to Pencey Prep, he lived a hard life. His father is an obsessive businessman, and his mother has yet to recover from the death of his younger brother, Allie. Holden fails in school, tends to get drunk and uses vulgar language. Throughout the rest of the novel, Holden encounters other students and teachers that just don't understand him and give him a hard time. Mr. Spenser, his history teacher tries to be sympathetic to Holden's problems, however he fails after a while because it is sometimes frustrating communicating with Holden. The headmaster asks Holden to leave the prep school as he is failing four of five classes and not applying himself. Holden returns home, borrows money from his ten-year-old sister, Phoebe, and leaves for the night. After that night, Holden decides to leave home, for good, and head west. Phoebe begs to leave with him, but Holden refuses. He remains confused about returning to school. The novel ends with Holden in a mental institution.I thoroughly enjoyed The Catcher in the Rye because of the complex problems that Holden faces throughout the novel. Not all plotlines have to portray perfect lives of people. It is nice to have a different and unique plotline for once. It relays real-life experiences that teenagers still face today. Although this book was written 50 years ago, it remains a good lesson for children and young adults to learn today. This book kept me on the edge of my seat, wondering what was going to happen next. I read it all in about 3 hours, and I usually don't like to read books, however this book was different; I never wanted to put it down. Just remember, like Holden, be true to yourself, but don't overdo it and waste your life failing out of classes and getting drunk. The first step to success is succeeding in yourself and knowing who you are and what you have to do to succeed."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is an absolute gem. I intent to re-read to pick up on more of the symbolism. What I found especially refreshing was the depth, yet simplicity of the narrative. Absolutely gorgeous, and nothing &quot;phony&quot; about it. The prose served to methodically hammer the themes and symbolism of the book into the brain- but its simplicity makes it an especially good choice for summer reading for school. No ten syllable words to try to wrap your brain around on break! I have nothing bad to say about the book... except that some people might find language and turn of phrase objectionable. Personally, I felt like it served to enhance the feeling that you were inside a teenage boy's mind without being overly graphic- nothing like it could have been, in today's world! To make a long story short, THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is a completely rivetting book that everyone should read, whether or not they usually enjoy reading."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm 15, and not really into reading classic books, yet I love Catcher in the Rye. The plot is not exceptionally riveting, but I was completely enthralled and could not put it down. It's only when you are done reaing it that you realize what I brilliant book it is. There is nothing classic about it. Salinger is like no other classic author. It's by far the best classic ever written, and one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Indeed this is a most-famous work which while I did enjoy and do not think it completely overhyped, it wasn't exactly lifechanging.The book is supposed to be a coming-of-age (whatever that means) one, told as the narration of Holden about the days following him being kicked out of school and going to New York (where his family leaves) but deciding to go on some escapades before he tells his family.Of course, the book IS quite deep, exploring grief/loss, loneliness, cynicism, adolescence and human connections. However, I didn't really find that I related to Holden all that much. I mean of course there are many similarities between him and every other reader (most people like to think they're genuine and would share Holden's particular dislike of \\"phonies\\"), but I don't agree with a common thread I've heard about the book that it's this classic for growing up and everyong should read it and will totally relate to it. In a very interesting scene in Six Degrees of Separation, the con artist analyses this book and its relation to violence. Perhaps Salinger did not want everyone to exactly relate to Holden.What I found best and worst about the book was something else - it really creeped me out. It felt like a combination of the film Stand by Me with the novel A Clockwork Orange - bittersweet coming-of-age coupled with psychosis. The fact that Holden felt to me more like a 12 year old trying to act like an adult than a 16 year old, his obvious deep-seated depression and the way topics like sex were treated in many scenes (very interesting when you consider that the book was written in the 50s and looking at it from that perspective changes a lot) made it seem like a nightmare. But that's one of the best strengths of Catcher in the Rye - it will challenge you and get you out of the comfort zone. For me, it showed that societies that attempt to be wholesome often aren't, but rather contain many deep recesses of everything that is uncomfortable and harmful - and Holden found himself in one of those recesses.A great work that will make you think, and a special treasure if you like debating about the meaning of books."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"In J. D Salinger's Catcher in the Rye irony makes an effective \\"bang\\". Holden shifts from the adult reference of \\"sexual intercourse\\" to the slang of \\"giving it to her\\", and Adley defend his \\"goddam religion for Christssake\\". Both boys employ verbal irony unintentionally showing their place between adolescence and adulthood. Holden hears the incorrect lyrics of \\"If a body catch a body comin' through the rye\\" instead of the correct \\"if a body meet a body comin' through the rye\\". He would like to catch and genuinely help children in a field of rye as they run toward a cliff, as he has admires in the nuns he encountered. Ironically, Phoebe, whom Holden loves and respects, presents the reality of the lryic and error in Holden's compassionate desire. She tells him it is \\"meet\\" not \\"catch\\" and therefore the phoniness of those who seek to be attractive and impress, the Stradlaters and Sally Hayeses, are what is real. Holden repeatedly refers to himself as yellow, yet he has the confidence to flirt with many older women, order drinks, and insult Stradlater and Maurice, the elevator operator. Mr. Antolini's home initially is a place of refuge for Holden. He respects Mr. Antolini and feels safe with him until Antolini makes homosexual advances and once again Holden fears his environment. Holden wonders what the ducks at a pond in central park do in winter. Though he cannot function in his own world he compassionately chooses to be concerned with the ducks. Salinger successfully uses irony in diction and situation to represent the struggle between Holden's despise for phoniness and his ideal reality that has brought Holden to tell his story in a mental institution."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"So many people have told me that this book doesnt have a plot or a purpose... but i dont really care. i loved it anyways. Holden is wonderful... hes easy to relate to even when hes doing something that you yourself would never dream of doing. it reminded me of my favorite book... The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky... definately get ahold of it somehow... sit down and read it in one day and then take some time to think..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a pretty strange book. These pages cover the exploits of one Holden Caulfield, a cynical teenager in 1950s America. If I had to describe the book, I'd say it is one prolonged moment covering ~200 pages. The style is reminescent of Jack Kerouac's On the Road, but I feel Catcher in the Rye is a far superior book.I guess the common chord this book strikes with everyone is that fragile innocence of childhood. The world started out kind and simple for everyone under their parents' wing, but somewhere along the way - 'Bam!' - we're protesting the government, fighting wars and cursing out bosses under our breath. The journey between those two points is often bewildering and confusing, with qualities lost and gained in the transformation. What makes Holden particularly tragic is that he sees this loss of purity coming. In the end Holden shares the same longing of innocence heralded by William Blake and embodied by Peter Pan. Never grow up. Protect your purity. Don't sell out.Unfortunately, it's a doomed endeavor. We all get older and more cynical as youth crumbles to adulthood. But Holden holds on, and I guess what happens to him in the end is only a natural result of his efforts. Life can be very unkind if you don't play along. Some books teach, while others forecast. The worst mislead us. But a book like Catcher in the Rye helps me remember. It's a book for young and old."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield is the twentieth - century Huckleberry Finn. He is the most appealing of all figures the Literature of Adolescence has ever created. The great humor of this work, and its wonderful colloquial language make it live line by line . Fifty- three years after its publication date and many millions of readers later it continues to charm and appeal to all those who look at the various establishments of this world , with an outsider's lonely perception.I don't think a review can do justice to the work. If you really want to hear about it , read it and you won't regret it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A very well-written book. It took Mr. Salinger 10 years to complete it. It is probably hard to think and write like a teenager when you are not one.It is a first-person narration by Holden Caulfield, a 16-year old boy, who was kicked out of prep school. He spends 2-3 days in New York city on his own rather than going home to face his parents. The book describes Holden's view of the adult world, his likes and serious dislike of 'phoniness' in a very distinctive language. This coming-of-age story is a must read for everyone, especially yougsters who are in the teenage years. I wish I had read it when I was in my teens. I would have found someone I could identify with at that time (well, why deny it, even now): the way Holden's thoughts go every which way as he gets distracted and his overactive imagination about the future."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"To start off this review, I think it'd be best to point out that Holden Caulfield is one of the greatest characters in literature history. There are few characters that can claim to be as memorable, as iconic, as Holden, let alone be the kind of partner in pain to all of us that Holden has become. The only two people that could possibly be equal to what Holden has become are James Dean and Kurt Cobain, and those two aren't even involved with the world of literature. Holden Caulfield is indeed mroe than just a great character; he has become the voice of pain to all of those people are depressed for no reason, the disgruntled teenagers going through their troubled phases, the people who think that the world is full of phonies, the people who just can't fit in or become a part of society. Holden Caulfield is a symbol.We all know the plot; nothing. And this is one of the things that I have noticed that people dislike about the book, the fact the book is virtually plotless. And I have to say, I laugh at those who are so narrow minded that they can't even accept such a &quot;drastic&quot; branch off from normality as a book that is more like a series of connected events rather than a plot. I can't wait till you get to read Finnegans Wake.But, as I've already stated, the book is &quot;plotless,&quot; more like a series of events then a story, and that just contributes all the more to what the book is. The book is just a window into a mind that has come to symbolize the eternally unhappy. And what an eternally unhappy mind it is; everywhere he goes Holden calls people &quot;phonies,&quot; talks about the things that bother him, the things that sadden him, attacks the word &quot;marvelous&quot;-just pretty much Holden's stream of conscience. And as the novel goes on we follow him wherever he goes, from his professor's home (can't remember his name, or even if he was his professor) before he leaves him boarding school (can't remember that either,) to his room where he meets his roommate that he just hates, to a New York hotel, to a club, to a rendevous with a prostitute, to just about everywhere else. And through the novel we peer into his eternally unhappy mind, watch him make all sorts of observations about what's going on around him as well as life, just watching him live and exist.Hopefully, you'd think that this novel'd be for everyone. I really do doubt that there are many of us here who feel exactly the same way about exactly the same things as Holden. But there are however, many of us, millions of us, the majority of us even, who do feel for Holden. There are countless observations of his and feeling sthat went through I personally couldn't help but know, one example being the lonely depressed walk that eh takes through a New York park. And there also many among us who do feel there are at least a few &quot;phonies&quot; in the world, Holden's trademark. And if you don't feel any way in relation to Holden, not even to a minal degree, then chances are that you are one of those people that Holden attacked."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book will, as it has done to me, and to an innumerable amount of people, captivate and enthrall you at every single turn. People generally,have many misconceptions about the book, especiallly after the killing of John Lennon- although I'm not insinuating that the book did not prove to be a catalyst for that reaction, it just seems to me that the irrational mind would have been defeated and betrayed to kill such a peace loving individual whether or not he had read this marvellous book.The books protagonist, Holden caulfield, is the embodiment of all of our morals and ideals; the regular defiance of corrupt authority, the complete and utter loathing for phonies and the dream which is plainly, yet beautifully put as \\" All i ever wanted to be was the Catcher in the rye\\". For those of you unfamiliar with the text, the metaphorical suggestion of being this catcher, is to keep children innocent; stopping them from falling into the depths of corruption, greed and avarice. However, what has always struck me is the obvious contradiction between his personality and what he believes; he acts like a member of the cynical generation x, but incorporates all of the traits typical of a revolutionary.The book, unlike many others, which now try to go to extremes to shock people, has the simplest and minimalist plot presented in a form just as simplistic; yet I am still fascinated by Holden's continuing nostaligia and pensive tone, the claustrophobic sex and ghosts which always haunt him. Salinger was truly ahead of his time here.When speaking to several of fellow readers, they complained that the book did not hold any relevance today, therefore was not worth their time, unlike Wuthering heights, they said. However, this book is as relevant and significant to soceity today as it was when it was released; look at our governments, idols, musicians, footballers etc. We live in lottery ticket, game show nation that want to be millionaires and anarchists simultaneously; Holden shows that we can't."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"\\"If you want to know the truth, I don't know what I think about it. I'm sorry I told so many people about it. About all I know is, I sort of miss everybody I told about. Even old Stradlater and Ackley, for instance. I think I even miss that Maurice. It's funny. Don't ever tell anybody anything. If you do, you start missing everybody.\\" -J.D. Salinger, The Catcher in the Rye, page 213- 214The Catcher in the Rye is a great book that can really hold your attention if you get into it. Holden Caulfield has trouble staying in school. He went to many schools before going to Pencey. He has an annoying, self-centered roommate who could care less about him. Holden was kicked out of Pencey for bad grades and not trying. He only passed English. He decided to leave Pencey earlier than scheduled and live in New York for awhile. There, many funny things happen to him. You have to read the book to find out the different kinds of people he meets there.I would definitely recommend The Catcher in the Rye to anyone who likes to read. I would give this book 5 out of 5 stars because it was so fun to read and kept me wanting to read more. It really lets you get to know Holden and his very different perspective of the world.Holden Caulfield is definitely the protagonist of The Catcher in the Rye. You really get to know him as a person throughout the book. Holden is a really unique person. He thinks almost everyone in the world is a phony, except for, maybe, his younger sister Phoebe and his dead brother, Allie. As I said before, Holden is not a very good student. He likes to read and writing is okay, but he really doesn't like school. Holden is kind of stubborn, he doesn't want to go back home. Holden often times speaks the truth. When he has something on his mind he usually says it. Holden Caulfield is a fun guy to get to know through this novel.One of the best parts of this book was when Holden snuck into his house to talk to Phoebe. They start to talk about the play Phoebe is acting in as Benedict Arnold. After talking, they decide to listen to the radio. Then, they start dancing, it turns out Phoebe is a great dancer. They love each other so much, it is a great scene to picture. Another scene I liked was when Holden was on the train going to New York. On the train he met a nice woman who turned out to be a mother of a Pencey student. He started telling her information about Pencey that was incorrect. He had the best time talking to her. It was also very fun to picture as I read.The Catcher in the Rye is an awesome novel to read. I absolutely loved it. If I had the time, I would have read it in one sitting. One thing I wished would happen was that Holden would call Jane. He kept saying he would but never actually talked to her. I was waiting to find out what they would talk about. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read books written in first person because you really get to know Holden Caulfield as a real person. You definitely have to read this book sometime in your lifetime!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye by Salinger is a great book. You come to love Caulfield as a character. Because of this, most people (scratch the AYN RAND lovers) feel at least a bit emotionally attached to him. Laughing at his stupid mannerisms. Pointing out his flaws just seconds after he already has done so himself, although he doesn't do anything to change his poor self-worth. He is a perfect model of a narcissistic procrastinator. I loved the book. It was about absolutely nothing..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this in high school so i wanted to re-read it on my own. I liked the story but thought that at times it was a bit slow paced. it doesn't matter though because there are close to 3000 reviews and everyone knows about this book already. read it, its good for you."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Just one flaw:The narrator of this story is presented as an avid reader, yet he speaks with a weak vocabulary and weak sentence structure.By my count, he uses the catch-all phrase \\"and all\\" 174 times.He accuses most adults of putting on a false front, so, by my count, he uses the word \\"phony\\" 47 times. A student with above average literacy skills would likely look the word up in a thesaurus.His little sister Phoebe, who is presented as an honor student, is likewise verbally deficient. During the conversation in the bedroom, she uses the phrase \\"and everything\\" 5 times.This is especially unrealistic considering that Holden and Phoebe's parents are viligant about their children's verbal expression. During the bedroom conversation, we see that the word \\"lousy\\" is verboten in the Caulfield household.Salinger probably held a stereotype that all adolescents and children speak with a weak vocabulary and weak sentence structure."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had read that this was a great classic book, instead I only found a book that was very slow and mostly boring. By reading some of the other reviews I can tell that I am not the only one that thinks this way, honestly, I only kept reading because I took this book on a trip and really did not have anything else to do at night.It is a story about a teenager that rebels against school and parents (what else is new?), he runs away and spend several days hanging around not really doing anything interesting and always complaining.Maybe you would still like to read this book, that is your decision, my personal opinion, I would not bother, there are much better options out there."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is one book I really don't know how to react to. Holden the 17 year old narrator of the novel is just plain &quot;phony&quot;. I say this because all throughout the novel he is telling us about how he thinks everything and everyone is phony. He narrarated the novel in first person from a psychiatric facility months after the events in the novel occurred. His reactions to people are weird. At first I found them an annoyance but once I kept reading the novel his reactions became kind of humorous. The whole novel took place just about two days before his Christmas break. His sister Phoebe acts as his best friend and he tells her everything. Holden always seems to mess up his chances with the girls he goes out with and always makes dumb mistakes.He never really thinks over what he does. One person who tries to help Holden out is Mr. Spencer who is a history teacher at his school Pencey Prep. Holden didn't want to listen to Mr. Spencer though because Holden thinks he did nothing wrong. Mr. Antolini was Holden's favorite teacher and when Holden went to visit him, he makes Holden feel uncomfortable. It seems that every time he tries to connect with someone there becomes a conflict. Nothing ever seems to go smoothly for him.The meaning of the title &quot;Catcher and the Rye&quot; is a person who tries to catch little children as they are about to fall off of a cliff and this is what Holden's goal is in life. I think you can decide for yourself but in the end I think you will agree with me. Holden is a very odd character and you must have patients to read this novel. So that is why I rated it 3 stars."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Although the book was at times entertaing, this book is not one of the better classic novels. The writing is often redundant and boring. Salinger, however, does portray his main character very well.

I wouldn't go that far only because of the above points that left me staring at the book with antisaption that some more words or pages explaining the things I wanted to find out would suddenly show up or something. If your interested in reading it, it's no doubt a great book, but if you looking for substance in plot, story, and true feeling, I recomend reading Richard Wright's &quot;The Outsider&quot; or &quot;Native Son&quot; two of truely the best pieces of American Liturture I've ever read. This would follow a Close third or fourth only being bumped by something like Ray Bradbarry, Anthony Burgess."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Sallinger's Holden Caufield was one of the most colorful lead characters/first-person narrarators that I have ever read.

My disappointment comes from the novels uneventful plot: spoiled teenager gets kicked out of his 4th swanky private school and spends 3 days on his own in New York City. (...) This book has become required reading for some of our society's most menacing outcasts (for example the assassins who shot Reagan and killed John Lennon). The were both supposedly influenced by this book. It must have had a very subtle message that I missed. Many reviews have discussed this book in tandem with Lord of the Flies. If you only have time to read one or the other, please choose William Golding's classic. Catcher in the Rye was \\"mildly\\" entertaining and for that it will be a pleasant surprise if you have to read it for a class. It does move at a very rapid pace and Holden Caufield is enjoyable.

My reading of the book evolves with me as I age and hopefully mature. When a work of art can help ground a person in the craziness of modern life it is a classic.

I am always amused in reading these reviews to discover that nobody@nowhere.com knows more, and thinks their own opinion is the last word in literary criticism. I may not like, or enjoy, a particular book, or a piece of music or art, but I respect those who consider such material an essential creative work of the 20th century.

The book was phenomenal. Never have I read a more compelling piece. 4 years later I find myself buying my own copy because of something I realized: as you get older and reread it, you see Holden's life from different perspectives. You grow with him and you learn from him. He changes as you change. Salinger is a credit to his profession as proven in his first (and most successful?) book.

I was wowed, amazed that someone could have been thinking the same things I had been thinking in such earlier years.Now, I am not -that- much older, a little wiser (I think), but I've definitely outgrown my spat of bitterness. I try reading it, but now Holden just seems whiny and immature."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"When reading The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger, you should keep in mind that it takes place in the late forties. Customs and the way people go about things were very different than they are now. Or, maybe it's just the way Holden, the main character, reacts to the events in his life.The Catcher in the Rye is about a seventeen-year-old boy, Holden, who drops out of prep school, without telling his parents. This leads to him hanging around New York City in the days preceding Christmas break. He is your typical rebelling teenage boy. He tends to use lots or crude language and enjoys rather large amounts of drugs and alcohol. Some common phrases Holden uses are: \\"For Chrissake\\", \\"Wuddaya mean what the hell am I doing?\\", \\"Jesus! What the hell happened to you!\\", \\"That depressed the hell outta me\\", and \\"Goddamnit!\\". Although, when faced with the opportunity for a prostitute he takes it, but when she arrives, he can't bring himself to commit the act. That seems to be the only real commendable thing about Holden. The only other thing that I liked about this book was the relationship Holden had with his younger sister, Phoebe. Here is a quote that shows how Holden cares for Phoebe. \\"I'm going with you. Can I? Okay? Please.\\" \\"No. Shut up. You're not going. Now, shut up.\\" This is the part where Holden decides he is going to go out west and Phoebe wants to go with him, but he won't let her. This caring feeling that Holden has for Phoebe also comes through in other parts of the book.At the end, problems are solved, but not in a reasonable or logical manner.I didn't get much of anything out of this book at all. There's really no lesson learned, point or objective and not much of a happily ever after either. Personally, this book could and should have lasted much longer. The author could have spend more time really getting to the bottom of Holden's problems and telling more about how things turned out for Holden. It just seems like he got tired of writing the book and took the easy way out. The last chapter: \\"That's all I'm going to tell you about. I could probably tell you about what I did after I went home, how I got sick and all, and what school I'm supposed to go to next fall, after I get out f here, but I don't feel like it. I really don't. That stuff doesn't really interest me too much right now.\\" This book may be considered a classic, but I don't see what makes it that way."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I first read this book at the suggestion of my high school A.P. English teacher. She handed me a paperback copy and offered me extra credit for reading it. Being a disillusioned 17-year-old at the time, I was in desparate need of help with my probably less than passing grade.By the time I finished the first page, maybe even the first paragraph, I was infatuated with this book. It's been about 8 years since then, I have read the book maybe three more times, and it is still my favorite. If any disillusioned 17-year-olds are reading this, do yourself a favor and get this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I WOULD suggest this book to anyone who insn't interested in books with tons of action. In my opinion, this book reads extremely fast because of the casual tone. It's much like every day life which, naturally, we're all accustomed to. However, there isn't much action. It's insightful and entertaining which adds something to your own everyday life. Read it; it's great!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I wanted to like this book. A few of my friends had recommended it and one in particular was obsessed and finding references to it in everything. I wanted to relate to Holden Caulfield, being sixteen and cynical.But I couldn't.Maybe it's because I'm a girl, but I'm fairly jaded in my views and I found Holden pretentious and boring. I also found him hypocritical; in his everpresent disgust towards the \\"phony\\" people around him, he himself became like them, a snotty rich New York brat who had nothing to complain about yet went on childish tirades about anything and everything. With everything I heard I expected this book to represent the pinnacle of unabashed teenage angst, but instead I wasted a couple of hours of my life listening to the rantings of an emotionally immature teen. No, I didn't think much of the swearing, but that wasn't a big problem in my opinion. It was the overused slang and refering to everyone as \\"old ______.\\" It was the ludicrous events that Holden experienced that nowhere near stood the test of time. Most of all, it was the fact that I have known twelve year olds who had more rational thought processes than Holden ever had.The only thing that kept this book from receiving one star from me was a.) his sister, who was the only genuine character, b.) Holden's Romeo and Juliet tirade, because I actually agreed, and c.) The incident with the swear word in the school and museum. But unless you have to read this book as an assignment, don't waste your time."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I love this book. I was not required to read this book, but I chose to because it is said to be a classic. I think this book touches all the bases of life, and it is simple to identify with Holden at many points.

It's one of the best I've ever read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"in spite of the things that others have said about this book, I believe it is the best book I have ever read. Holden seems sad to think that what has happened to him will happen to other children. when I say &quot;what has happened to him,&quot;I mean losing that childlike essence in all of us, forever. I particularly like that after dropping out of prep school he faces his parent's wrath to go see his little sister Phoebe. it is a cool book and a must read for anybody who liked white oleander. if you liked this book, you should also read white oleander."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"There is nothing more that I can say than, read this book.

Catcher in the Rye may have been groundbreaking when first published almost five decades ago but today whatever edge it once held is now lost. Teachers who rember this book as a life changing event and assign it to their students would be better off remembering sometimes that what is eyeopening to them may be an eye closer to others. If you want to see true literary greatness read Hugo, the word phonies isn't mentioned once and doesn't need to be."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye is supposed to be the book of the times. We read it in school to get a feel about universal issues present to both the world and the person during the sixtys. I personally thought the book was terrible. Mainly becaue I had trouble getting off to a good start. The book has no real story at all. All it is about is some kid and the emotional impact that different people and situation have on him. I mean, this is not even a book. All it is is a reevaluation of someone's life in terms of emotion. Besides needing to read this for school, if I had known the book was like this, I never would have read it, and would have relied on CliffNotes for symbolism."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"All I can say is that if a school makes you read this book, it's not that good. Also I have been told by my fellow classmates that they agree.

His constant thought processes are lifelike, but they become obnoxious very quickly."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Would have rather read something else. I really didn't like the book. To me the ending just stoped and it left many questions unanswered. Holdens constant whining and complaining really bugged me, and it drove me nuts how he would always repeat himself over and over again. One part that I liked is when he is at home with Phoebe, and they are in her room dancing to the music. Other then that part, the book didn't interest me that much."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The only dispassionate thing one can say about J.D. Salinger's THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is that it is a book that cannot be read dispassionately; both its numerous supporters and detractors are equally ardent in their respective admiration and disdain.The novel is already noteworthy on the strength of its style, which represents the culmination in the development of a distinctive American idiom--a process begun by Hemingway and continued by the likes of Hammett and Chandler. In the deceptively simple voice of Holden Caulfield, Salinger strikes a tricky balance between slanginess and profundity that many writers have since striven for, but rarely duplicated. Holden may or may not be &quot;phony&quot; himself, but his voice is most decidedly not, as it is free of pretention or self-consciousness.To call the novel a self-indulgent outpouring of &quot;teenage angst&quot; does it a grave disservice. Holden's problem is as old as Hamlet's, probably as old as mankind ! itself--a struggle to find purity of purpose amidst intense feelings of fright and confusion toward the perversity of human behavior. While Holden's various adventures alternately amuse and move the reader, the novel's real heart lies in his relationship with his sister Phoebe, who manages to be cute, earnest, and intelligent all at once; their climactic encounter has the force of genuine tragedy.In the final analysis, THE CATCHER IN THE RYE proves to be nothing less than one of the major literary achievements of the 20th century."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm sorry but this book is completely overrated! I kept reading hoping it would eventually get better but it never did. It was boring and even though I could vaguely relate to the &quot;teenage angst&quot; aspect, it certainly didn't enlighten me or change my life in any way. I can't believe anyone would make such a big deal about this dull and uninspiring book. I had to force myself to finish it just to say I'd read &quot;the classic&quot; Catcher in the Rye!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Bought this after searching high and low for an audio version of Catcher in the Rye (it was the ONLY one I found). Very pleased to say that it was in excellent condition.For students with learning challenges and people with vision issues, audio books are a great alternative. My hope is that audio format becomes more widely available."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this novel because I love classic works of literature. From Homer to Dostoyevsky to Sartre, I love it all, including modern classics. Naturally, that this book is counted among the modern classics, as well as its association with the assassination of John Lennon, both recommended this book for my reading list. I read it first when I was 17 years old, and again recently at 22. Frankly, I have never quite understood its place on the list of classics as it is often described. Sometimes I think that the only reason it is so popular is because it was banned in many places, in the same way that Ulysses (which I would count as a classic, personally) is so often counted among the Classics by people who have never read it. I'm not a fuddy-duddy or a stuffy classicist: I absolutely adore books with no plot, interesting first-person narration, quirky characters, etc. But I just don't quite \\"get it\\", and I never have.Perhaps it is because I simply do not like the character. I didn't find Holden Caulfield endearing, or witty, or particularly interesting; to be honest, I find him annoying. In fact, of all the characters portrayed in this work, Holden is the one whom I like, or with whom I can identify, the least. He is whiny and foul-mouthed, and uses the words \\"phony\\" and \\"god****\\" every other paragraph. I am not criticizing Salinger's writing--in fact, it's dead on. I had no difficulty whatsoever believing that this was really written by a teenage boy. But it just doesn't ring any bells, or flip any switches, for me. It's okay, and not a bad read on a lazy afternoon, but beyond that it falls flat. Perhaps I would have to have grown up during the time period of this novel to really grasp what the author is trying to get across.Overall, worth reading, but don't accept its status as a \\"classic\\" simply because everyone else does."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I was left puzzled after reading the book, which isn't surprising. It's quite a confused book.Having digested it a little though, I do believe it's excellent. The things I loved are exactly the ones which annoy some other reviewers:- No visible plot. The main character sort of lives his days, doing stupid things and fretting about them. I found that very charming.- The silly teenage language from the late 40'es / early 50'es. It annoyed me at first, but then I enjoyed it.- The whiny narrative. Yep, it was a bit over the top whiny; but I thought it was compensated by the inspired passages that were observant and kind. In fact, the narrative left me feeling the guy may have loved the people he claimed to 'hate'.- The repetitiveness of some key themes and thoughts. I found it very natural.Separately, the characterization was breathtaking, I thought. Maybe Salinger was doing a bit too much of it (e.g. characterizing the taxi drivers and random kids in the museum), but I could feel he was having fun with it and it did come out very well.Maybe it's just me. I love the non-linear, honest stories like this, that don't drive a specific 'plot', but rather explore a person."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Let's start this off with saying that I thought Holden Caufield, from J. D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, is one of the most disrespectful teens I've ever read about. Then I realized that most of his potty mouth or rude comments stay in his head. I though this character reminds me of me sometimes. What he thinks and what he does can be completely different things.I thought this book was really good. The beginning is a little bit slow but Salinger really must have targeted the teen audience. Though a lot of people think this book should be read by college students, I think anyone in high or even upper middle school would be able to relate.It makes me wonder what happens to Holden Caufield. I think his experience wandering around New York alone would help him learn that the world doesn't revolve around him. As a teen I have to admit that at most time I think the same way. I think that Holden has a lot of potential and that he could live up to it if he really strived to. I would recommend this book, its funny and a nonstop page turner."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"At the age of seventeen, most adolescents have to make a decision as to what they will do with their life. Holden Caulfield, the protagonist of J.D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye taking place in New York in the 1950's, is no different. He decides that he has to \\"catch everybody if they start to go over a cliff - I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I'd do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the only thing I'd really like to be\\". Holden is in the process of transitioning into adulthood; however, he wants to preserve his childhood innocence. He watched as his brother Allie died of leukemia at a young age and can't bear to think of anyone else missing out on the virtues of childhood. He wants to protect his sister Phoebe from the evil adult world as he encourages her to ride the carousel. Holden himself attempts to venture into society, but can never seem to manage. Going out late at night, drinking, and getting involved with prostitutes are things that Holden tries to do to make the difficult transition. However, Holden faces many internal conflicts that prevent him from entering adulthood. He has flunked out of four preparatory schools and feels abandoned by his parents because he knows they will just send him off to another one without trying to understand the problem. Holden continues to search for his identity, and an answer to where the ducks go when the lagoon in Central Park freezes. All readers will be able to relate to Holden's frustrations, disappointments, thoughts, and decisions. He proves himself to be complex, sharing the mentality of teenagers today. The audience can connect to Holden's feelings of isolation and fear of growing up. The theme of Salinger's book is timeless because Holden's concerns match those of teenagers everywhere in every era. The Catcher in the Rye is a classic that is truly deserving of praise. It is a book in which the reader can't help but connect to the main character. The audience can see themselves in Holden Caulfield, with his obscure thoughts, insecurities, and opinions. The Catcher in the Rye will surely catch the attention of all of its readers."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A novel relevant to teens today and one that will be relevant for years to come is The Catcher in the Rye by J. D. Salinger. Taking place in the 1950s, the novel follows the narrator, seventeen-year-old Holden Caulfield, as he fails out of yet another prep school during his struggle to find his place in this world of \\"phonies.\\" He is stuck between childhood and adulthood, unable to make the transition, and fearing that he too will become one of these \\"phonies.\\" Through Holden and his predicament, Salinger portrays the theme of the loss of childhood innocence and fear of growing up that many teens experience every day.As Holden encounters difficulties with roommates, relatives, and relationships, teenage readers can connect to his problems and understand his feelings and desire to remain young. He shares the confusions of sex, love, and overall morality, unable to understand what is right. Although some argue that the language of the novel is too harsh, profane, and perhaps unnecessary; it is through this tone that young readers relate. This abrasive dialogue helps to show that Holden is not some perfect prep school kid but an everyday teen who makes mistakes and fears what the future may hold. At first he seems to have a tough and almost rebel-like exterior, but as readers learn of his close relationship to his little sister Phoebe and the pain he feels concerning the death of his brother, it becomes evident that underneath the faade is a caring and loving heart.A truly timeless work of literature, Holden and his dilemmas are a model for many. Highly recommended, Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye tackles the quandary that all teens face as they transition into adulthood, encouraging them to be true to themselves and avoid becoming just another \\"phony\\" of today's world."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Without a doubt, J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in The Rye is a controversial piece of literature, from the moment the novel is open, until the book's back cover is closed. Salinger's use of profanity and coverage of mature material has been debated for years. Some claim it to be too blunt and inappropriate for its targeted audience, but regardless of these critics' opinions, Salinger's brilliance is undeniable. The novel's protagonist, Holden Caulfield, is a seventeen year old prep school teen who constantly suppresses his past which causes interference with his present life. With the plot set, the novel easily establishes a theme in which many can relate to, the inevitable loss of innocence one undergoes when growing up. This theme seems to prevail, and bring truth to the unavoidable facades adults often wear. J.D. Salinger's informal use of language, and well developed characters help capture the ingenious plot of his novel and its ability to have its audience clinging to every page.The Catcher in the Rye ultimately portrays Holden Caulfield's fear of becoming another phony adult in society. His many teenage problems that uniquely present themselves throughout his life, create a page-turning effect that keeps the reader anticipating what the next may reveal. While Holden's attitude and personality seem to embody every reader who praises this novel, the supporting characters don't always play such a minimal role. Holden's older brother, and younger sister, Phoebe plays a large part in the development of Holden's character. Events such as the death of his little brother, in the long run also reveals much about Holden's attitude on life. His close relationship with his sister and the envious resentment he occasionally portrays for his older brother, are relationships everyone can relate to.Salinger's simple use of language leaves no space for confusion, and his bluntness enables The Catcher in the Rye's audience to relate in such a close manner. His informal usage of words are also responsible for attracting readers who long to pick up a book without having to put on their \\"SAT\\" thinking-caps in order to acquire a new perspective on teenage life. But without a doubt, depending on the reader's level of comprehension, Salinger does provide bigger ideas and concepts for deeper analysis through his \\"simple use of language\\". The popularity of this book has remained consistent throughout the years, from being one of the top \\"must read\\" novels, to being the talk in every high school English room, The Catcher in the Rye is one of the most brilliant and life changing novels yet. For having captured so much attention and so many negative critiques and reviews, it is quit evident that as an author, J.D. Salinger must have done something right."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"what can you say about a book that delivers time after time. i get something very different from it now than when i was sixteen. it still matters, for a new set of reasons, and that's what makes it great."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye by J.D Salinger is a story that can make anyone smile. The main character, Holden Caulfied, is a troubled teen that is yet again, expelled from another haughty boarding school. Holden cannot find the motivation to succeed in school because he feels he does not have a purpose. Why apply yourself if you don't know your place in life? Holden struggles with his inner-self, battling his own mind, and trying to understand his purpose in life as a teenage boy. Holden's difficulty in comprehending his place in the world as a young boy is what makes this story unviversally relatable.After Holden is asked to leave Pencey High School after winter break [expelled], Holden ditches school early to take a little \\"vacation\\" to New York City; he packs and leaves by train in the hopes of enjoying himself before returning home to his parent's wrath. In the few days he spends in New York , he experiences the city's nightlife through strippers, bars, and night clubs. In contrast, he also spends his free time by revisiting his childhood, reuniting himself with old friends and visiting sentimental places. Holden seems to have a lot of friends, although it is obvious he is not confident about friendships. Holden degradingly numbers off girls throughout the story and therefore his character becomes bothersome. However most of the time it is very easy to sympathize for Holden as he is in deep distress, and he feels that he is surrounded by a bunch of \\"phonies\\". No matter who he associates himself with, whether it is an old friend or a stripper, he feels out of place. The more Holden observes and aquaints himself with humankind in New York City, the more he realizes he is different, and the more he feel like he is without purpose. His inner-struggles and battling of the mind eventually peaks causing for a catchy ending. However, the author does not fill the ending with detail and it can be very frusterating.Over all, this book was easy to relate to, it was funny, and it was happy and sad all at the same time. Salinger's writing is humorous...but it is not forced humor. He often incorporated spontaneous wit, humor that is not necessarily \\"obvious\\". For example, the laughter that come from dealing with an awkward roomate. The struggles that Holden Caulfield went through could be applied to anyone's life as a high school student, and being able to follow Holden through his journey of discovery makes this book relevant and dear to any reader's heart."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield has just been kicked out, yet again, of a preparatory school which his father, a hot-shot corporate lawyer, has selected for him. Holden is a pathological lawyer, he smokes like crazy, and he prefers the peak of his brand-new red hunting cap to be facing backward, not forward. Holden begins wandering around New York City, buying time before the date comes when his parents will be expecting him.Such are the plot details, and the wonderful character painting, that this wonderful little novel unveils early in its course. The Catcher is a fast-paced and an easy read, two qualities which typically don't go along with works of literature. Is the Catcher a work of literature? The answer is an unqualified yes. Salinger has accomplished an amazing feat by relaying his story through the first-person narrative of our protagonist, and the writing is complete with Holden's idiosyncratic jargon and constant lacings of profanity. Yet what makes the writing so remarkable is that we know exactly what Holden is talking about it, even though his slang can be a little confusing at times.Still, what makes this little gem a literary genius is not its exceptional writing, but its wide appealing cultural value. I think it would be immature and cliched to call this a \\"coming of age\\" book (even though it is one), or to talk about Holden's prototypical \\"teenage angst\\". In my opinion, this novel finds its far-reaching appeal because it speaks to the heart of us all. We all get discouraged (and even disgusted) by the faults that we see in society, and in human nature in general (for example, the \\"phoniness\\" which Holden sees as near ubiquitous). Nevertheless, all of us have to make decisions, just like Holden does, as to what direction we choose to walk in life.A final note. I loved this book and found myself laughing out loud throughout many parts of the book. Nonetheless, I wouldn't be surprised if this novel isn't everyone's cup of tea. I suspect that some readers will have a tough time relating to some of Holden's observations (after all, those \\"phonies\\" that Holden constantly criticizes include us). In addition, Holden's cynical, near sourpuss attitude (along with his profanity) may be a turn-off to some. I still suggest that you at least give this novel a try."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is my favorite book of all time.

There is really no point to this book except to let you know that teenagers are really screwed up because they are still figuring out who they are. This book has great cause and effect.

But, despite a few small seeming unrealistic elements, the book was wondering. Holden Caulfield's smart mouthed, slick personality seemed to grow on me and I couldn't put the book down because I kept wanting to learn more about him and his insane adventures. Also, the book is funny. For example, it's hilarious hearing Holden complain about his roomates not clipping their toenails over the toilet bowl. It was a great read and I read it on my own time too, not linked to school. That really shows that it must have been a really good book, which it was."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Maybe I'm in the minority, but I really didn't care for this book.

If you're the kind of person hunting for content and meaning all the time, i'm sorry this book let you down. but perhaps you should get off your high horse and try something new???? perhaps you should see this book for it's entertainment, for it's humor, for Holden's boldness to let go of the cynical thoughts that so often linger in our minds.i'm no book critic. if you were to ask me to dissect the book like a piece of meat, i'm sorry, that's not what i look for in a book. i think books should be entertaining and THIS HAS DEFINITELY DONE IT."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"What a prison of pessimism. Reading Catcher in the Rye felt like bathing in a toxic waste plant.T.S. Elliot said, &#65533;April is the cruelest month of the year&#65533; because the sun reveals some things we&#65533;d rather not see. Likewise, Salinger&#65533;s work conjures up the darkest memories of adolescence&#65533;memories I&#65533;d ceremoniously burned (along with my acid wash jeans and Debbie Gibson cassettes) years ago.Of course, I must recognize that my response is perhaps reflective of my aged removal from young adulthood. As an educator, it is imperitive that I am tuned in to what makes my students tick. If there&#65533;s one redeeming element of the book, it is that I was reminded of what a potential time bomb is the teenage brain. Regardless, I&#65533;m sure that point could have been made without harping on the most banal aspects of adolescent existence.Having recently observed the teaching of Catcher in the Rye in a high school classroom, I experienced first hand student&#65533;s reactions of apathy and distaste for the book. Student editorials discussed Holden&#65533;s narrow character development. One student made the point that if Caulfield is a character adults use to peer into the adolescent mind, they are largely misled. The common consensus among the students held that Holden is not the quintessential teenager.So I think it unfortunate that students suffer through the Catcher experience. While I cannot speak for everyone, the specific classes I observed were most turned off by Holden&#65533;s language, poor decision making, and overall depression. Many explained that Holden is not a character they would like to strive to be like. Rather, he is merely someone to feel sorry for. And who wants to read an entire book where the primary emotion invoked is pity?I will acknowledge that there are certain themes in Catcher that are universal. Themes include loss of innocence, rebellion from society, mental instability, death, immaturity in sexual relationships, and resentment towards parents. While these are issues most any teenager can relate to, presentation is of the essence. Unfortunately, based on my HS classroom observations, Salinger&#65533;s writing style and characters have little to offer today&#65533;s breed of students.I wonder if my reaction to the book would be different were I ten years younger. But as for now, I already know how bad raw sewage reeks, so why expose myself to such noxious fumes page after page? The masochists can have their Catcher. I&#65533;d rather drink my tea with two sugars, thank you."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had heard so much about this so called classic that when I found it included in a box of used books given to me I eagerly attacked it. 10 pages in I was puzzled...20 pages in I was sure I was missing something...30 pages in I was bored to tears. I stuck through this sorry mess to the bitter end in the hopes that there might be some redeeming factor to it but, alas, there was none to be found. This book was obviously an attempt to speak to the feelings of loneliness and alienation often felt by adolescents but the protagonist's self-pitying, stream of consciousness torrent of complaints against all of existance left me wanting to scream &quot;Shut the @#?! up&quot;. Truly one of the worst books I have ever read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Every page of this book is the same. It has no building up of events. Or... any events for that matter. It goes from him getting kicked out of school to waiting around in the city to going home and doing nothing. Not saying he will do better in school...no relationships...no action. You learn about what this 17 year old thinks about the people around him, his brothers, his sister , and what he does in the city for a few days. Nothing more exciting or different than your life. So if you take a few minutes of your life and self reflect about a time you were bored...you'll save a few bucks and some time that way."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've read lots of literature; more than you might imagine.I read this thinking that I had missed a classic.This book does NOT &quot;capture the rawness, is so enthralling, blah, blah, blah.&quot;It IS outdated and whiny. Instead of feeling empathy with a depressed main character, I feel the urge to only slap him.Why this has achieved classic status only attests to what P.T. Barnum said about people, numbers and fooling."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Many things will come to mind when you pick up a copy of The Catcher in the Rye. Some of these may be pleasant and happy; others will be full of complete remorse and utter disgust. Let me elaborate. The book is a faltering attempt to sum up the life of the author. Although he embellishes the story quite a bit, it is easy to see the \\"subtle\\" hints that this is what his life was like. The author creates a boy that, by normal standards, has absolutely no connection to 97% of the world's population. By trying to create the feeling of sympathy for the main character, he further entrenches the belief that this person isn't like the rest of the young boys that exist today. Maybe I am off by trying to impress the fact that there should be some type of connection between a regular fiction book and the people that are reading it, but it is absurd to think that the book would be anything to somebody my age. The small problems that arise with the Holden have no relevance and cannot add any depth or meaning. Despite this, I think that there is some value to the book and that it might have a saving grace. What might that be? Well there are some well-written parts. The author has a great attention to detail that, in some cases, can really put the book out as a classic. This can be overlooked by the poor detail in some parts. Another bright spot would be the accurate recreation of some of the ideas that a young boy may have. This doesn't last though. Yet, despite some good detail and some nice insight, this book is an incapable novel that doesn't deserve any recognition or praise. The author clearly doesn't understand that a normal person just doesn't need to read about some childish little boy that can't get a grip on his own problems or have the resolve to get help. Really, can't the writing minds in this nation do better than this? Maybe not."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Maybe this novel is supposed to speak to the rebellious teen who can't find their path in this world. As a middle aged adult who read this book for this first time, I was disappointed in this &quot;classic.&quot;A dumb kid with too high of an opinion of himself who thinks everyone else are jerks gets thrown out of prep school. He wanders around in New York City a few days getting into various mischief until the money his mommy and daddy sent him runs out. Then he goes home.The book should have ended with his father giving him a swift kick in the rear and throwing him out on the street to appreciate what real life is like and to take advantage of his opportunities."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A dull, pendantic book about a dull, pedantic hypocrite.Maybe this was groundbreaking when it came out, but it's dull as dishwater today.The main character is irritated by every tiny miniscule event that happens in his life, and has to tell you about every single one as if it's momentous. That's pretty much the sum total of this book, a kid griping about inconsequential nothings the entire book.The only thing that kept me going till the end were the teasing hints that he was about to become seriously ill and/or die. No such luck, just had a bad cold."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This was the worst book that I have ever read in my life. I kept waiting for something big to happen throughout the whole story, and nothing did. All the book is about is a kid that walks around New York and complains about everything that happens to him. He's very depressing. I would rather read the dictionary than read that book again."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Full disclosure: I didn't read this in high school. Perhaps you have to be 15 or 16 to really get the most from this book. If so, then it belongs squarely in the category of adolescent fiction, not canonical literature.But my son's reading it, and he _is_ in high school! Yet he and his classmates find the book tedious and dated, much like The Outsiders. He finds class discussion difficult, because after all, there are only so many ways you can cut the story of an insecure, hypocritical, mendacious kid. What is there to talk about? Heavy, heartfelt chants of \\"I felt like that too!\\"? Then the book belongs in an adolescent therapy group, not a literature class.Many of the people who are enthusiastic about this book seem to be saying \\"yes, this is my story\\". Well, they have my sympathy of course, but since when is identifying with a single character the standard of good writing, let alone literature? If that's true, well, then just scrap the weirdoes like Shakespeare, Joyce, and Woolf, or the guys with unique experiences, like Dante. I just can't see what the big buzz is with this book, despite perusing some of the comments here.Another thing. High schools generally strive to prepare students for success with the SAT, including its verbal section, which presupposes some adult grasp of grammar and usage. In that respect, this book, with its dated adolescent conversational style, seems singularly ill-chosen. Why not find something informative, evocative, and well-written?Obviously, I don't expect many people here to concur. But honestly, after reading the book this week, I was shocked at how annoying and pedestrian it was. Compare it with The Secret Life of Bees to see how some of these themes (insecurity, isolation, mendacity, etc.) can be done with subtlety, insight, succulent style, and social consciousness to boot."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had to read this for english. I'm a cynical 16 year. If any thing this shows your the complete illogic in cynicism. This is the only book that ever frustrated me to the point of throwing it across my room. If you like a pointless story about some hipocrit who does nothing but complain then read it. If you prefer something atleast mildly entertaining that isnt page upon page of literary B*TCHING then go read a real book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The last three pages were the best."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is the only book I was glad I read in high school. Everyone especialy in this decade can relate to the main charater in this book. The best thing about it is it isnt a normal edited parental aproved book. J.D, Salinger writes as a normal kid would talk not like an english professor's kid would talk."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Until I met Holden Caulfield, I thought I was the only kid in the world whose life was messed up. Holden taught me that it is on to be different, ok to be afraid, ok to not have every single detail of your life planned. And he taught me that it is ok to pursue your dream. Who cares if someone else thinks your dreams are ludicrous? Holden's sister Phoebe thought he was nuts because he wanted to catch kids falling off a cliff. Well, who is anyone to say what is ridicudlous or what is not? Is wanting to be a &quot;catcher in the rye&quot; different than wanting to be a writer or a fireman or an Oympic champion?Parents hated Holden Caulfield because he was the antithesis of everything that they were taught. As kids growing up in the 50'swe were taught that you should join the poshest clubs and pursue the job with the biggest salary and do everything and be the bestnot because you wanted to be but because it satisfied your parent's ego. Parents wanted all their kids to be Beaver Cleaver and Bud Anderson. There were alot more kids out there like Holden than there were like Beaver or Bud.This book provided those of us, like me, who didn't fit in, with comfort and the knowledge that it was ok to be different (like in the movie &quot;Pleasantville&quot; when Tobey Maguire told his mother &quot;There is no right life&quot;. ) Holden said it first.Salinger didn't invent Holden Caulfield - thousands of them existed. But thank God he had the courage to write about him."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Contrary to what the neo-Christian Taliban would have you believe (see other review below), this book does not condone sex, drugs, or even rock and roll. Quite the opposite. It's a tale of an adolescent who aspires to possess the trappings of adulthood while maintaining the innocence of childhood, and the impossibility of acquiring that equilibrium. The protagonist is devoted to his younger sister (and all children), respects his teachers (Antolini and Spencer), mourns the death of his younger brother and the suicide of his only friend, protects the virtue of a young prostitute, and attempts to rub out profanity he sees scrawled on an elementary school wall. One would think these were admirable traits. Too bad some people are so busy counting swear words that they can't see the book's theme or value. Oh well, their loss; I feel sorry for their children. \\"Catcher\\" is THE classic existential coming-of-age story of the 20th century, and should be required reading for every person under the age of 19."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye is one of the best books I've read. It didn't change my life. I don't sleep with it. What it did do was reveal things that I've always known about but have never talked to anyone about. Salinger talks about the little stupid things that people say and do that don't really make any sense. He talks about phonies and how they behave, but more importantly, he also describes some real people. This is a great book, but if you're looking for a plot or suspense, you've got the wrong idea."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a love it or hate it type book. I for one, loved it. It was a great book because it perfectly captured Holden's teenage angst. This book really reminds me of To Kill a Mockingbird because both books deal with loss of innocence. Holden is going through this loss of innocence in the book, and he seems to think that he's alone in the world in this passage from child to adult. Although I would never say this book is as good as To Kill a Mockingbird, it still does a pretty nice job of what I think Salinger was trying to accomplish. And that of course is what helps to make this objectively a &quot;good book,&quot; the fact that you as the reader can easily grasp this book and enjoy what the author is trying to tell you. I would reccomend this book to anyone just simply because while I can't say everyone will like this book, it is by an intelligemt peson's standards, a &quot;good book.&quot;"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had immense expectations for this book before i even flipped open to the first page, due to the fact that one of my best friend absolutely worshipped this book (that already shows how much of a &quot;phony&quot; I am). However, no matter how hard I tried, I simply could not relate with Holden. It wasn't that I didn't hear his message or empathize with him, but it was as if some very subtle but crucial connection was missing between us. I guess the biggest reason I couldn't connect with Holden was because I am one of those children that he failed to catch and fell off the cliff. Unfortunately, as life progresses, it is inevitable that we lose some of our innocence. However, the degree of cynicism expressed by Holden was simply too much for this generally optimistic reader. I probably would have appreciated this book much more if i had read it during my teenage angst years rather than my current stage of my life (one of balance and content). Yes, the world is full of &quot;phonies&quot;, but that doesn't mean the end to all innocence. I guess i still feel innocent at heart, and therefore I don't think, as Holden would have put it, the world such a &quot;crumby place&quot;."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I never had to read this book in high school, but talking to friends of mine who had read it, the Catcher in the Rye was a &quot;love it or hate it&quot; book. So, of course I had to read it.I neither loved it nor hated it. Holden Caulfield was a memorable character, one that I would love to sit down and talk with, but a character does not make a great book. Salinger created a wonderful character, a cynical yet compassionate, tough yet insecure teenage boy, an outsider in a &quot;phony&quot; world.But then nothing happens. We see a portrait of a kid full of angst, a character that most of us can relate with to some degree or another ... and Salinger just has him spout cynisms when he's not suddenly crying because he feels lonely. He hatches crazy schemes about running away and then abandons them when he realizes that his kid sister needs him, and he needs her. So he hangs around, then eventually goes out to stay with his older brother, who (were he not his brother) would probably be termed a phony by Holden. And that's it. He runs back to family when confronted with a lifetime of loneliness. A realistic resolution, perhaps, but not really the stuff classics are made of.At no time does Holden ever feel despair or hopelessness. And why should he? Despite the situations he is in, he's always in control and active. While he's not loaded, he's got plenty of money. He's got friends, even if most of them are border-line phonies. He's got a family who loves him. So why on earth does he feel lonely?Great characterization wasted by a mediocre book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A lot has been said about this wonderful book and what I am going to say will probably be much of the same. I loved this book. I bought it for my dad for xmas and I ended up reading it myself. It's on the reading list for my english class so i figured i'd read it ahead of time. I read the book in two days, i couldn't put it down. I found myself really identifing with holden. I have gone through a lot of similar problems that holden went through in the book and I came out of it actually feeling smarter and wiser about life, the first time a book has ever done this to me. The relationship between holden and pheobe was my favorite aspect of the book, especially the chapter when holden is in pheobe's room. The book is pretty funny too, like when he gets all nervous when the prostitute comes to visit him. I very much reccommend this book to everyone, especially teenagers. I'm on my way to re-reading it now, it's that damn good. Easily my favorite book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It is important to keep our mind open to what great writers, such as J. D. Salinger have to say to us. The book its not just a three day adventure of a confused adolescent, it is a saga of a soul, a look at how our society is, and how we have to somehow give up part of we are in order to \\"blend in.\\" It is also about the loss of innocence in the process of becoming part of this society where the phony relations always prevail. \\"I'm always saying \`Glad to've met you' to somebody I'm not at all glad I met. If you want to stay alive you have to say that stuff, though\\" (pg87). Sounds familiar?Holden has in a certain (crazy) way, a clear view of the world. He doesn't like the world he sees, neither wants to take part in it - and that is his big struggle. It is important to pay attention to the message in between the lines. Just not refuse the \\"maybe inappropriate\\" comments of the protagonist; many of them, if you think about, are perhaps the clear picture underneath superficial appearances...It is no doubt a great book and must read. It will make you laugh, it will make you think, and you'll miss Holden the second you put the book down!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye was what I would call an \\"a-ok\\" book. It didn't grab me and pull me in like many say it would. It was a book about a teenage boy trying to cope with the real world and running away from problems, much like a stage in life the present day's teenager would associate with.The tone of voice in Holden, because it was written in first person, sets a depressing state in the reader. Holden just didn't seem like a positive figure, and that may be why many school libraries ban this book. I think that this book is good for the adolescent though because it mirrors life, and because I think teenagers like to read books that they can relate with instead of the long, boring stories that some students are forced to read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"i thought this book was great i highly recomend it to teenagers who dont know exactly where they are in life. A book where you must recognize at least one character from your life. A must read for all teenagers who dont like to read or whos life isnt on track."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"well, this is a pretty good book and all, but i wouldn't gocalling it &quot;grand&quot; or anything like that. if i heard someone call this book &quot;grand&quot; i'd probably do something crazy like go kick a tree in the park for chrissakes. i'm a madman for this book, i really am.."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I absolutely love this book. It seems almost as if it was written for my mind word for word. Blantant truth oozes from cover to cover, in a twisted harmony that reaches out and pulls you inside."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The idea that most interested me in reading this novel was the amount of publicity that it has gotten over the years. I thought that the book was interesting. It is about a young male that journeys into New York City after leaving a prep school. The events that unfolded while he was there were interesting. The main character always seemed to be looking for something to do, which kept me reading to see what he was going to do next. Throughout the novel the main character finds out who he is and where he wants to go in life. This would be very good and interesting for someone that is just starting to discover who he/she is. The only major issue with this book that I found to be not if interest was the main characters view on life and society. If you are someone who feel that society is not fair or just, then you may enjoy this book more than I did. Though the events in the novel are interesting and keep you reading, the amount of negativity is not. I guess that the bottom line here is; if you are interested in reading this book out of curiosity then do it. On the other hand if you are interested in reading about the joys and gifts that come in life, with work, then this novel may disappoint you."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a novel written in the first person, is told through one large flashback, and is about a young boy dealing with himself. The book is written in the first person, so the reader feels and hears exactly what the author is feeling and thinking. The book is one large flash back to help the reader understand the character better. This book captures the boy's adolescence in its worst and rawest.This book is written in the first person so nothing is left out from the author. When a book is written in the first person the reader gets to see deep inside the main character and get a full picture of his mind. What the author is thinking is being conveyed to the reader in words. These words are maybe even something that the author would never even say aloud, but are there for the reader to accept and analyze. Holden thought of many things that he \\"should've\\" or \\"would've\\" said, but he didn't. The reader got so see that shy side of him that wasn't expressed to others in the novel. If he did come out and say something there was always a feeling of regret in him that the reader could see and could help them relate better to him. When something is written in the third person it takes away from knowing the individual, and focuses on knowing the subjects. The reader no longer knows the people, they know what is going on around the people. There fore, a book written in the first person lets the reader truly get the advantage of really knowing what is going on in the mind of the individual.This book is also written in one large flashback. The main character, Holden, is talking to a psychoanalyst. Where he starts off is where he left his most recent school. He views this as a turning point in his life that brings about a whole mess of things to come. Schools are a big part of his life, though he despises them and all that they stand for. The fact that he has been going to boarding schools does not help that. He is at school twenty-four hours everyday and there seems to be no escaping it. That may be why he doesn't feel the need to do well in school, because it is just a place he feel he \\"has\\" to be at and not a place to further his life. Though his flashback is only about a couple days, in those days he realizes many things about himself and what his life means to him. He realizes what school means, what his family means, and what he means to himself as an individual who is such a small part of this vast world around him. By him expressing all of this to the psychoanalyst, it is probably also helping him realize even more that he may have been to afraid to admit ti himself at the time it occurred. As this flashback is taking place the reader understands the character more and the character may understand himself more.The boy in the novel, Holden, has to deal with himself, all by himself. This is able to show him how strong or weak his spirit and will really are. While he is by himself his loneliness builds up into a depression. This depression shows the reader his regrets, his sorrows, and his weakness. This weakness leaves him vulnerable to other characters in the book. He is open for the rudeness and rejection that comes his way. He is inhibited because of his fear of these things also. He does not want to be rejected therefore he won't do something. After that he will have regret for not doing that thing. All of this contributes to his depression and leads to his feeling of discomfort and alienation wherever he is. When Holden is trying to figure out what to do in certain situations, his hesitation leads him into a whole spiral of questions that he lets fall upon himself. The loneliness that he has to deal with leads him to comfort zones. But once he arrives at those places, he realizes they are not what he expected them to be or what they used to be. Holden had to deal with himself and he did as best he could.This novel really captures the rawness of this boys life. It does that through flashback and being written in the first person. The reader sees exactly what is happening and knows what is behind that. They know what is happening because they can see inside the authors mind while each event is taking place. This book was very enjoyable and very well written. It showed how the main character really worked, and was not fabricated by other opinions, that is hard to find in anything these days."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Every human in this world is different from one another. Being different from someone else is a unique characteristic. The book &quot;Catcher In The Rye,&quot; deals with being different and not being yourself. The book is basically a journey through life of the main character, Holden.Holden always has trouble with applying himself in school. He has been in many private schools and managed to fail out of each. His last school ends up being Pencey, an all boy's school. He fails to apply himself in his classes except for his English class. He ends up being kicked out of school and has to return home to deal with his parents.Holden never seems to want to be alone. He gets depressed alot when things don't go his way. When he did get to New York, which is where he is from, he had to hide out for a while. He didn't want to be alone, but he couldn't go home. He was unable to go home due to a letter from the school. He wanted to wait until the letter arrived and then return home. He began calling up old girlfriends and friends and staying out until all hours. He even went so far as to buy the company of a prostitute. He ended up feeling sorry for himself and he lied to get her to go away. He always lied about something to save himself, but that would create depression. This depression led to alcoholism and then thoughts of suicide.Holden ended up going home to visit his sister. Holden ventured home and got inside the house very quietly. He didn't want his parents to know that he was there, just his sister. He had favoritism towards his little sister Phoebe, and she looked up to him. He figured things would be ok once he saw her.In the end, Holden wants to leave, saying, &quot;he wants to get away from the phony people.&quot; It is funny because Holden was phony himself. He never told the truth and he was always pretending to be someone else. He got so fed up with these people that he wanted to kill someone. He mentioned that &quot;he wanted to be in a peaceful place where phony people can't talk.&quot; Phoebe decided that she wanted to leave with him. After talking her out of it, he realized that he wasn't going to leave either. He ended up returning home.To finish this book, you have to realize where exactly Holden is telling the story from. Just by seeing the type of character that he is, you realize that he is crazy. Holden had to wait a semester to go to school, he ended up staying in the psych ward. His character made the story and symbolized his crazy mind and the moods of his character. Catcher in the Rye deals with mental problems and the reality of living with them."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"If you bring up the name Holden Caulfield in any conversation, you might get a few blanks, but in a lot of cases, it's either &quot;That book saved my life&quot; or &quot;I'm preparing the oven for 451 degrees, it's so bad.&quot; I rank under the former.I borrowed the all too common paperback copy from the local library (actually the main branch in downtown Fort Wayne, IN, excellent system there), wondering what all the controversy that still stands was about. I was instantly hooked on it. I just never finished it. I have a common tendency to leave books right at the beginning or at the very middle. There is no real plot, so you could just start where you left off without really caring.The book has gained so much controversy, to my knowledge, there had only been one audiobook of it, meant for the visually-impaired. That's sad, considering I can handle audiobooks better.It's about a rebellious, but respectful in some aspects, teenager who flunked out of prep school, on his trek back to his home in New York. He ends up in predicaments such as getting really drunk and becoming customer to a hooker.Addressing these sort of things were very uncalled for back when this was released, and now we've got Jerry Springer to skip over.Unfortunately, Mr. Salinger wrote only 2 other books and became reclusive. Once you've become a real fan, you might want to check out Salinger's daughter's memoirs of her father. I haven't read it, but it provides some exclusive insight to Salinger's exiled life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book chronicles the mental breakdown of its main character, Holden Caulfield. Written in the first person, we gain access to the cynical and sardonic attitude of a youth who is unable to synthesize his emotions and mores into a cogent view of the world.Young readers of this work may find much in common with Holden. Older readers may simply find him petulant and immature. I decided to read this book for the first time at age 43, mainly to see what all the hubbub was about (Lennon/Hinckley, etc). The book did help reacquaint me with the unrealistic idealism and haphazard thought processes that plagued me during adolescence. At the same time, I have to wonder about the mental health of anyone who can fully relate to the main character.Salinger's &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; style makes for a difficult and often frustrating read. I spent much of the first half of the book seeking a plot that didn't exist. The book has no beginning, middle, or end; and is more of a psychological profile than a novel.If your goal is to be entertained, this isn't the book for you. If you want to get in touch with another part of your psyche, it might be. Either way, I suspect it's not the kind of book you'll want to crack open more than once."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is not your basic tale of growing up, it shows the harshness (and the hailarious) characteristics New York has on a free adolescent. A very funny book, the only bad part is that he uses &quot;phoney&quot; way to much! (but who really cares?) Salinger's excellent discriptions give you a good picture without over crowding it wiht minor details. ***** for me and thumbs up!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye was an alright novel. It talked about a lot of real issues that face many people in the world. The novel was also very desciptive and sometimes you could get wraped up in it like you were there. Parts of it were heart-warming, like when he talks about his brothers and sister. Also when he talks about his dead brother you could tell he was a really sensitive guy. However, the novel did have a lot of cursing and most of it was about women, drinking and smokingand so on. All Holden, the main character who told the story in first person, talked about was being depressed and hating even the smallest things. It was kind of ridiculus of how many stupid things made him feel depressed and it got old after a while. If you read the book for long periods of time it could even make you depressed. He also acted very craze(mentaly) and most of his decisions were extremly childish and you would say to yourself why would a 16-17 year old do that. Besides that the book had to do with a lot of real-life problems and it could even give a little tug at you heart and that is why I gave it a rating of three stars."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I thought that this book was one of the greatest books I have read.The book catches you from the first pages that you read.J.D.Salinger did a great job on this book.

It is something that is not human, but holy."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"After finishing the last page of &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, I suddenly got a strange feeling like someone was reading my mind. I got this unexpected urge to check my room for video cameras, like everything that I had done or thought or said in my life had been recorded by some voyeur. This was the effect that &quot;Catcher&quot; had on me. Holden Caulfield, without a doubt the most fascinating literary character ever written, seems to be the essence of every teenager on the face of the Earth, myself included. Many of the thoughts expressed by Holden have, at some time in my life, been echoed in my own mind. It was truly all I could do not to scream out &quot;I totally agree with you!&quot; during a few points in the book. This is what makes &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; the greatest novel ever written, the fact that it is such a brilliant reflection of at least some of the hopes, fears, and desires of every single teenager out there."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is, hands down, the best book I've ever read, and I'm a bookworm. I've heard people say it's dated, the writing's terrible, well listen. It's dated to us because he's writing from the point of view of an adolescent boy in the 1950's, so of course nowadays we don't understand some of their slang. The writing is as if he was talking to you, and it's such a personal story. It's so touching, and speaks to you in such a way that after it's over, you wish it could go on forever and just not end. If you haven't read it all ready, go! Buy it! You certainly won't regret it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield is a pimply, foul mouthed, sixteen year old kid who believes with all of his heart that just about everyone and everything in his life is a \\"phoney\\". He thinks, of course, he is great, but no one understands him. His teachers stink. He goes to school. Many schools. In fact, today we would call Holden a \\"loser\\". Yet I believe the story is given to high schoolers often to read because of it's very \\"unphoney\\" coming of age of young Mr. Holden Caulfield. Thankfully, not all teenagers are like Holden, who comes from a well-to-do family, with a dead brother he loved and a little sister he adores. He is a poignant protagonist, and if read in the right light, can tug at your heartstrings as you begin to sense the isolation and loneliness that has lived with him for a very long time, I sense since his older brother Allie passed away. When Allie died, Holden was old enough to recall himself smashing all the windows in the garage and breaking his hand that night. Holden, though not the epitome of a teenager, is an alienated, sad, individual who builds his armor by swearing and chain smoking and not believing in life at all. We hear about Holden first at his latest school, Pencey, and those last few days at Pencey describe much of adolescent life during the early nineteen forties. Abrasive even today, nevertheless it is a book not to missed, and one to be remembered."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"For those who don't know if they should read, you must. This is one of, if not the, greatest coming-of-age novels of all time. Holden Caulfield flunks from a prep school, but he doesn't want to come home early to tell his parents about it. So he spends four days in New York City on his own. Holden is perhaps one of the most intriguing characters ever written down. He has a &quot;limited vocabulary,&quot; but is wise beyond his years. And he wasn't raised by the Disney Channel and others of naive, demeaning purposes. Salinger writes speeches in poetry. This is a classic. It looks at people from a distance with a racy glance. It's a savy, street smart stupendous sample of literature. Read it. Read it today."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caufield, in The Catcher in the Rye, is a very upsetting person as an individual. He sees the world as many &quot;phonies&quot;. He is not disciplined at all and is not well educated. He has been to several private schools, although he manages to be kicked out of all of them. So he has had the chance to be well educated he never applies himself though. He has no drive in him that I see. He has a poor outlook on everything wrong and write in the world. If this type of person is the type the author tried to portray in the novel, he did a very nice job. It would be interesting to read some of his other novels to compare them. I hope not all the main characters in his novels are that negative. Do not get me wrong the book was good as a whole. The mood and negativity of Holden added to the quality of the book. That is more than likely what the author was trying to create in his writing. It educated the reader a little about life in school and for a young adult. How it might be a little rough at times and there are decisions that must be made on the way. I hope that some young adults can learn that school is important and a necessity of life. I took that one thing away from this book plus a few others. Parents might learn something as well. They can learn to be a little more understanding of their children at times. Overall, I would recommend this novel to other people, old and young, not too young."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye definitely got my attention in the beginning. It was interesting going throught the life of a young man and his journey, but after reading about how he feels about this or that and really it seemed like of a lot of opinions on his part, it got really old and boring. Because I don't agree or I cannot relate to what it is he is talking about. Although it is a good book and could even be a fun adventure."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I thought the book was vey interesting. I really thought that the auther did a very good job of telling in great detales about every person he sees, but at the some time at some point he sounded very gay when he would keep talking about how good some of the guys looked in the book and he just kept going and going about it for a page or two. But all together the book was very good because the way he kept the book in teresting with putting different emotions through out the book, he would talk in a way that he would be sad and then he would put in the mad parts in there even sad parts and i really loves the way he ended the book that was probably the greatest ending with out really ending the book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I think that this is the best book in the world! It describes perfectly the feelings as a teenager and the feeling of rejection and depression because I myself am a 14 year old boy. Holden is a great character and has they greatest perspective on life. This book includes comedy along with seriousness. What i mean is when Holden got drunk it was kind of sad to see what he was reduced to and the reasons that he got drunk. While that was somewhat sad it was also very funny to see Holden slurring all his words and stumbling around talking to people without a care in the world. While i was reading this book i was amazed at the amount of composure Holden showed even when people were dissing him. personally I would have punched some of them in the nose. It took me a while to figure out what happened to Holden at the very end of the book on account of the fact they never came out and told you. I thought that was a great way to end it for more advanced readers. And I loved Holden's idea of paradise. Being the Catcher in the rye. That was a great part in the book. Overall I thought this was an exelent book that every one should take the time to read and ponder about. thank you for taking the time to read my review."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Most, if not all, people who have read &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; have said that the book changed their life. It changed mine. The change for everyone is different, but for me, &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; gave me faith in the materialistic world we live in today. Being a cynical adolescent myself, I can relate with Holden. Although he does not exist in the outside world, he exists in my heart. Exisists in my heart as friend; as someone who knows what I'm going through.Written with wit, sarcasm, and humor, &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; is one of those books that you can read over and over again. JD Salinger portrays with brutal honesty a young man fed up with rules, with standards. A young man who had everything in front of him, yet nothing at all. A young man, who, despite all the adversity he faced, came out strong and with a new perspective on life. Holden is cynical. Holden is sarcastic. Holden is, well, a jerk when he wants to be. However, there's something about him and the way he is written that makes it obvious why he is one of English literature's most beloved characters.Throughout the book, Holden goes through his share of adventures; from getting expelled from his private school, to an awkward (and humorous) night with a prostitute, to the end of the book where we learn where Holden is telling his story from. Each chapter is skillfully written and unique. JD Salinger is one of, if not the best, writers to ever grace American literature with his presence.&quot;The Cather in the Rye&quot; *is* a timeless classic that will please the nihilist in all of us."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is about so much more than baseball, it's not even funny! J.D. Salinger was a real maverick here, writing a story that most of us would never even think of imagining. I am looking forward to watching the SF Giants play the LA Dodgers tonight, but this book really opened my eyes to what it is like to see things over a much greater playing field."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"i ussually hate reading. but when i read this book in my english class i couldint put it down. its very interesting. it is about a 16 yr old boy who gets kicked outta school and he leaves and spends the rest of the time traveling around the city pretty much. but he runs into all sorts of crazy things."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Everybody is a big phony--well, at least to Holden Caulfield. &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; is one of those books that it seems everyone dreads having to read in high school but for no understandable reason. I was never forced to read it in high school and now that I am in college and have started reading on my own, I decided to check out this classic work.Holden, going through what can be considered normal teen emotions, appears to have a real chip on his shoulder. After being kicked out of yet another school, Holden becomes depressed. Wandering around New York until it is safe to go home, he is left to wallow in obscurity. The only people or things he cares deeply for is his little sister, Phoebe, and his dead brother, Allie. Holden's relationship with Phoebe, my favorite aspect of the book, is the only thing managing to keep him sane. Borrowing a phrase that Holden likes to use, Phoebe really &quot;knocked him out.&quot; The other characters, such as fellow Pency students Ackley and Stadtler, have limited roles and only further add to Holden's disillusionment.From the beginning of the book it easy to identify with Holden, even though his view of the world is almost exclusively negative. Holden confides in you and it feels very easy to confide in him. At first the ending seemed empty, as it if was lacking a denouement. However, if you read between the lines, the ending is very fitting. This is the theme throughout the rest of the book too--it is an average story when taken at face value but further inspection reveals greatness.I did enjoy reading this book. The only reasons I didn't give it the final star to signify true excellence was some of the harsh language used and the depressing nature of the book. It really isn't the best book to read if you are feeling down on your luck. Otherwise, if you have never read it or were forced to read it in high school and didn't like it then, I recommend you pick up a copy now."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I cannot believe that i'm 39 years old and am just now discovering this classic. I remember back when i was in elementary school and my older brother was in high school and studying this book. I knew nothing about it and simply shrugged it off as a very short novel that people had to study for English class. I can also remember that several years ago a girl once told me that i reminded her of the main character in Catcher In The Rye. I asked if i was supposed to take that as a compliment or insult, she said compliment because some of the sarcastic and funny things and the way i expressed myself reminded her of Holden Caulfield in the book. Having read the book i tend to agree with her, and i found myself laughing out loud at Holden's sarcasm and wit. This book grabbed my attention from the first page. I loved the style of writing and found that although the book was written in the 40s and some of the words and phrases are dated, for the most part the story had a contemporary flow to it, and could easily have taken place today. I've heard that this book is banned in alot of schools and i'm thinking WHY? Is it because of the swearing? Have you heard the trashy foul mouths on some of today's youth? The language in this book is nothing compared to that. This book should be required reading by all high school students, as it paints a picture of the feelings of frustration and alienation, and not fitting into the world that most every adolescent goes through at some point, and how adults and authority figures seem to be all [people] who don't know or understand anything. This book is one that i will be reading many times. I can't believe a book like this was written back in the 40s. It's an amazing book! I now understand why this used to be such an important book back in school before they banned it.This book makes me want to read all of Salinger's other writings. When a book can make me laugh right out loud i know i've found a really special book. It's extremely well-written and probably one of the most accurately perceptive writings as to how a youth that age would probably think and feel."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I missed out reading this book in High School and have been catching up especially since schools are banning this book. This book is very conservative compared to what I can see on network TV. Yes it has mature content but is a excellent work and an easy read. When asked what it was about I replied - &quot;Life&quot;."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book when I was 17 and it absolutely blew me away. Holden's sad desperate angst and terrific need for answers to this phony world is exactly what hooked me. His gradual breakdown is terrible to watch but, like a traffic accident, you can't turn away. Yes, It has pretty raw language in it but this only enhances the book's realism and makes it that much more real and true."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I first read &quot;The Catcher In the Rye&quot; this past year as a freshman in high school, as part of an oral presentation. I was completely amazed at this novel. Holden Caulfield is a youth of sixteen years that embarks on an odyssey of self discovery. I found Holden, a character in a 1949 setting to be very real even to myself as a contemporary teenager. He is someone that teens can relate to because the issues Holden faces in &quot;Catcher&quot; are still the issues teenagers today battle. &quot;Catcher&quot; has been challenged and banned since 1951 because of the frequent use of profanity. However, the expletives are applied artistically to frame Holden's temperament and to express the hidden issues of the teenager. I am not one to curse excessively or frequently. However, I found &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; to be an exceptional book, surpassing my original skeptical expectations."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I just finished The Catcher in the Rye for the second time in my life, and this time (when I am 20 years old), I feel like I finally understand why it is such a popular book. When I was younger, I loved the book but was too caught up by the foul language, prostitues, and poor manners of most of the characters (if those bother you, it is not a good book for you), but now that I am a bit desensitized by those aspects of the book, I understand how well Salinger captures the alienation of teenagers. I found myself relating to Holden Caufield, his cynicism, frustration with the world in which he is stuck, and the desire just to leave everything behind because certainly the grass is greener on the other side. Everyone can relate to this if they allow themselves to remember just how topsy turvy-adolescense can be. The story itself has many incredible moments and some excellent characters, but I will admit that it slows down occasionally and sometimes does not flow well, but I am willing to accept those aspects of the book because they help remind the reader of Holden's alienation and the story remains incredibly enriching and still causes a healthy does of self-reflection. I liked this book a lot and will assure any teen or someone who wants to reminisce about their youth, that it is a terrific book for you."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book sets the standard that all smart mouthed children are expected to live up to.

The Catcher in the Rye is a tremendous novel, it is warm, compassionate and desperate, providing the reader with a piercing articulation of the sense of longing that seems to be an inherent component of the human condition. Most fans of literature will probably tell you that this is the first novel they read that gave them an almost instant understanding that they had read a masterpiece and not just a story. The basic plot follows the adventures of a confused young man over a few days as he trys to make some sense out of his life. The writing is very intimate and real as the characters invite you into their thoughts.

Salinger paints a totally accurate view of the world of a teenage boy, or any teenager, for that matter. While the story is set in 1950's New York, it would have fit perfectly into 2001 Small Town (or Big City), USA. I would recommend this to anyone, young or old, to help people truly understand what it is to be young and lost in the world."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Best book I have ever read.I just want to say if you have not read this book yet do it.Its great!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Wow. That is the first word uttered after I put this novel down. J.D. Salinger truly has a gift for writing. Catcher In The Rye is an amazing novel, written richly and in colorful tone. Holden Caulfield is the perfect main character you never thought of. Who knew that writing about some modern boring life could be so interesting? To me, this book is the best I have ever read in my life. It is richly detailed and fully animated to make a book hard to put down without finding out what is on the next page. Salinger completely describes the hardships of a 16 year old trying to find himself in a superficial world in which he cannot trust many people. It explains his thought process, through which Holden rambles on about his messed up life and how everyone around him he cannot stand. The plot is quite realistic and in a portion of the novel I as shocked to find a situation in which I myself could closely relate to. (I would rather not say which, for his situations certainly are not fattering) This novel is so great, I cannot stress enough that it is a must read for any teenager struggling to find his or her identity. It is a cure for the common depression of adolescents. Thank you J.D. Salinger for writing such a great novel and it is too bad you cannot share even more of your wonders with us."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This was my introduction to \\"real reading\\". Before reading this book, I had kept to what I will call \\"easier\\" reading.\\"Catcher in the Rye\\" was assigned to us by our English Teacher, as a part of our undergraduate English class. Our teacher, Ms. Syring, knew the book by heart. She seemed to tell us each day what was coming next. At times, this was the most annoying thing that she could have done. Yet in the beginning while reading the book, her telling us what was to come kept our class interested. (Imagine teaching English litterature to a bunch of Accounting students!) I sat many hours on the train back and forth to school, reading the book, chapter after chapter. (And I have read the book many times since then..)Holden is a character I can identify with. I surely believe that at some point in life, every single one of us goes through a stage such as Holden's. The book reflects on the different situations and insecurities many of us have, or will be facing, in life. J. D. Sallinger wrote the book in 1951, but Holden's struggle in life is as valid in 2001, as is was back then.If you only read one book this year, make that this one!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"In my opinion, this is one of the best books ever written.

It's not often that you feel such a strong connection with a character that isn't much like yourself, or so it was with me.It's pretty high in the standings for best book ever.You must read this"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is an interesting book, especially for people who have had experienced hard time during their teens, and also for teachers seeking to understand their student&iexcl;s perspective.While reading this book, I, being a teenager myself, came to understand Holden, the main character. He isn&iexcl;t so different from some friends I know. It is my wish that there be more teacher who are willing to to love their students, and help them bestow meaning to their own lives.Holden, when expelled from his prep school Pencey, leaves it as soon as he can. Taking care not to tell the news to his parents sooner than necessary, he lingers in New York. He encounters a series of incidents --- cab drivers, a prostitute, the two nuns&iexcl; --- as he dives deeper into his &iexcl;phony&iexcl; world.Troubled adolescents like Holden are not rare these days. I realized that the source of such repugnance towards one&iexcl;s surroundings is lack of care. No one, at least it seemed so for Holden, cared enough to give attention to what was going on in his mind. The place, other than his home, that should take the blame more than anywhere else was Pencey. The school was full of phonies, because the curriculum was not so focused on making the students &iexcl;find the idea that fits one&iexcl;s mind best.&iexcl; Finally, Phobe, the only person in the story that is capable of giving Holden the much needed affection and care, saves Holden from his deep fall and sets him straight.This story, written in first-person narrative and conversational tone, ends with an happy ending. But I keep asking myself: Will every troubled boy find his Phoebe?It depresses the hell outta me when I think about it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book has, from the time it was written, been controversial - and to more conservative readers, it has been somewhat offensive. However, the case of this book should be judged only after one has read the book for one's self. The events, frustrated musings and reprobating mien that Holden Caulfield reveals to his audience - no matter how unsettling or contentiously expressed - have much to say about human nature, society and its agents, the family, death, and even homophobia. Readers will find themselves asking questions and will finish the book with either stongly opinionated answers, or an empathetic appretiation for what young people endure. I recommend this book to everyone with an open mind."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"When was the last time you met a truly satisfied and happy sixteen-year-old? I can honestly tell you that it has been quite a while for me. The Catcher in the Rye focuses in upon that particular aspect of teen life: depression and self-gratification. The main character, Holden, wants to be a &quot;catcher in the rye,&quot; a savior of the innocence missing in the world around him, a world that has let him fall over the cliff into adulthood alone. He is tossed into a world that he knows very little about and must survive. This book is an excellent story and a masterpiece. It never should have been banned anywhere, but I can see why it was. Local color seems to play a big role in this book, the dialect and slang used by the characters like &quot;ya&quot; &quot;trynna&quot; and other &quot;lazy American&quot; talk. The presence of nightclubs and their role in New York's society is blatantly shown as incredibly important to both sexes. The illegal obtaining and consumption of alcohol is also a tie-in and customary past time for teens in the early fifties. Prostitution also ran rampant around that time, providing a multi-million dollar per capita business in New York alone. The recovery from WWII is also present as many women are still working and men coming home from the war are basically left at home, lest they force their wives out of their only chances at earning some money. Another direct reference to subjects taught to me in History class is when Holden attends a movie at Radio City Music Hall about WWII and his reference to the Atomic Bomb. This was present in the minds of most Americans at this time, the horrors and sheer power of the atomic bomb, and the fear that Russia and Germany may turn their scientific advancements in the atomic field on America during the Cold War. I have always dreaded any English teacher's favorite words: &quot;This book is due&#8230;&quot; Being an honors student I have heard this many, many more times than I ever wanted to in my life. I have always made it a point to NOT read the book because they always said, &quot;Oh, you'll love it! It really is a good book, I promise you.&quot; To tell you the truth, I was seriously considering not reading this one either, but then I thought of the previous experiences with novels assigned to me by my history teachers. I couldn't think of one bad book I had ever read for History class aside from the textbook, so I read it and I am immensely glad that I did. This book embodies everything I stand for: misery, depression, solitude, atheism, and just plain not caring. Throughout this book, Holden proves the ignorance and stupidity of mankind and their uncaring and unthinking nature. For example twice he attempts to start conversations with his cab driver. Each time they either showed apathy or contempt to his attempts to brighten their days. How often I have tried to make conversation with someone I didn't know just so they couldn't say that I hadn't and virtually every time I have been snubbed while their noses stayed upturned to the world. This book is an excellent novel for anyone who is missing something in this world and wants to be a champion and help others while the rest of the world stands by and watches with apathy. This book opens all its readers to the world of a teenager, something that few books I have ever read have been able to do accurately. I have read books from my Mother's bookshelf about the psychiatry of the teenage mind. I would like to ask the authors of books like that one thing: If every teenager is different, as you have blatantly stated in you book, then how can you make generalizations like you do? This novel makes no generalizations, it is not about every teenager, it is about one, and that one experiences different people in his time in New York the same age as him, and they are all different. J. D. Salinger is a true magician. For anyone who wants to be a Catcher in the Rye, you should all read this book before you yourself have a nervous breakdown and end up in a rest home writing a novel."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"First of all, I want to apologize about my bad english, but I\`ll try to express myself I read this book because I hear that this book encouraged Lennon\`s murderer to... him. I had the curiosity to know what would a book can say to encourage somebody to .... After I read this book I can say about it that far of being a classic literature book, is better a filosofy one, but not as you read it, as you undersantd it. I can compare this book with other that is very similar, this is &quot;Der Steppenwolf&quot; by Hermann Hesse. In this book the main character, Harry Haller, is a misunderstanded guy that is sure that he is a very rare kind of human who had another side, a dark side that is like an animal and it come out and fight with the human side. This same theory is in The Catcher in the Rye, tha main character, Holden Caulfield, is a misunderstanded guy that have this both sides that always fight, the human Holden and the animal Holden, so he get depressed and he seems to have no goals in life. But this book also has a pretty cool humor, because Holden is a cynic teenager that doesn\`t worry about and always have nothing left to lose. Also is a very special guy, who can despise the most complex art or science, but in the other side he admire very little details like a good dancer or his sister(better his death brother). As my conclusion I can recommend this book, but not to everybody, I recommend it for those who are not enough worried about anything and for those who wnats to see &quot;behind the catcher&quot; to indentify themselves.Again, excuse me for my terrible english! Thank you!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"If you're reading The Catcher in the Rye because you heard somewhere that it'll give you the meaning to life, and there's some sort of hidden message, like reading it backwards says &quot;Paul is dead,&quot; don't read it. J.D. Salinger, like so many sadly misinterpreted writers of his day, is examining Holden's internal impulses, searching for meaning in a world where he has yet to find any. This book is written in stream-of-consciousness style, meaning the sentences run-on and meander, true to Holden's thinking. It's actually as if the book were written, and then Holden got his hands on it, and his own interpretation of it is what resulted in Catcher. This book will continue to frustrate anyone who reads it for plot coherence, because it is driven by character.To many people, a good book equals a good storyline with a nice, neat ending, and as a result, this book doesn't measure up. J.D. Salinger instead chooses to CHALLENGE OUR CONVENTIONS of a novel, and in doing so, creates a lasting place for himself among the likes of Joyce and Woolf. Brilliant."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"For years, when people were asked which book had the most impact on their lives, Catcher headed the list. When I finally got to read this gem, I was utterly perplexed. Although Salinger writes well, the book's lack of a plot and immature, plaintive hero drove me to hate it. I could have done without a plot if Holden Caufield had learned anything from his experiences. However, upon the conclusion of the book, he is still the same insecure, apathetic, sarcastic, slimy little toad that he is at the beginning. He undergoes no change which is the only thing that could have saved this zepplin of a book. After drawing out a weekend into pages and pages of ordinary, Caufield finally realizes that the world is fake?! Well, DUH!. I have to wonder about readers who found this a revelation. I suppose if one entered the world blind to people's true intentions and motivations that this fact could be elusive. However, to those of us whio dare to think independently, the theme of the novel is something we've known for years. If you choose to read this, be prepared for disappointment."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I never really liked this book (probably because I was forced to read it when I was young). But reading the reviews here reminds me of my favorite book. If you like social commentary - GO READ STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND. Check the reviews....you will find them equally as passionate"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I first read this book in 7th grade--I picked it up on my own. I think that's the best thing I could have done for myself at the time. I again read it in 8th grade on my own, and then in 10th we read it for my English class. I have picked it up since then, and have read it about 5 times now. I guess the question always remains: What draws people to this book? What makes them read it over and over? I answer because it's good. Such a simple word, but true. In 11th grade this book played a major role in my life again. I wrote my term paper on JD Salinger. In some ways understanding the author helps you understand this book. I think the most important aspect that everyone must remember is the impact this book can and will have on certain individuals. And it seems so far that most of it has been received well, and I'm glad. I would recommend that young teens read this book--all of them. The main character's personality is easy to identify with. In some form I believe that deep down we all see a little of Holden in ourselves. And some people have a hard time dealing with it, but it can't be denied. I believe what's so compelling about this character is his honesty--brutal honesty. I think a lot of us think what he is saying, although we would never say it outloud, and we would never admit it, but we can all understand and feel where Holden is coming from and to a certain degree we all see the phonies in this world and we all miss our age of innocence. Holden called it like he saw it and that's what I respected most about his character. He said the things I was thinking, he put those thoughts into words I could never have imagined, and my life changed and grew as his did throughout the book"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Many people criticize this book and it's author, J.D. Salinger because ofHolden's language. But that's what makes this book so real. Theuse of language that most of us use, whether we want to admit it or not, make'sthis book come alive for the reader. Another point that make's this book soreal is the fact that Holden is constantly contradicting himself. He says thatnothing ever changes, yet that's why he's so messed up. Everything is constantlyin a state of change. I think most people should read this book. It may shed somelight on the subject of life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"If you are looking for a good read, you should pick up the Catcher in the Rye. J. D. Salinger is at his best with this magnificently told novel.If you have ever felt down or depressed then you will love this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"You'll finish reading this book without feeling very fulfilled, but perhaps intrigued. Holden is an interesting character because of his many levels of personality that Salinger so masterfully brought out. On one level, Holden swears and calls on prostitutes. At another, he goes around erasing swear words from an elementary school's walls. You only get fulfilled after you've looked at the book more deeply, and there always seems to be more to discover"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Do not make the mistake many make in glorifying Holden Caulfield. Pay particular attention to the brief bookends at the beginning and end of the book, which make it clear that Holden is telling this story to a psychiatrist in an asylum. Also, note the passages about Holden's brother, which are central to a deeper understanding of the book"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is the best book that I have ever read. I loved it. Fabulous work by Salinger. Get this book from the library. Although it is not that much to order it. Do what you want. But, get this book and read it.FJ"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Salinger's CATCHER, frequently glorified by the passing teenage generation, is rightly done so.Our hero, the frank and blatantly blunt Holden Caufield, see the raucous, chargingworld through the honest and moody eyes of any pubescentmale, from any time. His biting insights are short, to the point, and unlike mostof the society surrounding him, he's not &quot;phony&quot;. After sharing a small breakfast with some ladies of the church, he comments: &quot;That's what I liked about the nuns.You could always tell, for example, that they never went anywhere swanky for lunch.&quot;If you're tired with the &quot;worn-out trumpery&quot;, and the the trappings of the materialistic world, read this book"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield is one of those fictional characters whose 24 hours of this book metaphorically describes people of similar character -- teenagers with terrible angst.Whether you raised one or were one -- or both -- you know Holden.Being a teenager is bad enough. Being a teenager who is kicked out of boarding school is worse. Being a teenager kicked out of school just when his brother dies is worse yet. Being a kicked-out, brotherless teenager who keeps getting into fights with the few people who like him -- beloved teacher and sister -- is the pits.Just when you think he cannot get any lower, he stoops. And, all in the middle of the city where no one can be a child -- NYC.Holden Caulfield is leaving the innocence of childhood to become a man -- or morphing to become what he calls a phony. And, with impressionable eyes, his observations are accurate. Unlike children, adults do not \\"let it all hang out.\\" There is restraint. The restraint fails to deliver the \\"full truth.\\" The failure to deliver our true feelings, to refrain from saying our opinions, to stop from depositing out $.02 -- that is what makes us phonies.And, he hates it. He wants to be the catcher in the rye when he grows up. The catcher is a mysterious person in the middle of a field which abuts a dangerous cliff -- where he can prevent the children from crossing to the cliffside and falling to their demise. From losing their innocence. From losing their childhood. From becoming phonies.In a great way, we jealously feel the same and are beholden to Holden's fervor to retain his childhood -- something many of us lost years, decades, eons ago."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"16-year-old Holden Caulfield is more than the character in a book. Salinger has, through this youngster's eyes, made and accurate, moving -and at times hilarious- depiction of an everage teenager's mind. The narration of this boy's anguish and confusion after having been kickend out of school, and not knowing what to do with his life, goes beyond the limits of the novel and can easily represent the feelings of loneliness and disorientation of anyone alive in a crazy world. New York and the year 1945 set aside, this narration outstansingly trespasses the barriers of place and time, making it a MUST-READ book anywhere and any time..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"In nearly each review of this book, people refer it as as a &quot;classic&quot; and &quot;fine piece of literature,&quot; but what everyone seems to fail to mention is how very funny this book is. Holden Caulfield is one of the most amusing characters from a book that I have ever read, and there were many times while reading it that I just had to laugh a lot. For instance, who in a book would say &quot;vomity&quot; or &quot;perverty&quot; or &quot;goddam&quot; every five seconds? People say these things in real life, but writers rarely ever catch it. It seems in every page, Holden says some smartass remark that is very amusing, and that is the best part of the book. If he wasn't as sarcastic and both self-loathing and self-loving as he was, I'm not sure that the book could even stand to be read from just the storyline alone. This is one of the funniest books I have ever read -- definitely a page-turner -- and has renewed my interest in reading. Usually when I read the book, I am curious about the author, yet in this case, the dialogue and writing were so catchy that I was mostly just interested in Holden. This is a funny sort of American book with an American humour, and is definitely worthy of a read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is Holden Caulfield's personal narrative of his four day attempt to esacpe from the phoniness of the world, and to find a fixed reality. The entire book is a flashback filled with digressions, anedotes, and asides that reveal Holden's character.The book is concerned about psychological pressures felt by the teenager who was actually on the brink to adulthood. J. D. Salinger somehow wanted to portrait Holden as a hero who was determined to escape the world and seek a new home - a place where he will be involved with nobody, where there will be no pain, no disillusionment, and no involvement.Over the span of four days, Holden was met by psychological and metaphorical challenges, or even dangers, that robbed him of his own values, own individuality and intellectual autonomy. The reason why I say the whole world is involved is becuase of the great number of people Holden encountered in this novel. From his own parents and siblings, his friends at Pencey Prep to the hooker, etc., Holden is a character with incredibly great aquaintances.THE CATCH IN THE RYE has remained one of my most beloved book since I first read it in eighth grade. Every now and then I have to re-read the book and be transformed again. The book was banned in certain communities and condemned by some school boards due to profanity since it was published in 1951. It is truly one of American classics. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I absolutely felt that this book was worth reading. Most present day teenagers can definitely relate to some aspect of this book. In fact, older adults can also relate back to difficult times during their teenage years. There were many times, as I was reading, that I paused and thought to myself, &quot;this same thing has happened to me or I have often felt the same way about that.&quot; Holden's &quot;confession&quot; in his quest to find true understanding and compassion is an odyssey that should be shared with others."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The funny thing is that first read Catcher in the Rye as a Mormon Missionary in Virginia. Due to an illness I was boxed up in an apartment in a different country, a different world, alone, nineteen, and not quite sure what I was doing. The bottled angst of being surrounded, and unconsciencely annoyed, by so many 'phonies' really escaped through the pains and misadventure of Holden. I found the book a fresh breathe of Honesty. It is amazing in Holden's outlook and now, all these years later after getting the book again, I realize how a resolve to become honestly (legitimately) a catcher in the rye -- that is, a good and caring person -- has guided me.I enjoyed it then and now I do again. The odd and strange twists and critics of the world make you laugh, and then make you think - for a long time. The book is a great introduction to a new and tough way to realize how someone else worried about zits and sex and life in crazy dog-days of post-pubesence.The best way to spend Six dollars."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It was clear to me that I wasn't going to get attached to the plot ot the book about half way through with reading it. It isn't a book you would read for a suspense and a awesome ending either. It is more of the narration by the main character in the book named Holden that really draws you to this novel written by J.D. Salinger. The Catcher in the Rye was a book that i enjoyed becuase of this style of writting. I often found myself laughing out loud because of the different things Holden would be saying out loud of thinking in his head and sharing with the reader. It made very good attempts to show the fustration of Holden and did a great job of keeping it real. By the middle of the book you sort of knew exacltly what to expect from Holden but you still never kne what he would say. Lets just say he rarely surprised you through his actions or what he told the readers. Although few of us go to the extreme in some cases as he does but it is sometimes easy to relate to his fustraion with the simplest things. Don't get this book if you are into a great suspense but if you really enjoy reading new styles of writting and different kinds of books &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; is one that you will definitly enjoy."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I believe this is perhaps one of the top two books I have ever read. Maybe this a biased opinion, seeing as how I am rapidly approaching the age of Holden Caulfield (very rapidly, I'm told), and that I too went to a private school in which I felt I was sorrounded by phonies. However, this is the very nature of the book: I believe you can't help but relate to the main character; JD Salinger designed the character of Holden Caulfield so flawlesly that the single fact that Holden was of Salinger's own invention is reason enough for me to regard it as one of the greatest works of litearature ever written, and anyone who would disagree was never an adolescent."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye has truly stood the test of time, being one of the most well known stories of all time. It isn't suprising how so many people can actually relate to Holden. He's the truth that most people can't even come close to admitting to. I read it for the first time when I was 15. I checked it out at the school library, just to see what the fuss was about. I am reading it again, absorbing more, feeling more, and coming to admit my own feelings of life and society. I personally believe that this should be a story that should be passed to adolescents at the coming of age, teaching them that life isn't as easy when you're out on your own. If you love deep reading, this is definetly worth the time. I read it better, and understood it more while I listening to Pink Floyd, but that won't work for everyone ;)"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I remember when I was that age. I hated everything that didnot fit into my world. I hate the world too as a matter of fact. And the came Cauldfield. We wanted to be like him, but we did not have the guts ro run away, get expelled, and feel free.If we go back to 1951, think on the impact of this book on that generation. Rebellious, insatisifed kids (and more) felt compeled to be like Holden, and the attraction was inmediate. I don't loose sight of the political and cultural epoch of a bok; it will give us a wider persepctive of who and why.Salinger, who then intelligently (and what a great marketing act that was) vanished, knew what he was writing, and imagined that he could not get any better than the Catcher. He did not have any more to say, and he decided to shut up. Good move!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"There is a reason so many people (including me) have claimed The Catcher in the Rye as their favorite book ever. The reason is that it is quite probably a perfect novel. JD Salinger is an artist with his words. They're funny and moving and insightful all at the same time. Each line in the book is a thought in Holden's mind--and while reading it I never got the impression that I was reading these thoughts. It was like the thoughts were being poured from Holden's mind into my own, and the words were just incidental. Phoebe was also my sister. Mr. Ackley was also my teacher. My heart broke over the death of my brother. I wondered where the ducks flew from the park. I faked having a bullet wound in my stomach and stumbled into the bathroom. In all these ways and many many more, JD Salinger is able to make the reader feel like s/he is right there with Holden through all of it. And maybe it sounds really corny, because Holden's only a character and all, but he is so dang likeable that I would marry that guy. If you haven't read this book, you must. You have to meet Holden. And if you have already read it, read it again every year to visit Holden and to remember what the perfect novel is like."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Before I begin with my complaints, I would like to say that this is one of my favorite books of all time. However, I did have a hard time understanding the point behind it all. I mean one second it's telling you to kill John Lennon, the next it's telling you to kill Ronald Reagan in order to impress Jodie Foster. Well, which is it? I suppose it's possible that the book wanted me to kill both of them but if that's the case then why not simply state it outright, instead of leaving it up to interpretation like it did?Furthermore, now that both the people that the book instructs on killing are dead, it seems a little dated. Sure, it can be read as a coming-of-age-tale, but to do that you must read between the lines. I tried calling Mr. Salinger to have him clear it all up, but he wouldn't answer. It turns out that in an effort to become even more reclusive, he's died.My favorite quotation from the book: \\"Kill John Lennon. Go ahead, you know you want to. Just do it.\\" A real example of classic prose, a skill that unfortunately seems to have been lost by many modern writers.Overall, I give it five dead celebrities out of five."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The other day I was at a store and saw a little boy excited to get on and ride the escalator. Nothing was passing through his head about being cool, about pretending it was routine for him, no embarrassment, just plain excitement. Holden Caulfield would have said, \\"He kills me.\\"The thing is that we grow out of that and into something else -- a much more self-conscious, socially aware, socially anxious, strategic, plotting . . . adult. Caulfield doesn't like that -- it's full of \\"phonies.\\" How do you grow into an adult without becoming a \\"phony?\\" As Caulfield says, \\"How would you know you weren't being a phony? The trouble is, you wouldn't.\\" You could be phony about being phony, priding yourself on your non-phoniness, on your seeing through everybody else's phoniness. You never know.If you're like me, and you haven't read A Catcher in the Rye for a very long time, it's worth a re-read (or maybe two)."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"With the recent death of its author, J.D. Salinger, I felt that it was time to finally do something I have been intending to do for years, read his classic. I was disappointed. Maybe it was because I had high expectations after all the hype. Maybe it was because I kept expecting something to happen, you know, the classic building action, climax, resolution thing. This book is nothing like this.Written about a couple of days in the life of a teen who was newly expelled from yet another private high school, the author explores the traditionally pessimistic, skeptic, somewhat depressing view that youth has about the world created by his predecessors. Written with plenty of voice, this book is an enjoyable read, as the reader waits for something to develop. I could almost hear the voice of this book's contemporary, Jack Kerouac, in the pages. But nothing does happen. Maybe that was the author's point. In any case, I found that disappointing."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"After Salinger's death, I wanted to reread The Catcher in the Rye, so ordered a used paperback.

Sometimes shocking, acid, sharp and touching, the child goes on with his thoughts under the 50's American atmosphere."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had high expectations for this book, which always adds pressure to a reading experience. I found the novel appealing with angry ant Holden reminding me in some ways of myself during high school, but I must confess that I missed the key message of this story. The characters lacked visible face for me, and the timeline of two or three days was a contributing obstacle. The \\"up yours\\" attitude of Holden's towards authority is a feeling all reading can relate to in their own ways. But I am still unsure what I was supposed to feel or understand better by the conclusion of this book. A decent novel, but it didn't sizzle for me.Nicholas R.W.

However, I soon realized that the plot of the story is perfectly fitted to show the real focus. Characterization. Once in a while, I come across a book with it's primary strength being characterization. This book is an example. The characters are very 3 Dimensional and distinct. From Ackley to the prostitute, all the characters are life-like and imaginative. I rank it way up there with Animal Farm and Annie Frank, but give it 4 stars because the plot COULD have been a bit more interesting as well as supportive. For these reasons, I enjoyed this book and strongly suggest it to anyone that appreciates realism."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"As profoundly insightful as a novel can be, CATCHER IN THE RYE is the best novel I've read this summer, except for perhaps THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY, which has a protagonist that reminds me of Holden Caulfield.

It was so easy to read the way Salinger worded everything almost like Holden Caulfield was telling his story to you in person. The characters were almost three-dimensional, making them quickly identifiable with people in real life easier than in any other book I have ever read. Also to my amazement the language seemed quite shocking to me considering it was written during the 1950's-even though I was aware that it was widely banned at that time. Still nothing can take away from this perfectly written masterpiece whom I would recommend to just about anyone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A sad story of youth depression and Alienation.

I would recommend it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I can understand how some people would find this book incredibly dull because honestly, nothing really happens except this 16 year old bitches about his life. But, it cracks me up every time I read it. Sophomore year, my advanced english class read it and all my friends simply adored it. It wasn't the typical run-of-the-mill english book. This book made you laugh, made you think, and made you understand, if not actually feel for Holden. Salinger is a genius (and quite mysterious). &quot;Franny and Zoey&quot; made no sense to me since I didn't have an english teacher to explain it to me, but I'm four years out of sophomore english and still read this book every year. I'm glad it wasn't banned in my high school!!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Salinger has been criticized for an overabundance of pathos through the story, as opposed to objective 'tragedy' as one critic termed it. I think this is a myopic criticism however, CITR is much more modern than any true tragedy and it aptly portrays the confusion of the time (that continues untill modern times). Pathos is undoubtedly the best way to express this confusion. Salinger's prose is refreshing becomes it doesn't have a distinct theme to it, sometimes ineffable emotion is better than indoctrination. It's interesting to note that those who didn't like the book were somehow forced into reading it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Theres a reason why when you ask people what their favorite book is, a large percentage of the time you hear, \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" Its just a great book.

I finally bought it and read it - and although it was not the worst book I have read, it was no classic either.The hero is a regular teenager, from a well to do white family, who leaves boarding school and goes around more or less aimlessly for a few days. He is of course confused, and full of thoughts, which may have caused a sensation 50 years ago, but is a cliche today. There is nothing truly rebellious about him.A classic to me is a book that stands the test of time. This book has certainly failed to maintain its initial relevance over the years. Still, it is not too bad as a regular adolescence book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Another good title for the book could be 'The Dopey, Immature Kid with a Lousy Attitude'. I read this book twice, once as an immature teenager and the second time as an immature adult. The reason I read the book again as an adult was to find the so-called 'great meaning and powerful ideas' that are supposedly contained in the novel. I found absolutely nothing of significance and meaning that would qualify this novel as a classic or masterpiece.Basically, this novel is simply about an immature, screwed up, mentally disturbed, brat with a terrible attitude. The only thing the kid needs is a good, hard kick in his butt. Don't get me wrong. It's an interesting read and somewhat enjoyable, but that's all there is to it. If you want to read a great novel with real significance and superb insight about our world then read '1984' by George Orwell, the greatest novel I have ever read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is simply a classic masterpiece, depicting a rich boy, Holden Caulfield, as he bums around New York City after being expelled from yet another prep school. The style of writing is honest and believable - it is told in the first person, by Holden, and his teenage dialect is both funny and realistic, as he uses the same few phrases over and over again throughout the book, as many teenagers do today. Although this book was written in 1945, the writing style allows it to take place in modern times. It is also a fairly quick read with many quotable quotes, and is the sort of book that can be read again and again. I highly recommend it for anyone but particularly adolescents, who are probably feeling many of the same emotions as Holden Caulfield."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Although everyone seems to think it's a must read book, I tend to differ. I read this book at age 18 because I was sure I was missing out on something great, but it turned out that I wasn't missing much. Holden Caulfield, the main character, is cynical, selfish, and an all around jerk if you ask me. Also, J.D. Salinger's writing technique didn't impress me. He was very repeditive, and instead of getting his point across, it only succeeded in running his point into the ground. I was very let down by this novel."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"HOulden should have stayed home. In thsi way, he w&oacute;uldn't have a history to tell and we wouldn't have to read this garbage."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is where \\"emo\\" all began. The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger is widely considered one of the best books ever. I personally cannot see why it is considered so great. It is a very boring and repetitive book with barely any storyline. J.D. Salinger never wrote another novel after The Catcher in the Rye. I can clearly see why. The Catcher in the Rye is more of a collection of short stories than a cumulative, well-told novel.The book starts out at a preppy high school called Pencey Prep. The main character, Holden, drops out and goes to New York, where he goes out on a bunch of dates with people he hates. While he is on these dates, he thinks about and describes how much he hates the person he's out with. Each chapter, Holden rants about something. It can be something as pointless as the price of a briefcase, or something as serious as nuclear war. There, I just summed up pretty much the whole storyline to you.The thing that this book does well though, is that it has great character development. I personally did not have much of a connection with Holden, but I could see how somebody could. Since most of the text in the book is Holden's thoughts along with the occasional dialogue, you get to know Holden pretty well by the end of the book. Rarely could I sympathize with Holden, but many people likely could. He is obviously very depressed and emotional, although he seemed more whiney and irritating to me than deep and depressed.The Catcher in the Rye is a pretty powerful book, despite its weak storyline. Throughout the book, I felt pretty depressed. It's so powerful that it can be dangerous. Two murderers said that Holden was their inspiration. The man that killed John Lennon and a man that attempted to assassinate Ronald Reagan both were obsessed with Holden. That is likely the reason it is considered so good.I have heard some people say that this is a good book because it is unique. It was the first book to dare to write about a troubled teenager afraid to advance into the adult world. Some people say that it is a good book to read at a certain age, around 16-17 years old. Well, I'm sixteen, and I still hate this book. But, if you enjoy reading 200+ pages of some whiney, opinionated kid talk about why he hates everything, how everyone is a phony, and curse every other sentence this is a perfect book for you. Otherwise, I would recommend you stay away from it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"...I had to read this for my English class. We did an Internet blog, with my classmates contributing their own ideas, questions, and answers to the story. I felt as if I were the only person who truly thought the story was lame, and if not a complete eye-roll.As I've mentioned, I am seventeen. I found myself connecting to everyone else EXCEPT Holden. His character is a lame attempt by an *adult* to relive, or God knows what, the experience of a teenager's angst, coming-of-age, and whatever else this book is said to be. Holden goes from being an annoyance to something of a teen dad, where he cries in the rain, as if suddenly everything's meaningful and he's mature. Whoop-de-do. What a load of nonsense. Never have I met, nor will I meet a seventeen year old go from that to that within a year, let alone by himself/herself vagabonding his/her way.I must admit, though, that the style of writing is interesting enough for one to actually read the book. (despite the fact that that's probably the only thing I liked) The beginning was fresh and even funny--this is the only book to which I've laughed--but by the middle, I thought to myself, \\"Is Holden still talking? Why hasn't he just thrown himself into the Hudson?\\" Agh!While people may connect with Holden--as a number of my fellow classmates did--I simply couldn't. Why your parents would be that irresponsible to let you fail all of your classes and keep packing you off to another school, and why you'd continue failing them is beyond me. Dear Jesus get a grip on yourself, Holden.In all honesty, I'm glad I read this, but I certainly would never praise it, nor bother getting into discussion about it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It's safe to assume that if you're reading this review, you've contemplated buying this book. Don't. I realize that if you've got a mind to read it you're going to do so. This is for the person who has a mind a to read 'a classic' but isn't sure which one they want to read. I hated this book. I can't possibly stress my disgust in it via this review. But know this. I read it during a three-week exercise in the Arizona dessert during my tour of service in the Marine Corps. Being that I was in the dessert my options were a) continue reading this book or b) play with dirt. Thirteen pages from the end I chose option b. And I am not a dirt enthusiast. To the author's credit I've never loathed a written word or envied the illiterate as much as I did when I read this book. Maybe that's worth something. Just not to me."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Maybe if I would have read this in high school it would have seemed cool. At 30, I don't get what is so great. Stream of conscious teenage ramblings. Is that hard to write?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I must say the first time i read this book, i did not think much of it. I liked the book and found it to be just another novel that sat on my bookshelf.Now, that I have read it again, in my junioir english class, I must say that this book is even better than i remember. The first time i read it I was about eleven. At the time, I found the language offensive, and couldn't relate to the main character, Holden Caufield. Now, that I am older I can relate to him much more and I am able to look past the language. Many people see Holden as a preppy, spoiled, cynical brat. But in Salinger's defense (the author), he is supposed to be that way. He is teenager, just exemplified. He has raging hormones, he feels the need to hide from his parents and is scared to grow old and take responsibility. As a teenager, I feel everything he feels, although I wouldn't consider myself as much of a \\"madman\\" as him, or hate the world and call them \\"phonies\\", I am able to find parts of myself in Holden, and parts of Holden in me."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I don't know how I missed this for so many years. My parents even had a copy floating around when I was little but I ignored it like all the other books they had sitting around from when they went to college.I really did enjoy this one. The tone was fantastic and the first person viewpoint is hard to pull off for most writers. The dismissive attitude of the protagonist could have easily been overdone but it was just the perfect amount. In chapter 14 when I just started to notice it Holden has his meltdown and everything starts to come together.So yes I am glad I read this book and look forward to more, it was nice to sit in Starbucks on Sunday afternoon and have a nice Venti Drip and listen to my iPod. The tables turned over 3 times during the hour I was there so I'm hopeful that the economic end of society isn't here yet."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The first time I read the Catcher in the Rye I thought it was a brilliant piece of fiction. An instant classic. Then I read it second time and started noticing how annoying Holden can be. The third time I felt that Holden was overreacting. The fourth time, I just could not take it anymore. And that is the exact reason I love this novel. It is Holden's ability to either like or dislike him that makes him so attractive. It is his constant annoyance that leads to the reader either to identify with the him or to detest. Very few other characters in novels have the power to reflect both ways like Holden does. There is no gray area with Holden. It is interesting that people find it boring jsut because of Holden. But the novel does what it is supposed to do. It commands the reader to think and to start developing provoking ideas. He does not resemble the good in human nature. On the contrary, he completely exposes humanity. It leaves naked and exposed to be examined and digested by the reader. It is the perfect parallel to the Lord of the Flies. In both novels, human nature is not promoted. In both novels, human nature is turned around and given a complete make over. It is revealed. And it is through Holden that we learn. We learn to become better than he is. We learn to not be \\"phonies\\"."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The book was received in exactly the condition described, well before the expected due date.

Also included were copies of Aesops Fables and Grimms Fairy Tales, without which no library is complete"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this highly acclaimed novel as part of an ongoing effort to upgrade my reading list. It is included on the Modern Library list of 100 Best Novels and is a staple for budding literature students the world over.That having been said, it's interesting in what goes into making a novel a \\"classic\\". Without the previously known accolades, I would have never labeled this work as such. It is a moderately entertaining period piece, but it is highly repetitive and certainly drags through much of its abbreviated 280 page length.At its heart, it is a portrait of teen angst, as it follows callow, seventeen year old Holden Caulfield for roughly 48 hours as he abandons his most recently failed effort at boarding school and returns to his home in New York City, circa 1950s. Holden \\"hates\\" everything and everybody (except a female acquaintance that we never meet, and his younger sister, Phoebe). Everyone he runs into is either a \\"jerk\\" or a \\"phoney\\". He is bored and life is \\"a pain in the ass\\". He drinks and smokes his way through numerous encounters, leading ultimately to a date with therapy.The writing is certainly first rate, and the subject may have been ground breaking for its time, but its hard to feel anything but annoyance at the attitudes and actions of young Caulfield. Moderately entertaining period piece, yes; literary classic, I don't think so. Three and a half stars."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE has a simple-enough presence: Take a character and let him tell his story. That's exactly what J.D Sallinger did with his character Holden Caulfield.To break it down simply enough, Holden is sixteen-years-old. He's also stuck in a very bad situation. He's at a fancy private school that he absolutely hates. He's failing, so much so that he's about to get kicked out. So, before he gets kicked out, he decides to leave and take a \`break' from everything that's been happening to his life.After leaving the school, he begins his \`break' by reconnecting with some old memories. He rents a hotel room and reflects on the people he's known, particular some past girlfriends and a friend from another school.The thing that makes THE CATCHER IN THE RYE different from most books about teenagers is that Holden isn't a stereotype. We quickly pick this up early in the novel, when we learn that Holden has A LOT to say about his situation. His characterization is only further proven when he decides to buy a \`night' with a girl. It turns out that Holden's not into that; he simply wants someone to talk to. The fact that he isn't a stereotype is what makes him so interesting. But, you're probably wondering, if he isn't a stereotype, how can we relate to him? It's because Holden, like all other teenagers, has problems.I can't say a whole lot more about the book without giving it away. It's fairly short--the mass market paperback being only 214 pages--but it makes for a quick read. I found myself reading it slower though. It's easier to reflect on a book like THE CATCHER IN THE RYE if read in pieces, not all at once.The main moral of the book is that teenagers have it hard, regardless of who they are and where they might be. They've all got problems, they've all got fears, hopes and dreams. There's no escaping what's happening when you're a teenager, and Sallinger captured that perfectly.THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is a book EVERYONE should read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book explores various themes about growing up. It was interesting to note that most of the issues and themes explored still remain unchanged today. Given that the book was written in the 1950s, it shows the author's talent and insight.The protaganist is Holden Caufield, a 16 year old high school boy, and it is written in the first person. I have heard that the book was on a \\"banned\\" list for some time due to the themes it touched on, and the language.A very easy read, and I would highly recommend it.The book is said to be a classic. The first person narrative works great."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Despite a weak plot, &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; is a wonderful book about a brilliant, yet cynical, teenage boy.

A young, cute, very honest guy goes through all of the thoughts, problems, and relationships of teenage life. His name is Holden, Holden Caulfield and boy does he have problems! He can't find a college he likes. He's either getting kicked out, getting into trouble, or just not liking it enough to even try. But all he can think about is what he can do not to tell his parents right away. This book was published along time ago as in my parents even read it, but is still a very good book. It has lots of things in it that still happen a lot today. This book is a great read and I'm not the only one that thinks so The Catcher in the Rye is #9 on the list of the best english-language Fiction books of the twentieth century. It has a unique ending and you're not going to want to miss it! -RachelOrazem"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have been reading these reviews and I don't think one single person really gets what the hell Salinger was trying to say. I don't know myself! Personally, I think that Holden is bi-polar because his moods fluxuate so rapidly. This is made worse by the death and continued grief of his brother Allie. Also, I think it's important to mention the part where Holden is staying at a former teacher's house and wakes to find the man stroking his hair. Later, Holden says that that sort of perverty thing had happened to him a lot when he was a child. So what I think we have here is a bi-polar teenager who has been molested and has never gotten over his brother's death. That would screw anyone up. Don't you think?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've read Catcher in the Rye over 20 times and I always find something new and fasinating about Holden's adventures in New York City.

I don't now why but I have a preference for books who use still other words than Phoney, \\"old\\" and \\"goddamned\\". It is also perfect to ruin your day. Once you start reading this depressing novel from a boy who can't say a singular positive thing about his live, you can say goodbye to your happy feeling. There was only one positive thing about all this. I thought he put himself in a very strange position as a writer. He doesn't regard himself as being the all-knowing novelist, he puts himself kind of aside. You don't see that often. But than again, I think he's just trying to be the underdog, someone eccentric.

The story takes place at Pencey, Caulfield's prep school in Pennsylvania, and then in and around his home in New York. Caulfield suffers throughout the book from the &quot;phoniness&quot; of society, adults, and everyone else with the sole exception of his younger sister Phoebe. I think that the main theme of the novel is &quot;sometimes when you look around you and you hate all you see, it may be you and not everything else that is wrong.&quot; The author, J. D. Salinger, uses many allusions and flashbacks throughout the novel. Holden is a teenager who never fully recovered from the death of his brother, then gets depressed from others being what he calls phonies, and has a nervous breakdown. The story is presented to the reader as he is talking to a psychiatrist at the mental institution he is placed in. I did not like the Catcher in the Rye; it was not the cursing that bothered me but rather the negativity. I really liked Holden though, he'd be a great guy to date. I loved his sarcastic attitude. However, the book just did not appeal to me."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The story is basically about the experiences of this kid, Holden Caulfield, over about a three or four year period.

But, you never actually find out WHAT they did to him, though you do find out where he ends up, sort of.

Soon I was laughing and enjoying myself for the first time in months. I love characters that I can relate to. It also is very straight foward and hard to put down. I carry it around with me, just in case people ask me about school or anything. I was going through the same exact feelings that Holden is in this book when I read it, and its just a wonderful, crudely humorous novel from the mind of a confused young man. It made me feel so much better to know that someone out there had the same thoughts and feelings as me. (Even though it's a 16 yr. old guy in 1951!)... but even if you're not going through any of the same thing(s) as Holden, just read it, because I'm sure everyone will relate to something in this amazing narrative.

It's a good read. I think it's important WHEN you read this book. I read it when I was about the same age as the main character and liked it because it rang true and because I could sympathize with the guy."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have read the Catcher on the Rye on two seperate occasions. The first time I read the novel several years ago I was swept up by the character Holden Caulfield and the way in which I could relate to him as a fifteen year old boy, but my opinions regarding The Catcher in the Rye changed somewhat when I read the book more recently as a college undergraduate. I can still see the way in which the book could be appealing to a teenage male filled with angst regarding that society that he lives in, but now I think that this novel could have been written in a much better way.The Catcher in the Rye only loosely follows a plotline and therefore the events in the novel lack any noticeable connection or continuity except in the most general of ways. The novel, the it addresses serious issues, was not masterfully crafted on any literary level other than its characterization of Holden Caulfield as a teenager rejecting the &quot;phony&quot; society he is being forced to join as he grows older. Despite all of it's faults however, The Catcher in the Rye did start my interest in literature and showed me that things that I cared about could be addressed in literature. The Catcher in the Rye isn't a flawless novel, but it is a must read for any teenager. Hopefully future generations will be inspired by Salinger's wonderful use of the teenage character."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Thousands of people have read The Catcher In the Rye and most of them loved it. As one of the people who love this book, I would say, this book is a really good to read. The writing style of this book is very different from style of other books. Also, it is easy to understand, so it doesn&iexcl;t bore the readers. It causes the readers want to read it. In addition, the author, J.D. Salinger has the great skill, which makes the reader feel like being in the story. These are the reason why The Catcher In the Rye is a really good book to read. Many &iexcl;Best-Sellers&iexcl; have attracted people with their amusement of the contents. In this sense, The Catcher In the Rye has a great resource of enjoyment for readers. In my case, I never got bored of this book, during entire period of reading. The first interesting part of the book is its distinctive language use. The main character, Holden Caulfield, tells the story as a narrator. He recites and describes his feelings in vivid expressions as if he speaks to readers. As he narrates the story, he uses the language, which would be used in conversation between close friends. For example, he says, &iexcl; I was the goddam manager of the fencing team. Very big deal. We&iexcl;d gone in to New York that morning for this fencing meet with McBurney School (P.3).&iexcl; It makes the reader to be more friendly and comfortable with the book. Holden Caulfield is a teenager boy and story is mostly about his experiences of many new things as a teenager. This gets me excited, because I am also a teenager. Things he has experienced and the way he has felt are quite friendly to me. I feel something that adult reader would not feel. Thus, the teenagers would enjoy this book a lot more than adults would. To tell the truth, this book was my 3rd or 4th book I have read in my life, except the books I read from school. With the books I have read, I had some troubles reading it, because there were some parts that were totally confusing and hard to understand. Also, the vocabulary often stops flow of reading, because I had to look in the dictionary quite often to find the meaning of the words. However, The Catcher In the Rye was very easy to read and understand. I hardly ever looked in the dictionary. I could easily finish one chapter without getting stuck. Moreover, I didn&iexcl;t need to think hard while I read this book. I could just relax and enjoy it. That&iexcl;s one of the reasons why it&iexcl;s really a good book to read. While I read this book, I have realized the author&iexcl;s great writing ability. He has the ability to make the readers feel really being in the story. Also he makes the readers feel the same way as Holden does. For example, I felt depressed when Holden was down, and I felt quite delighted when Holden finally gets what he wanted. While I was reading, I was so deep in the book, so that I didn&iexcl;t recognize my brother&iexcl;s calling me and couldn&iexcl;t feel the time passing. In my opinion, the author, J.D. Salinger is a fantastic writer who can manipulate the readers while they read. The author who can put you so deep inside of the book, you just got to find out what will happen next. The most main reason why The Catcher In the Rye is really a good book to read, is because of the author&iexcl;s ability. The Catcher In the Rye is a very nice book to read, especially for teenagers. This book well describes a teenager&iexcl;s feelings of experiencing new life. This book is fun and humorous that keeps the reader away from sleeping or getting bored. It&iexcl;s also very easy and simple; it gives you a comfort and relaxes. It&iexcl;s totally different from the other books, which would give you a headache. In addition, this book is well written enough to get you really in the story. The author makes the readers fall into the story and feel the sadness and happiness as the story goes along. It&iexcl;s the author that creates the different world in your mind. This skillful writing with humor and straightforward expressions are the reasons why The Catcher In the Rye is a really good book to read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"When I read this in high school as required reading I loved it, and felt some kinship with Holden. Having reread it 14 years later I realize that I was Holden - or am. The thought patterns, the use of language, being easily annoyed with dumb people, feeling physically ill when confronted with the inhumanity of the world - it all rang so true for me. The absurdity of life. All the &quot;phonies&quot; out there.How can an author capture this feeling that so many young men feel? It's amazing to me how this story speaks to me in a very personal way, and yet so many other people feel the same way. Isn't this the story of an outcast? What does it say about our society when a large percentage of my peers have so much in common with Holden Cauffield? Is this a timeless story, or one born of 20th century America?I'm going to make a mental note to revisit the world of Holden when I have children of his age. My parents probably could have benefited from doing the same.There's not much else for me to say that hasn't been said before about Catcher in the Rye.

J.D.Salinger was a mystery.His creation was a groundbreaker.I read and re-read this book several times. I still remembered this first time I was still in my teen,It came like a breath of fresh air. Never before I'd read such unique character,Holden Caulfield. Salinger's narrative style was charismatic,bewitching and truly remarkable. Now I'm in my late-twenties I still find it amazing each time I'll read it..I see things from a different level or perceptive.I'm sure in the years to come, at different stops of my life,my views may vary but I will certainly read it for a long time, this book will withstand the test.This book was about Holden,17. Salinger took readers to see and experience a few days of Holden's life through Holden's preceptive. Holden's going through a phase which was realistic and compelling. Showing the true meaning of life and psychological reality of people. What is human nature?

When describing the book, I could hear how, to someone who hasn't read it, Holden Caulfield sounds like a slacker who cannot even think straight, has no morals and no self-dicipline. But when you read it, you see that while he's low on common sense, he's got a lot of really &quot;deep&quot; thoughts. He sheds a new light on various things, such as where do ducks go in the winter, phonies @ expensive schools and &quot;flits.&quot; He's extremely opiniated and sometimes you find yourself swinging to his way of thinking. I reccomend this to everyone who could read it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I loved this book, i couldn't put it down! If you have a chance to pick up this book at your local library.

The first time I read this book, when I was about 13, I was amazed that there was someone else in the world that thought like I did. It let me know that I was not alone and I was not a weirdo. My favorite book of all time and my choice for best novel of the 20th century."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I learned that I would have to read this book in my English class this year, so I decided to read it on my own first. I wasn't sure if I would like it or not, but I love it! The book is fabulously written. J.D. Salinger did a great job of making Holden Caulfield come to life, and sound like a teenager that really existed! I would recommend this book to anyone, but especially teenagers, because it really speaks to you."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!! im not really a big reader but i was going on a trip and wanted a book to read.. by chance i stumbled upon catcher and the rye, i knew it was some sort of classic or something and figured its always good to know those books.. so i purchased it, i couldn't put it down!!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've read two books in my 22 years. One &quot;Where the red fern grows&quot; sometime in the 5th grade and (after weeks of hearing my mother lament on how I had never read the book and how the boy was just like me) &quot;catcher in the rye&quot; on the heels on my graduation. I figure most people either hate or love it. All I know is I spent this long is school and the whole time not once did I feel enlightened...until I read catcher in the rye."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I would recommend people to read this. I thought it was funny because today the kid would be packed full of Prozac and Ridillan, but at the time setting he is in, he is merely passed from school to school. Kids will like, because he swears a lot. That much is cool to me, mainly because I am fourteen. I'd reccomend this book and THE LORD OF THE FLIES especially for boys, but for everyone as well."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I hope my tagline will entice some reader to read my review, although I doubt it. I scanned through the reviews myself, and saw that almost everyone put 5 stars. I must agree. It's the best book I've ever read. &quot;What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like. That doesn't happen much, though.&quot; It happened this time. I wouldn't mind giving old Salinger a buzz."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"First of all, I'm probablt the youngest reader of this book writing a review. I'm only 13 yrs. old and students don't attack this book until they are at least a freshman in hs if not older. Personally, I think it's a brilliant book! It observes the aspects of life like the moments of Holden's happiness to the freaquent things that depress him. It's one of my favorite books and I didn't find it so hard to understand. It seems to written roughly though beautifully. I think it's a great book...you will definetly enjoy it no matter what your age."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden gives voice to the awkwardness that virtually everyone experiences while navigating through adolesence. Salinger is the man. I wish we could all leave him alone long enough for him to come out of his house and hang out with the rest of us."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"&quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; is the closest novel that I believe exists today that accurately depicts the emotions and thoughts of a typical, rebellious adolescent. Holden Caulfield immediately lures you into his grasp and never lets go until the final sentence. In response to the reader who claimed that there was no discernable plot, I would have to vehemently disagree with that. While there is no action-packed, tension-filled story, what the reader reads is the day-to-day affairs of an iconoclastic teen who does not like the ideals that have been set by society. He gets kicked out of his private school early in the book, and has to live the next few days by himself, in New York City. I do not believe that J.D. Salinger intended to write this novel for someone to be impressed with Holden, or even admire him. The language that he uses is quite profane, and it amazes me that many teachers put this kind of story on their curriculum. It does not amaze me that some schools have banned it from their walls. Still, it is an important story, one that every 16 or 17-year old could relate to, is very easy to read, and does have a message intertwined in there somewhere--you just have to think a little. Great book...highly recommended!!!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Despite writing Catcher in adulthood, Salinger exhibits a true understanding of teenage thought, psyche and angst. Though a simple story of a teenager's brief sojourn to New York, there is something about this novel that provides a compelling force to read on. There were only two aspects of the novel that I found mildly disappointing: I wanted to hear more about his brother and, I thought the ending was anti-climatic. However, it is still a timeless classic."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Anyone, boy or girl, can relate to Holden and the situations that he goes through. And I believe that we all know somebody just like him too. This is a book that you just can't put down."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I loved this book. I have several copies (no, I am not crazy) and I give them away to my friends when I think they need to read some good literature. Will someone please tell me the importance of this book in the movie Conspiracy Theory?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I absolutely love this book, I read the Catcher in the Rye for the first time at age 12, although, I did not understand some of what was going on the book, so I read it again, and again, and again, and each time that I read it I discover more and more how much of a masterpiece it really is. J.D. Salinger pushed forward the personality of his main character so well. I felt so much as if I was Holden Caulfield. To this day I think about Holden, he was such an interesting character. Salinger showed how confused a person can really be, while also being very much aware of what is going on. It is really difficult for me to describe the emotional attatchment I have to this book, and how much it affects me still. It is and will always be my favorite book of all time."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"my wife and mom have read it, i'm next.they liked it, except for all the curse wods"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I disliked this book when I read it, I was uncomfortable being in Holden's mind and it was a place I knew I never wanted to visit again, once was more than enough. I read it when I was in my teens and kept expecting the good stuff to show up, to justify or explain the popularity of the book, but it never did. I have no idea why so many think this is such a classic, I found it depressing, tedious and boring. I had zero sympathy for Holden, and while I never wished him ill, I thought his problems were all of his own making, he did not need any outside help to contribute to his angst, it was always there if its own accord. Reading the book felt like walking down a filthy street in a slum with overflowing garbage cans and the fug that goes with it and no salavation in sight and I was SO glad when it ended! However, as they say, \\"chacun a son gout\\" so I will leave the words of the miserable teen to others who have a bigger tolerance and appreciation for that sort of thing."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"God D....t, somebody finally has to have the courage to tell the truth. Old Roxanne wasted 3 hours of her life reading all about a kid that she just wanted to slap upside the head.

Salinger's 'Holden\\" expresses. Not knowing what in the f--- I was going to be doing with my life, and not quite satisfied with the realization that the world is not always a beautiful place, I had an epiphany when I read this book.What Salinger is able to express, in the characters he creates, you begin to relate to Holden. And the ultimate message of growth is here, in so many beautiful words.I missed this when I was in high school but I wish I would have read it. It helped me to have a better understanding of myself, which is quite a feat. 5 stars."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye should be a must-read when in High School. I read this book in school and I loved it! No, I was not an emo or gothic type girl.Actually I was a normal, popular and well loved girl =) I think one reason this book appeals to teen so much is that when you are a teen you tend to be a little 'lost' and scared to enter the adult world. Enter Holden Caufield.I have four sons and one is entering high school next year. I hope this book will be read while he is in school. I am not sure with all of the hoopla over this book that it will be available for 'inschool' reading however, he can always read it at home.Too all the people who see 'evil' in everything they see or touch this is not the book for you! I am a Christian woman and I still think teens can get something out of this book. Like it or not alot of teens need to know they are not alone in their sometime' whacky mind' LOL.If people are reading this book to get something out of it, you are in the wrong dept. go to self-help section. Take this book for what it is, a pure literary success. Nothing more, nothing less."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Sunk into the deepest hole of society and rejection, the main character Holden tells his story of a teenage who is tired of the \`phony' people around him. Holden Caulfield is a character of rebellion yet full of vulnerabilities that he can not over come. Once again getting kicked out of school, Holden wonders the streets of New York to evade facing his disappointed parents. As Holden journeys in the city of New York, he faces a decision of whether to accept adulthood or forever live childhood. In New York, Holden experiences sex, liquor, and other decisions teenagers face today. J.D. Salinger gave Holden the intelligence to see human flaws yet stripped from him the ability to see the positive side of human nature. As Holden introduces to the \\"madman stuff\\" that happened to him in chapter 1, the readers are directed into a path of his troubled and sensitive mind as he travels in New York. Though Holden pretends to be perfectly independent and self-sufficient, he is not. Holden's imaginary control over his emotions and acts of self-alienation pushed him even closer to self-rejection. The Catcher in the Rye is a book that will teach its readers to enjoy the simplicity of life and not see everything to the extreme. Because one will not only feel sundry emotions such as joy, sadness, astonishment, and intimidation but also be taken on a journey that exposes the ugliness of human nature yet the beautiful side of family and love."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger was the first book I truly enjoyed reading when I was in high school. One of my former classmates raved about this book and when it was my class' turn to read this book I couldn't wait to lose myself in this little piece of literature. The main character Holden Caulfield has a foul mouth, he's depressed, he's sacastic and he is the most realistic character I have ever read. He is like so many teens today, his personality is timeless and modern. Don't wait another minute, read this classic treasure today."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this novel for the first time in eleventh grade, and unlike many of my other reading assignments I did not reach for Cliff's Notes or any other such materials. This novel portrayed adolscence in a way no other author in recent memory had, which believe me, is no easy feat.Holden Caufield, while sardonic and even downright annoying, serves as an ideal passage into the mind of a precocious teen. Off-put by the hypocritical and materialstic world around him he seeks his independence and liberty, though ultimately it's the journey, not the destination, which makes this novel so memorable.Recommended for everyone, though obviously teens will find it's plot most appealing."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I could not wait to read this book.It was good, and I did relate to Holden in many aspects, but I felt let down. Perhaps it is because I am a little older, and due to the hype I expected the earth to move.I would not discourage anyone from reading it, but I do wish I would have gotten more out of it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"If there is one book that could change the way you think about those kids, teenagers and what becomes of them in adulthood it is 'Catcher in the Rye'. The book is a must read for all ages especially any teenager confused about the workings of the world around them.Salinger tells the tale in unique words of Holden who learns about the world as he comes to NY from his boarding school after he has failed again from yet another educational institution. He has promised to 'apply himself' so many times that you know he has really tried. He smokes and has height and hair of a person older than him. He talks to strangers at the bar, gets a hooker to his room in NY hotel and gets beaten up for being the wise-crack he is.He can stand up again though. He visits his kid sister without really being home. He doesnot want his parents to worry about him and his grades. He remembers his dead brother and also confides in his sweet kid sister that he will be going away for ever. The kid however with her unconditional love for her brother makes Holden have a change of heart.Catching innocent children from falling into the 'phoney' world is what he wants to do. He doesn't still know whether he will 'apply himself' next academic year.Greatest soul transforming book ever to come out."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"the reason i love this book so much is because it reminds me so much of my best friend, john. its really hard to describe, but all i know is that holden is JUST like john. it's weird. i find a lot of holden in myself, as well. i am in love with this story so much, i really think its one of the best ive read"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"it was a good book. when i read it for english class, i wanted to read it ahead of everyone because the chapters (in my opinion) would always leave you hanging urging you to want to find out more..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I think everyone can learn something from this.

JD Salinger presents the cynical aspect of human nature, as well as society's alienating tendencies and individuals' reactions to these tendencies (compliance, &quot;phonieness&quot;, etc). This book is also very entertaining. I definitely recomend this classic to everyone!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Kudos to the 16-year old reviewer in San Fransisco! I, too, read CATCHER IN THE RYE as a 16-years old in an honors English class in high school. To be perfectly honest, the reason I read it at first was because my teacher said it was still banned in many parts of the country, so I wanted to see what I was missing (the best thing you can do for book sales is to ban it!). The book ended up affecting me more than I imagined! Hypocrites are everywhere, and anyone who doesn't want to believe it can live in a cave. I am now a 28-year old grad student halfway to my MA in English and have read this book literally 100s of times and can quote some of it ver batim!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"After reading The Catcher in the Rye for English class, I found out what I already knew: every book has more symbolism than you can imagine. J.D. Salinger didn't disappoint me in Catcher. While reading it was a great pleasure, finding out the little details made the book that much more fun. While the book could be considered depressing, it seems to be an accurate view of teenage life. I would reccomend this book to anyone who is, was, or ever will be a teenager. Well, maybe not anyone who will be a teenager, but that's a different book altogether."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The reason why this is such an excellent book is that it reaches in and touches the heart of any reader who has not yet made himself too cold and jaded to still feel. The plight of Holden is the beautiful and painful struggle of a sensitive youth, confronted by, and not wanting to face, the harshness of the adult world. Although he does not yet realize it, Holden is strong enough to someday grow into a man who can find a path of beauty and meaning in life. His journey through the initiations of adulthood prove a painful testament to the trials through which innocence must endure. (Not that anyone is entirely innocent, but a connection to goodness and beauty is sought after and found by some, renounced by others.)"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book was a sensation when I first read it in 1956 as a teenaged prep school boy. I loved it then. Today I can't understand what all the noise was about. Salinger was known for his alienated presence. Today this is a common trope in literature and films. The prototype of all teen angst books, it seems incredible to me that anyone can read it anymore without laughing out loud. He gets points for being early (though he was predated by decades by Stephen Dedalus, the anti-hero of James Joyce's Ulysses). All in all this book is best left a memory.EKW"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I found Salinger's book,&quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, to be very stimulating as far as understanding the mind of a sixteen year old boy in a depressing stage of life. Being only three years older than Holden, I can still relate with some of his feelings and emotions. I enjoyed Salinger's writing style and his survey of the thoughts we sometimes all have. It was a good book overall!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am a devout reader and usually quite picky with my selections, but I was amazed with this book. I had heard of it for a while, yet like Salinger wanted, the title never really drew my attention. After being required to read it for school this year, I am currently reading it for the second time, and plan to several more. The first page alone grabs the reader making it impossible to put down. Salinger's unique style allows you to feel as if he is speaking to you directly throughout the novel. I could definitly relate and identify with the book as well. Being a seventeen year old girl, I face bouts with depression and so on,too. I would definitely reccommend this to anyone, especially young adults.Don't think of it as just another stupid book you have to read for school.Even the slackers who hate reading love this one! To enhance the reading experience, listen to Radiohead OK Computer at the same time!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I first read this book about 5 years ago when I was in my 40s and found it to be very interesting. Just as the movie, &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; was one of the first movies to take adolescents and their viewpoints seriously, so was &quot;Catcher&quot; one of the first books to do so. Regarding the language, it's natural and fits the situation. The 3 (only) times that the &quot;F&quot; word is used (but who's counting), Holden is objecting to its use and trying to protect his sister from the word. People who want and wanted to ban this book either hadn't read it or didn't understand it. Books should be read and not banned, anyway. Most of us have felt out of place and disillusioned at one time or another. Salinger wrote about that type of experience from a young person's point of view instead of following the custom of the time and pretending that everything in life is wonderful. Life is varied, and it's sicker to ignore that fact than to address it"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Still the ultimate piece of writing on angst, Jerome DavidSalinger's Catcher In The Rye does not cease to amaze - nearlyfifty years (!) after its publication. It is still the yardstick for any book dealing with the falsehood of Western civilisation, the passage from teen spirit to an adulthood for which there are no ideals or idols left.It surely is no coincidence that it still serves as a device for superlatives, when being used as reference point for novels such as Douglas Coupland's Generation X (in Cosmopolitan), Bret Easton Ellis' Less Than Zero (in The Observer), Alexander Stuart's The War Zone (in London's Time-Out), Jay McInerney's Bright Lights, Big City (in Playboy), Scott Bradfield's History Of Luminous Motion, Trey Ellis' Home Repairs, Iain Banks' Wasp Factory etc etc.Fortunately, Salinger coped better with the fame and fuss than Kurt Cobain. Unfortunately it sickened him into not publishing much at all for decades."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had the good fortune to stumble upon &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; during my Junior year of high school. I have read it five times since then and I find new levels of meaning each time. Holden Caufield could be a teenager today, or then.

I was walking around school the other day and I saw this boy (actually he was my ex boyfriend) walking around with this hunting cap on..amazingly similar to the one Holden describes. I saw him in this hat and couldn't get the mental image of Holden out of my head. I was imagining this boy as Holden, and suddenly I felt so sorry for him. Putting all our differences aside I had the urge to just go up to him, give him a hug, and tell him I understood him. Well...ok I am a wierdo...but I guess you could say that Holden changed my life.

I read &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; for the first time when I was nine, and &quot;The Catcher In the Rye&quot; also for the first time when I turned 10. Since then, I've read &quot;Catcher&quot; completely through (vulgar page by vulgar page) four times. Although the use of the English language leaves something to be desired (Holden's repetitive use of &quot;Really&quot; and &quot;Goddam it&quot; can be of the utmost annoyance) and the 'plot' is quite predictable, I keep reading it. I've heard that it is a highly controversial book in high schools. Whoever thinks the book should be banned because of its 'naughtiness' is a fool. Look at society today. We're teaching sex ed. as early as the fourth grade. Don't tell me that kids are going to learn anything new by reading this book.

I read it in high school and I think I really identified with Holden also being a teen like him - even though there's the story takes place in a different era. It's apparently one controversial book, and I can understand why when it was written, but now it should be required reading. The feelings Holden goes through are like the teen angst songs of Green Day and Nirvana except it only gives you the lyrics and lets you create the music for the emotion in your head.An excellent read. I highly recommend it but it really does seem to be a love it or hate it novel so if your not sure perhaps buy a used copy."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book in 4 or 5 hours I think, and I can honestly say this is a great book. I always remember there being so much fuss about this book (although I am only 22), so I wanted to read it for myself and see how it was. To tell you the truth, I didn't think the language was very bad, and the sexual content was minimal. I have read books and seen movies that were much worse than this book. This story is all about a young teenage boy that does not know what to do with his life. It was a great book, because I was able to relate in so many ways. I was able to relate to Holden because I was once troubled.I was unable to put this book down when I started reading it. The way the author writes is unique to me, although I have not read many books so that may not say much. I was able to paint very vivid pictures in my mind such as in the dorm room, in the hotels, at the bar talking to the 3 women... I was definately expecting this to be more vulgar, only because that is how it was portrayed to me. I guess the book could have possibly influenced people to act out in violence, however I find it hard to believe.I thought it was interesting how Holden thought so many things were phony. That is something that I will always remember with this book. That and the word \\"goddam\\". Not even sure it is spelled like that any more... Seems like Salinger used that word preceding everything."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye / 0-316-76948-7There's not much to be said about Salinger's classic that hasn't already been said. The intense pain and longing of adolescence is tangible here - along with the impossible, conflicting desires that rage through these troubled years.Like any other boy his age, Holden longs for immediately available sex, but he cannot reconcile this longing with his emotional need for love and intimacy. Like so many of his peers, Holden yearns for adulthood and maturity and independence yet feels the pangs of sadness that come with the loss of innocence. He knows, instinctively, that his own innocence is already lost, but wishes somehow to slow the loss of innocence for those he loves: those people in his life whom he deems to be not phony.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book was reveals some very interesting, sometimes revolting, and in-depth character development. The book starts off explaining Holden Callufields' life and why he's in his current predicament. The rest of the book explains the next 3-4 days and what goes on between them. A whole range of emotions is presented in these days and reveals the confusion of his immature teen self. He goes through prostitues, tons of ciggaretes, and has a depressing adventure through New York.One reason I like this book is because the way things are always happening. Holden is a character that supports this aspect of the book and is almost always on the move. I also liked how Holden is not perfect like in many books. This book shows you the darkside of life and the dangers of pyschological depression. It really makes you feel bad for Holden and wish the others in the book can help him in the right way, when there isn't a good way to help him in entirety.Holden really does feel real when I find myself thinking about him. He makes realistic decisions and you find yourself hoping for him to do something and he does it. When he doesn't do something you want him to do it just makes you even more exicted to see what he will do next."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Having been forced to read this horrid novel for English, I can say that it is possibly the most boring book. Looking back, I can't recall anything of importance happening. Angst angst angst. Did I read the same book as the 5 stars?Innovative and enlightening? I think not. It's one dull page after another as Holden explores the woes of life. No teenager is this seriously depressed. Everything makes him feel lonely and sad. He swears every other word. Everyone is a phony. I had no patience for his lameness. I only got through it to pass the section on it.They say he grieves for Allie. You hear more about random classmates of his than of his brother. No character can hold your attention in this book.

It may seem to have subjects that kids shouldn't be exposed to but let's not kid ourselves. Children these days just seem smarter and capable of more and more each day. If they are exposed to such adult topics as adult social interaction, violence, alcohol and broken homes in the world of superbly crafted literature it would do nothing but broaden their understanding of reality and the world around them a hundred times over. They are going to seek out or happen across these topics as the world is getting smaller and smaller so why not allow it under favorable conditions?

I felt I couldn't relate to him. After the first 15 chapters that changed. I realized that, boy oh boy, I am way too much like Holden Caulfield. So much that I almost want to post a list of how we are alike, but that is not the point of reviews and I doubt it would be interesting reading. There are few eye-opening moments in Catcher in the Rye. The line that most sticks in my head is this, \\" The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause, while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one.\\" I will be honest, lines don't really stick in my head and this one doesn't either, but its meaning does.I can understand why this book is a classic. There is so much that I don't think I fully grasp everything yet; it is one of those books I think should be reread every so often. I wouldn't have read this book if not for Nerdfighters' Blurbing Book Club, so I thank author John Green for picking it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've read Catcher several times and though it doesn't stand out in my mind as a favorite novel, every time I read it I rediscover how much I enjoy it. I give Catcher five stars because Holden's character holds my interest until the very end. Salinger gives him a complexity that makes him neither saint nor sinner. The reader isn't necessarily going to like Holden, but he isn't someone you'd want to hate either. I think anyone who enjoys people-watching will find Catcher offers plenty to keep the reader entertained with its parade of characters and never dull rantings of Holden at his darkest time."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've always adored this book- some complain that nothing really happens in the prose but the truth is this book is loaded with the type of symbolism that almost anyone can relate to. I read in high school (forced to in fact) and thought of it as fair but then when I came back to it as an adult, I found a lot more love. I think it works best when it is read as an adult looking back on life (rather than while it is happening to a person- which is why so many school kids don't like it). If you, like me, love this book and want to read something that manages to capture a bit of the magic here try Jason Rider's A Space Between.This is true literature!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book has become my yearly end-of-school ritual. I have read it for four straight years, and it just keeps getting better each time. While I understand that many people find Holden Caulfield to be a pain in the [...], the thing is, he is really just a kid, and he's just growing up. Try to go spend time with a teenager for a day (yes, I am one of them, but that doesn't matter) and you'll realize just how accurate Caulfield is. Teenagers are annoying! But once you realize that Caulfield is just growing up, you understand what this book does.This has been pretty inarticulate, but essentially, this Book is absolutely amazing and should be read by all, although the forced study of it has turned many off...it should simply be picked up some day and gone through, as happened to me, and then you'll understand just how fabulous it is."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am 12 years old and i started to read this book and found it not to be very good. It has about ten curse words on every page and i don't think it should. It also has a bunch of other stuff that younger kids should not read. Over all i found this a bad book and pretty boring too."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have no idea why this book is considered to be a so called \\"Classic Of Modern Literature\\". I have read it twice over a 25 year period and I still fail to be impressed by it. It concerns an 16 year old teenager named Holden Caulfield who flunks out of School and rather than facing the wrath of his parents he decides to rent a Hotel room in New York for 5 days. A great portion of the book is Caulfield describing his Rampant Teenage Hormonal Desires and yet when he finally gets a consenting adult female in his room he declines to sleep with her!!! This is very strange considering his obsession with older women which he describes on his train journey on the way to New York where he meets a mother of one of his classmates and is sexually attracted to her. The rest of the book sees Caulfield trying to get drunk and whining about how everybody else in this world is a \\"phoney \\" except of course himself. He also displays a fascination with homosexuality and one begins to wonder if he is in reality suppressing his true Sexuality .Read this book if you want to see how a 16 year old teenager has yet to discover that he can run but he can't hide from himself no matter how hard he tries."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had to read this for school and I don't see why this is still such a beloved book. I can understand why it might have been popular when it first came out in an era where people strived for a \\"wholesome\\" atmosphere but now this book is just 200+ pages of garbage! There are several things wrong with this book.First of all, there is the repeated swearing. I'm not usually bothered by this. Stephen King uses quite a bit of cursing, for example, but his stories are still interesting. This book, however, swears so much that the book would probably be twice as short if you took them all out. Every other word seems to be \\"g-dd--n or a variation of it.There is also the repitition of the phrases \\"____kill(s) me\\" and \\"phony\\". Now, this wouldn't seem so bad at first. But believe me, you have NO IDEA how incredibly annoying that gets after a while. I actually started to cringe whenever those phrases were coming up, and I'm not exaggerating. Take out those two phrases plus the swearing, and this book is reduced to about 1/4 of it's actual size - maybe less.Next there is the movement of story. The Catcher in the Rye does not go anywhere! There are a few mildly interesting, new occurences here and there but the majority of the story is about the main character,Holden, getting kicked out of his 4th school and going away to New York before having to face his parents with another rejection. During his stay in New York and once he goes home, he does basically the same, average things every day and this book - from beginning to end - is just one huge pessimistic opinion about everyday life. The story ends much the same way it began with no elevation or climactic events anywhere in between. In other words, boring. I had to force myself to finish it.Finally, there is the never-ending and annoying whines of Holden himself. Halfway through this book I was pissed off and annoyed with Holden. All he does is whine and complain about every little thing around him. Not only is it incessive whining, it's rambling. He cannot simply state his dislike and reason for that dislike for something. He goes on and on about what he dislikes, why, the events that trigger it, what it reminds him of, and a million other things not even related to his topic. That is all this book really is - a load of complaints at absolutely everything including the harmless, meaningless things/people around him. This book does not so much give me an insight to a troubled teen's life so much as it makes me want to scream at him.There was one thing I did really like about this book. Salinger writes very well in first-person dialect. I felt as if Holden was actually talking to me in a casual conversation. It also allows the reader to figure out for themselves, why Holden acts the way he does through what he tells you and his actions. However, this conversational attitude towards it is vastly overshadowed by the swearing, lack of movement, and overall annoying-ness of Holden. Even if it is conversational, it doesn't matter much because the person having the \\"conversation\\" with you is someone you wouldn't WANT to talk to in the first place! The purpose of this book would've been much better if it had just been a short characterization story or maybe a psychological analysis, rather than trying to pass it off as a novel that will thoroughly hold interest. The Cather in the Rye created a disillusionment of society for people in the 1950's, thus the wide-spread interest. That disillusioned fascination has died down since then, and this book should too."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I never heard of this book before our daughter said she had to read it for high school English. As soon as the teacher started reading it in class our daughter said it was dumb, she wanted out of English class ,I want to quit school, and why do I have to listen to my teacher read all this foul language including the F word repeatedly. We said you don't and pulled her from the class. Christian or not if you have any moral compass at all Catcher in the Rye is a book to avoid. The book inspired the murderer of John Lennon. It talks about and seems to condone all sorts of sin,including prostitution. drunkeness, lying,blasphemy, and fornication.It is a very depressing book and is filled with foul language on every page. It doesn't edify or build up the reader to become a better citizen or self governing individual.It makes every attempt to drag you down to its level, the gutter. The Bible says whatsoever things are honest, true, just , pure, lovely, and of good report, if there be any virtue, think on these things . You can't think on these things reading \\"goddamn \\"245 times in a 200+ page book. Beware Parents. Don't fall for the line that its on the schools approved reading list or that it is a literary 'classic'. This book is filth ,pure and simple.

I read it for fun. Let me take that back. I didn't read it for school. But now I see why it's assigned so much in school. It helps keep kids busy until they turn 18. Sure I read only half the book; I was too bored to finish it. And I'm sure you don't esteem my opinion. But I sure do find it grand that such a crumby book is so well-respected. Did I relate to it?

Well I'll try..Been working in the various college bookstores since 1968, I had a chance to read a few pages from this book. Its literary quality is not that great, the emotional harmony with the increasingly more infantile american public signals the takeover of teeagers of the public life. We all saw the results. This is the basic affect of liberalism, with no positive vision of a possible action. However, even after 9/11/01, my son is compelled by the New York State to read this second rate fiction, alongside with &quot; The Chocolate War&quot;, &quot;Lisa Bright and Dark&quot; and other &quot;pulp-fictiony&quot; type of &quot;STUFF&quot;.How about some Faulkner, Hemingway, Dreiser, Dos Passos, Vidal, even Zane."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is the worst book i have read in a long time.

I felt like I was reading a book for a 9 year old, it's written very simplisticly, almost as if the author thought the reader would be too stupid to understand big words.I am dissapointed. I have heard about this book my entire life and when I finally read it I was surely let down. I don't get why this book is banned from some schools except for the fact that if students read it in school they'd be so bored they probably would never want to read anything ever again.I only gave it one star because there was nothing lower."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The book was in poor condition.

A story about a spoiled preppy can only appeal to preppies and wannabe-preppies.People overlook Bukowski because they refuse to acknowledge their working-class similarities to the Bukster. Rather, they pretend that they too are preppy types.Caulfield's problems are self-inflicted. He's a whiny moron who deserves nothing but contempt. Readers of Salinger are gullible nuts who are just padding Salinger's bank account.If you want a real look at reality and adolescence then read more Bukowski!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"usually, i can see redeeming qualities in book's i dislike...but in this case, i can't understand why anyone would like such a pointless book. did i miss the point? probably...because it must have been mentioned while i was too busy screaming at how idiotic and frustrating the narrator is."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had to read this book for high school a couple of years ago and painfully read every page. I just didn't get what all the big hype on this book was about. Personally I hate depressing novels and music. So this one really turned me off. From the first page I was bored. I really don't know why Holden (the main character) didn't go see a Psychologist (but yet, he manages to see a prostitute instead. Go figure), cause he certainly needed to! Page after page I had to read about his troubles and horrible life. Swear word after swear word. I wonder after reading this how many times one can use the word &quot;Lord&quot;! I really feel sorry if you have to buy this book for required reading. And I just don't get why this is considered a &quot;Classic&quot;...personally if there is a book that portrays *correctly* the life of teenagers then I would definatly reccomend &quot;A Seperate Piece&quot; over this jumble of words any day. &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; is like listening to a therapy session and should be left on the shelf."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"If you want to read the book that's fine, and if you really enjoyed the book that's great, and if you want to write about how much you enjoyed reading the book that's probably fine, too. But please don't analyze it. For my sake, of course, but also for Salinger's, and all those people out there who saw some beauty in the novel and not just some transitory self-justification. Everyone who likes Catcher in the Rye likes it because they can relate Holden, albeit tenuously in many or most cases, but just because you felt some vague simpatico connection to the main character does not mean you understand the book. Just take it as a given that the author was much smarter than you will ever be and deal with it. To quote Pete Townshend, sort of, and without any suggestion of proper context, you \\"can't explain\\". Or at least you can't do it very well. So don't try. Please."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm sorry but I hate this book. It was horrible! I'm not a person that likes constant swearing so I guess that's one reason why I didn't like it very much. There was no climax to the book whatsoever, and barely a plot. I understand all the symbolism and I admit that it is great in this book, but I hate the book anway."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"My English teacher recommended this book to me becasue she knows I love classics. However, when I picked up the book and read the first sentence, I was disappointed. The book tells of three days in the life of Holden Caulfield, a sixteen year old former prep-school student. All I got from this book was a look into the world of a typical teenage boy with a big annoyance with the world. I thought this book was disgusting and horribly written. In fact, I only made to page twelve before throwing it in the trash. If you want to save money, DO NOT buy this book. It certainly does not live up to all the hype."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"For years I have wanted to read this book. I never had the chance to get around to it until recently. Now that I've read it, all I can say is the hype is extremely overrated. This book is about nothing and goes nowhere. It is about a boy who, without any particular reason, hates everything about everyone. Nothing significant ever happens and the main character just wanders around his home town late at night complaining about how everybody is phony. Okay, fine. Everybody is phony. Do something about it. After I finished reading this dribble, I literally sat and stared at the last page for a moment wondering how to get back all the time I'd wasted. This book is linked to conspiracy theories, presidential assassins; controversy is all over this book. Why? Maybe it's because people were so angry that they wasted time reading it, that they became violent. I'm sure that in the 1950s and 60s this was considered edgy because it talked poorly about society. But today the subject matter simply doesn't hold up. Stay clear of this one."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"...

During the course of the novel he copes with the necessity of maturity much like waves on the beach, rushing forward toward it and then running away from it, repeating the cycle over and over again. Portions of the novel strike me as a bit uneven, but not so much so that one would consider it uneven in a broad sense. The characters are well drawn, and the episodic story reasonably entertaining. It is most likely to appeal to teenagers, young adults, and mature adults capable of laughing at their own past teenage hysteria. Well done for what it is, and you'll probably enjoy it, but hardly in the same class with the great novels of 20th century American literature."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I was made to read this book for my English literature class. I hated it after the first few pages. This Holden seem to be on 'the road to nowhere'. He wants to tell us something and then doesn't. This person is lost! The book is extemely subjective and broken like glass. He decides to do something, but does not really think of its consequences...no wonder he gets expelled!I read this book as a teenager (16) and I still remember being made to stand up in front of my class to explain why I thought this book was/is CRAP! I thought that nothing this guy is thinking or doing is similar to my thoughts and that of my friends at the time. The book itself is written like it just wanders from one thing to another throughout these three days. There is a lack of thought to what he does. Especially the near miss with the prostitute. If he had stayed any longer in New York...God knows. I don't understand what being a 'catcher in the rye' can achieve someone in life. This led me to conclude that he is a total dreamer. However, his dreams are as careless as he is in life and this is reflected heavily in the book. What I have learnt over the years is that the guy who shot John Lennon had this book on him at the time of the killing."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"6) Book ReviewThe Catcher in the Rye is an American text in 26 chapters by J.D. Salinger. It was published for the first time in 1951. The main character, Holden Caulfield, sixteen years narrates his own story from the time when he has dismissed from his third private school to return Ill and in a state physical and mental shock, to the shelter of his home in New York three days later. Before this novel, J.D. Salinger was of basic non-literary status. The Catcher in the Rye was his first step onto the literary playing field. This initial status left Salinger, as a serious writer, almost unique as a sort of free agent, not bound to one or more schools of critics, like many of his contemporaries were. This ability to write freely, his status as nobody in the literary world, was Salinger's greatest asset. Holden's story is in first- person narrative, and is told in Holden own language with unconscious humour. It is just before Christmas and Holden Caulfield, has been kicked out of the exclusive Pencey Prep, a school in Pennsylvania. Life at Pencey was dreary, artificial, and of course, expensive. It was the latest schools were Holden got the ax. Understandably he's in no hurry to found his parents. So He takes his stuff and what money he has and went to a hotel in New York City. There he passed few days living new experiences. He is involved with a variety of persons including taxi drivers, two nuns, three girls from Seattle, a prostitute, and a former teacher. And the sad ending in which Holden ends up in a mental ward is depressing. 'The Catcher in The Rye' gives us a chance to catch quick, half-amused, half-frightened glimpses of ourselves and our contemporaries, as Salinger confronts us with his brilliant mirror images. What makes the book so good is that it is realistic and believable. It could happen to anyone. In fact, it happens to hundreds of teenagers every year. Besides, out of all the characters in popular literature, Holden is probably one of the most &quot;real&quot; to his readers. All this is not to say that only teenagers will like the book. They are more likely to like it, but anyone could like it. It is a realistic description of the world. Many of the things said in the book about human nature are so dead-on accurate that is it damn near scary."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"To be totally honest with you I thought the book is seriously over-rated.

He has run away from boarding school before Christmas, and is spending a few days drifting in New York City while he decides whether to go home or not. He feels that his childhood is over and his innocence lost, but he detests the phoney, loveless grown-up world (symbolised by plastic Christmas baubles and seasonal fake goodwill). He thinks that to be adult is a form of surrender, but he can see no way to avoid it. He wanders the city, talking aimlessly to taxi drivers, lodging house keepers, bar tenders, prostitutes and his sister Phoebe, whom he tries to warn against growing up. Finally, inevitably, he capitulates-or perhaps escapes, since we learn that we have just read his &quot;confession&quot; to the psychiatrist in a mental home.

When I first read this book in high school I was surprised to see that someone understood me and what I was feeling and then incredulous that everyone else around me had the same kinds of feelings.

However, I do not think that this is fair at all. The boy's cynicism is not blind, and there is much related through it all. There certainly is 'method in his madness'.

Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around - nobody big, I mean - except me. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff - I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I'd do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all.\\"An angsty teenager gets kicked out of (yet another) prep school and spends a few days in New York City. It doesn't sound very interesting, does it? This is why I never read it as a teen myself - reluctantly getting around to it in my mid-20's just to find out why it's considered such a \\"classic.\\" Now I must say, \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" is truly brilliant.The novel chronicles the misadventures of Holden Caulfield, a maladjusted teenager wandering around New York City. Holden picks a fight with his roommate, tells tall tales to strangers he meets, and has awkward encounters with an ex-schoolmate's mother, tourists, a prostitute and her pimp, an ex-girlfriend, a former teacher, and his little sister - all the while narrating about his sexual frustrations, expressing concern for what he sees as the loss of innocence in children, lamenting the death of his brother, and (most infamously) airing his disdain for \\"phony\\" people.Unfortunately, I think many of the people who love this book largely miss the point. Holden Caulfield is no hero. He's irresponsible, childish, and hypocritical. (For someone who hates phonies, he seems to love misrepresenting himself to the various people he meets. He also entertains some pretty misogynistic thoughts, after starting a fight over the honor of a girl he cares for.) He's sarcastic, bitter, and cynical beyond his years, and I'll be damned if the kid doesn't whine!But I feel the severe critics of the book are far more off base. Sure, Holden's no hero, but he's nobody to hate, either. His angst and frustration stem from his truly being a sensitive, altogether good person, and his concern for children is pure (albeit misguided). Let's not forget he's also a teenager, with all the confusion, angst, alienation, and sexual frustration that comes with the territory. Holden Caulfield is certainly a flawed character, but one I think most people can sympathize with and relate to as an extreme, characterized version of their adolescent selves.My favorite part of the novel has to be when he pays a visit to an admired former English teacher of his, Mr. Antolini. Mr. Antolini (having had a few cocktails) tells the young Caulfield \\"I have a feeling that you're riding for some kind of a terrible, terrible fall\\" - a statement that contrasts sharply with Holden's \\"catcher\\" fantasy. Mr. Antolini quotes the psychologist Wilhelm Stekel:\\"The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause, while the mark of a mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one.\\"And what does Holden do with these words of wisdom? He abruptly leaves (having mistaken the intent of Mr. Antolini's affections).While reading \\"The Catcher in the Rye,\\" I often found myself wishing I could talk to Holden Caulfield. At times I wanted to give him a Linus-style \\"you're a good man, Charlie Brown\\" kind of pep talk. Other times, I wanted to pat him on the back and assure him that things would get better. And yes, there were times that I just wanted to reach through the pages and strangle him for a while. Such is the beauty of Salinger's masterpiece. For better or worse, you are always emotionally engaged.I've only read \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" once, and that was a couple years ago. I was so completely absorbed by the story, I felt that I had absorbed it myself. Up until now, I've never felt the need to reread the book, but after writing this review, I think I might pick it up again. As Holden says, \\"Don't ever tell anybody anything. If you do, you start missing everybody.\\""},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The coming of age novel, The Catcher in the Rye is my favorite book of all time. Sixteen-year- old junior Holden Caulfield is rebellious in that he wants to defy the hypocrisy of the grown world. He is restless, has failed out of four schools and holds a scar of his brother's death. He alienates himself from the world and is extremely judgmental of everybody that it is almost funny. It's really just his blindness of not wanting to understand the world. He wants to be the person in life who protects innocence, hence \\"the catcher in the rye.\\"Holden's relationship with his sister is so charming and kind, that it is easy to overlook his faults. It shows that despite being an unreliable narrator, who has a compulsion to lie and be judgmental, he has a genuine love for his sister and her wellbeing. He wants to protect her from the ugliness in the world.In a way, his love for her is what sets him in the right direction because, although Phoebe is six years younger she knows growing up is necessary. And through her eyes we see how broken Holden really is, but it's that brokenness that's so endearing because his sincere protective nature and his want of things to remain unchanging are beautiful.We get to see who Holden really is and what he's afraid of. He can't prevent children from falling out of innocence. That transition from childhood to adulthood. A lot of people are uncomfortable with their own weaknesses, and in that we are a lot like Holden Caulfield"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Well, I must say this is probably one of the best novels I've ever read. I hope I'm not speaking too soon, especially since I have Mrs. Dalloway, Zorba the Greek and Swann's Way in my too-read pile.So why is this book so great? Let's start with sheer writing technique. It's superior. Why? Salinger describes characters without EVER stopping the story. He tends to describe people in traits and ticks, versus describing the person from head to toe with general and forgettable traits you're likely to forget 200 pages later.Chapters worked on so many levels. Each chapter was thematically rich, and you never knew what that crazy Holden was going to do next. While some might complain about the long paragraphs, they were generally always vivid in imagery.Salinger is a master of \\"show don't tell.\\" Sure, he may have said \\"It made me feel depressed\\" (which, admittedly, doesn't say much,) but then he follows it up with a passage like this:\\"I went to this very cheap restaurant and had doughnuts and coffee. Only, I didn't eat the doughnuts. I couldn't swallow them too well. The thing is, if you get very depressed about something, it's hard as hell to swallow.\\"Not only do you get a swift and clear image, but you also identify with what it feels like to be so depressed that you simply lose your appetite. The entire novel is written on this level.And the book had something to say about the choices you make in life and what it means to face your problems or run away from them.The Catcher in the Rye is a quiet book. No buildings blowing up and no high-speed car chases. But it is a lyrical novel about the human condition that will stay with you for years to come."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield is one of those uniquely legitimate characters in literature that is so like myself it is almost scary. Was Salinger a perpetual teenager, or was he just remarkably insightful? I do not know the answers to these questions and I never will, but this fact does not bother me. I can find all I need to know about Salinger in his hauntingly autobiographical novel The Catcher in the Rye. His colloquial speech is incredibly relaxing to read. Who said literature always had to be so stiff? He, like James Dean, is often considered to epitomize the true \\"rebel without a cause.\\" However, with a closer look, it is possible to understand why this young man is as angry as he is.Holden is like most other teenagers in that he cannot make up his mind. Probably the most dualistic character in all of American literature, he has widely varied opinions on the same subject- this would seem impossible, but Holden (or should I say Salinger?) accomplishes it both realistically and intriguingly. What is most fascinating about Holden is his obsession with innocence, and the protection of childhood. He provokes a fight with his roommate at Pencey because the boy goes on a date with a girl from Holden's childhood- symbolically protecting her innocence. He has a preoccupation with the ducks in Central Park. He continuously asks people if they know where the ducks go during the winter, representing his fixation for all things simple.The introduction of his younger sister Phoebe brings one of literature's most brilliant characters to light. Salinger managed to create someone who is very clever for her age but is so young that it is not impossible to smile at some of the things she says. It is highly understandable as to why Holden loves his sister so much. In fact, this relationship is what endeared Holden to me. His sensitivity towards his younger sister (when most older brothers antagonize their younger siblings) erases many opinions of him as cynical and rebellious. This is not to say that he is not rebellious-he is- but he is so much more than that.At the crux of the story lies a deeply confused teenager, one who has lost his younger brother and is enduring a midlife crisis at much too young an age. His mind constantly pulls his thoughts in different directions, and it is no wonder that Holden seems stretched too thin. His symbolic desire to be \\"the catcher in the rye\\", or the person who helps children retain their innocence, draws the reader to the conclusion that Holden is not merely a teenage rebel. He's truly lost in a world that he views as cruel and without the innocence he wishes it had. This book is the story of the loss of innocence of a kid who only ever wanted to keep it, and that is something all generations can identify with."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye was a terrific novel; I really enjoyed the author's realistic views on being a child and some of their everyday hardships. J.D. Salinger also does a terrific job on creating characters like the main character Holden Caulfield. Holden is a very troubled young man who has lots of issues like staying in school. The story tells from his perspective a few days in his life where he roams the streets of New York City.J.D. Salinger does a really great job at conveying and describing Holden as a person. I really like how she crafts Holden into a wreck of a human. She gives him a very negative, almost angry approach at everything he does. He is constantly unsure of what to do, always changing ideas with each change of heart he has. I also enjoy all the other characters and how I was able to compare them to so many people I knew. Whereas other authors struggle with making normal truly human characters, J.D. excels at such a task.I also enjoyed the novels deep and interesting plot. Although the story seems to be about Holden's experience while exploring New York City, I got the feeling the book was more about emotional struggles. Holden is a very confused young adult whom struggles with grasping what he wants to do with his life; he has no thoughts of his future. I enjoyed hearing all of his internal thoughts, how he felt about other people, school, and other activities. I got to compare and contrast my views on subjects like peoples personalities and school experience with that of Holden's.I would strongly recommend this book to anyone, for I think they will be able to relate to it on some level. I found this story also made me think and view other people in new ways. I you enjoy reading at all, I believe you should read this awesome classic novel."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Like millions of kids over a bunch of decades, I too carried a worn copy of the book in the pocket for years. I was, and still am, a true disciple of the Catcher-Cult. And, I'm sure there is nothing much to add here. It's all been said over and over again. I do, though, want to mention an experience I had with the book over time.When I first discovered the book at 16, I was completely devoted to the Holden mind-set. Everyone I saw was dripping with the fake and the phony. The world looked different to me. This almost ruined books for me. I actually expected to get that experience from every book I read. It was sad when it was not true. When I reread the book at about 25, it still rang true, but with some of my own angst long-gone, the book had lost its urgency. In a moment of personal confusion and conflict, I reread it yet again at about 30, hoping it would renew me in some way. It had the opposite effect. I couldn't help but think that Holden whined way too much. Enough already.I read it again at 42. And? I realized, perhaps more now than at 16, that Holden was more right than ever. The Catcher-Cult, once dormant inside me, had caught fire again, and a few decades later, once again changed my view of the world. Both the boy and aging man owe a debt of gratitude to Mr. Salinger.

This book has a strong moral background to it for those who are willing to think a little deeper."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"If I could write 3,000 words about this book I would!! What can I say about Holden Caufield, except for the fact that he is my personal hero! High school's tough for many kids, and reading about one's angst, and trials is such the stress reliever! Maybe it's the way Holden puts everything into a new light that one may not think of , or maybe it's the way you get so angry at him while you're feeling so incredibly sad for him. Whether you get angry, or feel bad, this dynamic teenage character is one to surely keep you laughing and feeling!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A very very very very good book. The langague and the story being told by Holden makes the book very interesting."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am a teenager, and unlike the review below, I read this for pleasure. This book has to be one of the top five of my favorite books. I think that a lot of tennagers cannot relate to Holden because they have never had the feelings of being alone and scared but also trying to grow up at the same time. I do not feel that I can persecute people for the way that they feel about certain things, but I do not think that these people have actually put much thought into their reading. This book is very good and makes you think about things that go on about you. I can understand where Holden is coming from because I feel the same way about people and authority. During a time in his life when he needed his parents most they were not there for him. When he went to New York and talked with Pheobe, he realized that he was very troubled and needed help. If you haven't ever read this book, i recommend it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book perfectly describes the angst and turmoil projected among much of my age group. Holden reminds me of an average teen kid that is found in every highschool in every city, the loser who never gets the girl, the kid who thinks for himself. He's the perfect antihero, someone with whom youths can identify with. I'd give it twenty stars if I could! Don't pass this up!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Sorry, but I found this book to be rather boring and repetitive. I did not like the character Holden, and thought he should grow up."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Go into this book without all the expectations and just read it for what it is. Instead of searching for the &quot;deep&quot; meaning, let the message come to you and say what it has to say to YOU. Catcher has proved so popular over the years because it carries meaning and realates to so many different people. Don't worry about what you're supposed to get out of Catcher, instead, find your own meaning. So start reading- like a madman."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is the most incredible book I have ever read. If Holden was a real person, I would marry him. I have never had the experience where I have more wanted to protect and love a character in a book than anyone human. The stream of conciousness style kept my attention the entire way, and over not more than 150 pages, Salinger created a character just as complex as the most complex human."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"While I found the story itself slightly dull I found the character development to be spellbinding. Being a teen myself, I have often suffered through many author's ideas of how teenagers think (which are NEVER accurate), but Holden is the exception. I can name ten people I know who could be him. If you enjoy deep, complex characters, I reccomend it. Otherwise, I don't see what all the fuss is about."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book will go down as one of the great works of the 20th century, in my mind at least. Words can't describe how much this book speaks to dissatisfied and alienated people who perhaps understand life just a little too much for our own good. There may be little in the way of a storyline, but is there really any such structure to life anyway?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Though this novel failed to blow me away, it among other things, proved able of being completely enthralling throughout the course of reading. The main character, Holden, truly teaches his readers a great deal of information about what it might be like for some teenagers, who are not quite ready, to be forced rapidly into a very different adult world. Many might read this book and simply write off Holden as a classic sociopath, I know I did at first, but one must really evaluate what goes on with Holden's choices and rituals and continual rebellions to the endeavors and situations of a much intimidating elder world. Catcher in the Rye relates somewhat well to a very intriguing book entitled The Perks of Being a Wallflower. However, the main character in Perks seemed much more open to society and acted in many more positive ways. His attitude too, preferably appeared to be significantly less depressing than Holden's attitude certainly was. Catcher in the Rye was very well laid out, very well written, extremely easy to understand, very relative to a teenagers life, and immensely intriguing. However, the underlying negative, depressing tone seemed somewhat agonizing after the first 150 or so pages and other books exist in the world, that deal with the same sociological topic, which are not so incredibly dismal and disheartening. Thus, the rating I give, on a scale of 1 to 5, is a 4."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden is a very extraordinary character he understands the preciousness of life he takes school for granted and then when he is kicked out he then has too much pride to tell his parents that he was kicked out. It is very inspirational story it's something that one can relate to I personality connected with Holden. He longs for acceptance and love. He is a very frank character and he has a lot of pride. The story line is remarkably intriguing and is exceptionally simple. The reason for this book success is the way it is told. Holden totally engages us and pulls us into his world. Salinger writes very well in first-person dialect. You feel as if Holden is talking to you personally. Salinger's writing is so brilliant; his characters seem so real, that he needs not to employ artifice of any kind. This is the work of a true genius, the vivid images are very apparent. I recommend this book to anyone over the age of 16."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A true classic, I cant remember every reading a book so captivating. Holden is a true character..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is one of my absolute favorite novels. It started off slow but once i got into it I couldnt put it down. I liked this book because it put out a good message and i could really connect with it because the language was modern enough so that i didn't need to use a dictionary to figure it out. I wouldn't recomend this book to anyone who needs to have none stop action to stay into a book, but anyone who likes reallistic fiction should read this and all of J.D. Salingers books."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A Wise ReadThe book that I enjoyed reading was CATCHER IN THE RYE, by J.D. Salinger. The story is about an adult male named Holden Cualfield. He is about to drop out of high school. The time he is traveling home because he left earlier than the school lets out for vacation. He wanders through New York City. There he meets with a girl friend that he met a while ago. Also during this book you begin to realize that Holden is very depressed in a complicated way. He isn't very suicidal, but throughout the book he constantly mentions that he is very depressed. Although many people say that, and don't really mean it, he could be doing something very fun like seeing a movie or on a date, but still isn't really happy, he thinks that there's something wrong all the time. I would recommend this book to anybody who is interested, or studying psychology. The reason why is that his depressed mind will interest and find out what his actual problem is."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I see so many reviews for this book where they mention the cynicism of Holden Caulfield, and I never read it that way. I read this book in one night cover to cover a few years ago, and have since reread it a few times and the more I read it the more hope I see in the eyes of Holden Caulfield. He is so optimistic about the way the world should act that it nearly destroys him. I think his hope is best described when he talks about his brother writing for movies. He believes his brother is too talented and should do more, that is not the view of a cynical person. Maybe the people who review it are too detached from the feelings of being a teen, they look at any character who isn't outwardly chipper as cynical, when it is merely his reaction to a belief in good betrayed. Read this book and see hope in the darkness."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I reluctantly picked up a copy of The Catcher in The Rye by J.D. Salinger recently. I'm not an avid reader and if a title doesn't catch my eye, I am usually not too enthused about the book. However, I am glad that I stuck it out and read the whole novel. I think it provides a new insight to life and really makes you think about the world around you.The book is a coming of age tale about a young man named Holden Caulfield. Holden is expelled from Pencey Prep School. He has struggles within himself and many minor conflicts with other characters. For the most of the book Holden is talking to himself and to the reader in his head.You can tell that he is different emotionally and mentally than most people his age. He has a superior outlook on human behavior but overanalyzes many things about life. Holden goes on and on about what he would have done to a guy who stole his gloves. He lays out a scene like it actually happened, but instead of pretending to beat the guy up, Holden acts like he would in real life even though it is his daydream. After Holden argues with the guy back and fourth in his mind for a while he says, \\"It could go on like that for hours. Finally, though, I'd leave his room without even taking a sock at him.\\"J.D. Salinger has a very unique style that made me connect with Holden on a very deep level. Even though Holden is kind of a burnout I still cared about him because of the way that Salinger portrayed him and showed his emotions. In one instance where he was watching his sister play, his emotions really come out. \\"I was damn near bawling, I felt so damn happy, if you want to know the truth. I don't know why. It was just that she looked so damn nice, the way she kept going around and around, in her blue coat and all. God, I wish you could've been there.\\" Throughout the whole book you really feel for Holden and his situation even though you might not have ever experienced anything that he goes through in the book.The story takes place back in the early 1940's of New York. Holden jumps around from school to school because he can't stand the phoniness of the people around him. He doesn't have much respect for adults, but he really likes kids. This is apparent through the way that Holden speaks of children, and the way he is afraid to act like an adult.I thought that the plot was slow moving, and there was not much action to the story. If you want a fast paced book that keeps you on the edge of your seat, this is not the book for you. If you want a book that can teach you a lesson about life and appeal to your emotions, then this is definitely a book that you should read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Like most people, I read this book in high school, but it has stayed with me ever since. Holden Caulfield is a character one can easily symphathize with, and the supporting characters, especially Phoebe, are wonderful. Masterful."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Even though this book is banned in a lot of places, it's an important story about growing up. The author really captures the emotional feeling of being Holden Caulfield. Holden's sadness, his boredom, and his anger really come through to the reader. While J.D. Salinger's writing is difficult to read and grasp meaning from, the themes he chooses seem original yet familiar. Holden Caulfield goes through periods of depression which are confusing yet understandable. You can really relate to Holden through a lot of his experiences. The imagery in this story is incredible with the word choice of the author. The book has a setting unlike any other story, not showing New York City in black or white, but in shades of gray and brown. The characters in this story are real, and while walking down the street, it isn't hard to look for them. While some people might not agree with all of the topics The Catcher in the Rye brings up, I think it's a book everyone should read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book can simply be defined as a classic. I first read the novel in High School like many, I'm sure. The book covers the story of the young and innocent Holden Caulfield in his search for something genuine. The novel discuses the life of the typical teenager, but with more truth than others are willing to admit. The author does this by letting the reader in on Holden's personal thoughts, thoughts that in reality most people come to know.Holden comes from a well of family, which does not in return make his life easier. His family seems to ignore the heartbreaking event of the death of Holden's older brother, which Holden is then left to deal with completely on his own. He comes off as a rebel by not doing much in school and not seeming to care much for others, but he is revealed to be quite intelligent and friendly in his own way. Throughout his family and friend relationships Holden begins to find positive characteristics in which society contains. Holden struggles to look beyond the phoniness of his society in trying to simply find something genuine. The author J.D. Salinger contradicts some of Holden's actions, which may seem like an accident, but it was an intentional accident. Salinger does this to aide in revealing life lessons taken in by Holden and the reader. Throughout reading Holden's thoughts, you come to pity him and even empathize what he's going through. In the end the reader learns that Holden does truly have good intentions, which is revealed in his admiration and caring for his younger sister, Pheobe.One negative side could be that the novel seems a little wordy at points, but this factor is instantly over ruled once Salinger concludes the point he was trying to illustrate.This is one novel that will ever grow old. The author, J.D. Salinger brings up issues dealt with by Holden that can simply not be ignored by not only teenagers, but the by the rest of society too. Every one should read this book. The book invokes thought, questioning and emotions, which is something our entire population needs a little bit more of."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"HELLO!! Everyone! I have just got done this book and I enjoyed it cover to cover. If you enjoyed this book you noticed yourself in Holden, and you could to relate to at least one thing he was saying, or thinking. Don't get offended! I'm not saying you are a physco, but who is to say anyone is a &quot;pyhsco&quot;. Holden is pretty pathetic in a way because he has no one there for him to cry on someone's shoulder. Everyone needs a friend and love. The only FRIEND and LOVE is through Jesus Christ. There is no greater love than to lay your life down for your friend, and that is exactly what Jesus did for us. Holden looked everywhere for the perfect love, but no one was there. You may think I'm some fanatic but I bet you deep in your heart you know Jesus is real and that just like Holden, we ALL need to fill that void in our heart with GOD's love. That was the only downpoint of this novel, Holden never found love, and I wish Holden could have asked Jesus to come into his heart, so that Holden could have love, joy, happiness, in his heart, and the answere to life itself.

No wonder it's a modern day classic."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I see how some of my fellow teenagers found The Catcher in the Rye to be a boring or frustrating or pointless book. After I got over my initial shock, I realized that while this book was extremely special to me, it could just as easily be seen as trash by someone else. It is a highly subjective piece of literature, unlike, say, The Odyssey, which can be dissected as easily and unpleasantly as a frog. For certain types of people (myself included), books like this and Catch-22 provide characters to identify with. Other people with valid opinions might scoff at Holden and Yossarian and look to Beowulf-type heroes for proper role models. Quite simply, the anti-hero isn't everybody's cup of tea. I don't recommend this book to everyone--just to those that have ever felt alone and misunderstood because of different beliefs or paradigms."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I personally believe that &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; is a wonderful book. Even though it was written in the early-middle part of the century, it still is an accurate portrayal of teenage life. It touches on all the taboos, which include sex and drinking. Holden Caulfield may not be the perfect example of a teenager, but he is close. His values are approximately the same as most teenagers, and he shows sympathy for just about everything that is wrong in this world. I can see a bit of Holden in all my friends (I'm a teenager). This book was great, and not just because it was (and still is in some places) banned."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye, a book that I have always heard of ever since I was in school. I never knew what it meant, what it was about, and why it was so special, until now. I read this masterpiece of literature by J.D.Salinger this year, and this had to be one of my favorites of all time. Surrounded by controversey, and criticism, this book met up to all of my expectations. The writing style is what makes the book so powerful. The use of the normal everyday english, a style so at ease that it is a comfortable book to read, and more importantly to understand. You must understand this book in order to feel the complete effect of Holden Caufield, and his quest to find himself. The book has been critisized for its so called &quot;unappropriate&quot; language, and disturbing topics. I don't understand why, because what Holden does, and says are things that are not new to us, his language and many of his thoughts are common to many people, especially of his age. This book is definately one that I would read again. It feels good to finally read a book that I understand, and can, in some ways, relate to Holden. That is the most important aspect of the book, I believe that people can relate to Holden, making a very inspirational, and valuable book. Everyone who reads this book will see a little bit of Holden Caufield in them."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye is an interesting book, but not, as some may say, one of the best. It seems people read too much into the symbols in the book, and try to see things that aren't there. Even so, Salinger did not come up with a bad book. The portrayal of teenage life is excellent, and the feelings of the main character, Holden Caulfield seem to reflect ones which all of us have experienced at one time or another. As far as plot and depth go, however, this book is average, as is the style of writing. In other words, I've seen better, but I've also seen much worse."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher In The Rye is definitely one of those books that I think everyone should read at least once in their lives. It really takes an in-depth look at human nature. This book is very powerful and thought-provoking. It explores the idea that everyone around us is a phony, including ourselves. At first this may seem like a shocking and scary statement, but as you read on you realize that unfortunately, this idea is very true. Everyone, whether it is intentional or not, is or has been at one point in his or her life, a phony. We all have a bit of Holden Caulfield inside of us. This book will really make you take a look at yourself and those around you. It is a story everyone should read again and again!!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"For every teenager who thinks he or she is alone; for every adult who needs to remember!!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher In the Rye is a book that I read more than once because I could not get over how good it was. Every time that I read the book I find something new that i did not catch the time before. You have to reach deep inside to actually understand the book. I think that it is important that everyone is required to read this book before it is too late. It is not very common to hear that some one did not like this book. It was a book that is so easy to relate too. I think everyone has a little Holden Caufield in them, I know I sure do. Catcher in the Rye is such a well known book for the impact it left on readers. The readers were not used to the truth. They banned the book and would not let students read about the way things really are. Not one person is perfect. There may be close to perfect and far from perfect, but not perfect. Holden was a messed up boy that thought he was perfect. Holden needed to find a way to preserve his perfectness. What is ironic about the story is that as perfect as Holden tried to be the more screwed up he became. I strongly recomend this book to anyone who has not yet read this book. It is such a shamej to let such a book slip by."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I tell you it is a very well written book. There is an eerie quality about it that grips you right from the first page and continuous throughout. It makes one wonder how does the author manage to write on a thin plot line with such intensity. Houlden's comments about everything around him are immensely funny and lucidly presented. Though he makes you laugh on many occasions fundamentally it is a very sad book. The state of his mind when he asks Sally that sometimes i feel that everything will go to pieces if we didn't do anything about it is very well captured. And his relationship with Phoebe is potrayed with excellence. I've read the whole of Salinger but this was a masterpiece. It makes you laugh it makes you cry read it and know for yourself where the ducks go when the water in the lagoon in New York square freezes."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I really, really love this book.I'd say it's one of the best books I've ever read, actually, and having read at least three books a week since I learned to read at the age of six, that tells me a lot. Your mileage may vary.Holden is cynical, yet rather optimistic in a way. Depressing, maybe, but I think the reason people think it's depressing is because you recognize a lot of your own feelings and thoughts - most of them feelings and thoughts you don't really want to recognize.The language in the book might be offensive to some people, personally I've never cared much about cuss words, etc - they're just a part of the general &quot;shape&quot; or style of the book, and as long as they don't interfere with the rest of the book, I don't mind.Anyway, I'm ranting and I'm not supposed to. What I meant to say was:If you haven't read this book, go read it. If you don't own it, borrow, or better, buy it (you're going to want to read it a couple of more times, and people tend to want the things you borrowed from them back). You will regret it if you don't."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"&quot;The Catcher In The Rye&quot; is my all-time favorite book. It drew me in immediately, and before long, I fell for Holden Caulfield's cynicism and angst, as well as his vulnerability and hidden tenderness. Salinger perfectly developed the character, exposing and displaying Holden to make the reader feel as though they are snooping on someone's innermost private thoughts. I felt like I could get inside this character- like he reached out to me. I suppose it seems silly to get so involved with a book, but this book is so gutsy, so full of life, that I couldn't help but get involved. Read it and see for yourself."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book for English class but at first I didn't want to read it. As a teenager, I was really able to relate to Holden. At first I didn't like the book much, because Holden seemed too judgemental, but I discovered why he was like that. And his reasons seemed justified, and he was just reacting to the ugliness of the world. I feel the author did a great job with character development. And wrote from the perspective of a teenager, which Holden was. The only improvement I felt was needed was a new cover. I highly recommend this book for all age groups, especially for teenagers."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is one of the best I've read and most inspiring. It was some what depressing but reminded me that every day and everyone has challenge but no matter what; fate steps in and makes everything right again. READ IT!! =)"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm damned glad Salinger will never allow this to be filmed. Picture it. Ethan Hawke whining and saying &quot;really&quot; a lot. Ugh!!I will read this book every two years until I'm too old to remember how it feels to be Holden Caufield. BECAUSE I read it every two years, I hope I'll never forget.If you're a 7th-grader reading it because it has curse words in it, read Judy Blume's Wifey or something, cuz you're missing the pointPeople who assail this book for its lack of plot might just as well try to learn botany from Monet's Waterlilies.No other novel of the last 50 years even comes close."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"When I read this book, I was a junior in High School. I found the book to be almost autobiographical. I related to Holden quite well and I felt that he was telling the story of my life. It was quite influential! I enjoyed it greatly and it made me a better person."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Ok, I don't want this to sound like all of the other reviews, so let me just say that J.D. Salinger really captures the essance of being a teenager. I was only 11 when I read it for the first time, I understood a lot and liked it for the superficial aspects of it. Now I'm 15 and can relate to Holden. I read this book for the third time about a month ago and I think this time I really understood what Holden was going through. I would also like to say to all of you who hate this book, its ok to hate it, but give Salinger some credit. He is a wonderful writter and even if you don't like his books, you should at least give him his credit."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a prety good book, where Holden Coufield shows you a way to manage life.

The Catcher in the Rye is probably the only book in English Literature that appeals absolutely to all age groups. Even readers, especially teenagers, in India, as far as I have observed were overwhelmed to read a book that gave them the confidence to believe in themselves; to believe that they are not the only people in the world having a totally isolated sphere of their own; Salinger has very aptly exposed the sentiment and emotions of an American youth in whom Indian teenagers have found a friend. I feel that it is one book not worth missing to read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I absolutely loved this book, partly because there's a little Holden Caulfield in all of us, but also because he speaks volumes about our life in America. He's right- phonies are everywhere! Maybe it's because I go to a snooty private school just like him, but I see this everywhere- girls try to show off to all the boys, and the boys just don't care-they're cynical about the world. Read the book (Salinger is a great writer) but keep in mind that you are not supposed to like Holden, because the guy's a jerk to everyone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I think that The Catcher in the Rye is a sad portrayl of a young and confused teenager. The book did not interest me at all and the constant use of profanity made the book even worse. There seemed to be no plot and when I thought the book was actually going some where, I ran into another dead end. It did bring up a few desent points, but other than that I have to say that I give the book a thumbsdown. I hope some liked it, but as for me, I found nothing interesting about it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D.Salinger's &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, is quite possibly the best book I will ever read. Some say it is for kids. I beg to differ. This book hit home for close to millions of people. It is a timeless classic. Holden is the guy we all identify with for many reasons. He is a loner, he's funny, he doesn't know what to do with himself, and his intentions are good. The book is hysterical at parts and sad in others. I love this book so much because I went to a school very much like the one described in this book and I know what Holden is talking about. The bottom line is: Catcher in the Rye should have gotten a Nobel Prize in literature because it is so right on the money. As a coming of age novel, or for any reader who hasn't read this yet, please read it. It will change the way you think! No other book has been so poignant in so many ways for so many people. Read it and find out for yourself."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"good read although the swearing gets a little tedious after a while. Rather humorous and also sympathize with Holden towards the end."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the RyeJ. D. Salinger's book, The Catcher in the Rye, is one of the better books that I have read. It deals with a major problems that one may have in their life.Salinger did a wonderful job of expressing the feelings of the charactors so that I could relate. The main charactor, Holden Caulfield, goes through many different kinds of problems and does not try to seek help, instead runs away from them. The book points out to the readers that you can't just run away from all of your problems because your going to have to deal with them no matter what. \\"You can run, but you can't hide.\\" That would be the main lesson learned by reading this book.I recommend this book to people who are fifteen years of age or older. I do not recommentd it to younger people becuase of all the profound language in some places. This book would even be a good one for older people to read because it took place in the 1950's and they could try to relate it to their childhood. This book was fun to read and kept my attention. So if you want to read a book that will keep you wanting to read, you should read The Catcher in the Rye."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book because I had heard so much about it. To me, it didn't live up to all that I have heard but I did think it was a good read. The thing that bugged me about it was his constant use of the word goddamn because it got old after the first two paragraphs. I kept waiting for something to happen or for the plot to develop but it never did. At least the end was satisfying. It is just the kind of book you need to look deeper into."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Being a 16 year old high school student, I had to read this book for English and thought it was great. I understand how some people can find this book absolutely pointless, but Holden really does tell life like it is, saying things that I believe we all think in our heads in one point of our lives. This is a book every teenager should read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye started off as a funny and interesting book. The jokes that the author would crack, and the storyline and all made for a really exciting beginning. I got really into it and couldn't put it down. But as the story went on, it got really boring. The story started getting a little dull. Actually, very dull. If someone asked me, I wouldn't recommend this book for anything."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"After teachers and friends telling me that I simply *HAD* to read it, I went out and spent 6 bucks on The Catcher in the Rye. If I wanted to be put to sleep I could have done it for much cheaper than 6 bucks. Perhaps it gained popularity because it was one of the first books to swear and show the grim reality of some aspects of life. There are numerous books which do this now, but are not nearly as popular as this one. I found the book lacking in plot, variety, climax, and skill in every way. While it was not the worst book I have read, it is still on my list of books I would rather have a root canal than read again. If someone wants to read about and experience the grim reality of the world, read &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;. If you want to listen to a teenager whine repeatedly without any direction...call me (I'm 17) or waste the money and read Catcher in the Rye."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book when I was 16 and it is one that I still think about a lot.

A great deal of it still sticks in my mind years later."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I was amazed to read in an earlier review where someone mentioned that the pilot character in that new WWII novel, &quot;The Triumph and the Glory&quot;, reminded her of Holden Caulfield. I'd just read both books myself and was thinking the same thing, but figured it was just one of those perceptions one has that no one else on the planet ever has or ever will share because there isn't a shred of reality to sustain it. Anyway, The Catcher in the Rye is still, after all of these years, a monumental expression of human nature and the conditions budding adults face when they begin to fathom how the real world actually functions (or fails to function)."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"i read this book the other day....straight through without stopping. Although i found it a great book and some of the discriptions amazing and the feelings so easy to relate to and true to life, especially well ahead of it's time, and extremely clever the way it u know so much about stuff in the past despite it's short present tense, about 3/4 of the way through to book i began to get bored. It was getting kinda repetative....u just wanted him to go away, or go home, ring jane or do SOMETHING! but he doesn't and much to my suprise (due to the fact i had loads of blank pages at the back of my book) it ends! The only tiny glimmer of an ending being him finding a moments happiness.I s'pose that's the clever part of the book...to catch the reader by suprise...but it wasn't half annoying....i had a good mind at first to write my own ending!oh, i don't know what i think...well i'd recommend this book to anyone who likes to think, it's a very deep book but to anyone who can't stand things being unfinished don't even begin to read it!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have read this book many, many times and each time I enjoy it even more.

I read the book in an honors English class, I studied it, I talked about it, I thought about it. It's not bad, but it's not particularly good either.

Salinger, but never got around to read them. Finally on a trip to Europe a couple of months ago, stopping in New York on the way, I packed The Catcher in the Rye in my luggage. As it is set in New York I started reading it on the plane from New York to London. And did I enjoy it?! Man, what have I been thinking, waiting so long? I got so much on terms with Holden Caulfield, that I started to write like him in a couple of letters I wrote. The evening I arrived in London there was a brilliant documentary about J.D. Salinger on TV. I was totally absorbed, and enjoyed every page of the book, admired Salinger's portrayal of adolescence. Such a comic and touching novel. I continued to read it on the train up north through Sweden and at some stage laughed so much I had to put the book down - people were looking strangely at me. They just fitted into the book, had probably never read it. I have and I loved every bit of it. Not to be missed, so don't wait, just go ahead and read it!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield is the ultimate disgruntled teenager attempting to find his way in life-over fifty years later, most teenagers ask the same questions and view the world in many of the same ways as Holden."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye is easily one of the most brilliant books ever written. It is wildly entertaining but also very deep. If I had to pick only 5 books to read over and over again for the rest of my life, this would be on that list, and probably in the top two or three. Very few classic works of literature from the United States are actually worth reading, but this book is the exception. Everyone should read this at some point in their lives."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I think this is a must read for all kids in junior high. I read it in graduate school which made me think as I read the book that it would have benefited me more in junior high or high school. I got out of the book that you should not drop out of school and you should apply yourself. It was pointed out to me that this book is also about a kid with mental background issues that need to go to counseling. Very good book if read at the righ time in your life but still a valuable read later on in life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is mature in its immaturity. It took me a while to finally come to this conclusion. When read for the first time, Holden appears to be an immature teen who is too busy complaining about everything he can. I recently watched the movie Loser with Jason Biggs, and took note of the influence this book had on this movie. For example, the red hunting cap made an appearance."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is very interesting. It shows the attitude of a teenager as well as the way one thinks. However, I found it hard to read because it skipped from one idea to another often.

It remains a classic about the alienationfelt by teens."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read The Catcher in the Rye a couple of years ago in high school, and since then, I have recommended it to a number of people. Most of them have hated it. This is one of those books that you either love or hate, and I can't always pin what type of person is going to hate it or love it. Nevertheless, I am definitely one of the people who really connects with Holden, and I have returned to this novel over and over.I really connect with Holden in this novel because basically, it is about the problem of pain, and everyone has dealt with that biggy before. I really think Holden's struggle in the novel is an authentic one, and it strikes me like my own. Holden is devastated by the loss of his brother Allie. He loved him and the world took him away, and now Holden does not know how to act in such a world. He doesn't know how to be intimate with anyone anymore. He doesn't understand how other adults cope, and he thinks they are phony. Of course, many of them are phonies, and Holden himself has resorted to being one in an attempt to divert himself from the painful realities of living. He would rather project his false self than let his real one be hurt, but Holden, unlike many of those around him, is at least on the way to not being authentic. I think all of his actions throughout the novel center around his struggle with pain. He is either trying to divert himself (with Sunny and Sally) or he is trying to fight through it (with Phoebe and possibly, Jane). And near the end, I think he is finally beginning to make a breakthrough, when he is able to care for Phoebe and resolve to stay near her despite the fact that she is a person who he cannot control and who may hurt him. He seems to find some redemption from Phoebe's love.I really find The Catcher in the Rye to be one of the great books I've read. I think there are so many things you can take away from it, and I feel that Holden's struggles are so real and so relavent to (at least my) life. The novels one of the true classics of the last century, and I can't really see its popularity diminishing for a while."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"&quot;I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff- I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I'd do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all.&quot; This is a quote made by Holden Caulfield, the narrator of The Catcher in the Rye. He was explaining to his little sister, Phoebe, how he wants to protect children from being corrupted by adulthood.Anyone who read this book would agree with me when I say that Holden Caulfield is a very unique individual. He uses the word \`phony' to describe just about everyone around him. Although I found him to be quite odd, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel. It was, at times, comical, and exhibits the thinking process of this sixteen year old boy very clearly. He explains the method to his madness, and how much he dislikes all that is not genuine in this world. I felt like I knew Holden personally by the end of his story. He gave such an intimate description of his life from the time he got kicked out of Pency to his return home.The way that the book was written exactly how he would have spoken, made it easy for me to read. I felt like I was having a conversation with Holden. The characters described in the novel were very realistic. I could just picture his family, teachers, the boys in his dorm, and all of the people he came in contact with while he was in New York.The Catcher in the Rye is an excellent book. I would recommend it to teenagers; boys and girls. I think that especially that age group would find this book very amusing, and it will really make you think about the people around you"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I believe this book is liked by so many people is that many folk, especially youngins, can somehow relate to Holden Caulfield's life [the main character], he is so dynamic in his negative aspect on life and his comments. I have read this book twice and im not even a big reader. The first time was for a book report, but during the summer after I cant believe I actually read it again and learned even more underlying ideas. This is a great read and not too long either!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is amazing. The instant you fall into it flows amazingly. It plays out like your own thoughts do. The writing is great and the story is great. 16 year old Holden is a lonely character and is one you will never forget. This book delivers some serious messages without boring you. It is an easy read. but a very very tough idea. The themes in this boo are soo extremely deep that holden can only scratch the surface for you, and if you do not like this book than you are missing the point. Many self-richous morons will disagree with this book, but it is the fact that holden is not an adult that makes his raw untouched, unfiltered point of view unique. His point of view can tell you a lot about many a things. Overall if you are going to read one book, make it this. And if you enjyed this then you might also enjoy A seperate peace."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is the best book I've read in a long time. It really makes you think about the world and the &quot;phonies&quot; in it. Holden brings up a lot of good points about society and how people act. Sometimes, the way Holden keeps on repeating everything gets annoying, but I think it's done purposely. He was mentally unstable, due to the death of Allie. Some people say that Holden is incredibly self-centered. But the book is written in stream of consciousness. I don't know about you, but my thoughts are mainly focused around myself. Salinger really uses this writing style to give the book a deeper meaning and greater impact. Holden is like any other teenager I know. He looks at the world and wonders why everything is like it is. Why people act so dumb and lie all the time. The Catcher in the Rye really gives you a lot to think about."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a revolutionary book. Aside from all the notoriety it receives as the cause of some unfortunate incidences, the book is written flawlessly. The language Salinger chooses to use is easy enough to read that most all readers will find the words easy to comprehend. Yet therein lies Salinger's genius. Salinger depicts the mind of an adolescent male to perfection. Using fluid and basic diction, Salinger creates a mood and way of thinking that is so close to reality, its scary. Although not all young men have felt exactly the same as Holden, all have at one point felt certain aspects of Holden's disillusionment and pain."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; and I believe it was a book that was an example of certain troubled teens. Holden was like other teens forced into an uncomfortable position that his mentality was unaccustomed. That' s why he was dismissed from yet another school, there was a part of him that was disturbed. He had different sides to himself, like some people, the side that doesn't care much, the part where he took little notice to leaving the fencing teams foils, or knowing his parents suffered each time he came home as a failure, there was the side that stood out the most, the depressed side where he would get easily depressed when he was caught in a certain situation he'd get depressed, an example, when his brother died, he resorted to smashing all the windows. Many depressed people resort to unthinkable ways when something like that comes up and the reason some people think is they should've known better and they should stop thinking these ideas, but a depressed person can't help their actions sometimes and sometimes seem a little lower to a regular person sometimes. Leaving Pencey is what Holden felt was best, and doing that was good because for Holden to escape where he was crumpled up would have put an anvil on his already troubled mind. That's why he remembers this point of his life so vividly, where he opened up and went through this nervous breakdown that was waiting to come. Through his mishaps with some people such as old Maurice to his viewings as a 'sweet young man' by the two nuns shows his personalities. The one who absently fixes himself into a sorrowful situation to the one that can see a pleasant person who means well. Unfortunately, he is thrown into his mood swing of depression. His nervous breakdown reallyy comes when he gets drunk up to when he cries at the thought of his sister giving him her Christmas money. By then he has reached his point of depressing due to the agony he spent by himself, which is what the novel is about, a young man who remembers so vividly of his suffering which became serious at that point of his life he spent alone. We see hints where most of his hurt comes from. Being alone, several thoughts, and the depression he consistantly feels. At one point his breakdown subsides when he sees his sister enjoying herself, he feels a feeling of joy that replaces any bitterness. Of course, he sees a psyciatrist after all this so the actual problem isn't worked out fully professionally. Holden's continuous pessimistic side of life by referring to his environment around him as 'phony' is one that optimistic people might argue, but we see that child in him; one that wants to see something the way it is supposedly seen, while it's an example that the world itself does't show us what it really is, it paints a serene picture on what it feels it wants to be, then when we're hipnotized into it, it bestows the acttual fact; some don't care about that, others see this and complain. At one point, we see why the book was banned because the f word was announced five times, which I must say is bad in general, but is worse that America would ban the book because of the word. At that time, the world wasn't ready for that word, but it should've realized that this is the world they were living in, and that the book was an example of it. Of course, America didn't want to face the facts, they wanted to shame America from America, which J.D. Salinger unveiled. Mr. Salingner really unveiled America and it took America by surprise. Judging on life itself, the word was probably invented even in the late 1800's but by the time the meaning came around, the word was a shadowy figure, known but never spoken, until it finally shone light. Before I conclude, the story took place sometime in December of 1948 and even though Holden was hesitant to admit he was wrong, we all have the tendency to be that way. In fact, we fail to admit this to. To conclude, I felt some anger towards Holden the first time I read the book, but after awhile, you could see there is some emotional pain to the sixteen-year-old that he has to work out but might not have (a sequel on Holden's progress would fit the cause), and when that is found, sympathy could be given for the kid. What he had could've been, as he related earlier, a phase. I rate the book a three because although the book told a good point of what many might overlook, a great deal it could've unfolded. I'll stop here; I could go on though, but I wanted to talk about the important parts in the book. That's all I have to say."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had to read this book for my 11th grade English class. This book was really easy to read.

The narrative was whiny, foul-mouthed and boorish, and I could find no sympathy for the plight of the protagonist, except of course for the mourning of his younger brother.Certainly I get the theme - a young man is forced by himself and the world around him to race headlong into an adult world full of contradictions and broken rules, and come to grips with his lost youth. Admittedly universal and relevant to some degree for all readers. I guess once you're through that stage, the angst fades, perhaps even turns to nostalgia, and a character like Holden just becomes one of those slacker kids you no longer care to dissect.Maybe the \\"classic\\" designation comes from the extremism - the language, the mental state, the sex, booze, rebellion, etc. And I guess I could see value in challenging students to find meaning in a non-traditional plot. It just didn't do it for me though.I think when my kid is a teenager and has to read this for school, I'll give it another shot to foster some conversation, but I won't feel the need to pick it up until then."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had never heard a bad thing about &quot;the Catcher and the Rye,&quot; so I decided to read it. I don't see how so many people can like it and recommend this novel. The story isn't too horrible, and even the plot isn't too terrible. But the word selection, sentence structure and syntax is the worst I have read. Wow, I never knew how often someone could repeat the same phrases and have a novel published. If I wrote an essay where I said this 'kills' me (he meant amused me) every paragraph, I know my English teacher would fail me. If half the time I started to describe something, I said, &quot;But I don't feel like telling you about that&quot; or &quot;But I am not in the mood,&quot; my paper would flunk. I never knew how often the word &quot;phony&quot; could be used.I really tried to stay openminded about this book, but by the end of the novel I was no longer enjoying his story because of the writing style. The story in itself is not that bad; I have read worse. This boy Holden has just flunked out of his third prep school, and we join him over the next two or three days of his life. Holden seems to think many people are phony, and I think that the phoniness of so many people must be the point of this novel. I agree that a lot of people do things because it is what is expected of them, but does that make them phony. I think that Holden used other people's phoniness as an excuse not to apply himself, because he was not phony like others.Overall, I gave the novel two stars because of its grammer, the plot wasn't too bad."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I finished reading the Catcher in the Rye about two weeks ago. I thoroughly enjoyed every page of J.D. Salinger's masterpiece. Holden Caulfield is a remarkable character that we can all relate to. Holden represents the sometimes terrifying step into adulthood. I highly recommend this book. Everyone should read it at least once. The Catcher in the Rye has easily become my favorite book.I love it!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Okay, unless you live in a cave you've heard of Catcher in the Rye. Most likely it was mentioned in hushed tones usually reserved for Events of Monumentous Occasion and Venerable Fixtures of American Popular Culture.During my senior year in High School (1985) my English class was assigned to read this book (as every English class has been required to do since the Truman Administration). I \\"opted out\\" as it were. Years later I found a copy of this Hallowed Work for 25 in a thrift shop and thought I'd see what I'd missed waaaay back when. Turns out, I really was better off ditching school and going to Disneyland.Sorry folks but this is a textbook example of Much Adoo About Nothing. The truly ironic part is that most folks who gush about Catcher in the Rye would be excatly the kind of people Holden refers to as \\"phonies\\".There seems to be an obligation to love this book in order to consider yourself enlightened or progressive. I can see why this act plays big on both coasts.This was the book that ushered in the angst-ridden teenager as anti-hero that survives to this day in the form of tone-deaf Emo and Nu-Metal bands.How the reader is supposed to have any empathy for a trust fund baby with a chip on his should escapes me. Maybe it's becuase I was not rich and angst-ridden as a teen.The book itself is a tedious, read. Dull, long-winded and repetitive Caufield rambles aimlessly through what is supposed to be a couple of days but reads like 10 years. All the characters are forgettable and by the end of the book you're rooting for Holden to get run over by a taxi.This emperor, truly, wears no clothes."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"... but every 15-y/o should be given a copy and told not to read it until he/she is 50 years old and/or has had at least one life-altering experience, e.g., death of a sibling, combat, loss of a first love.I don't recall reading this in high school -- hard to believe -- but I finally read it. Outstanding. It should be banned in high school, not because of the language, teen-age behavior (smoking, drinking, fighting), etc., but rather it is too good a book for the majority of high school readers who wouldn't \\"get it.\\"I am thrilled, though, to see some high school students reviewing this book on Amazon and giving it 5 stars."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Although I do have to agree with most of the people below that CATCHER is entertaining and a page-turner, it definitely did not give me the feeling of enlightenment reading other Salinger books did. CATCHER doesn't really have a plot or a meaning to me. Holden Caulfield is a boring, predictable, spoiled-brat prep school kid. Salinger's other characters (the Glass family) are much more multi-faceted and interesting. Do yourself a service and read Franny &amp; Zooey or Raise the Roof Beam High, Carpenters &amp; Seymour.His other books appeal to anyone on a spiritual search or who just want intelligently written books, not just teenagers who need to be coaxed with a mindless plot including lots of swearing, smoking, and sex to read a book.

The story of a boy struggling through school and getting kicked out. Im sure pretty much everyone can relate to Holden in someway.The story is about a boy named Holden who attends private school and has been kicked out of a couple and is now leaving his current school called Pencey. Summed up the whole book is him telling his life story.The book didnt really impact my life that much. I did some research about the book and such and what I found was that supposeably this book encouraged Mark Chappman to kill the beloved singer and song writer John Lennon a former band member of The Beatles.I personally thought the overall book was good. It didnt take me long to get into and didnt take me long to finish but i also enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It is a story that any teenager or adult can relate to, even if it was not written recently the ambiance and situations don't change, Holden is a typical boy struggling with issues of belonging, curiosity and trust. It is an impact to see how the betrayal of a trusted person can be a disaster in ones behavior. Also is amazing to see how the example of the father and mother is repeated in the image of Holden.Even the way it ends it is like a teenager, without explanations and not making any sense to a grown up.Easy to read book, I recommend it to those who have teenagers at home, it will make you remember what a struggle one goes through during that life period and hopefully understand a bit more what they are going through or will go through."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this in high school and could certainly relate to Holden at the time. He's an angry, rebellious, sarcastic teen with a serious attitude problem. Throughout the story, he grows, he learns and he faces some really horrible things in his past. The story is 'badly' written to some standards but in an artistic way which reflects the character. There are a lot of intense situations and some profanity (as a teen I was like \\"Cool!\\" hehe). In the beginning, Holden seems to hate the world. You start out hating Holden and thinking he is a jerk but through the course of the story you learn so much about him and you share his pain. You learn that benieth a tough mask, lies a smart, sensitive and thoughtful person. It's a flawed story, with a flawed character in a flawed world but it all seems so real that you feel like you are there. It has a lot of dry, sarcasic humor which had me laughing out loud in class. Mostly it's a story about growing up and the journey of a young man discovering who he really is in a world full of phony people. I can see why this is a classic! A warning though to those who are sensitive or easily offended: There are some sad parts and lots of foul language but without this it would not be the same story! It's a timeless story and I would certainly read this book again!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This story is about a boy by the name of Holden Caufield. He's going to a prep school and the name is not just meaning the name of the school. In Holden's eyes everyone is a fake, prep, or jock.In the beginning of the story, which is from Holden's point of view, Holden is explaining how he's leaving the school because he has failed 4 of his 5 subjects. He goes to visit his aging teacher and meets up with his room mate. Turns out that his slimeball of a room mate is going on a date that day. On a date with a girl Holden knew from his past. He thinks about how he's is known as a player in the school and he worries for the girl.In the end, after Holden leaves the school he takes an 'interesting' journey through the city. He meets up with some shady characters, while he's thinking about getting home to see 'Old Pheobe' his younger sister. He also thinks about his younger brother who had died. Along the way he seems to talk to himself, but in turn is really trying to have a conversation with his brother. His brother was the genius of the family and always seemed to know what to do, unlike Holden's older brother who has gone off to Hollywood where, in Holden's opinion, all the fakes live.In the end this story is thought to be about a lot of things. Some people think that it's just the story of a messed up teen, trying to find his way home after getting kicked out of his 3rd school. Then people think of this story as the lose of innocence, like how Holden worries about Ackly's date.You can come to your own conclusions either way. Hope you enjoy the book:)"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I walk through this life in a sea full of strangers, a world without compassion and innocence. I wanted to drown, and just when I thought I would drown, this book came along, and it's as if a hand extended itself to pull me out.Four years ago, I was 16 just as Holden was in the book. But unlike him, I excelled at school and it's as if I had everything going for me. And during all that time I felt completely and utterly alone because I was in a world were popularity was everything, where the f word was used more times than you can ever count, and where purity meant nothing.I respect Holden because despite his flaws he realizes his imperfection, and his only dream and comfort would be to save innocent children from falling. In a way he has achieved that dream 'cause for everyone whose failing spirit was revived by this book, Holden already became that saviour. So thank you Holden for catching me."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have been reading this book the past couple days, I only have about sixty pages left. And I'm still looking desperately for a plot. It's amazing that a two hundred plus page book can be so popular when there is no plot that I can see. The entire thing, as far as I can see, is about this messed up kid that isn't happy unless he swears twice a sentence. He's obsessed with getting laid and that dumb duck thing. My English teacher says it has some metaphorical meaning, but I don't see it. I only give it two stars because it is well written, there's great voice in the book, it sounds like a real person is there narrating it orally. I dunno, maybe it'll get better, but I doubt the last sixty pages can redeem the first hundred and fifty."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Being bored one day,I happened to glance at my book shelf and spotted catcher in the rye. Hearing about this book in a couple of movies(conspiracy theory being one of them) I thought i'd check it out. From what I have read I can see why it appeared in the movie. After reading I could n't help but look at the world in a different way. And thats not such a good thing!Holden is a paranoid peccimist and an alcoholic and chain smoker. But hey thats cool we all have problems. Some or his views are very scary in a way(like his thoughts on museums) Its kind of overwhelming at times and I grew worried I might start thinking the way he does! At times the book is funny and at times sad. I kept hoping he would actually do something like go really crazy(taxi driver type crazy) but he didn't. Throughout the book he doesn't really do anything but his experiences are still amazingly intersting and revealing of his vulnerability and mental state. I really recomend this book. After reading it you won't look at things the same way again. Or worse yet you'll catch yourself thinking the way he does!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Hi, first you should know I only gave this book a9 instead of a ten in the vain hope you wouldnotice this review among the dozens of 10s whichwill surround it.

It is supposed to be some amazing adventure into the everyday life of a teenager, full of shortcomings, pressures, angst and grief. IT WAS NONE OF THAT. I thought that it was a horrible peice of literature. I believe that it showed a whiny young man, who couldn't take responsibility for himself. He stayed mired in this self-pity and couldn't see why nothing went his way. I didn't care for this book at all. I beleive that the only reason that it caught fire was because it was so &quot;bad&quot; when it was published that it was banned. This being banned added a little mystique to it. Everyone read it and it did well. Oh, by the way, so there is no misinterpretation of my comments, I am a 17 year old male in California. Yes, a teenager actually hated the Catcher in the Rye. AMAZING! I welcome any comments at my e-mail address: hoss@neworld.ne"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Written from the point of view of an average American teenager, this novel seems to bring out the best and worst in all of us. Perhaps the most gripping fact about this book is that it is reflective of our society. Obviously, societal behaviors are what drove Salliager to write this novel, not the opposite: our behavior changing, for the worse due to this novel"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is pathetic. Many people called it a \\"classic.\\" It's the book that killed John Lennon. Oswald had a copy. So I thought \\"What the heck?\\" I then embarked on four hours of my life spent reading this complete testacle sack of a book; four hours I will never get back, I might add. The long and short of it is: the writing style is mundane and repetative, the crude language, while could be seen as \\"liberating\\" considering the time in which the book was written, becomes more numbing than anything else thereby losing its effect on the reader, and to wrap it all up, the boy is so unbelievably annoying, you find yourself applauding the pimp for slapping the crap out of him. The only reason this book survived to the present day is more because of the folklore surrounding it, rather than the book itself.J.R.R. Tolkien said to C.S. Lewis concerning Lewis's first book \\"Clive, people who are willing to use the word 'bunk' are going to call this book 'bunk.' They don't know any better.\\" I am an educated man, and to call The Catcher in the Rye \\"bunk\\" is to give it far too high a praise."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book first came to my attention when I was in eighth grade (1979 or 1980 if that matters) and watching an episode of the \\"Lou Grant\\" TV show. The episode was about book burning and censorship in general. Catcher in the Rye was one of the books that was mentioned by name as inspiring hatred in some groups of people (along with Slaughterhouse Five, and a certain editions of the Dictionary which contained \\"dirty\\" words). Rossie (one of Lou Grant's star journalists) picked up Catcher in the Rye out of the pile and said he couldn't believe anyone would want to ban it, and that book helped him survive his teenage years. Naturally after seeing the episode, I went out to the local Library to try and find and read all of these forbidden books for myself, to see what was so bad about them.I read it at age 13, and just did not get it at all. I mainly didn't understand what a \\"phoney\\" was in the context that Holden Caulfield was using that word, and didn't understand how a person of his age could have so much freedom (to stay in a hotel on his own, wander around New York City on his own) and still do nothing but whine and complain.We were assigned to read the book in my Sophomore year in high school, and even with the benefit of being two years older, I still didn't appreciate the literary value of it. Holden was just a insufferable whiner in my opinion, and I couldn't identify with him whatsoever. I decided it must be a baby-boomer thing.It wasn't until I read \\"Less Than Zero\\" by Brett Easton Ellis in the late 80's that I got a clue to why baby boomers loved Catcher in the Rye so much. One of the reviews of Less Than Zero quoted on the back cover said \\"... this is a Catcher in the Rye for our time...\\". Less Than Zero was one of the most raw, shocking, disturbing books I had ever come across, and it made me think that maybe in the early 1950's when The Catcher in the Rye was published, it was raw, shocking and disturbing to audiences at the time. If that's the case, then I can understand why it holds a special place in the heart of baby boomers, and people from that generation.Even so, Holden Caulfield will always be an insufferable whiner as far as I'm concerned."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is an interesting book, mostly due to the polarizing effect it seems to have. People who read it either believe that it is the worst book ever, or praise it as though it were the only book that ever expressed anything worth reading. While the latter group insists that the former is missing the point of the novel, I disagree. Although I do not think that Catcher is the worst book ever, I certainly understand why many people believe that it is extremely poorly written.The first complaint I have with The Catcher in the Rye is that it does not have a plot. A typical plot will have an escalating series of events, culminating in some sort of climax with a resolution. The story begins with Holden getting kicked out of Pencey Preparatory School and quickly devolves into a random collection of events that occur to him while he walks aimlessly around New York City, with no clear conflict resolution or climax. The book ends in a similarly ambiguous manner, with Holden going back to school, presumably to drop out again. Some people, however, will say that it is not necessary for a book to have a plot in order for it to be good. Those people will claim that it is enough to have characters that are interesting, relatable, and have interacting interactions with one another.Shockingly, The Catcher in the Rye manages to skillfully dodge having either of those. J.D. Salinger does a remarkable job of keeping Holden from changing, or learning anything that could improve his negative life outlook. For example, at the beginning of the novel, Holden is shown flunking out of school due to a lack of applying himself, and at the very end, he is shown saying that he doesn't really know if he's going to apply himself when he goes to his next school. From this, it is obvious that Holden has not developed or learned anything from his trip. This only adds to the fact that Holden is not relatable to the majority of people, especially not the teenagers who often proclaim to enjoy the book. The actions Holden goes through, from getting drunk when he goes to the bar, to ordering a prostitute, are so outside what the average 16 year old does that the character loses any semblance of similarity to the typical teenager.Secondly, Holden's personality is one of the things that make me dislike the book. This is due to the fact that Holden complains about everything that he sees, and even admits to Phoebe at the end of the book that he can't think of anything he especially likes. It is also extremely difficult for Holden to be likeable, considering he brings most of his troubles upon himself. For instance, Holden gets beat up by a pimp after ordering a prostitute and refusing to pay her the full fee she asks. Then later, Holden complains that he's probably going to die of pneumonia, after getting drunk, soaking his head, and not drying his hair before going out into the freezing cold. As these events are clearly caused by his own poor choices that he could easily avoid, it is difficult to sympathize with Holden. While it is true that some events in Holden's life, such as Allie's death, were beyond his control, he displays a clear inability to deal positively with grief and move on with his life, as he keeps trying to tell Phoebe that Allie is the only thing he likes in life, despite Allie having been dead for years.Due to the fact that the book lacks the main characteristics which define a good novel, it is difficult to accept the claim that it is truly an example of excellent literature. The Catcher in the Rye lacks a relatable main character, a true plot, and any semblance of character development."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A cult classic, \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" has captured the imagination of countless adolescents, school teachers, and even one Mark David Chapman, the assassin of John Lennon. It has also been reviled, refuted, and banished from school reading lists since its publication in 1951. So what's the big deal?It's understandable that by 1950s standards this book may have been controversial, given its profanity and sexual underpinnings, although that is mild by today's standards. However, these give the book an edge, and an extra dimension that helps catapult this book to the top of the list of classics. Salinger presents the story of an adolescent, Holden Caulfield, and his alienation from the world he lives in. Although there is little action, Salinger convincingly paints a portrait of a tortured individual struggling with irreversible changes in his life as he grows into an adult.Although Holden is a privileged teenager from Manhattan, his life is anything but privileged. Although he convinces himself that the world around him is full of \\"phonies\\", his total self-isolation serves as a protective barrier against the world whom he loathes. As he falls deeper into the abyss of self-pity and loneliness, it becomes apparent that a root cause of his present state of mind may be the death of his younger brother, Allie.Holden looks longingly back at his childhood, and is determined to preserve the innocence of his younger sister, Phoebe, the only one whom he truly cares about. Indeed, his dream job would be a \\"catcher in the rye\\", one who catches children as they play in a rye field before they fall over the precipice. Symbolically, this is the precipice that separates childhood from adulthood, and the one that Holden is refusing to confront. For once he descends into adulthood, he knows that his childhood is gone forever, and his memories of Allie will become distant.There is a good reason this novel has become a staple of high school literature classes. Although it is an easy read, it is also deep and profound. And nearly all of us could relate to at least some aspects of the story."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is one of the best books I have ever read. It is a truly inspirational tale about a boy who is all alone and is in a desperate search to find himself. After just getting expelled from his school, Holden goes through New York City for a couple of days and you read about the sad, funny, and just palin weird adventures he embarks on. This book really makes you think about what your place is in the world and has you to realize that you can't just perfectly lay out everything in life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Book was well used, and written in, but I read the story and we had a good book discussion about the author and story line."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A classic that I could not finish.

Donated to the LA County Public Library."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had been somewhat hesitant to read &#34;The Catcher in the Rye&#34; after snoozing through Salinger's &#34;Nine Stories,&#34; but I'm glad I finally came around. This book is a work of genius.The book is a &#34;coming of age&#34; tale, but it certainly transcends the adolescent garbage that fills up most of the genre. The protagonist is 16 year old Holden Caulfield - depressed, aimless, and disillusioned. The entire story covers just one December weekend in which he seeks to find direction in his life after flunking out of another prep school. As Caulfield contemplates his transition from adolescence to adulthood, he becomes disgusted with the utter &#34;phoniness&#34; of society and longs for the innocence of youth.Where Salinger's masterpieces surpasses other notable coming of age novels such as &#34;Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man&#34; and &#34;This Side of Paradise&#34; is in the treatment of social mores. Where these other novels offer a one-dimensional treatment of sexuality and religious apostasy as the sum-all of maturation, Salinger offers a more complicated, more realistic picture. Holden Caulfield is truly one of the best characters from the last century, this story will make you think, or possibly hate adolescence."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this some time ago, and honestly, I don't understand why it was ever banned in public schools.

The teenager in this book just wanders aimlessly in the book seeking attention because he comes from a broken childhood. He's very bitter and constantly uses vulgar language and makes sexual inferences in the book. I'm not exactly sure what the point of this book was unless it's describing how not to raise a kid or else he will end up this way. Holden Caulfiend was like James Dean, \\"A Rebel Without a Cause.\\" He was bitter from page one to the end of this book. I never felt so empty until reading this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"100 best books of English language. An excellent book about a young man who is clearly suffering.

This is a stream of consciousness book that is very well wrought in the first person, from Holden Caufield's perspective. It's a cautionary tale to truly take the time to understand your sons - they are complex emotional creatures with little outlets to find inner peace."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A hilarious little work that made me laugh or chuckle quite frequently. Holden Caulfield is a self-important young man, getting his self-esteem pummeled after being kicked out of his (3rd, 4th?) college because of flunking grades. The kind of guy who thinks everyone ELSE is a moron, Holden's internal thoughts are comedic. He interacts with some very interesting characters, some more interesting than himself. I enjoyed it very much, though, was distracted by the bad grammar! \\"I and he....\\" etc. Overall a joy to read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield calls life as he sees it. Life is mostly full of phonies but there are good people as well. The good people are usually the \\"little people\\" such as the ladies working at his sister Phoebe's school, the coat-check lady and the two nuns that Holden bumps into while eating breakfast. The phonies tend to be those in a position of power and those with money. Very young kids are almost always genuine and nice. Sometime between childhood and adulthood, something can go horribly wrong. Holden recognizes this with unusual clarity and yearns to shelter children from the ugly realities of life. Burdened with his own considerable issues, he finally focuses on saving only one child - his beloved sister, Pheobe."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"JD Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye is an interesting novel which explores the loss of innocence in the eyes of the main character.

Not all books have happy endings and not all books have to live up to the standards that 1000 bound thin, leafy pieces of paper told you are correct, moral, and just.Holden Caulfield is the perfect example of an anti-hero, and a lovable one at that. The fact he isn't a God-fearing conformist like everyone who can't think for themselves doesn't mean you can't read the book. I read this book in my freshman year in High School and it was a very enjoyable, fun, and appropriate read. The fact the F word was used shouldn't come to much of a shock to you: 8/10 high school kids use the word as often as they say \\"umm\\" or \\"like.\\" It is natural sewage spewing from their mouths, and the fact you don't think your children can take a few curse words in a book is a scary thought. I understand you are trying to raise your child in a holy and sin-free world but this is not the reality of the life she lives, I am quite sure of it, even though I don't even know them. You can't be protected forever, and if a book is the only thing to upset them, they is living a very calm and peaceful life.You can't judge a book by it's language or by the fact there is no fairytale happy ending, and counting the swears is absolutely ridiculous and meticulous drudgery. Honestly-- turn off the Beauty and the Beast, put your handbook to life in your nightstand drawer for a second or hide under a rock so God can't see you read such a blasphemous novel, get past your stubborness (yes, I'm positive this book is the Devil's attempt to drag us all down to it's pitiful level, along with the murderer of John Lennon), give this book a clean slate, and read it. Only then can you judge it truthfully. (And if you have already read it once in all your anger, read it again the same way you would read any new book.) After you have read it, like it or not, you should read JD Sallinger's other book, Nine Stories. It's different than the Catcher in the Rye-- it dabbles a good amount in the field of post war life and shell shock. So please, give this book a chance, it's not sin-free and it does deal with foul language, prostitution (although the heinous crime of pre-marital sex is not committed, God forbid), drunkeness, and real-world situations... but isn't that the make up of life? It's not what you want it to be, it is what it is."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is definitly different. It made no sense to me at all. All that goes on is only in like 2 days. It feels like this is his whole life! It's definitly confusing. Beware swares galore! If you like werid books that are out there than this is a good book for you otherwise I wouldn't suggest it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am 16, and i started reading this book because even donnie darko director richard kelly said it was good.but anyways this book is sooooooooo boring, not to mention its so utterly pointless and annoying...almost of single page the read is bombarded with this BORING, and i meen BORING character Hold claufields thoughts...him saying 'goddam' so much i felt like burning the goddamn book. honestly most of the book is him just living his crappy little life, and not to mention him saying how phony and depressing every iS!!! it doesnt matter how much 'meening' and 'symbolism' is portrayed in this book. I am 16, and i know being a teenager is nothing like this, i dont see everything as depressing, i dont get aggitated by very small things like movies.. I feel like giving this holden guy a kick in the head. The author is obviously trying to be smart and intellectual about this book..but its simply not entertaining. Its just a series of depressing events. this book is not enjoyable, but simply DEPRESSING."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"come on. everyone has read this book. if you havn't what are you going to talk about at social gatherings?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Poor Caulden.

I have spent my life reading most of the classics, along with best sellers, biographies, etc. I stopped counting when I got to 10,000 books read, about 13 years ago, so I consider myself to be a book connoisseur. This Catcher in the Rye is one book I wish I never read. Actually I didn't even bother to finish it, because it is such a waste of paper and time. If you want to read a great coming of age book, read A Separate Peace or A Prayer for Owen Meany. If you want to read about a real hero, read The Real George Washington."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is probably the second most overrated book in American Literature. I do not understand why people think this book is so great. I quickly tired of the protagonist's well-heeled puerile whining . I kept thinking, &quot;Grow up, for God's sake.&quot; In short, I would argue that Salinger's insights and themes are stunted and trivial at best. To teh people who love this book I would sayGrow up and find out what real life is like and maybe read some real books"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm a 17 year old girl, and one might think I can't possibly have read enough books to choose an all time favorite, but I believe I have. On whim, I picked up this book in New York City, and day or so later had finished it. It's the novel I read when I'm bored. It's the novel I take with me everywhere. I always keep it near me. I've underlined things, I've quoted it in my articles for the school newspaper. Now I sound like I'm obsessed, but I'm not. The storyline isn't something everyone can relate with, yet there is a sense of relation when you finish the book. A person almost hopes that he or she would have acted the same way if put in Holden's situation, because he makes it so amusing. This is worth the 5 stars!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am a teenager and normaly, books aren't very amusing to me. But one day I took a glance inside this book and I loved it. It was very funny,well written and I recomend it to anyone, especialy teenagers."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Salinger writes a wonderful tale of a disturbed but dashing teenager trying to escape from the depressing fake reality of his world. The main character Holden Caulfield has much of the typical teenager in him and is still current decades after his creation, but is infinitely more interesting than the &quot;average&quot; teenager because he thinks more, and really cares about his life. Much of his passion is misspent and leads to trouble at school and with friends, but it is easy to sympathize with Holden's desperate confusion, intense affection for an innocent sibling, and even his revulsion towards the phoniness of society. A few things, like his temporary whims and his attraction towards the mysterious Jane, make the book a bit puzzling at times, but overall it's intriguing and definitely humorous reading."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book was a very interesting portrayal of a young mans mind. The author did a good job of explaining things in way of thought. It seems to me that this book is sometime misunderstood, though the meaning lies in the thoughts of the reader. I believe that there is more to this book than meets the eye. Otherwise, it's simply just a book about nothing in particular, which would seem quite usless to me. You see, some believe that the meaning of the Catcher in the Rye is different in different books. This book has been a favorite of almost all serial killers, and the basis for some movies. I belive that there is a reason for that. Couldn't it be that the insane or mentally disturbed see something that the layman can't. Mabey common folks don't look into the depths of this novel. Now, when I first starting reading this book, I wanted to go into it with a open, and deep thinking mind. You must try to be the character to relate with the thoughts, and it actually works!!! If your just starting to read it, try to understand the way Holdens mind works. I believe that it is inevitabel that you'll understand the book, and even give it a meaning of your own."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I really didn't like the book. To me the ending just stoped and it left many questions unanswered. Holdens constant whining and complaining really bugged me, and it drove me nuts how he would always repeat himself over and over again. One part that I liked is when he is at home with Phoebe, and they are in her room dancing to the music. Other then that part, the book didn't interest me that much."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger definitely knows how to capture voice and the whole essence of a character. Catcher in the Rye is a perfect example of this. He must have an excellent imagination to totally develop a character like Holden Caulfield. In the beginning of this book I did not like the main character, Holden. But after awhile I began to realize he wasn't so bad after all. I could not really get in to this american classic,though. Maybe because it was the first stream of conscience book I read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I liked the way the book was written, and how Holden's mind worked. As a teenager around the same age I can relate to some of the topics he discusses. Although, I have never had an experiance like his with Sunny and Maurice. The book was very well rounded, as it should have been being a train of thought. The only thing I didn't like, was that I didn't want the book to end. I wanted to know more. Many people thought that Holden was very brave by wandering around in New York by himself. I on the other hand look at things a little differently. The book was published in the mid to late fourtys. There were many people Holdens age that were out on their own starting a family by his age. Many boys his age were already inlisted in the service and waiting to go to the Korean War. Now days it seems very brave but back then it was really very normal. Over all the book was very interesting and held my attention."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I found this book really well writen. The Athor is a very good writer; But I dont like the life of Holden. I think that most people can relate to the book; But I dont think that I really want, or most people, to know The life of someone and all his problumes.I am sorry if this botheres anyone about this book but I dont feel that people really want to read the problums of someones life. Thanks for reading this bye bye....."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I fear that the difference between an important book and a great book have become distinctly blurred by time, grown old and tired, out of focus, like my own eyes, which don't operate too well without a glass covering.I first read this book in high school. Seems to be a rite of passage. Frankly, considering the language, I'm susprised it was assigned reading, but that's progress for you.My memories of the book were sparse, to say the least. Seems to me I thought it terribly important at the time, but as time and I moved on (frequently in different directions, though he always seemed able to find me when I least wanted him to), the book moved further and further away from me; or, perhaps, I moved further away from it.I decided to re-read it recently. I read it in a single afternoon. Not because it was a page-turner or I felt I couldn't possibly put it down. Mostly because it was so short that I knew I'd be disappointed in myself if I didn't scratch it all out in one day.I came away from it the second time distinctly dissatisfied. Perhaps it was because my station in life had changed. Perhaps it was because I'd just read &quot;Studs Lonigan&quot; immediately beforehand and recognized that &quot;Studs&quot; was so emminently superior. Perhaps I had simply grown older, and, having taken a trip back home to visit old friends, discovered that they had remained the immature brats they'd always been; and I wondered to myself, &quot;Was I like this? Was I this supremely annoying?&quot;&quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; was daring in its frankness and language for its day. It still seems frank, even today. But sheer frankness is not enough to qualify a book as great. &quot;Ulysses&quot; was frank as well, but it was also artfully done, and still prompts debate to this day regarding almost every facet of its text. Is it right to compare &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; to a masterpiece such as &quot;Ulysses&quot;, or, perhaps, other novels such as &quot;Sound and the Fury&quot;, &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; or &quot;Gravity's Rainbow&quot;? Of course, it is; if you want to call a book great, it must be stacked against the greatest. And, stacked against the greatest, &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; falls short.It is an important book in the chronicle of English literature. But it is not great."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Sure, I'm only a teenager, but I honestly stopped reading for awhile. I didn't find it fun anymore. Then my English teacher showed this book to me, and I loved it. I couldn't put it down. My mom would come in my room at midnight wondering why I was still awake, but all I could say was, &quot;I'm reading the best book I have ever read in all of my life.&quot; I could really relate to his growing up and his problems. J.D. Salinger is a great author and I have continued to read his books that never leave me hungry for more."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book in my teens, and just now re-read it 20-plus years later. The only part I remembered from before turns out not to be in the book, to tell you the truth. Hmm... (maybe it was Midnight Cowboy&quot;?). I'm really crazy, the craziest guy.Anyways, this guy Holden Caulfield is a whiney loser prep-school expellee and all, and walks around NYC for a few days complaining about everything and everybody, he really does. Funny that the way the book is written you know, in the sort of phoney realistic manner that some notorious writers use, is pretty good and all, but Holden can't really put together a grammatically correct sentence, although he was supposed to be good at English, at least he didn't fail that at school.Anyway, I did like the book a little - I really did, but I did not much care for Holden or his problems. I suppose this book would have been better in the fifties when it came out. The notorious &quot;cursing&quot; - oh, my! - is tame. Mostly GD this and GD that, and only gets into the F word at the end.I would not recommend it, but I would not keep anyone from reading it. Sort of like Holden, he takes both sides."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"You don't need Cliffs Notes or any other thing other than your own brain to read this and understand what Salinger was saying here. There's a little bit (and a lot also) of Holden Caulfied in each of us. I don't care who you are, or what you do.Salinger writes this with a fresh youthful narrative, both demanding your attention and causing you to think and let out a sigh of pleasure after you've read it. There are funny bits in here, and also serious directions to the mental state of Holden Caulfield.The swearing? Come on people: best said in Stephen King's book, On Writing, where he explains his answer to his own mother's question as to why he had swearing in his writing: because the writing is a direct reflection of 'real' life. A truck driver gets cut off on the highway, almost plowing into another car, he's not going to say, &quot;Oh, darn!&quot; Caulfield'd dialogue is his real dialogue; he's not going to hold anything back.Don't read this for a teacher's book report, not for a creative writing class, but only for the pure intention that J.D. Salinger intended: for the enjoyment of it.5 STAR ESSENTIAL RATING FROM SCRAGGY'S TOMB OF CLASSIC LIT, USA."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Despite widespread fame and popularity, I believe that this novel is quite insignificant and deserves little of the esteem it has thus far been accredited. Holden Caulfield's story is not some inspiring, amazing book, but a simple story about a misguided adolescent. There's nothing more; indeed, it is amazing to know that many consider this a &quot;Great American Novel.&quot; It surely does not deserve such a title, and I must oppose strongly those who inflate the novel's importance to literature."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger's &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; is one of those books that seems to be surrounded by the aura of its own myth and hype. So the question is: does it live up to this hype? After reading it for the first time, I am of the opinion that while &quot;Catcher&quot; doesn't quite live up to its own legend, it is still an engrossing read.&quot;Catcher&quot; tells the story of Holden Caulfield, a troubled young man who has just gotten kicked out of prep school. The novel follows his physical and mental wanderings after leaving the school. Along the way are some interesting glimpses of New York City's sleazy underbelly in the post-World War II years.The copyright page notes that the Little, Brown edition of &quot;Catcher&quot; was originally published in 1951. I imagine that Holden's smoking, drinking, and musings about sex may have been shocking at the time, but it's pretty tame stuff today. Still, I can't help but like a main character who boasts that he's &quot;the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life.&quot;Much of the book seems to be written in a sort of &quot;code.&quot; Little hints along the way indicate that narrator Holden is not being totally honest with us, with himself, or with both--even though on the surface the narrative should be the truth behind the lies he tells to other characters within the story. What is Holden's real unsaid truth? I won't give my interpretation, but will leave that to each reader.In the end, &quot;Catcher&quot; is a classic that still commands our attention. It's an ironic and challenging text that rewards the attentive reader."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I sincerely believe that every teenager should read this book. The Catcher in the Rye is definitely the best book I've ever read. I am sixteen (like the main character) and I mean to read it again after all my friends read it. This review isn't revealing anything about the story. I don't like it when reviews give stuff away about the plot so I'm not going to. Just read it. It really doesn't matter what age you are- you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"After reading a few other reviews, I've decided to comment on this book. First, I would like to start by saying I am a high school English teacher. I have a MA degree in English. I've read more books than most people think they have!One problem with this book, judging by negative reviews, is people tend to read it incorrectly. If you claim, &quot;this is an easy read,&quot; you've missed the boat. There is such a great depth to this book that it is impossible to claim it as an easy read. If you read only the surface and see a snotty-nosed rich kid wondering around bitching about everything, then yes, it is an easy read.But what about the true cause of his feelings towards people? Would you not have the same attitude towards people if you were in Holden's life situation? I mean, his brother has died. His one true friend is now dead. THIS is the cause of his breakdown. Realize that he is telling this story after his breakdown. It is obvious he would have a bitter opinion looking back.How many people did he reach out for help from that let him down? EVERY character in the book was one potential helper in saving Holden. This would include such characters as Sunny and Maurice.If you think this is an &quot;easy read&quot; or not a good book, look me up. I teach it every fall. I'd love to have you sit in for my lectures as we go through the book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Reading \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" was a wonderful experience. It's not that I find myself in his situation at the moment, but I once was in his shoes. Well, sort of. I was once as cynical as he is; intolerable. I hated people and judged them. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to live and suffer Holden's life. I recommend it to the person who being open minded is ready to enter a world full of conflict. This book really deserves all the praise, it is a must read for any person, not just teenagers. As I said before, in one way or another you can easily feel in his shoes. And if not, still you'll have a good time following Holden's chaotic life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"&quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; is a coming of age novel, though not in the usual mold. It is a brilliant and in-depth study of a young man -- Holden Caulfield -- who has just been booted out of his private school. Written in the 1950's, it still rings true today.Holden finds phonies and liars in all the adults and all the characters he runs into.He has an astute gauge of character, and has a way of finding the emptiness in the money-chasing, status-seeking Manhattanites he runs into.&quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; refers to Holden's dream in which he tries to save children from falling into adulthood; he's the catcher who's trying to stop kids from becoming jaded and phony adults. A five-star book.A similar book one might read is the newer novel by one Asher Brauner, &quot;Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf.&quot; It is a brilliant book set in Santa Cruz, California and shows how a jaded, uninvolved young man becomes passionately involved with both a woman and a political cause.Do read &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; if you want to realign your priorities and reinvigorate your sense of joie-de-vivre."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I first read this novel in college. That was forty years ago. Ever since, I have always had a copy of Salinger's novel in my library. I think about it every so often.The difference between this book and other books is the immediacy of the writing. From the famous first sentence, Holden Caulfield talks to you as a real confidant. You are immediately his best friend. He confidies his private thoughts to you without any hesitation as to your relationship to him. There is an unspoken conclusion that he needs you to talk to. And he needs you now.David Copperfield, which opens with that other famous first sentence, addresses you formally. His verbs are properly conjugated. and his diction is polished. David does not get close to you. He tells you his story from the podium.Holden sits right next to you, leans against you, and talks to you. He language is informal and his diction is not so great. You don't care. Suddenly, someone is confiding in you. You want to hear him out.That is why the novel works. Holden immediately accepts you, blemishes and all, as his best friend. He tells you his story even though he just met you. He is a stranger confiding in you.Thomas Hardy tells a good story. He converses plainly and directly to the reader. Dickens addresses the reader. Salinger confides in the reader. This is the immediacy of the novel.That is the difference between this book and the others. We all want to be someone's confidant."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I don't get it. Holden freaks out so bad when he reads that cuss word on the wall in Phoebe's school. And yet, on virtually every page of the book, Holden is cussing! And the bit where he says he's really glad the atomic bomb has been invented... What a gaff! Apart from that, there were some amusing bits. There really were. But come on. It's not that great, people. Try reading 1984 or All Quiet On The Western Front. Get a taste of reality."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I thought that &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; was a good book. I dont understand how people can totally hate it.

Halfway through I found myself thinking &quot;So What!&quot; Overrated..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The storyline of the book is good, but Salinger could have used a better style to write it. He writes about a really weird person who has minority complexes. The book is supposed to be an autobiography, but I think it is exagerated. Salinger uses a poor style, and often swearwords. The book is inapropriate for younger and older people. You should be a teenager to like it and you shouldn't search for any Latinized words. That could be the reason why it wasn't published early in GB in the original version. I liked most of the book (maybe because I'm a teenager) but he often repeats the same sentences. The book has long passages, with few tension, which make it hard to read sometimes. But all besides that it wasn't too bad. It is a great achivement for a 17 year old boy to write a story like that."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I FIRST ATTEMPTED TO READ THIS BOOK WHEN I WAS ABOUT FOURTEEN BUT COULDN'T CONTINUE IT.I WONDRED WHAT THE AUTHOR HAD BEEN ON WHEN HE WROTE THE BOOK.

The main character, Holden Caulfield, is a very good frog because he can mislead everybody he wants to (the three women around thirty in the hotel at New York, for instance). Holden is very independent of people and he can take care of himself very well. I admire him because he has the guts to kid with Stradlater (I would never have challenged that tough guy). This book has a few tiny little bad points: it has to many chapters, to many characters and it's typed so small that's even difficult to read if your eyes are all right. There's more but this you will hear in class.My greetings to you, Mr. Geerinckx,Your pupil of 6MWb,J.Duyck"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"this book wasn't that bad but I'm sure I wouldn't read it again. because we had to read it I finished it otherwise I should have stopped after the first chapter. if you read one page Holden said about 20 times &quot;the damn&quot; and that bothered me a lot. something else I didn't like about the way it was written was that the writer wrote like the way they said it.By example: Ya lost them, Ya mean and sonuvabitch, and that was in a way confusing. the books gets better after the lost chapters when he goes home and spends some time with his sister. the book is easy to read, there are only a few difficult words in it and that's a big advantage. conclusion: I didn't like the book very much."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden's phony. Salinger's eulogy to the non-conformist, no-b.s., see-it-how-it-is prodigy misses the mark. Anyone gifted (even by an author) with Holden's seer-like insight would be capable of cutting the crap without freaking out.Read this book if it's the last thing you do . . . you can put that in my obituary. OUCH"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book because most reviews claim it to be one of the great American classics, though it might be considered a classic, great?...not so much. I read this book when I was 19 and found it to be a painfully endless story of a restlessly rebellious teen who can't stand all the \\"phonies\\" of the world. Page after page, I hoped something of substance and story progression would follow and to my dismay there were none. Just a ridiculously agitated teen who gets kicked out of school for being lazy and decides to venture around New York City, while complaining about as I said \\"all the phonies\\". You can see how this review can seem repetitive, well...so is the book. What I've previously stated is pretty much all you get out of reading it. The only sense of relief you get is when you finally come to the last page and the torture is over."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"\\"The best thing, though, in that museum was that everything always stayed right where it was. Nobody'd move....Nobody'd be different. The only thing that would be different would be you.\\"I love this quote because sometimes I feel the same way that Holden does. Sometimes I wish people would not judge and that people would be more excepting to new or different people.Basically, this book was writeen in the time frame of the 1950s and it is narrarated by the main character, a 16 year old boy, named Holden. Holden gets kicked out of school, again, so instead of going home, he goes to Manhattan and tries to act older than his age and to get into bars, etc... Which is the main conflict of the book, whether or not to connect with adults, part of him feels like he should connect with older people, but he also feels like he should reject the adult world as fake and go back to childhood.When this book was first released there was much controversy because of its language and sexual content. This book relates to Salinger's life in many ways like, Miving fron prep school to prep school, is threatened with military school, and knows older students. I think this book is appealing to people because they can connect with it. Everyone, including me, has felt conflicted between growing up and stayid young at some time in their life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I love to read, so when my high school freshman son was assigned this book as required reading for an honors English class, I decided to read it, too. I was surprised that I had never had a chance to read it in the past, and have been trying to catch up on the \\"classics,\\" so this was a perfect opportunity! After reading it, though, I was pretty disappointed. True, the book is humorous and it kept me engrossed. I do believe that it is more suited to mature readers than high school freshmen or sophomores.It contains adult themes and I am not surprised that many of the teen readers rated this book as poor...you need a lot of insight and an adult sense of perspective in order to take much away from this book.Some others have commented on the language (swearing). This is pervasive throughout the book, but didn't bother me too much. After all, the book is written from the point of view of a 16-year-old, and the language is certainly much milder than what one might hear these days. What bothered me is the situations that the character gets involved in. If you are a parent, I think that you should read this book and think about whether it is something you want your child exposed to at a young age. At the very least, the book requires thoughtful discussion following its reading. Holden finds himself in a hotel where he solicits the services of a prostitute (he does not \\"follow through\\" and learns some sort of a lesson following this incident--I think?). He also drinks alcohol quite a bit, contemplates suicide, and deals with some issues regarding homosexuality and teen sexual activity. In sum, this is the story of a teen who becomes increasingly out of control on his way to a mental breakdown. Not very uplifting."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a great portrayal of the life of a teenager. It goes through a weekend of a seventeen year old boy named Holden Caulfield. This book follows him as he leaves his boarding school and finds a hotel in New York City alone. It explains his encounters with relationships, money, drinking, prostitutes and other teenage conserns. All through this story the author goes into the mind of this teen, explaining what many teenagers have in their minds. I suggest this book to anyone out there. It will bring back memories of your teenage years if they have already past."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye starts off with a pessimistic teenager. He has been kicked out from school many times, and he's going to get kicked out...again. So his rather gloomy story continues on, describing the people near him (and criticizing them bluntly) and describing his two days in New York.This hero's comments about people and places sound like a nasty teenager's whines at first, but there are a lot of points where you can sympathize him. Overall his critiques show a teenager's struggle to live in a harsh world.Of course, there is a lot of swearing - but it actually makes the book more realistic and believable. Also, some say that there is absolutely no plot in the book. There isn't. But here is the magic - even without a plot, Salinger manages to make the reader believe in Holden (the main character) and his world.There is also Phoebe, Holden's younger sister, who is innocent, loving, and kind. She says that she'll come with Holden, when Holden, in his imagination, prepares a journey to some kind of wilderness. Ultimately, Phoebe brings Holden back to reality and casts some light on the morose atmosphere of the book.The Catcher in the Rye is a masterpiece, a must read, whether for teenagers or adults."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A Review of the Catcher in the RyeHave you ever wondered why people should act like this and that? Have you ever felt sick when living in a world of formality? Why should people always be like phonies and not express their true feelings? J. D. Sanlinger used a boy, named Holden Caulfield, to sharply point out the sickness of the society by his keeping swearing in almost all his sentences. Also because the protagonist is a teenager, Holden has truer mind to himself than the adults who only follows the regulations so to achieve a successful career. Frankly speaking, he is merely a boy and he is very rebellious that his sarcastic words leave a big room for readers to ponder upon.The book is about a boy who was just kicked out of his school by flunking all the subjects except English. Because he was so fed up with the people around him and the world, he went to New York for a three-day vacation. In fact, he lived the craziest days of his life in those days. While in New York, he met his old friends and his young sister. Many of them depressed him and made him felt like to cry. With his journey went on, he developed an idea to be the catcher in the rye, the one who leads people back to the right direction of life. And he did. Not in the fictional world, but in the real world to the readers.This book is a page-turner, but never a fast-read joyous book. It tells the reality in a sad way. Sometimes it is too sharp to make the reader making a reflection right at the moment. Personally, I felt sick of myself when I read some particular parts of the book. In this book, Holden keeps criticizing the fakeness and weakness of humanity such as being phony or corny, shooting craps and so on. He feels that he is so lonely, but senses that he cannot live alone so that he keeps calling his friends even if they are the ones that he considers as phonies. This is one of the saddest things in the world. No one really jumps out of the world or the society and no one can really be alone. There is an unwritten rule, the laws of nature or humanity, which human beings or other creatures must follow. Even if many of they know something is not right or vicious, they do it anyway for the advantages of it or something else.This book is highly recommended to read. The readers can judge the reality Holden swearing about to adjust their attitudes toward the world. Just like Holden who did not leave for West, we stay in the world of reality by finding a decent way to live on that the catcher in the rye direct us."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Odd, rather than reading this for personal enrichment, my incentive was to find out why so many movies (such as \\"The Conspiracy Theory\\" and \\"The Good Girl\\") reference \\"the Catcher in the Rye\\" and why Mark Chapman had on his person when he assassinated John Lennon.The Catcher in the Rye (a cynical 16 year old Holden Caulfield) superficially, is a narrative of a few days in the life of a boy who has just been expelled from prep school. The book describes Holden's thoughts and activities over these few days, during which he describes a developing nervous breakdown. This is an easy read, though not comfortable as the elements operating within Caulfield which lead to the psychological collapse are, frighteningly, within us. This novel is fascinating: when we identify with Caulfield we realize the difference between psychological collapse and normality is not that great. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"...and it only took five years!Amazingly enough, I haven't read this book since 10th grade. And back then, I absolutely loathed it. Maybe because my teacher kept insisting to me that it was about \\"how society has moved away from spiritualism\\", which I just wasn't buying. At the time, I thought it was just about some whiny kid who hated absolutely EVERYTHING.It took five years, but I FINALLY get it. Holden's favorite thing to think was that people are phony. Well, guess what? People ARE phony. The book may not be about society moving away from spiritualism, but it is about society, and how hypocritical it is. For me, the brilliance of this book is that Salinger had the balls to write it in the first place. Through Holden he stood up and told society exactly what he thinks about it. Three cheers for Salinger!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"If you like hidden humor, sarcasm, and negativity then you'll love The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger. It is about a troubled boy named Holden Caulfield who had gotten kicked out of bording school. He had gotten kicked out of numerous schools before this, so he knew his parents would be pretty mad at him. Most of the book is about Holden's travel back to his house in New York City from his bording school in Pennsylvania. You learn a lot about him on his travel home. You learn his thoughts and outlooks on life, god, and society. I like this book because I enjoy hearing people's opinion on things like life and society. Sometimes Holden gets off topic when he is talking to you. If you don't like when people do this, then you shouldn't read this book because he does it a lot. That is the only bad thing about this book, and I suggest you read it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"There are two types of people that read The Catcher in the Rye. Those who fall in love with it, lauding it as one of the greatest books of all time, and those who deem is as messy garbage: the thoughts of an ugly character whom they had no interest in, much less want to read a book of his whining.I enjoyed The Catcher in the Rye. I found much truth in it; everyone knows a Holden Caulfield, and Salinger nailed the personality. Some passages I would read and think, &quot;That is so true! That is a true piece of thought!&quot; Too often novelists will have their characters speak to a plot, rather than actually have human attributes. Holden Caulfield comes to life in the book.Although I enjoyed the book and appreciated Salinger's truthful writing, it is not a work of literary genius, much less of the best books I have read. It's mildly contemporary, which can be forgiven. But the main quib I had with the book is that Salinger held to the one personality and ran with it too long. In making Holden come to life, he also ran it to the ground, making him flat. Salinger tried to undo this near the end, but I think it was weak writing.All in all, a great book with many truths, but not a complete portrait of a human. Perhaps only the greats, such as Joyce, can write as such, but isn't that what the 5 stars are for?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is perfect if you're a screwed up 14 year old guy who was born to stand out. It's actually perfect for anyone who's ever felt frustrated. Holden Caulfield is one of my role models. This book is addicting. I'm reading it for the second time. I read more advanced books then most people my age, some people (A lot of people) in my school still read those Fear Street books by R.L. Stine..That isn't even close to perfection.This book starts out with a troubled, angry 17 year old boy named Holden Caulfield, who is writing some sort of an autobiography, but it's not a whole autobiography like he says on the first page. He just got kicked out of Pencey, a prep school in Pennsylvania.He goes back to his home in New York, and has quite an adventure.THis is one of the best books that will ever be written. Everyone should read it, because everyone can relate to it. I relate to Holden so much, I've started talking like him now too, that's how this book is. It's influencial.READ IT!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"As I was reading this book I was thinking \\"Holden Caulfield is such a jerk! He's disrespectful to elders, he's blasphemous, he can't see past the end of his nose, and he's an aimless kid who's heading nowhere fast.\\"But guess what? That describes me when I was a kid! In fact, it describes a huge percentage of America! And it also describes a big percentage of American youth. J.D Salinger caught lightening in a bottle with this timeless, classic look at American teen angst. Based on the way the story is told, it could have been written at any time during the 20th century, and it still speaks to us today. Because of all the swearing and the potty mouth thinking of the book's central figure, I', not sure I would recommend this for a high school class, but it would make for a good book for a college class and something that every one who cares about timeless lit should read.I should also say that as frustrating as it is to get inside the mind of Holden Caulfield, I came away from the book with a sense of hope, that maybe the kid won't be a schmuck for the rest of his life after all. In that sense, when I see Holden Caulfield, I see myself."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Upon the notice of the authors death, realized I had never read it.

Holden Caulfield, the protagonist, uses a lot of profanity and rough language, and gets himself into some situations, such has having a prostitute in his hotel room, that many parents would find objectionable.But many of us know someone like Holden Caulfield, or maybe we are even a bit like him ourselves, or perhaps we used to be; someone who is like a porcupine that wonders why people don't get close to him.I'm not sure why I waited so long to get around to reading this book that some of my friends have called one of their favorites. It was only after reading Salinger's \\"Franny and Zooey\\" recently that several urged me to read \\"Catcher.\\" All I can say is that I'm glad I did.I read this book on two sittings, something that is very rare for me. I couldn't put it down. I wanted to find out what situation Holden was going to get himself into next, all within the two-day period after getting kicked out of yet another boarding school.Holden Caufield is a pathetic mess at 16 years old. Not only does he swear a lot, he insults the people he wants to be with, he smokes excessively, drinks excessively when he can, pretends to be something he's not (but calls everyone else \\"phonies\\"), all while he is grieving the death of his younger brother and at the same time missing his older brother who has gone to be a screenwriter in Hollywood.His little sister, Phoebe, describes the situation accurately when she tells him, \\"You don't like anything that is happening.\\"Yes, I think we all know someone like that. Which is why this book is so appealing after all these years.While there is no conclusive resolution to Holden's situation, there is enough wisdom near the end of the book from his little sister, as well as from a former teacher, to make the book redemptive on many levels."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a brilliant excursion into the mind of a n American teenager and holds up even to this day as one of the definitive examples of teenage life in the United States. J.D. Salinger writes a character that comes across as a natural, challenged individual who teenagers can relate to when they are reading his words. That is the style of a brilliant writer.The book has often come under scrutiny due to its reputation as the most banned book in the USA's schooling system EVER...Ironically it is also the most taught, and discussed book in the United States schooling system. That is the thing about The Catcher in the Rye. Some people are not ready to read this example of how the male-teenage mind operates during this trying period of human development, or they only wish to deny its truth.What makes Holden a likable character is that he embodies the fear of growing up that exists in every teenager, whether they're willing to admit it or not. Holden's only difference that separates him from most teens is how frantically he tries to PREVENT himself and those around him from growing up. The character allows teens to recognize how trying the American transition into adulthood really is. You see in most cultures you have a trial or ritual and then BOOM! you're an adult whether you like it or not. The Catcher in the Rye shows how that in the American culture we basically have an 8-10 year long period where we are WAITING to grow-up.J.D. Salinger brings to our eyes how very stressful this time is for teenagers and how difficult it can be to accept growing up. What makes this book memorable is no its characters or its story, but instead it is what it represents and that is the American Teen experience."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It is scary how similar I am to Holden Caulfield. Reading this book opened my eyes up to the fact that sometimes you don't know what you want to do and you just have to do something sometimes, to find out what it is you want to do. Try out a hundred things, and if they don't work out, you haven't failed. I heard a great quote once. \\"I haven't failed, I've just found 100 ways not to do something.\\""},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had bought this book to read on my trip to Costa Rica.

It has helped me greatly. At the time I first read the book thte weight of the hypocracy I saw around me was staggering, and I was struggling to fight off an impending nervous breakdown. Im a saved person because of this book. Thank you JD Salinger, wherever you are...."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"In reaction to other reader's comments I must comment how amazing it is that someone can read a book and not understand it. What Salinger does with &quot;Catcher&quot; is create a teen-ager who is in a state in his life where he doesn't understand what's going on around him and that he loves people so much, he hates them. How hard is it to understand people? Well, I guess the reactions people have to this novel is a great way to find-out what their insights are on others.... Take &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; with a grain of salt and take Salinger with some bourbon. Forget about the freaky old man and listen to what he has to say. There was a lot of insight in his head.

Well this book is exactly that. This book read's like teenager's act and speak in today's schools and in society. Salinger made me wonder if the life of a teenager has changed any from the 50's to now. This book has a lot of profanity, but as I look at it, using profanity helps me express my anger. Although it may not be the best way to deal with anger, I understand the need for it at times. Salinger tries to make this book realistic, which he does a good job doing. It's a book that all teenagers can relate to."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I don't really understand how people can so quickly dismiss this book! Holden experienced the same troubles and feelings that teenagers today have, so the book really is timeless. The feeling of wanting to save the world and be &quot;the catcher&quot; is felt by so many, yet those who don't feel it will never understand it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The points of view delineated in Catcher In The Rye, A Separate Peace, and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest utilized unique methods of expressing the events and characters in the novels. Holden reflected upon his escapades through his clouded, obstructed outlook on the events which took place during adolescence. Gene Forrester reminisced, also in the first person, about the trials and tribulations of his high school relationships. An outsider, looking in upon the daily shenanigans of Randall McMurphy in a psychiatric ward of an urban hospital, told the third literary work from omniscient third person point of view. Thus, the way an author expressed point of view was crucial to the understanding of the characteristics of the protagonist, the way he related to others, and the main character's developmental maturity at the end of the work. The similitude of the protagonists' traits in these three literary works was strikingly synonymous although they were told from dissimilar viewpoints. Salinger allowed Holden's sub-conscious and conscious thoughts to permeate his pages while keeping the interference between thought and reality a distinct dichotomy. Holden's reactions to adversity also illustrated his strengths and weaknesses in dealing with his peers. Holden was an introvert, except in confrontations, where he would turn into a verbose, overzealous authority on the topic at hand. Holden responded with rage when his roommate denounced the quality of an essay he had written. &quot;What the hell's the difference if it's about a baseball glove?&quot; (Catcher p. 41) He then proceeded to tear up hours of hard work due to frustration. Randall McMurphy's eccentric attitudes and constant rebellions were demonstrated by Kesey's narrator in a purely physical form. We were unaware of the psychological processes occurring in his mind. McMurphy was thought to be lacking full faculty and reasoning, but perhaps had the story been told in first person, we could have gained a better understanding of his modus operandi and motivations for his idiosyncratic actions. Gene's value system established by Knowles was disclosed by Gene himself. We would not have been able to understand Gene's deranged, ulterior motives, had it not been for Gene telling the story. His irrational actions and lack of remorse obviated any other narrative interpretations. All three protagonists had outspoken personalities and were determined to use their forceful volition to have their way at all costs. The level on which each protagonist related to his peers was evidenced by conversation, physical interaction, and thoughts of the characters. Holden's superior attitude isolated himself from his peers. He felt all people with common activities such as sports or seeing movies were phony. Holden's words epitomized his negative thoughts of humanity while trotting down Pencey's dormitory hallway during his final departure. &quot;Sleep tight, ya morons!&quot; (Catcher p. 52) It was McMurphy's solitary goal to have Chief assimilate into the social circles of the psychiatry ward. &quot;C'mon Chief, take the ball, take the ball, c'mon!&quot; (Cuckoo's Nest p. unknown) Randall could be heard encouraging his companions during exercise time. He tried to better the lives of his fellow patients by exposing them to the ways of the world during card games and basketball matches he organized. McMurphy was all for conformation, but unfortunately, this belief clashed with the rules of the hospital. He rallied his peers voices together in a biased attempt to further his own desires. A fishing expedition involving the entire company of deranged men was organized and executed under the authority McMurphy bestowed upon himself. Unlike Holden, McMurphy was a social extrovert, always including others in his adventures. No thoughts of McMurphy were expressed due to the third person viewpoint of the novel. Phineas and Gene were best friends. Gene was always cordial to his teachers and other students. The deep boyhood bond between these two compatriots was demonstrated by their frequent outings to the river, beach, and late-night activities. Gene's jealousy of Finny's athletic abilities overtook his psyche and he was compelled to put a damper on them by causing Finny to break his leg. After this event, Gene became more and more isolated and began his incorrigible lying spree. During an interrogation by his peers in the smoke room, Finny was heard fibbing, &quot;Yes, huh, yes there was a small, a little contretemps at the tree.&quot; (Separate Peace p. 82) Gene's thoughts were of truth and justice, but his actions rarely vindicated them. In order to understand a character's relationships with others, we must first be able to rationalize their thoughts and belief system and put them into the environment in which the character reacts with others. The maturity and worldly knowledge each character gained as a result of their experiences are portrayed in a variety of ways. Caulfield's acceptance of rules and consequences demonstrated his growth in maturity. The realization he came to at the end of his escapades was that one's family is always there for one, no matter what trouble one is in. During strolls in Central Park, and long, lonesome nights, the truth of Holden's heartache and cover-up came to the surface. Had this novel been written in third person, our insight into Holden's aspirations would have been solely based upon his limited conversations with his sister. The acceptance and mutual respect of Nurse Ratched surfaced during the end of McMurphy's life. Randall's actions indicated his acceptance of his fate and of others' conditions. McMurphy voiced his concerns to Chief, and through those conversations, we learned of his adult like maturity. Both Holden and Randall used their life experiences as basis for future decisions. Gene, unlike the former protagonists, started out with a great deal of knowledge. His maturity level atrophied and he continued to partake in the same childish activities such as cutting class and teasing as he did in years past. As expressed in first person during Gene's inner struggles, he did show emotional maturity and remorse for actions he had completed. Each character seemed to grow and develop in stages, as we learned through their dialogue, actions, and thoughts. Therefore, the portrayal of the characteristics of the protagonist, his relation to other characters, and the main character's developmental maturity defend the fact that point of view was essential to the understanding of Catcher In The Rye, A Separate Peace, and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. Qualities shared by the three protagonists were portrayed differently, however the message remained the same. Some other habits they had in common were smoking and the love to be challenged and debated. Holden, Gene, and Randall all confided in someone, although they expressed their companionship in distinctive ways customary to their individual personality. The stages of maturity each protagonist reached as a direct result of their interaction with others demonstrated emotional and psychological growth. There are various ways to portray key elements in literary works, but one must take into consideration that each point of view has its specific benefits and drawbacks."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Its just an awesome boo"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book when I was 16 or 17, and felt that Holden was articulating everything I was feeling.

Salinger's book is amazing in the sense that it moves you and influences you beyond your evening reading. That is, you find yourself almost tormented by his internal thoughts and may even find, as I have found, a change in your everyday language and internal thoughts.

The book acts from a teenager called Holden Caulfield. When he gets kicked out of his school, Pencey, he goes to New York where he meets some friends, his sister Phoebe and collects new experiences (e.g. with a prostitute). The book is dominated by Holden's ideas which lead him in some problems. He's a very emotional guy who likes thinking about things which happened to him.These very often happening scenes make the book pretty boring.Holden also often thinks that other guys are &quot;phony&quot; but for me, he's the most &quot;phony&quot; person in the book. This book is good written, but more something for real bookworms, than for guys who just want some easy-and -nice-to-read-book. It makes no sence just reading the book, but as a school-lecture, where you discuss about the character and the feelings and Holden and the deeper meenings of his some sta! tements, it's good."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm a young man from Italy and I read this book with a teacher and some other guys. I think that this book it is not very difficult. Usually I don't read too much and somethimes I don't understand some strange words, but our teacher says us what do they mean. I think that it is a nice book, but a little boring, that everyone can read and understand. The part that I prefer is when Holden comes back home and speaks to his sister Phoebe. Holden with his book can enjoy guys with different age"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I think it is a book that at first glance is easy to read and understand. Although it might seem a simple story without a hard argument if you concentrate in his feelings and become Holden while you are reading it, it is full of sense. As an anecdote I have to say that I started reading it in Spanish, a year ago, and I stopped because I didn't like it. Now, my teacher has made me read it and I have enjoyed it a lot. I think Holden represents all teenagers who are confused,happy and sad at the same time, and who think too much about everything."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I think it is a book that at first glance is easy to read and understand.

It is a book that is easily related to, the characters are very engaging and you tend to become a very crucial third party to the story itself. Recommended for all of you who need to look back at the world in a very different way."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read &quot;Catcher In The Rye&quot; last year, and I thought it was excellent. J.D Salinger really has a way of telling a story through the eyes of a cynical, sensitive and lost adolescent. Holden Caulfield, the main character, is fascinating as he explains, describes and reflects upon the things in his life. Although the story only spans over a couple of days, by the end you feel you know everything about Holden and his life. Being an adolescent, I identified with Holden a lot, his story was almost too real. &quot;Catcher In The Rye&quot; is full of brilliantly written dialogue and descriptions, it mirrors the thoughts and feelings of adolescents perfectly. A funny, thoughtful and touching masterpiece."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I couldn't put this book down. When I had forgotten parts in the book several years later, I reread it. Holden, confused and disillusioned, is a deep feeling character and quite mature for his age. This book is such a quick read that you need to reread it several times to really get enought out of it. Each time I read it, I find something I missed and there is deeper meaning the more you read it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is about a boy who seems to always get the short end of the stick, usually because he brings it upon himself. That is the way I am now a days, so reading about Holden kind of made me think for a while of how I can change to not be a phonie. But what's funny about the book is that Holden should have taken his own advice, because in my opinion he was the biggest phonie in the book. clever how Salinger does this by making Holden think he is so head strong. Also I can relate to this book, what Holden felt at one time I also felt that way at one point, I've been through some of the difficulties Holden has been through and this story doesn't explain it any better. Holden may have been a phonie but he still was a good kid who didn't mean any harm. It was a pleasure to read this book. END"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a great story of a teenager who has to face the world after he is thrown of of prep school. It is really funny and, as a teenager, very easy to relate to. This is a must-read for anyone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"No doubt that this book has had a tremendous effect on me. It was the first book I ever read that wasn't either a mindless bestseller or a boring victorian novel. It is as brilliant now as it ever was. A masterpiece in every sense of the word."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is in fact my most favorite book, ever. Salinger is the greatest writer of all time, and this book proves it. If you want to read a book that wont slow down, will keep you interested, and doesn't try and act all &quot;formal,&quot; then this book is for you. I am 16, and read this book at the suggestion of my dad. I put it off, but when I started, it was about the only book I have ever read for pleasure. If you want to read a book that you will finish and say, &quot;i can totally relate to this book,&quot; than read it! I wouldnt normally write a review, but in this case, I feel that everyone should read this classic. You won't walk away a murderer as people say, if you do, your problems aren't coming from this book...."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is the story of a young, depressed, and emotionally exhausted Holden Caulfield. Holden is sickened by most of the things he encounters in the world around him. The ironic part is that Holden condemns all the things in the world that he himself is a part. His hatred of &quot;phoniness&quot; is a recurring theme in the book yet he is the most &quot;phony&quot; character."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Or maybe you are a troubled teen right now. In any case, this is the book for anyone who is in or has experienced a childhood that you didn't think was happy happy joy joy (which should be about everybody). This book takes you into the life of Holden Caulfield, a troubled 14 or 15 y/o boy (some may call him a cynic) in the 1950s who got kicked out of a school he didnt like and is fighting the world of conformity and \\"phonies\\". Just because this book was written in the 50s does not mean that it doesnt apply to modern life because it does, we may have experienced some of the situations he has and can relate to it. He says everything in this book that you're afraid to say complete with profanity (the profanity isn't all that bad, its nothing all of us havent heard already) and it's even bold enough to address sex and they way we feel about it at this age.It's my favorite book of all time because of how open and true it is. It has many themes and symbols and it's just great to read again and again. You will not regret buying this book because it is a must read for EVERYONE!!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The name Holden Caulfield is synonimous with Revolting youth and a desire to break off from authorities grip. This book is one of my personal favorites of all time. It gives us all an alternative view. It causes me to think about the choices I do have in my boring little life. The options are limitless and without rules. To me that is powerfull."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"As I started to read this novel, The Catcher in the Rye, I did not like it. There was no point to the novel. Nothing made sense, but as I kept reading this novel I liked it. This book represents many teenagers like what they go through, how they live with others, what they think about others. This book is perfect, because it makes you think that you are Holden, you know his feelings, and Holden lets you everything in details.The way that Holden talks may offend many people because it uses profanity, but it represents who he is and lets us know the he is depress, he does not uses profanity like goddamn to feel cool, its to lets us know that he is depress after his brothers death and being kicked out of school.I will be sixteen soon, and I just finished reading the book, and I think that this book resembles lots of teenagers. Irresponsibility, arrogance, laziness are just things that represents us like teenagers.One thing I know for sure is that if one day this book makes its first movie, it will be a great movie, and I know I will be there to watch it. This novel is the greatest book I ever read in my life, I even think that is even better than To Kill a Mockingbird, because this novel does not take to deep into the book, it does not describes everything as it does in The Catcher in the Rye. That is what makes this novel really good, it makes you feel as Holden from the beginning to the end. Other thing for sure I know I will do is to recommend this book who is a teenager to make them realize who they are."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I thought ,The Catcher in the Rye, is one of the best books ever written. I read this for my English class and I was able to relate to Holden in one way or another. He is the one of the greattest characters in literature composed. If you are lost or just feel like this world owes you something, you'll love this book. Holden tells it like it is, it's beautiful. And I'm 16 years old so I know what I am talking about, and I hate it when old people tell you what to read but this is good. I know I'm babbling so I'll end it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This famous book has captured many hearts especially young ones because its is so realistic and satisifies what you expect out of a struggling teen's life with a lot of insight. It is easy to compare to the main character because it clicks after every chapter the message and humor. It is funny in all the right places and random too, but it is also filled with expressions. This great book should be on anyone's read list."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm not going to write a book report. I'm just writing for the purpose of a review- to tell you my opinion. This book sets itself apart from all other books in one special way- it's real. No, I'm not saying it's non-fiction. If J.D. Salinger says it's fiction, it is. I'm telling you the emotions are real. The personalities are real, and the situations are real. Everyone at one point in their life has felt themselves caught in a downward spiral, that they can't get out of. Everyone has lost motivation for life, and has felt lost and without a purpose. Salinger took these emotions everyone experiences and put them in a book. And the result is a book that will in one way or another have and impact on your life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book for my AP English class, and I don't see what all the hype is about. Holden's narration thorughout the novel was like 200 pgs of rambling cynicism and skepticism. Grant it, the dialect was very believeable, but the novel lacked a real plot and I found it too be quite monotonous for the most part. The entire novel, in the form of a flashback and filled with many insignificant digressions, was really just an adolescent constantly rambling who is obvious a very emotionally and psychologically disturbed person. I do feel, however, that this book does have some purpose in that there are many teens on the brink of adulthood that need something like this to relate to, and not feel the isolation and alienation that Holden did. Salinger writes very realistically, and depending on the type of person you are, there's a great deal to be taken from this novel."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I first read this book when I was in eighth grade. My boyfriend had recommended it to me. I asked my parents to get me a copy, and they seemed impressed, telling me how it was such a great book. I started reading it and I loved it instantly.I took it to school as I continued reading. My English teacher noticed this. He walked up to me and said, &quot;The Catcher in the Rye? Excellent book. Excellent.&quot; Next period, my science teacher talked to me about how she loved it too. After all of this, I finally was able to finish reading it within one day. I'm usually a slow reader unless I really love the book, and I did.The next day, my English teacher and his friend, another English teacher, talked to me about the book. The other English teacher began telling me how he first read it when he was 18 and that it was the best book in the world. He told me he really wished he could teach it in school, but the kids were just too immature for that.I must agree - this book is not for kids. I see some people think this is just a plotless book filled with cussing. That is not true. This book is quite beautiful, actually.. it teaches you about life, growing up, relationships, change, and mostly, the transition from childhood to adulthood. Salinger does a great job giving Holden the personality of a teenager, one that we all can relate to, somehow. This book isn't like others.. I mean, whose mind is on the same subject all the time? If you ask me, that's rather phony. Holden tells it like it is and has rather amusing thoughts. He's also a loveable, admirable character in many ways, such as how no means no to him and how he wants to save children. Just read it. It will change the way you see everything."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Salinger's Catcher in the Rye is without a doubt one of the finest modern classics of the 20th century. Anyone, and I mean anyone, male or female, or whatever ethnic background, can empathize (though not necessarily sympathize) with Holden's struggles of late adolescence: identity, the shapeless future, sexuality, all set against a backdrop of the spinning confusion that is the teenage experience. The only qualm I have about this book, albeit a small one, is that some of the language and time-specific instances that Salinger uses (plays, movies, locations) date an otherwise timeless piece. Some of the dialogue (esp. the ones with his sister) are pure brilliance. It is a real shame that this book is still banned by many high schools across the United States, for its alleged &quot;bad influences&quot;. Yet, if this book was taught to more angry, outcast teens, it would do much more to heal... than to harm. Just my two cents..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye was by far the best book I have ever read!!! It is an excellent story for a teenager to read for a school project! Teenagers love this hilarious book! It makes you feel like it was made for you to enjoy personally, like J. D. Salinger made this book for your sense of humor or he knew that you would love to read this book! Holden Caulfield is truly a &quot;madman&quot;. The only thing I didn't like about the book was that it ended too soon! I wish the author would come out with a sequel to the story!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"An important aspect of &quot;the Catcher in the Rye&quot; was that I was able to identify with the main character, Haulden. &quot;Indentify&quot;, I feel is not strong enough a word, I was able to &quot;get inside&quot; his head, to plan his next move, to consider what he was considering. I fell in love with the style of writing of Sallinger's; an author doesn't do that too often now, they never take a chance such as that. The book made me cry at points, and made me think about life, and priorities. Simply put, this is an amazing book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Being an avid teenage reader, which is a real rarity these days, I told my mother to buy me some &quot;classic books&quot; for my birthday. When the day came to open up my presents, I immediately went for the books eagerly wondering what my mother has gotten me. I flip through the books quickly reading the names as I go along, &quot;Lord of the Flies....The Great Gatsby....The Catcher in the Rye...&quot;. The last title particulary sparked my interest since I read a newspaper article recently that mentioned the book. That night I started to read it... and I just couldn't stop! By the time I was finished I felt that I knew Holden Caulfield personally. His perspective on life made me think a little more about what's going on in this world. This is a classic book that ANYONE could get into, especially teens. It doesn't get frusterating to read at all (unless you really hate the mild swearing). I've read this book through about 6 times now and I'm still laughing, smiling, and having a great time reading it. This book is a must for most people. If you're really touchy about the swearing, stay away! It's a masterpiece though, J.D. Salinger simply outdid himself."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"When I read this book I felt as if I was reading about myself.

Probablyy one a week, if you want to know the truth. But I hate reading things that one is &quot;supposed&quot; to read. As such, I have missed out on this gem for too many years. Isn't that ironical. I think I shall go read it again now, if I am in the mood.Stop reading reviews... We have nothing to say.. JUST READ THE BOOK!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is hilarious. I have just started reading. Thought I should read what they call classics. This one is the best so far. It takes me back to when I was that age. I was a know it all just like old Holden, and disgusted with most of the world too. I don't understand anyone giving this book a one star review, but they should learn to spell. That really gets me when these phonies who think they are smart and all give a book a bad review and can't even spell. Anyway it's a great book, you will understand this review a little better after you read it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone who is a child at heart, or who wants to discover how an adolesents mind works. The brilliant description of the hell that Holden went through before he realised what he needed to do in life will strike a chord with many people. The book gets to the core of what typically goes through the minds of the average teenager, and what he or she should realise needs to be done in order to be successfull."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I first read this book two years ago when I was still in high school. Since then I've read it about twenty times and I just never get bored with it. Several authors over the years have tried to duplicate this milestone in American literature, but none have been comparable to Salinger. Close matches in the same genre are such novels as FAR FROM NOWHERE, GENERATION X, and BRIGHT LIGHTS BIG CITY, but CATCHER is still the best."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Once a year, during the summertime, I read this book. This ritual has gone on for five years now, and I cant wait to read it again. I feel his solitude and despair with society. I find it quite atmospheric, especially when he hits new york.

It is a really easy read and I enjoy every second of it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"when i was 13 and going through a bout of depression, my father recommended reading Catcher. it was a rite of passage for him and it was even more important to me. at a time when i felt that no one could understand, and that everyone was wearing a mask, here was a book that gave me a character to identify with. Holden Caulfield: at once apathetic and also highly motivated; anti-social and misanthropic and yet fanatic about social rituals-- an adolescent troubled, yet intelligent. reading about Holden's journey through New York City made me realize that much of adolesence is the same now as it was then."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Never had i read such a book like The Catcher in the Rye. I suggest it to anyone that is looking for something different. It takes you through the main characters life. He is very witty and blunt (straight forward).

Tired of buying books on the bestseller list and then wondering how they got there? Fear not, for there's always Salinger's &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; to keep you afloat.Wry wit, humor, psychological darkness lurking underneath, and a bevy of insight, you simply can't go wrong with this one. My classes all have read it, and they must have excellent taste as they keep coming back for my lectures!A fine American classic."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Every single guy in the world needs to read this book. I'd like to give reasons why, but frankly there is no reason, you just have to read it. You'll understand why when you're done. I read this when i was 16 years old, against my parents wishes, and couldn't put it down. The book captured me, it enthrolled me to the point where i knew this was a life changing book. In my opinion if you read no other book you wouldn't be missing much. This is THE essential book. The observations are relatable, and you can relate to this adolescent, Holden Caulfield. Please read the Greatest Book Ever. Thank You"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"When I first turned the pages of this great book, I really did not know what to think of it. Was it sad? Depressing? A little too oriented towards the deep, melancholy areas to life? But, after the first few chapters, I began to realise how applicable and realistic this book really is. The novel features Holden Caulfield, a teenager who is depressed due to the death of his brother, and his moving through different schools. Though he is not exceedingly bright, and very critical of other people, he is a very sensitive, emotional boy, and many a time would a reader feel moved, and sorry for Caulfield. I will give this book four stars, merely for the fantastic account of his teenage life, and the emotions that are brought towards the end of this fantastic novel. Please, if you haven't done so already, have a look at it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I cannot Imagine how anyone could give this book a rating of less than four stars. The book makes an impact on those who read it closely, analyzing it. This book is so important that most high school students are required to read it before graduating. Holden does not &quot;hate everybody&quot; as one reviewer writes. Holden is a teen struggling with the fact that he must leave childhood behind and enter the adult world which he finds is not all it's cracked up to be. Every person who reads this book should be able to relate to Holden and his struggle. Holden Loves his sister, Phoebe. She is a major character in the book. The Catcher in the Rye should be read by every person and thouroughly analyzed before judging it. As with all great works of literature, an element exists beyond the entertaiing aspect of the novel, that element is the meaningfull aspect, the feeling left with us after we finish the novel and stays with us for the rest of our lives"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"One of the most depressingly honest books I've ever read. You can read it any time at any age and still feel emotionally involved in Holden's adolescent decline. Salinger is a really human writer whose writing style is crystal clear. Everything that is pure in humanity is in this book. In a world that becomes more and more alienating and stifling as you grow older, Holden seems to be a real symbol of why growing up is not such a great idea. If you want a desperately funny book this is the one for you."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is a wonderful portrayal of teenage life. The way in which Salinger shows Holden Caulfield going through depression is phenomonal. The things I truly liked about the book was the accuracy of teenage bitterness toward the world. This bitterness is shown by Caulfield's sarcastic views on his school and his surroundings. The phoniness in Caulfield's life and his hypocritical outbursts of phoniness in an effort to be happy as his peers are truly makes a connection to teens everywhere. The way which Caulfield views things that are happening in his life really makes you feel for Caulfield while also almost coming to hate him. Caulfield's character deals with a self caused anger at the world and needs to somehow get over it. He seems to point out everything that is wrong with the world and nothing that is right. Caulfield goes through a list of girlfriends who almost none he truly seems to like. He also seemingly has no friends with the exception of a younger sister who seems to connect to him while also noticing that his depression is caused within himself. Caulfield seems to know this throughout the novel and his actions speak loudly about the way he feels. THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is an absolute must read for teens everywhere. I do not read much but this is a book that I truly felt I connected with and I am truly happy that I picked this book up off of the shelf. Also read MY LIFE and DRESS YOUR FAMILY by David Sedaris"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Coming of age novels abound--there's one on every corner. And they take any and every form known to man. Huckleberry Finn, Of Human Bondage, To Kill a Mockingbird, and The Bark of the Dogwood are just a few. But the classic one has to be CATCHER IN THE RYE with its simplicity, its straightforward writing, its humor, and ultimately its loss of innocence. Yes, the book is touching and sad in places too--there's a sense that Holden might not come out of things (past the point where the books ends) all in one piece, emotionally speaking. Yet Salinger also gives us hope for the future. That's the brilliance of this book; it's so perfect in its form and weight that it feels like the classic that it is.CATCHER IN THE RYE is one of those books that MUST be read. If you haven't yet, you're really missing an unusual experience. If you have already read it, another shot at this great American classic wouldn't hurt."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is just a great book, excellent for everybody to read even if you do not like to.

It is just one of those books everybody has to read.Wonderful.Must Read......"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I was required to read The Catcher in the Rye for school and I must say that it was my favorite book that we read all year. Holden, the main character, is a cynical teenager and the book is about his &quot;adventures&quot; after getting kicked out of school. I really liked the way the book was written. It uses slang and cuss words just how it would be like if Holden was actually telling you his story. The plot is very exciting and makes you want to keep reading to find out what happens. It is a fabulous book that I would recommend to any teenager or adult."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Sallinger?s book, Catcher in the Rye is a well known book made famous by the movie Conspiracy Theory and the assassin of John Lennon. The book is a must read because of its historical significance, but don?t expect an interesting story. The book is almost exclusively about the main character, Holden Caulfield who is dealing with life between childhood and adulthood. I think Holden is a great representation of humanity in general- never being satisfied with anything, and being unable to deal with life. While reading of Holden, I found myself despising him and the immaturity that he displays in life. But really, much of what I despised in Holden are things that I hold in my own life.How about a sequel? Holden meets the 21st century. That would be interesting."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"in a period of 3 days, holden was able to express every emotion that i feel. is there anything else to be said?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book explores the feelings of a young, cynical teenager who is struggling with understanding the world as he grows into adulthood. He is kicked out of many prep schools, and really has no sense of belonging anywhere. He gets away from school and travels to New York City to try to figure out what he wants to do, and how he will accomplish his tasks.The Catcher in the Rye is one of those books that a person will either think is a great read, or a bunch of unimportant events that ultimately lead to nothing. To truly understand the book, a reader must do a little outside thinking on what is being said, rather than just read and wait for things to be explained. One must admire the writing style of Salinger in this book, even if they do not care for the story. Salinger writes The Catcher as if straight from the mouth of a teenage boy in the 1940's-50's. He keeps this idea the entire book, and as I was reading I felt like a friend was relaying his thoughts to me, just as he would say, and not worrying about being literarily correct. (Although all/most of it is) Basically, if you like to see the world from a completely different point of view, if you can get into a book that does not have so much action or explosions, and if you have ever been a teenager trying to understand who you are and where you fit in, then I suggest you read this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher of the Rye is an excellent book told through the cynical views of Holden Caulfield, a troubling teenager in the midst of sort out his ideas, beliefs and values, and figuring out what is next in life.After finding out that he was to be again expelled from his prep boarding school, Holden decided to get away and go home early for Christmas break. As he travels home and explore Manhattan doing whatever whenever he feels. Holden does lots of wandering around he's hotel room and bar observing people and trying to entertain himself so that he would not feel so lonely and sad. He feels depressed from getting expelled and tries to cheer himself up by doing whatever he wants. Although Holden was feeling almost hopeless, through numerous chats with people and alone time, Holden clears his mind ending the book in a fresher more optimistic view.The book has a rather simple plot dealing with Holden and his self conflicting issues mainly of wanting to grow up and be accepted as an adult but also wishing to become a kid again. As his ideas flexures between he wants and what he thinks he wants and his opinions. This back and forth thoughts and tension between opinions fills the pages, leaving the reader with a frustrating yet suspense feeling. As Holden's thoughts become clearer the ideas straightened out leaving the reader with a pleasing feeling.This rather addictive book is not a plot through the actions but a plot through the thoughts. A reader would either really enjoy it or hate it. If you're looking for a more cynical bedtime read, dust this book off the shelf."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The first time I read this book was my first year of middle school...when everyone begins to grow up, question everything, and hate the world about 90% of the time. This was a perfect time to read this book because Holden Caulfield, the main character, is a teenager who is very relatable to most adolescents.The book talks about subjects that most teens are interested in, including the opposite sex, parents, and college. Holden Caulfield is a 16 year old boy growing up in the 1950s who just got kicked out of prep school, and doesn't know how to tell his strict parents. He takes us through a few days in New York City, and shares with us his fast maturation after realizing how much he loves his little sister Phoebe.The way that J.D. Salinger gave depth to Holden makes any girl want to marry this fictional character by the end of the book. He's sarcastic writing makes this book never a bore."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye was an astonishing book. I really enjoyed reading the book by J.D. Salinger. When I first started the book, I quickly became attached to the character and the thoughts he had expressed. For example, I felt like I related to Holden in numerous ways. The technique that J.D. Salinger articulated with Holden, his character seemed so real in my mind. I felt that Salinger described the emotions, actions and thoughts of Holden so well that it gave me the impression that he had gone into the minds of teenagers and described almost precisely how they felt as well as the problems that many had.I personally don't read novels on my own free will, but I could frankly say I enjoyed reading every chapter of this book. It was unpredicted towards the end. However, the last few chapters of the book started to get dreary. I anticipated something more exciting to happen such as someone getting injured or a twist in attitude. Conversely, I really enjoyed how the book ended and the emotion that Holden had experienced during his expedition through the city.The descriptions that the author described was easily traced in my mind. With no trouble, I was able to imagine Holden and other characters by the way Salinger had described them. I depicted Holden as a tall and lean male with short brown hair, who could effortlessly pass older than his age. I also pictured Holden with his bright red hunting hat on, walking down city streets shivering. Also, through out the rest of the story, I thought that Holden complained much about things. In some ways, I could understand his point-of-view on things and the impressions he got from people. I assumed he complained about things because perhaps he wanted to get his point across to make the reader understand him a little bit better. Overall, I really enjoyed this book. I thought it had an astonishing plot and storyline to it!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"&quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; does a heck of a lot more than portray adolescant agnst. Holden Caulfield is not just a rebellious teenager, rather he is almost the embodiment of a poet's soul. The reason I say this is because he is not rebelling against society, rather he is unable to conform to it. He is unable to conform to his lawyer father, and his preppy school, because he sees beyond them into his fantasy of catching children in a field of rye. As he tells his sister Phoebe in the scene back at his apartment, &quot;that is the only thing&quot; he can ever do.If you want to learn about adolescant agnst then watch MTV all day, but if you want to learn about human nature then read, &quot;The Catcher in the Rye.&quot;"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"From the very first page this book was easy to get into. It's told from a sixteen year old boys point of view, over a course of about 4 days. The boy, Holden, learns he is flunking out of his private school, Pencey Prep. He decides to run away. During the four days he is gone, he encounters several unusual experiences. I did like this book, a lot actually, but certain times during the book it got confusing and sometimes a little annoying because some of the things Holden did, specifically the way he was judgmental of a lot of people before he even knew them.Throughout the book I appreciated the way he was against \`phoney' people. He wanted people to be real with him, but it seemed like whenever someone was being real with him, he was always thinking to himself about how that person was a phoney. I was left wondering what \\"being real\\" was with Holden, and it was hard to define because the only person he really didn't call a phoney was Phoebe. I didn't really like the ending, either. It was odd because he was kind of building up to the end of the book, and then he just said, \\"I don't feel like telling you what happened next.\\" It was weird, but at the same time I expected that from Holden.Even though Holden sometimes was arrogant and unpleasant, I believe that is the way the book is supposed to be. It was overall a good book and I did like it very much. I do recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is the best single piece of literature I have ever read. It was easy for me to relate to the main character, Holden Caulfield, throughout reading the novel. J.D. Salinger is inspiring."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is one of the greatest books of all time. I first read it when I was in highschool and thought it was great. It has been three years since then I still read it and enjoy it. It is one of those books that a person can read and enjoy every time it is read.Holden goes through a lot of crazy situations and a lot of different feelings after he leaves his high school. It is one of those books that everyone can relate to. Although a lot of people never go through the things he does, everyone at one point in their life has the feelings he has. The feelings of being a loner and an outcast.This is a book that everyone should read at least once in their life. A true literary classic. Salinger is a genius"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a book that never ceases to amaze me. J.D. Salinger has created a book that captures the true essence of being a teenager that can even apply to today. The text is just absolutely gripping too, from Holden's views on people and life to his adventures that weekend.It is truly a shame that so many schools have banned this book. I can understand that the language is a little edgy at times but those who don't read this book will be missing out on the great writing of Salinger and how he builds his characters and leaves us with someone (Holden) that we will never forget.To some degree, I think we can all relate to Holden and his views on life and people. Maybe not to the full extent, but I'm sure a number of Salinger's readers are left with the feeling of understanding. And Holden's words are filled with plain and simple wisdom.I highly recommend that you read this book. And, oh yeah, be sure to buy a highlighter too because you'll find yourself highlighting all of the great passages."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I always passed over this book because I thought it would be dry - one of those old classics they force kids to read in school. It turned out to be one of the best books I've read this year. Laugh-out-loud funny in several places. It was written sixty years ago but the quality of the observations and satire hasn't faded. It's a quick read but it's so full of endearing characters, amusing situations and snarky comments that it's a shame when it ends. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I just finished reading Catcher in the Rye, and I sorry that I didn't read this sooner in life. Honestly, when I was in high school, I didn't have the desire to read this book. I didn't know what it was about, and I was sure that it was going to be another one of those boring books that droned on and on about stuff I didn't care about. Boy (old Holden is rubbing off on me) was I wrong. I don't know if there is a way to sum up the story. There seems to be many stories in one. It starts out with Holden saying that he's at a place \\"resting\\", and he goes on to narrate how he ended up in that place.So, he tells about his life from the time he got kicked out of Penecy Prep until his eventual journey home. One thing is certain -- I can definitely see why people would see this as the bible for the \\"teenage angst\\" generation. I enjoyes this book for the simple fact that it gave an honest look into a seventeen-year-old boy's life. Holden is cynical, introspective, and painfully honest. I don't know if Salinger really meant for people to \\"like\\" Holden more so than he meant for them to try to understand Holden's views on life.You're presented with a cynical adolescent who has no obvious direction in his life, yet at the same time he manages to be very intelligent. You're faced with his ideas on sex, school, phony people, etc. Holden makes no apologies for being who he is, and I appreciated that. The only gripe that I had with this book was that sometime the author seemed to be getting a little too much into the whole \\"teenage angst\\" deal. Some parts of the book had me snorting and rolling my eyes because it seem wildly overdramatic. All-in-all, it was a great book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book has been the subject of much criticism historically. There is no reason for this. The Catcher is such a good book, with such a clear message. All it is saying is that it is hard on a person who sees the wold for what it is. the world has changed in the last 50 years since this book was written. The things that upset Houlden Coulfield in the book are the very things that we as a society have come to accept. I for one believe that this is not a path that we should be proud of. Maybe if this book had not been banned and scorned so badly, people would have paid heed to its message and we would all have a better world. i for one am glad that out there somewhere, there is a man who protects us all by being the catcher in the rye..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I keep talking to myself in Holden Caulfield's language. Here are my thoughts about Catcher in the Rye in a language Holden might have used: Boy, do I feel great! The escapade of Holden Caulfield just killed me. The story starts when Holden, the protagonist, gets kicked out of his high school. He decides to leave the school early; however, for he cannot return home early, he decides to spend several days in New York City. He talks about how he spends his time and dough in bars, parks, cabs, hotels... While telling his story he makes very keen observations about people and adds his own view of them, which is what killed me the most while reading this book. His keen observations and ideas about people make you discover your own dormant ever-observant self. The way Salinger put Holden's adolescent still-evolving frame of thoughts into words is very simple yet so captivating that you cannot put the book down. It is this story that captivated me and took me to a smooth journey full of laughter, tears, reflections, flashbacks... I cannot really put how highly I recommend this book into words. Holden would probably say: \\"Such a swell book worth every penny of your dough!\\""},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield is a 16-year-old boy completely disconnected from the world around him. While he claims to feel sorry for others he states that he is &quot;depressed&quot; by almost everything that others say and do. Unfortunately, he battles his problems without anyone to turn to for help because he is far away at a boarding school called Pencey Prep.Because Holden was not willing to put any effort into his schoolwork, however, he was soon kicked out. Nor was this the first time. Holden had attended other such schools, like Elkton Hills and Whooton School, but he failed to thrive there also.After leaving Pencey, Holden returned to New York City to relax before he returned to his parents. Throughout the days he slept at a hotel where he was cheated out of five dollars and Mr. Antolini's house where he was patted on his head while sleeping, which in his mind deemed Antolini a child molester.Despite all of these encounters Holden was not ready to go home until his kid sister, Phoebe, showed desire to emulate him. He had made plans to run away somewhere and get a job, but decided otherwise when Phoebe begged to join him. This is the only instance in which he showed shame for the life he was leading. He promised Phoebe that he would come home and he did.Finally, Holden is sent to an institution where he can get help and he begins to realize that it is one thing to say you will do something and another to actually do it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield is a 16-year-old boy gone a little too far over the edge. He is obviously seemingly normal (or at least relatively so) to those around him, but his thoughts can be so twisted that they disturb the mind. Ironically, Holden is the always trying to analyze other people, when he is the one who truly needs the help.There is an eerie sort of symbolism in Holden's words and actions. The red hat, the baseball mitt, and the turtleneck sweater, all have a certain significance. He focuses on these things because of their importance in his relationship with others.While Holden often claims to feel sorry for others, his depression creates even more sympathy for him. In time he sinks to such a low level that no one understands him anymore. He is isolated from his family and friends, first mentally, and then physically."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"What Holden Caulfield was able to tell me, was not the foul language appearance on every other line throughout the whole book, nor his stereotypical tone of a cynical adolescent or the monologue, and all 277 pages of them, but a normal teenager's sense of lost in his direction though he knew his New York city like the backyard of his house, his well concealed emotion for being a full grown man though he wept when he was exhausted, hungry and given all the \\"dough\\" his little sister had, the eight dollars and sixty five cents and all, more so, his love towards his passed Allie, brother D.B. and his \\"old little Phoebe\\". All this boy soaked with sensitivity top down was presented in front of me, foul yet as a innocent complete, that just \\"killed me\\", and it really did."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield is a troubled teen. He gets kicked out of yet another boarding school and is afraid to let his parents know, so he goes back to New York and lives on his own for a while. His younger brother died as a child, and his kid sister is wise beyond her years. He doesn't respect many people, but he respects his sister. Throughout the story, you really feel like you know Holden. The way Salinger wrote the book, the reader can picture this cynical 17-year-old sitting across from you telling his story, slang and all. Narrated by Holden, the story is a look into the teenage mind and a source of release for teens. In the story, he states what he feels about people and things. He describes in such detail what people do, why it bothers him, and when he's nervous, you can feel the sweat trickling down your own tense face.This novel by JD Salinger was absolutely phenomenal. It is a great book for frustrated teens who feel strongly about things they don't think anyone else does. I understand why this book would be banned, reading the language and some content, but overrall this is an excellent book. Other teens my age are still reading The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, but I prefer to read this story. It is not only a teenage boy, Holden Caulfield, telling about his messed up life, it is a portrait of humanity. reading this book, I was captivated by the descriptions of people, places, and events in the book. I was surprised and pleased to see that other people feel the same way I do. This book was also very infuencial to me. I don't mean that I got expelled from my school or began mixing in one swear word for every five other words, but I began to feel what was going on around me. I do things I want to, like Holden wearing the weird hat regardless of others, appreciating my kid sister, and I even started saying &quot;it kills me&quot; at brief intervals like the main character. Take it from me, this book is good."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a CLASSIC! Even from the first page you are sucked into the book and are trapped inside until you finish it. It will not let you go until you know what happens to our friend, Holden. His crazy life, family, friends, and expressions capture the reality of teenage American life. I was 16 when I read it and I believe it is the best remedy for a confused teenager or an adult who longs for his or her teenage years."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I first read this book when I was 16, went through it really fast, and thought Holden was a spoiled rich kid. I read it for the second time today 4 years later, after having gone to a private boarding school myself, having some more life experiences, and reading the book with more attention. I had completely missed the first time around a huge life-altering event Holden goes through which made me understand why he is so depressed with humanity. Now this is one of my favorite books because of Holden. He is so sweet, funny, and relatable you can't help but love him. In the book Holden says he knows a book is good if he wants to have the author as a friend he can call up anytime. I wish I could call Holden. Read it!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a horrid \\"novel,\\" and I have no idea why it's acclaimed as a great piece of work. Although the idea of \\"coming of age\\" can be treated with skill and grace, this book fails to do so. I'll tell you why: the writing is awful. This isn't skillful writing, this is ranting. Reading the book was absolutely painful. It was cliche after cliche, and I wanted to run screaming away from the book and into the arms of Shakespeare, Pope, Dryden - just to feel like the English language hasn't entirely deteriorated. In the scope of things, this novel does not deserve to be taught in schools.If you would like to read a WELL-WRITTEN, worthwhile, complex, poignant piece of writing about \\"coming of age,\\" please read \\"The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\" by James Joyce. Please."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Reading for enjoyment - 1 star. Reading for study of mental illness - 4 stars. Those of you who are reading this because you have class paper, may be asked to present a diagnosis and treatment of Holden Caulfield's \\"mental illness.\\" Holden's struggles may not be common teenage crises, but the result of bullying and abuse leading to Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. Remember Holden words: \\"When something...like that happens(Antolini), I start sweating...

I enjoyed the book years ago and was amazed at the comparison to today's lost youth. or something..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I suspect that I'm not the only member of Generation X who should've read this book while young, but didn't, and have now rediscovered it as a middle-aged adult. I have a vague recollection this book was assigned reading when I was in college. I probably skimmed it, wrote a paper about it, got my passing C grade, and moved on, as I did with many a reading assignment in the \`80s.I'm afraid I would've enjoyed it more, had I not been influenced by all the hype. There's only one thing worse than assigned reading by a professor, and that is recommended reading from family or friends. The childish rebel in us all wants to do the opposite of what we're told we should do. This is also one of those books that people my age are always being asked whether they've read or not, particularly male English majors like myself, and then worse being told they should read it, usually by some phony uncle who got way more out of it back in his day because of what was considered in its time to be rebellious, controversial language. The funny thing is, phony (to use the main character Holden Caufield's favorite adjective) uncles like these seem to have missed the book's main message, which was perhaps hidden by their excitement over the blunt teen colloquialisms of that era.To me, this book should teach a lesson to the reader that one shouldn't try to ship their kids off to schools to rid themselves of the hassles of parenthood when those kids are unwilling or uncertain about it. Such action puts parents at risk, after becoming empty-nesters, of wishing they'd spent more time with their kids and had developed better relationships with them. This book is filled with conversational language and stream-of-consciousness writing style that, while entertaining, masks the overall message of the importance of family.While at first glance, one might think the protagonist's cynicism is hilarious, but upon further discovery one realizes it is incredibly sad. Likewise, on the surface it appears to be a simple story of a child struggling with becoming an adult, when in fact it is a deeper tale of neglect, and of a depressed child being \\"pushed out of the nest\\" before ready. When Holden hears the little kid singing the \\"catcher in the rye\\" song, and it makes him feel better, it's because the scene symbolizes his yearning to be a happy child with the comfort of his family nearby. Holden's parents continually want to ship him off to any boarding school who will take him, which not only shows they don't care much for him, but aren't willing to put in the effort to prepare him for the challenges of adulthood. One would think his parents would want to maximize their time with him, having lost another child previously, but the opposite has occurred.At age 16, Holden wants what he's never been able to get -the love of his parents. Although they've provided for him well, it is apparent that he does not value being sent to the finest schools, having the finest clothing, etc., and instead contemplates moving to Colorado for a more modest life devoid of such superficial things and people. He decides to stay home for one reason only, and that is to be able to spend time with the one family member who returns his unconditional love, his little sister Phoebe.Maybe the moral lesson to be learned is that one should consider himself lucky if he can count on his hand one relative with whom it is important for him to maintain a meaningful relationship with, one that includes unconditional love; and that to be a wealthy person one needs much more than material things or the \\"advantages\\" of a prep school education."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Are people really as fake, dishonest, and downright nasty as Holden seems to think they are? I suppose the answer lies in the eye of the beholder, but Holden sure uses a lot of cuss words in telling you his opinion! Basically, the book is a long diatribe of an angst-filled teenager against the perceived woes of the world, and I actually agree with a good deal of what Holden has to say. Holden is an especially insightful and perceptive teenager as well, adding to the story and making it relevant to readers of all ages. An obvious point is that the book is most likely autobiographical in many ways, as most novels are. Many people are indeed phonies, Holden, especially through your eyes.

I can see why schools might want to ban this book but really, at any school you hear language 100 times worse (OK maybe not that much, but still) than used in this book. The main reason I think there's no cause to object to the content is that he is writing exactly what he thinks about everything. It just makes the story much more real. I think he talks about issues that everyone growing up deals with, but are not really discussed in school or other books. This is what makes the book so good.I think we all see a bit (or for some, a lot) of ourselves in Caulfield's experiences, whether we're just coming of age ourselves, or are \\"all grown up\\" and remembering our teen years. Many times while reading the book, I found myself thinking \\"THAT'S ME!\\".Perhaps I enjoy this book more than some people might since I have the same sort of cynical view of the world as Holden, and a lot of the same things depress me. But regardless, this is a classic and should be read by everyone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Mid-aged now, I had a few spotty memories of this book from my high school years and in my mind's eye it seemed forgettable, but later in life I bought the book and read it again, partly because I wanted to see if I could figure out why John Lennon's murderer was carrying the book when he was arrested. Was there a clue in the story that inspired the twisted killer to attack Lennon? Anyhow, if so, then Chapman was not caught and saved by the Catcher, but instead went entirely off the cliff. And if Chapman envisioned himself as the Catcher, he was wrong. The Catcher in the Rye is a saver not a destroyer.Although I rate this book five stars it is by far not my favorite, but I would still recommend it to anyone just because it is so popular. I did find it interesting and in my youth I spent a lot of time in New York City and had been to some of the places referenced in the story. When I was a kid growing up on a dairy farm, my cousins and friends and I used to play hide and seek in the cornfields, (Catcher in the Corn) way before we ever heard of Catcher in the Rye. So While reading this book I felt those kind of connections, as in, I felt like I was there in the story at times. But back when I first saw the title Catcher in the Rye, I imagined, (before reading), that it must have been about something in life to watch out for, something that may catch you if you let your guard down, something that might be out to get you. Maybe that's the connection Chapman made. Maybe Chapman didn't actually read the book before he killed. I just hope they keep the guy locked up.And I, for one, hope they finally get finicky J.D.'s novel made into a movie. By the way, I think it is very healthy to turn off the TV and read books in quiet solitude. I find the best time is before I fall off to sleep, reading can also help to cultivate dreams.note: I still sorely miss John Lennon."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It makes me sad that so many young people don't like this book, since reading it was a highlight of my own youth. Although I was already a great reader, I'd never had a character come alive the way Holden did; I've remembered and loved him all my life as though he were a real person that I once knew. I read it again in my 50s, and loved it even more. I'd either forgotten, or never appreciated, how hilarious it is: Holden's observations about the people he encounters are dead-on and very funny. I especially don't get why people think Holden is a whiner who hates everyone. To me he is very perceptive and intelligent and interested in everyone: he's always trying to chat with everyone he meets, although he doesn't get a lot back from most of them."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book brings new meaning to life, a new outlook on it.

Its life, and though we cannot change it, we can only understand it better. How many times have you wanted to get away from all the phonies in your life? I read this book twice, once this past summer, another for class this year, and I would definitely recommend it. BUT, only to people who dont mind the layed-back, rambling story-telling from Holden, and of course who dont mind thinking of more than just how irrationally this (perhaps--but I have my doubts) &quot;insane&quot; kid faces life.

I don't believe the story is universal at all. Not many people I know walked around New York city with symptoms of schizophrenia at the age of seventeen. It sure does not define my life.

Salinger is the real phony here."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"My high school teacher forced my English class to read this book back in the late 1970's but somehow I managed to avoid reading it - maybe I was visiting colleges or something at that time. In any case, about 6 years later I found myself alone and stranded in the Australian outback with absolutely nothing to do and nothing to read except a box of books that included most of the works by Mark Twain, John Steinbeck, Kurt Vonnegut and this one by Salinger. It was the first time in my life that I had ever delved into literature in any real way and I totally fell in love with Twain and Steinbeck and especially Vonnegut. But when it came to this Salinger thing, I couldn't believe how boring it was, how irrelevant it seemed, how utterly phony its angsty rebelliousness seemed to be. I had grown up around tough kids who lived difficult lives when I was a kid and in Australia I had been working with roughnecks in the oil business, so this Salinger thing seemed pathetically trivial to me and its fame remained totally baffling to me. So about 8 years after that, I thought maybe I had missed something on the first read, so I read it again. And then I tried to re-read it for a third time about 5 years after that, but the effect was always the same. You call this angst? You're telling me this is what rebellion feels like? I can only think that my English teacher and all those other teachers who think this is somehow profound really haven't had much of a life, haven't really plunged too far into the depths of human experience, haven't really had to face difficult questions about existence and so forth. I'm sorry, but it's just a boring book. And if you're a teenager and your teachers are cramming this down your throat and you don't get it no matter how hard you try, don't sweat it: you're not alone. Maybe this was mind-blowing stuff 60 years ago, but 25 years ago I thought it was just an over-hyped waste of time... and I still do. Maybe there's a reason Salinger went into hiding: so he wouldn't have to face his utter lack of anything worth putting into print."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I was very disappointed with The Catcher in the Rye. I do not think it lived up to its reputation as one of the greatest books ever. I was left wondering what it was really about because nothing epic really happened in the book.

Why is this the standard, and beloved book? I felt alienated from the main character and his trifling saga. Worst book I had to read in high school. The only character I cared about was Phoebe--who would have made a much more interesting read for me. Her pain of dealing with her stupid brother was more real than the rest.Good news, though, is this book is increasingly less relevant to 21st century high schoolers. It's becoming a quaint view of the 60s to them, No kidding,"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I absolutely hated this book. There is no plot. At all. I've heard it's supposed to be a great coming-of-age story, but to me, it didn't seem like the main character changed at all. Holden Caulfield remains annoying, whiny, and obsessed with cussing and the word \\"phony\\". If I hadn't been graded on reading it, I wouldn't have even read past the first few pages.

SalingerPages: 214Time spent on the \\"to read\\" shelf: 4 or 5 months I think.Days spent reading it: 4 days.Why I read it: The Catcher in the Rye is an American classic and very controversial. I honestly wanted to see what was so controversial. Also, it was one of those \\"classics\\" that I did not read while in high school. In researching about it later I read that in 1981 it was the most censored book in US high schools and the second most taught book in high schools. It was one of the 10 most challenged books in 2005, but it came off the list in 2006. Those are some fun facts for you.Brief review:This book frankly annoyed me. The writing has very repetitive and had many aggravating sayings in it. The word \\"really\\" is used almost as much as the curse words that are prevalent throughout the book (one reason it is often censored--I would guess that gd appears 2-3 times a page at minimum, sometimes significantly more). And I assure you, both appear more than they need to, I really mean it.Holden Caulfield is the main character. He is the epitome of teenage angst. His world is utterly pessimistic. He sees only the bad in everything except his sister and his deceased younger brother. He is bright, but is failing out of school. He is obsessed with sex, but cannot develop a relationship with a girl. He is active and pursues all the pleasure trappings that a big city have, but has no defining meaning to his life.The book covers three days between him being kicked out of school and his untimely return home. Holden is depressed, hates everyone, exaggerates EVERYTHING (annoyingly so), and seems to have few people skills. In short, he is the perfect anti-hero and irritating enough that I did not like him one bit while reading this book.I suppose this book speaks to the hearts of some disaffected youth, but they would have to be interested in drudging through 200 pages of dribble in order to find the voice that Holden ultimately gives them.I found little redeeming quality in this book. I felt like I was being attacked as a reader throughout the book. The curse words were prevalent. Holden's judgmental attitude and disquieting assessment that everyone was fake simply unnerved me. The last 20 pages or so bring a little clarity to the book, but even that is not satisfying. I read this article in wikipedia and found a little more clarity on the book, but not enough to ever allow me to suggest this to a friend. I understand why people have tried to censor it (and sympathize with them even if I disagree with them), but honestly if it was not so controversial I think few people would ever pick it up and think \\"Hey, that's a great book! Everyone should read this.\\"In short, I'm glad I am not Holden Caulfield. I respect those who relate to him and his story, but his life is from such a different perspective from mine that I never sympathized with the character and ultimately never connect to the book.Oddly, in reflecting on the book some--the tone, the overall message, the anxiety it produced in me, perhaps I give J.D. Salinger too little credit. He probably got the exact response that he wanted out of me. I hate it when that happens. This is probably one of those books you mull over for a long time and never really like it, because its not fun. But you can respect it because of the emotions and conflict it produces in the reader. How interesting--actually reviewing the book in writing has changed my mind regarding my final critique of the book.Favorite quote: \\"Girls.

I was assigned to read this book in high school and everyone in my class hated this book. I've read most of the classics and loved them all but this was just a horribly pointless book. Holden is basically a rich emo kid stuck in 1945. All he did was roam around New York city, talking to stupid people, tried and horribly failed at picking up chicks, got drunk, smoked and then crashed at a closeted homosexual's apartment, because he was too afraid to tell Mommy and Daddy he had been expelled for the 3rd or 4th time. I seriously wanted to rip this book up and throw it in the trash, if it hadn't been a school assigned book. What was with his constant crying? I half expected him to be cutting his wrists and writing a suicide note. He should be on Gossip Girl, not making teens read about his poor rich life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I don't understand why people enjoyed this book.

No, Holden isn't perfect or anything, he's not a hero, maybe he does even have a little of that 'phony' in him, I don't know. But I just get really angry at reviewers who go on and on about how Holden's such a hypocrite, about how he's needlessly angsty or whatever. Don't they get that this is LIFE? The point isn't to end the book with some message of goodness, of joyful exuberance. It's so, so so so REAL and I just can't get over it. Holden's thing with wanting to protect his sister, and thinking everyone's a phony and punching Stradlater, it's really defining. He's just trapped, and he doesn't know what to do, it's like he's drowning.Really I think the book's greatest strength is that it's honest. Holden's really incredibly honest and maybe he's not RIGHT all the time, he is really melancholy, but he's honest. It killed me."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book has been the subject of much criticism historically. There is no reason for this. The Catcher is such a good book, with such a clear message. All it is saying is that it is hard on a person who sees the wold for what it is. the world has changed in the last 50 years since this book was written. The things that upset Houlden Coulfield in the book are the very things that we as a society have come to accept. I for one believe that this is not a path that we should be proud of. Maybe if this book had not been banned and scorned so badly, people would have paid heed to its message and we would all have a better world. i for one am glad that out there somewhere, there is a man who protects us all by being the catcher in the rye..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"When I say realistic, I mean it. No phonies, no nothing. The book focuses on Holden Caulfield, a repressed 16 year old who just got kicked out of his private high school. This book was written and supposedly takes place in the 1950's with the &quot;Leave it to Beaver&quot; type families and rebellious teens. Holden is just an average teenager. But what makes this book interesting is that he brings a sense of reality into the world. He never goes to the movies, movies are phony. He hates phony things, but the truth of the matter is, he's a phony, a hypocrit. He despises phonies and yet he lies without shame, that's Holden. When you read this book, it's hard not relate to him. You want to meet him and have a good long talk with him. He's a real kid and not many books can show the truth in this. I can assure you with full confidence that this one does."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've read this book many times over the years, from my first encounter in high school, to the most recent times, discussing it with my high-school children as they read it for the first time. Each time I read it, I'm struck more deeply by how truly it captures the rebellion, exhilaration, worry, fear, and rootless wandering which faced or faces us all as we journey from youth to adulthood. The language is crisp, funny, never lags. Holden Caulfield's adventures catch and keep our interest, and we care what happens to him as we accompany him through his wanderings, but the thing that strikes me after all these years is how deeply JD Salinger captured the feelings that Holden was living with each day: What happens to those ducks in winter, what happens to us all as our warm and safe childhood lives slowly become the cold, hard, unyielding lives of adulthood, and who is there to catch us as we pass through the rye. Does anyone look out for us any more? Are we alone, on our own? A beautiful, evocative book, for teenagers, adults, or parents helping their own teenagers navigate this remarkable journey."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"You know what happens when something becomes too famous, too utterly successful that everyone has heard about it? People stop caring, the significance that gave this book its importance grows boring, overused. All the young writers who identified with this book keep re-telling the \\"Holden Caufield philosophy\\" because they stopped being individuals like their hero and sucked up something somebody else said. Holden is too familiar. We all know him. What's gonna happen when somebody says 'Who cares?'Nevertheless The Catcher in the Rye is a wonderfully well-written and entertaining novel about a self-absorbed little punk who thinks he is--and probably is--smarter than everyone else. But he's too young, too inexperienced, too unsure of himself to survive on his own. He questions everything until nothing has an answer and increases his frustration until he's completely unable to do anything but dream, imagine he were something else--a protector. He imagines he was somebody's savior.All subtextural religious nomenclature aside, this dream delves more deeply into the personality of the character, not some unattainable dream as the cynical and lacking in self-confidence narrator tries to tell you it is. It is about someone frustrated because he is unable to change the world around him and a quest he already knows will end in failure of escaping himself and retransforming his life into something more profound.Yes, this is an extraordinarily powerful book, filled with the split cadences of lingo and slang to give you the feeling of having an actual conversation.And yet the problem of over-exposure cannot help but influence the outcome of experience. I remember hearing teachers and older siblings rave about this book when I was eight or nine or ten years old and when I got around to being assigned it high school myself, I skipped it arrogantly and somehow got an 'A-' on the paper just by copying down the hearsay and over-emphasis other people gave to the ability of someone else's story to change your own life. The fiction I submitted as my then analysis was lauded not because it was an accurate expression of opinion, but because it justified the teacher's own overwhelmed ideas regarding the novel's importance.It's a great book, truly. Just don't get bogged down by canonization."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye ReviewThe title, The Catcher in the Rye, still catches my eye. After reading the book it still intrigues me how the author chose this as the title. I think it's brilliant. The book is just as brilliant.Everyone can relate to Holden Caulfield, the fiercely honest and stubborn headed main character, in some way. As Holden recaps his journey through some hard times in his life you realize just how like him you are. He reminisces about things like getting kicked out of Pencey High School, \\"the very good school,\\" according to all whom have yet to and never will attend it. He struggles with his fellow peers who he can't quite see eye to eye with. He predicts on how his parents will feel about him leaving Pencey, \\" Well...they'll be pretty irritated about it. They really will. This is about the fourth school I've gone to.\\" After leaving Pencey, he figures he can stay at a hotel so his parents won't suspect he's gotten kicked out of another school. Holden thinks to himself, \\"I'd put on my red hunting cap when I was in the cab, just for the hell of it, but I took it off before I checked in. I didn't want to look like a screwball or something. I didn't know then that the goddamn hotel was full of perverts and morons.\\"Holden was in for a surprise when faced with life firsthand instead of the \\"candy- coated\\" life he had experienced in his elementary schools and boarding high school, Pencey. He's faced with pimps, prostitutes, strange cab drivers and just life in the streets.He calls on old friends to comfort him in his struggling downward but even they are no comfort to him. It takes time and bad experiences within the few days Holden lives on his own to see the truth. He comes up with his own resolution to face life head on. He figures that maybe he doesn't have it so bad and discovers a sort of self-respect. Every challenge he is faced with helps him discover that he is just as important as every other person on earth. He finds out that by letting his care for school, friends and life go, that there are people who care for him and would be disappointed if he made a decision like dropping out of school. Once Holden claims he's going to run away, his little sister Phoebe starts crying and Holden says, \\"I'm not going away anymore. I changed my mind. So stop crying and shut up.\\" But for the most part, Holden realized he would be disappointing himself the most.The author J. D. Salinger approaches Holden's story with a comical irony that still captures the harsh realities of life. It's a pretty easy to read book. Salinger portrays Holden as a person who expresses exactly how he feels on all the issues at hand without leaving the reader to wonder. It was exciting to see what Holden would do next. He was full of many good insights and pondered upon things people usually don't take the time to think about.I recommend this book. It captured my interest till the end. We all, as people, face hardships and sometimes feel like giving up, but we eventually pull through. Without those hardships we wouldn't be the people we are now. Everyone will take something different from this book. For me, I learned that life isn't half as bad as we think it may be. Everyone has his or her own problems to deal with. You're not alone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book was an excellent read I don't remember too many details just the feelings I received from it. I'm 16 myself so I had to read this book in an English class. I remeber this girl I knew said that book [is terrible] all he does is whine and complain. I read the book and instantly felt kinship to Holden Caulfield. the first few lines were how I usually describe my life story. Later on I was felt he was like me in that everyone around him is phony but more importantly how he's not good at accepting changes in people. What struck me was how contemporary it could be. Holden's actions and feelings reflect those of any teenager today. It is not unusual to hear of us kids failing classes, slumming around on the streets, smoking, drinking,swearing, fighting, and talking about sex. That's what surprised me. Seeing that it was written in 1951 made me think that it would be all \\"gee whiz\\" but this book could tell the story of any other troubled introverted teenager. With this book I felt I could wallow in this self-exile and not be worried about what society thinks and just fly your own flag and take aim on those around me.

I myself am seventeen, and I can totally relate to what he was experiencing. Now, I imagine a field of rye where children gather to play, and I feel that it is my responsibility to protect those children from the increasingly unsafe world in which we live. Now, whenever I see the 'f-word' written on walls or tables, I do try to remove it. I feel that if everyone read this book, and took it to heart, then our world would be the better for it. Salinger has composed such an incredible amount of detail for this book. I found it especially interesting when Holden would comment on something so obscure that few people would even notice it, nevertheless mention it. The way I see it, Allie represents mistakes of the past. D.B. is the mistakes of the present, and sweet Phoebe represents the future that will repeat these mistakes. Holden is the only one that can do something to protect the future. He wants Phoebe not to be as bitter as he is. Holden represents us. You and I. We must change the world to protect the future for our kids. That's the ultimate message in The Catcher in the Rye."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have read this book several times throughout the years and also have given many copies to friends.

I don't believe it is life changing or a masterpiece, but simply a challenging novel that has legions of fans (a cult following, perhaps?) because it tells it like it is. Teens on the rampage!

Or that you should even BELIEVE half the things he says. He's not going to come out and say,\\"Deep down, I like most of the people I know, although I'm not sure how I feel about my roommate.

To me, losing your innocence is kind of like being dead, but I'm not totally aware I think that -- it just comes out in what I say sometimes.\\"because if he did, he wouldn't have readers of every age and social class identifying with him, or wanting to save him, or angrily finger-pointing, or at least wanting to buy him some new gloves and maybe a hot sandwich.I read quite a few customer reviews just now (which were really funny -- I recommend them to anyone) and didn't know what I was going to do when I saw how many people just came out and said the WRITING WAS BAD. Is there anything better than a forum where you can say absolutely anything you want? I mean, we're not trying to review for the New York Times, right? In case you were curious, though, the writing is really good, no matter how much you hated it.(also, I stole the title of this review, which was actually a phrase used by Mary Karr to describe Franny of Franny and Zooey)"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"When you hear the name The Catcher In The Rye, you think of a lot of things. First, a book you should have probably read in high school at some point. Secondly, a classic by the nefarious recluse J.D Salinger. Thirdly, a book that has been found on many a famous assassin or serial killer's bookshelf. You buy The Cathcher In The Rye and some secret government agency puts your name on a list of possible homicidal maniacs or communist sympathizers or something. Hmmmmmm. Well.... I gotta tell ya, I never got around to reading Mr. Salinger's grand epic in high school, so I picked it up out of the sheer pleasure of reading another previously missed classic. With mixed emotions, I began to read about the life and times of one Holden Caulfield. Since it was originally published in 1945, 1946 & 1951, I caught onto the controversy right away. People just didn't write books with a lot of swearing in them at that time. Holden calls everthing goddam. Holden has been ejected from Pencey prep school for flunking out of all his subjects except for English. He is a rebel. He is perhaps some sort of deviant loner. He's definitely got some depression issues. Bottome line, Holden Caulfield is a weirdo. End of story? Not really. Holden mystifies his readers with his inane analysis of everything from phony people to little girls to jock roomates and life itself. Moving? Stiring? In places, maybe. He doesn't snivel and he doesn't want us feeling sorry for him, but all the same, you can't help but being just a little annoyed with his semi-retarded antics. He smokes like a chimney. He drinks like a fish. He sneaks into his parents house to talk to his little sister Phoebe, who seems like a smart, but perhap strange little girl.Overall...The Catcher In The Rye is a readable book. Nothing spectacular. I'm sure the scholars would rebuke these statements, but I gotta tell ya, it wasn't anything special. J.D. Salinger rambles on like a lunatic half the time and I'm sure it was not all for the mere literary effects. Ho hum in places, but still managing to keep the reader interested. Sometimes you want to hang out with Holden and other times you want to smother him with a pillow. It did not turn me into a serial killer...at least....I don't think it did. One of the earliest books to use the phrase \\"F*** You\\" however, and I found that particularly flavorful. The part where Holden describes his gravestone as his name, the dates, and someone's scrawl of \\"F*** You\\" at the bottom. Clever. If my name went on some secret government list for buying this book, I can't imagine what list I must have ended up on when I bought Vonnegut's Breakfast Of Champions or Barker's Books Of Blood or Orwell's Animal Farm, but they were far more worth the attention than Salinger's middle of the road biopic.Dig it!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I was interested in reading &quot;Catcher&quot; due to its history from Mark David Chapman up to its inclusion in &quot;Conspiracy Theory.&quot; As an aspiring writer, I was very impressed and entralled by the style throughout the book. I loved the conversational writing and feel that's at least 50% of the charm of the book. It's very engrossing and very true-to-life. I don't want to read a literary work that reads like a Medical report. Conversations have real language, descriptions, tangents etc --- and &quot;Catcher&quot; is Holden's story of depression.Which brings me to another reason for liking the book.....I can relate to Holden's plight. I'm now 20 and a sophomore in college, but I feel very isolated away from home. I have very few friends at college, and many of my high school friends have changed drastically. I'm changing, too, and I feel like I don't have anyone I can relate to. As &quot;corny&quot; as it may sound, I relate with Holden and his isolation from society.But not everyone will have that relationship with the character. I believe many who read it will find a piece of themselves floating around in Holden's mind, though. Be warned that it is not a &quot;plot&quot; book, as many reviewers have complained. True - It doesn't have a plot, per se, but it is an interesting story that through reading, I think, allows for much self-evaluation while Holden searches for himself and his role in society.If anyone would like to discuss the book, feel free to e-mail me!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"My oldest son was surprised to hear that J.D. Salinger fought in World War II. He thinks of Holden Caulfield as a contemporary, a peer, anachronistically making his way through a few days of life. The period references in the novel are like props on a movie set, no more real than the phonies Holden encounters. It's perplexing that so many of my son's classmates felt no connection to Holden after reading The Catcher in the Rye this past year. We are told on TV, on the internet and in movies that our teenagers and young adults are increasingly savvy, mature and perceptive. When it comes to technology, they certainly are. But most of students in the class considered Holden a whiny freak without realizing that often, it's the whiny freaks who walk through life with the clarity of sight and earnestness needed to leave this existence a little better than it was when we entered it. The story itself is a masterpiece. Salinger was firing on all cylinders and tapping into the strange other-worldly literary omnipotence we usually attribute to Shakespeare when he wrote Catcher. It's interesting to wonder whether he was even aware of everything he was doing in the book or if he was like a pro athelete who enters \\"the zone\\" and emerges at the end of the game a puzzled hero. Every time one of Holden's apologists dies, as his creator did this past week, a piece of Holden dies with them. Fortunately, he is as viral as one of my son's favorite You Tube videos. When we follow his exploits, Holden's DNA intertwines with our own and is propagated in everything we say and do. Fortunately, he will never completely die, but will continue to confound those who think him merely a whiny freak.

And I'm a slow reader with a short attention span.This book was HILARIOUS! I want my son, if I ever have one, to be named Holden. Seriously. There's so many reviews about this book in regards to being dated or using too much foul language or just about being immature and adolescent... but it's PERFECT because of that (well, not about being dated, which I didn't think it was). Maybe 31's not that old or something, or perhaps it's because I still hate the phonies myself, but I think Salinger's Caulfield is amazing.I'm not so good with words when it comes to being too descriptive or being able to clearly explain what it was I related to in this book, but it's just damn-near perfect. Holden's remarks about the phonies and want to be alone or just have some company and \\"intelligent\\" conversation... to wanting to be a tough gangster but knowing he's to \\"yellow\\" to ever actually be that way... that's what me and my friends are STILL like. Probably always WILL be like.Unless you've never wandered the streets of your own city, or a strange one for a couple of days with no agenda, no one to see and nothing to do besides get drunk and kill time doing things you aren't particularly interested in doing... maybe it's hard to relate to this guy.

This is a 'keeper'. Trust me, give it a try."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Rich, smart, and well dressed (with the exception of his long-brimmed cap), the story follows Holden Caulfield's disclosure to, apparently, a therapist. From his opening words on the therapists couch to his mental collapse in New York City, he discloses his insights into suitcases, toilet seats, bare-breasted Indian statues, graffiti, \\"phonies\\" and \\"feeling sexy.\\" Unfortunately, his insights do not suddenly catapult him into a position of superiority, but further expose his own ineffectiveness. He attempts to interact with people are rebuked. Reunions with trusted confidants of his past (Phoebe, Antolini) are disappointments. Although the book can be considered a tragedy (an underachieving adolescent's descent into mental collapse), the mood of the story is endearing and comical.Through Holden, Salinger captures adolescence at its most vulnerable and righteous. With Holden's untethered idealism comes a provocative cynicism that makes Holden my most beloved character in any novel ever. Holden's stream of consciousness dialect makes this book a masterpiece beyond any other \\"coming-of age\\" story. Prone to hyperbole, Holden views everything in universals and extremes. He has a sense of idealism that has not been comprised by the sophistication of adulthood. Although he is quick to see hypocrisy in everything, he is not so quick to see dissonance in his own thinking. He challenges the authenticity of everything although he is the one searching for his own meaning. The result is a warped sense of righteousness that leads to his loneliness and subsequent breakdown. Timeless and genuine yet poignant, no contemporary portrayal of teen angst has come close to Holden's saga."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A new generation of angry young men were inspired by J.D. Salinger's \\"Catcher in the Rye,\\" a dark-edged little novel about teen disaffection. Wry, cynical and strangely touching at times, this book is a look into the confusion and turmoil of a young mind -- those who want their teens clean-cut and meek need not apply.Holden Caulfield has just been expelled from a prep school for failing almost every subject he was studying. And he couldn't care less -- after all, it's full of phonies. Over the weekend, Holden wanders the streets of New York, thinking about the school, the teachers, the phonies, and his nebulous family -- especially his brother Allie, who committed suicide.Fearing the repercussions of going home and telling his parents what has happened, Holden just keeps touring New York in his peculiar cap. He meets a girl he once liked, a teacher who is sympathetic to his plight, but Holden always ends up pushing others away. And when he does go home, his temptation to run away is changed irrevocably.Remember the disaffected anti-hero of \\"Igby Goes Down,\\" who flunks school over and over, and runs away to hang out in New York? Cynical oddball Igby has Holden to thank for his existance. \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" catches teen dissatisfaction and dreams of freedom, making it seem almost painfully realistic.Most classics don't include the anti-hero sputtering four-letter words on the first page. But Salinger's style for \\"Catcher\\" is an unusual one. Through Holden's eyes, it's a bitter and very straightforward style, peppered with wry observations. The biggest flaw would be the handling of Holden's own \\"phoniness,\\" since it's obvious he can be as phony as the people around him. It's subtle, but too subtle -- to less discerning readers, it seems like Holden is just a bitter hypocrite.Holden Caulfield is a surprisingly nuanced character -- at first glance he just seems like an unusually obnoxious young boy who hates everything. But as the book unfolds, we see that he cares for genuine things, especially the innocence he no longer has. And he lacks the ability to connect with other people. None of the other characters really come to life... but they don't really need to. This is Holden's story.Salinger's cynical tour de force \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" is a bitter pill to swallow, but it's definitely worth it. Disaffected, yearning and wry, this is a modern classic. And deserves to be, as well."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Could you change the title of this item becouse is not the spanish edition, Thanks"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield is just a puling spoiled rich brat whinging about a lot of kak. The biggest 'phony' in the book is Holden Caulfield. This book's popularity is due to it's protagonist's foul language, which is less pungent than mine was in High School."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Because this is one of the most heavily reviewed books on Amazon, I will not at this late date attempt to do a comprehensive review. I'll merely focus on one reason this is such an important book and then comment on one odd yet persistent misreading of the novel.First, this is the first novel that was written with the narrative voice of a disgruntled youth. In fact, one of the most amazing developments in the 1950s was the birth of Youth. Before the fifties there was no sharp chasm dividing young and old. There were, of course, differences between being young and being older, but the main difference was mainly that you were merely younger, not that you embraced a completely different culture. CATCHER IN THE RYE anticipated everything that was about to happen in youth culture within the next few years. No novel had been written in slang before, at least not in youth slang. You would be a very rich man or woman if you could count the number of times that Holden says something like \\"I'm not kidding\\" or \\"I can't stand it.\\" Salinger's genius for maintaining a consistent narrative voice from beginning to end is unquestionably one of the novel's greatest claims to fame.The second thing I wanted to mention is the rather bizarre turn that so many people consier Holden Caulfield a hero. If anything is clear in the novel, it is that Holden is a profoundly troubled, disturbed, emotionally stunted and sick individual. The events he narrates are cleary done so in a mental health institution. For all his railing against phonies, no one in the book is as phony as Holden. To appropriate the language of existentialism, he lives a completely inauthentic life. But sadly the only person who calls him on the pathetic existence he is living is his teacher that Holden suspects of making sexual overtures near the end. But clearly the events in the novel presaged some kind of emotional collapse. Holden at age 17 in the mental institution writes about significant events leading up to his collapse at age 16. That anyone could view Holden as a role model or a hero is unfathomable.I reread this because I'm about the read the Frank Portman novel KING DORK, in which CATCHER IN THE RYE features prominently. I had not read CATCHER since college, but I was pleased to discover that it was as excellent as I remembered it being. I wouldn't rate it as one of the greatest books that I've read, but it is unquestionably one of the most important American novels of the past century."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"At the risk of offending all the fans--this book should not have been banned because of the cursing or the sexual references. It should have been banned because it is uninteresting and tortuous to read. The sentences and the dialogue are so annoying they make me want to punch Holden Caulfield myself. I understand that was what the author was going for, but it doesn't make it any more palatable. I also understand that the novel was groundbreaking in its time. Regardless, I lost interest about 70 pages into the book and moved on. This is no classic."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"For years, friends and family noted the classic, The Catcher in the Rye, as a \\"must read.\\" I was pleasantly surprised with Salinger's ahead-of-the-times writing of Holden Caufield and his experiences/thoughts with sex, drinking, and his general disenchantment with the world, as he is expelled from prep school. Holden narrates as he bounces around for a few days before heading home to tell his parents.On some level, readers will relate their own lives to that of Holden's. How could you not? He's depressed, rebellious, and negative. He's a coward, a braggart, a phony, and a wannabe. We've all been like him at times. But that is his whole character and you rarely see another side... only his love for his sibling showed a side of Holden that could be defined as positive.There is no real payoff or conclusion in the end. You'll find the value of this writing after finishing it, putting it back on the shelf, and thinking about it for a few days. Keep digging, it's there.Have fun,David TobiasRedondo Beach, CA"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This novel is more alive today than ever. Books are not being burned, but no one reads. The effect is the same. The few lucky ones have their favorite books in their heads."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"its a great book for a person who feel they are a outcast of society and no ones understands how it feels to be so alone well this book is for you its bout a jaded young man named Holden Caulfield who's liberal w/ profanity so if ur easily afiend by profanity and portrayal of sexuality and teenage angst then this book is not for you by if you want ur mind split wide open then this is the book for you"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"For years I was told that The Catcher in the Rye was a classic. I hadn't even picked it up until I was advised to read it. I was told I would most likely connect with it.The main character, Holden (a teenager), is a sort of rebel throughout the novel. He is kicked out of Pencey, a school in Pennsylvania, and then goes to NY. The one thing I honestly loved about the novel was how modern the author wrote, as if he knew how the youth of today would speak. You are reading something so modern while in the back of your mind you knew that this novel was written over forty years ago. From the beginning of the book I was completely enticed and drawn in; the book never seems to slow though. Like there are no breaks or rests. The one other thing that kept me reading and interested was the amount of knowledge you gain about the character. You always know what is going on and you are never uninformed. You always are told what is happening and where. No matter what it is, Holden tells you where, why, when, and how.Published in 1945, the book is still up to date with the vocabulary of today's youth. I wish the author were still at work with this novel, maybe coming out with some kind of novel, oh how do I say this, involved with this one. Like I said above, you are never confused as to what is going on. Obviously that is also a skill you must build over time with reading experience, but this book is great for all ages. In that respect my eight-year-old sister has been delving into the pages for a while now. I recommend this book to literature lovers of all ages."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had never actually read this in school sadly, although I wish they would of made me. I think it would of given some perspective to many a dry and detached school day. That is why it is a classic, because for anyone of youth, or who can remember the questioning, troubling, and confusing period of their life, Holden Caulfield is a relateable character. You can see why so many people who have felt troubled at all relate to him so dearly. I read in wonder at points as it felt the character had stolen some of my own thoughts, decades before I was ever born. His conflict with the world not living up to what one would hope, or people being \\"phony\\" as he would put it is a comforting notion to the disenfranchised person, making one sense that they are not alone in the internal conflict presented by such a issue.Of course, Holden also seems to conflict with himself, which is another classic issue of youth. Obviously troubled on a number of different issues, most people will see the character in probably many people they have known, or perhaps themselves. Some of these issues have of course lead to the books banning on a number of occasions, but of course for the curious reader, that should just be more of a reason to pick it up. :)The book's style makes it easy to digest, and quick to read. I would say young adults just getting out of the \\"Harry Potter\\" stage would be doing themselves right to pick this up.It is tragic that Salinger hasn't published anymore work in years, after this I feel commited to getting into the rest of this masters work."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Just one flaw:The narrator of this story is presented as an avid reader, yet he speaks with a weak vocabulary and weak sentence structure.By my count, he uses the catch-all phrase \\"and all\\" 174 times.He accuses most adults of putting on a false front, so, by my count, he uses the word \\"phony\\" 47 times. A student with above average literacy skills would likely look the word up in a thesaurus.His little sister Phoebe, who is presented as an honor student, is likewise verbally deficient. During the conversation in the bedroom, she uses the phrase \\"and everything\\" 5 times.This is especially unrealistic considering that Holden and Phoebe's parents are viligant about their children's verbal expression. During the bedroom conversation, we see that the word \\"lousy\\" is verboten in the Caulfield household.Salinger probably held a stereotype that all adolescents and children speak with a weak vocabulary and weak sentence structure."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have been reading many of the reviews on this page, some critical, some positive, and I have condensed the opinions to the following. Those who don't like the book seem to think that the book is disconnected, swears too frequently, or has no plot. Now, I realize that some negative reviewers have differing opinions, and I respect them, because the book is different from most literature, classic or otherwise.Most literature describes an event, using the characters to interact with their surroundings. There is a defined plot, there is a defined theme, the people do normal things, and everybody who reads it gets pretty much the same thing from it. For an example, I'll quickly examine a well-known piece of literature, &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; by Dickens. I am not going to go into great detail, I am not an expert on this work, but when I say &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; you see ghosts, kids with canes, and London. If asked &quot;what is it about&quot; you might say, &quot;the redemption of Scrooge&quot; okay great. Everyone agrees, discussion ended.\\"The Catcher in the Rye&quot; is not like that. People with literal minds hate books like this, because everyone who reads it, takes something different from it. These people say, &quot;nothing happens, the symbolism was great, but there was no plot&quot;. To them I say, &quot;Who cares?&quot;. I want to meet the person who declared that every book needs clearly defined plot, theme and grammar, to be good. Writing is about more than following the proper steps. A monkey can be taught to follow steps, a third grade student can learn to fill in blanks. Writing is about communicating. Some critics look at a work of Dickens and say, \\"Now, there's a good book, that's how writing is to be done. All the concepts are well thought out, the grammar is letter-perfect, and the word choice is outstanding!\\" And that is great for them, I'm excited that they feel this way, now we know that there is yet another job that a computer can be taught to do, critique literature based on grammar, punctuation and spelling. These rules are rules we give our elementary students so they can be understood when they write. If you want to buy a book, so you can examine grammar and word usage, don't buy this one. Salinger didn't sit down to write a book for his college English professor. If you want to look at his work from that standpoint, then it would be an awful book.Fortunately for the human race, writing is not about that at all. Writing is not only about being understood, writing is about feeling, writing is about telling another human being, what an experience is like. This is what Salinger has done. He has captured the teenage experience, the anger, the frustration, the disappointment, the feeling of hopelessness, the paranoia, and the feeling of looking out at society and realizing that it's not a nice place to be. Salinger did not write about the idea teenager, if he did, Holden would've sounded like a member of the Brady Bunch \\"The world is a happy place\\". Often, people like to rationalize what happened in this book, by saying, \\"Holden is sick, he is unusual, nobody else goes through this\\" this is not the case. True, Holden did move to California, apparently to seek some type of counseling, but he is far from unusual, he is truthful to himself, he is telling about the world the way it is, not the way he wants it to be.In the book, Salinger is communicating to two types of people. On one hand he is telling the people whose lives have been like Holden's that someone understands them. Someone else has been though what you've been through, it's a normal thing. And he is telling the Brady Bunch people \\"WAKE UP! Take off your rosy colored glasses, the world is NOT one big happy place, at least not for everyone. Yes, somewhere in the distance, there is war and hunger, but there is something more, and it's right next to you. There are people who can't find the most basic human need, the need to be loved and accepted.\\" Holden feels lost and alone, he feels like nobody cares about him, he feels rejected by his family, and he feels hopeless because he everyone and everything he knows either lets him down, or lies to him. This is real life, this is what it's like to have everything not go your way. If you are looking for fairy tale or soap opera, this is the wrong book. You also shouldn't read this book if you are going to use a holier-than-thou attitude and judge everything that is wrong. To read this book, you need to be realistic, and empathetic. This book is about the bad side of life, it can sometimes be hard to follow, and you may reach the end and wonder what happens next. Read it a few times in that case, you may learn that this kind of writing is not about what happens next, it's about what already happened, and most importantly; why?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Even though this is a literary classic that almost everyone in America reads before graduating from High School, somehow I missed out on this one and was never required to read it for any class I took, even through college. I've heard numerous references to it through the years. Before killing John Lennon, Mark Chapman, who read and re-read the book many times - to the point of believing it was his own biography, asked Lennon to autograph his copy before gunning down the musician. John Hinckley, attempted assassin of Ronald Reagan, was another devotee of the short novel, as was Robert Bardo, killer of Rebecca Schaeffer (star of &quot;My Sister Sam&quot; on TV). There may be countless other criminals and stalkers who have identified with the book's main character, Holden Caulfield. In Mel Gibson's movie, &quot;Conspiracy Theory,&quot; his character has an obsession with the book and must buy a copy every time he sees one.I finally had to pick up a copy and find out what all the fuss was about. Was the book about stalking and murder? Not exactly - but rather the motivating factor behind such heinous crimes of obsession.Caulfield, in his late teens, is a misfit in a world that doesn't tolerate misfits very well. His younger brother, who he dearly admired for being so likeable and genuine, has died of cancer. His older brother, D.B., lives in Hollywood, writing stories for the big screen, which is a loathsome thought for Caulfield.Caulfield is an introspective youth who hates being around fake people (who doesn't?), but doesn't try to get to know people well enough to find out whether they are really phony or not. He stumbles through life with his arms crossed in defiance, believing he's one of the few genuine people in the world.Growing up in an affluent home, being shuttled from one prep school to another, Caulfield finds himself ensconced with phonies and it makes him sick to his stomach. His refusal to acclimate results in him being kicked out of one school after another. The novel opens with his narrative of how he has been kicked out of Pencey, his latest prep school, and how he doesn't want to face his parents until they've gotten the news and calmed down a bit.He heads up to New York, getting a room in a fleabag hotel, then running from bar to bar, trying to find something that won't bore him. He's obsessed with avoiding boredom at all costs. He's constantly finding himself in situations where he fantasizes about killing people, but never defends himself because, he explains, he's &quot;yellow.&quot;His inability to focus and attempt to express himself makes him frustrated and angry, finding contempt and hate for just about anyone for any reason, even those he loves. The story takes the reader on a rollercoaster ride of 2 and a half days as Holden Caulfield searches for meaning in his life, but finds only emptiness. The only thing he can seem to hold onto is the fantasy of building a cabin out in the middle of nowhere, where he never has to be around phonies again... he'd rather be alone, than lonely in the midst of crowds of phony-baloneys.After reading the book, it's easy to understand how such misfits as Hinckley, Bardo and Chapman used this book as their personal anthem and almost as a proxy, felt the need to act out in ways that Holden Caulfield was unable or unwilling to do. To the sane reader, Caulfield's character is a study in sadness and loneliness, not a character worth admiring - albeit his search for the truth in life is a noble cause.The book doesn't condone or condemn Caulfield, but rather states Caulfield's thoughts as they come to him. The sane reader can't help but want to reassure Caulfield that this is part of growing up and everything is going to be ok, and wonder where such people were in the lives of the famous stalkers who never had anyone reach out to them and slap them with some reality.As someone with ADHD, I found the book a fairly easy read. Parents should know that the book is wrought with foul language and sexually suggestive narratives. As a minor, Caulfield smokes, drinks and attempts to procure the services of a prostitute, among other things... so this is not light reading nor should this be the reading material of a young person not mature enough to separate fact from fiction. Salinger's writing style is interesting - detailed, yet quickly paced, and a good piece of literature as reference for the aspiring writer."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It's rare that a book with such social significance and impact comes along. Although this book is now a classic - crafted by JD Salinger in 1951, it's message and importance is still relevant to this day.The Catcher in the Rye is the story of 16 year-old Holden Caulfield, an alienated teenager searching for meaning in life. Holden's troubles range from his poor school performance to the almost maddening feelings of disgust he has toward the plethora of phony individuals that he must deal with during the course of his day to day life.The story, told from Holden's point of view, takes us through Holden's mind, as well as the locations he visits on his quest to find the meaning of his extentialist purgatory.A superbly written, no-bull account of the life of an outcast teen, The Catcher in the Rye, in addition to entertaining us, inspires us to think: to question our own existence and encourage ourselves to be better people through compassion and understanding of the human condition. This book is a must read, especially for teenagers, as you WILL find something in this novel that you can incorporate into your own personality: something that you can make a part of you."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"While reading other reviews on this site, I find myself saddened by two problems people have with this book: 1) nothing exciting ever happens 2) Holden Caulfield is merely a cynical whiner In response to those who hold the first as a fault of the Catcher in the Rye, perhaps you should learn a greater appreciation for literature and the human soul. In this age of shallow films and pulp Stephen Kingesque fiction, people seem more concerned with cheap, &quot;action-packed&quot; thrills, and (not to sound like Holden or anything) it is depressing to see that people are unable to be moved by a book unless it involves a homicidal clown or a rebellious Soviet submarine. In response to those who feel that Holden is just a mindless cynic, I feel as if you have failed to see what lied beneath his very blunt (though often true) observations of the numerous rituals that are plentiful in American society. After finishing the book, Holden did not seem to be a cynic, but rather a figure of both youthful desperation and enlightened sympathy. He was by no means just an ass for he saw beauty in such innocent things as his little sister's joy while riding a carousel and the strange excitement felt by a humble drummer as he prepares to play a few, almost meaningless notes, and reflecting upon such things, one is lead to the belief that Holden, deep within his heart, wishes not to merely criticize but to help others by showing them the pointless suffering caused by their own arrogance (a self-glorifying form of cynicism) and self-centered attitudes. Thus, it can be concluded that it is not Holden who is insane, but the world itself. Holden sees through their insanity, and criticizes the disease, not the diseased."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've never even come close to reading this classic by J.D. Salinger until I picked up this cheap little copy a few days ago. My only knowledge of the book came from Mark David Chapman and the killing of John Lennon two decades ago. I sat down with it right away and quickly became engrossed in the story told by narrator and main character Holden Caulfield. It's absolutely incredible that this was written in 1951. The language is slangy and fresh enough to make anyone believe that it was written close to today.The book is an account of a few days in the life of Holden Caulfield, teenager and cynic. Caulfield gets kicked out of his prep school and wanders around New York City for a few days, trying to avoid his parents and having a few interesting encounters along the way. All of these events are related to use directly through Holden's worldview. This worldview is depressingly downbeat, as Holden views most who tramp through this world as &quot;phonies&quot;. To use one of Holden's favorite phrases, what &quot;killed me&quot; about this book is Salinger's ability to transform extremely arcane sensations and emotions into prose. When Caulfield talks about his dead brother Allie, he mentions how red his hair was. To show the reader how red it was, Holden talks about a day he was golfing and turned around and saw Allie about 150 yards away watching him. Great imagery! I could actually see his red hair while I was reading this. I loved Caulfield's hunting cap, the imagery of his being the catcher in the rye, and the ducks and frozen fish in Central Park. All point at Caulfield as something deeper than an angst-addled teenager slumming through New York. Caulfield is on a quest to save kids from his own fate. He achieves this in a sense at the end with his kid sister Phoebe.I'm thirty years old, which is still young enough to understand how Holden feels. I went through a stage where I felt exactly like Holden. Everybody does to some extent, I think. The trick is to survive it and not let it destroy you. I really thought this book would end on a bad note, but it seemed uplifting in a way. Read this book, if for nothing else then to say you've read it. Once you get started on this one, you will have a tough time putting it down. Recommended."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I love this little book. And I am not completely sure why. No, it is not the most engaging and brilliant of stories. It's simply a rambling journey of 16 year old Holden-and his subsequent misadventures. Would I have liked a guy like Holden in high school back in the day? Probably not! But the genius of this little story is the way Salinger brings the reader into his world. His observations--his encounters with others--his needs and wishes. In spite of myself, my heart melts as I read along. Maybe this is why so many generations read this very old tale (going on 60 years!) of the forever teenage Holden."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I was just browsing through the customer reviews of this book, and although I'm sure no one gives a damn about what I have to say (in the rare case that anyone will ever even read this review), I would like to offer my opinions and arguments with those who dislike this book. First of all, the issue of teenage angst is a difficult one to depict in words. It is a difficult one to depict without actually being a teen. Most of the depictions of teenage life these days are rather exploitative. They mostly tell teens how to behave and do not show the true side of adolescence. To those readers who complain that Holden is an &quot;immature malcontent&quot; and so on, teenagers are often immature and often are malcontents. If Salinger led you to believe that Holden is an immature malcontent, then his mission was accomplished. At the current age of 17, I can relate to Holden's character moreso than any other teenager depicted in the media. Although Salinger's style of writing is a little too elementary to be called a &quot;classic,&quot; I feel that Holden Caulfield should be the model for teens. Here we have a character who hates change and wants to be a &quot;catcher in the rye.&quot; When I see children shooting each other, I feel that this is a noble goal for anyone to have. While you are entitled to your opinion, keep in mind that if the world were full of Holden's &quot;phonies&quot; it would be a conformist nightmare. Thank god for people like Holden."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Any book that elicits this much of a response is certainly powerful. Is it a good book?This IS a good book. Why? Holden is one of the most believable characters ever written. He sees that adults are &quot;phony,&quot; and he doesn't want to be one of them. Who can blame him? He is sometimes whiny, but I think he knows it and the sincerity of his pain is absolutley devastating. He is immature, but he is fighting against the loss of his innocence. He's a very perceptive, if not always very articulate, sixteen year old.If you never had any doubts about the truthfulness of the way adults represent themselves, or if you think prose should always be lyrical, you might not like this book. If you are interested in an honest representation of a youth's struggle with his impending adulthood, you probably will.Either way, you should read The Catcher in the Rye, just so you will know what everyone else is talking about."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"There are two types of readers, I believe, who tend to criticize this Salinger classic. The first is the frustrated student who finds it in their summer reading list and second, a pretentious reader that will criticize it for it's simplicity [naturally remarking that the book is overrated].This classic, which follows a day in the life of Holden Caulfield when he gets kicked out of yet another private school, is truly one of the foremost literary fictions ever written. First published nearly half a century ago, it's story is still relevant to every young generation that has followed since. Holden's anti-heroic personality manifests itself in popular film and literature even today [and often]. On the surface the story is simply about a clever, but volatile, teenager that can't seem to stay sane in his own skin; a coming of age story. But more than that, \\"Catcher\\" is a look through the eyes of a misfit, an individual gifted/cursed with a hightened sense of the world, who cannot rectify in himself how he could stand to be happy in this world he sees as corrupt and full of hypocrisy. And yet he desires to be accepted. For all liberalists, this is a story that will touch that part of you that has looked at the unjust world and wondered whether or not you, as an individual, fit into it. It is a critique of family, friends, teachers, and essentially, human flaw and the struggle to accept it, all seen from the eyes of Holden Caulfield, a young man who simply can't pretend he doesn't notice that things around him are wrong. But the brilliance of the book lies in the fact that the entire book begs the question, What is wrong with Holden Caulfield?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"&quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; portrayed the suffering and alienation of an otherwise privileged, middle-class young man long before such a theme became fashionable. So much of today's writing with comparable themes seems like a tepid imitation of the original.Holden Caulfield is an utterly convincing character who is not reaching out from the pages and trying to grab our sympathy. Salinger should be commended for not endowing Caulfield with bathos and excessive sadness. Instead, he presents Caulfield's state of mind in a simple, lucid narrative. As a result, this novel is very effective in examining timeless questions about the nature of happiness and the conflict between the individual and society. There is also a compelling honesty in Salinger's writing that makes Caulfield so believable that I frequently forget he is a fictional character.This book should be read by young people and adults alike. It should also be read by aspiring writers attempting to market their own tales of woe."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"JD Salinger wrote six stories for the New Yorker mentioning Holden Caulfield. Since the book began in 1941, I'm assuming the book took place around then - making his 1945 story, the last, true, and, ultimately, depressing as hell.Holden's brother, Vincent (or DB in the book, apparantly), narrates a very short story where he expresses disdain over Holden's being MIA. It's ultimately revealed that Holden Caulfield dies overseas, a mere four or five years after Catcher takes place.I don't know what's more depressing, that, or the fact that, in the book, the biggest phony of them all is Holden Caulfield."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have read this book time and time again, I am still taken away by it. The book is a new lease of life, it shows that there is always someone worse off then yourself. I am only 15 and i dont really like books that much but this is an exeption, it is brilliant. Holden Caulfield is a late teen who is in a boarding school (Pency). Holden failed every class exept english and he was kicked out of his school. Afraid to tell his mother and father, Holden leaves Pency and makes his way back home to NYC, where he can break the news to his mother and father before anyone else. Along the way he meets a collection of people. Nuns, Prostitutes, Old friends and family.If there is one book that all book shelfs must have then it is this masterpiece. You will not regret buying it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Hmm... I read this book during my early adolescence while at high school and I was surprised and bewildered and perplexed. I then got involved in reading it for a second time whilst looking out for other works by this writer, the short stories and &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot;, I even wrote a class assignment essay about it and later on at the University I put myself through the tortuous task of authoring an overview of J.D. Salinger's work, his main themes and preoccupations. I seem to have misplaced both of them and cannot find them, and I stand as speechless as I did the first time I acquainted myself with the author.What I can say with certainty, is that this novel is Art in every sense, not a character sketch per se, not an alienation novel either, but a work of art that masterfully eludes all criticism in that it cannot be contained in one person's critical viewpoint without having a fundamental element of the book being overlooked and compromised in the process of analysis. My tentative observation, at this point in life, is that it is a prolonged haiku, a meditation on being young, idealistic and confused, a delicately drawn between-the-lines depiction of an uncaring, and hypocritical (&quot;phony&quot;) society afflicting the sensitive individual with both its vices and virtues, a starting point for endless adolescent discussion. But I would also like say to all young readers out there to not take this book too seriously, it can be as deadening and nihilistic as it can be sensitizing and sincere. Salinger is very talented writer but he is also deeply uncertain and troublesome, enigmatic as well as poetic, self-defeating in his world view, caring for the world and despising it at the same time, of this world and unable to live in this world or compromise even a minute part of his thoughts for a greater community value, a religion, a philosophical system of thought, a human relation, a cause etc.Good God (and this is only a figure of speech.), that was tiresome. Keep an open mind and doubt mostly everything. Good luck with reading this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Salinger's 'Catcher in the Rye' is an amazingly frightening and beautiful text. It's more than a story of a troubled and psychologically disturbed teenager, it's a beautiful emmotional-construction that captures the universal feeling of the individual in the face of the tragic. Consider the brilliant passages as Holden recalls his immeasurable fear while crossing the street as he feels himself slipping into a mental abyss, or the beautiful rage of his youth when he breaks his hands beating his fists against the windows of his garage when his brother dies of leukemia. Catcher in the rye is about the fantastic horror and beauty of humanity in the face of the tragedies and uncertanties of life and a holy rage against the coldness and indifference of the ugly individual. This is not a book that can be understood by the brain."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book serves as cold bucket of water dumped over the head of every parent who has forgotten what is was like to be sixteen. I hope my son is not on the same wave length as young Caulfield but this book reminded me that he might just well be."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I was given the assignment of reading the &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; in tenth grade and quickly feel in love with it. This book captivated my imagination and I found myself in another world. Holden is a mature male who is faced with everyday challenges which he needs to overcome to suceed in life. Holden is on the outside of the world looking in, so he has first hand accounts of events which he can describe to readers. A great trait this novel has is that it was very personable. Readers can relate to the experiences Holden overcomes, and sometimes even trips across. Readers are reminded through out the literature that Holden is human like everyone else. He makes mistakes and must pick himself back up and through his actions readers can see the strength it gives a person. Throughout &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, Holden Caufield describes his world how &quot;his eyes&quot; see it. He is very bold and tells it like it is, for example throughout the the novel he vividly describes the phonies who are intertwined throughout people in everyday life. The Catcher really teaches you what you don't like about yourself and gives you a passage way to start over on. He condemns all the horrible people who are man-made by envy etc. and makes readers want to change people people for the better. This book will open your eyes, and hopefully inspire you to look deep inside yourself and criticize."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is about an adolescent growing up into an adult, about 17 years old, trying to escape a world of \\"phony\\" people and rescuing young innocent lives. The book is a story of Holden Caulfield telling his life of a three-day adventure he had. He had recently been kicked out of his third prep school, Pencey because he was flunking every single class except English. Scared to face his parents, Holden decides to leave early from Pencey Prep and travel downtown, New York. On the way, he runs into many different people such as taxi drivers, three girls from Seattle, a prostitute, two nuns, his little sister Phoebe, and a former teacher. Holden gets sick of the friends around him at Pencey prep thinking that they are &quot;phony&quot;; leaving for New York only showed Holden that the entire world is &quot;phony&quot; also. Holden wishes to escape from this world of \\"phoniness\\" and decides he wants to be away from people, a place where nobody will know him, so he does not have to be involved. J.D Salinger has created a masterpiece. He uses a style of writing where you think you were in a conversation with the main character in the book. It's as if you were talking to Holden as he was telling you his adventure as he searches for himself. In the novel, J.D Salinger points out that Holden's little sister Phoebe would care to help him. I find the relationship Holden has with his sister is the heart of the book. Holden expresses himself to Phoebe the night he visits her, and explains to her the one thing he wants to be. \\"I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around-nobody big, I mean-except me. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff-I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I'd do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it's crazy but that's the only thing I'd really like to be.\\"(pg.224-225) Holden expresses what he wants to do for the first time to Phoebe and I find this special and touching. The last scene of this novel was also very touching. Holden was at the carousel with his sister Phoebe and was watching her ride. As he is watching her, he thought to himself, \\" I felt so happy all of a sudden, the way old Phoebe kept going around and around. I was [almost] bawling, I felt so happy, if you want to know the truth. I don't know why. It was just how she looked so nice, the way she kept going around and around, in her blue coat and all. God, I wish you could've been there\\". (pg.275) The relationship he has with Phoebe is the perfect relationship he has been looking for. This kind of bond is the type of bond that makes Holden seem like a real character. I found this quite interesting because, he just wants to keep young children, like his sister from becoming \\"phony\\", and to watch her act like a kid, makes him feel happy. This made the novel more enjoyable to me. This novel didn't have many weaknesses in my point of view. It had so many strengths that made this book seem as if his story was reality. This novel was written, as if it was a true story, it has no plot. The things J.D Salinger points out just happens, like life, you never know what is going to happen, you just have to accept and appreciate it as God hands it down to you. Holden accepts the life he has to live in for he is a struggling adolescent entering adulthood. While you are \\"listening\\" to the story Holden is telling you, it is easy to relate to one of his many situations. It might come across your mind that you may have said \\"That has happened to me before\\" or \\"I know what he's talking about\\". That is the best part about this novel. Many people can relate to Holden's story. Once you get through the symbolism of the novel, you will realize the things J.D Salinger tried to point out. This book is a long life lesson. People these days try to please others rather than speak their mind, which expresses the &quot;phoniness&quot; in people. I recommend this novel to everyone because it will give people a different, fresh, and new point of view on life. Anyone who is confused about life, or wants to examine the mind of a young adolescent should read this book. Also, if you are the type of person who likes to be kept thinking about the novel after reading it; \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" is the book for you. You will be touched by the experiences Holden Caulfield goes through, and can feel the pain and confusion he is feeling. When reading this book, do not force yourself to read it, just enjoy and relax. You will find this book a classic!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is a classic, and for many reasons. I loved it when I read it in high school (not for a class), and I love it even more now that I've taught it in high school English. Students love it because of the narrative voice and the content, and they don't realize they are reading a classic of American fiction. I've gotten some great essays and test scores from this book; proof that this book can engage even the most reluctant readers into reading literature. And the discussion possibilities are endless: I learn something new every time I moderate class discussions. The kids take over, and I only have to prompt them to dig a little deeper into the meaning to find a gem of an insight. If you read it as a teen, re-read it and enjoy! Share it with a friend, read it for book club, teach it; do not miss out on this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Where do I begin? Wow, what a great book. In Holden Caulfield's life, he is surrounded by phonies, teachers whom had flunked him, and how he doesn't care about how he looks in his SWEET red-hunting hat (with ears!). Holden is a little distraught with his younger left-handed brother dying, and his older brother, D.B., a writer, so Holden feels like he must make something of himself...After getting kicked out of Pencey, he decides to go to New York for a few days, until it is time to go back home. One of a very Holden-ish sayings is when he is leaving Pencey, early morning and yells, &quot;Cya later ya bastards!&quot; or something like that. What a great way of expression! Holden continues on, and experiences love, and well, you'll have to read what happens. Definitely a great book, so pick it up and give it a read. Then get surrounded in Holden's world and go buy a red hunting hat!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"As a 14 year old new Freshman, I have just read the Catcher in the Rye for my summer reading. It was really by chance that this was the book I choose. I had heard it was a classic and basically had no good reason for choosing it. After reading this book though, I can truly say that I am happy that it is the one I decided to read. Although I haven't been around for very long, I must say that J.D. Salinger expresses a degree of literary genius higher than anything I have ever read before. I feel that teenagers can definately relate to the Holden Caufield character in many ways. Although most are not as fully &quot;crazy&quot; or distraught as Holden may seem, I think that all teenagers can at least relate to one aspect of Holden's personality. I think the way that Holden seems to believe that as you become an adult you lose your innosense and ultimately become a &quot;phony&quot; is the way that a lot of young people feel."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The protagonist Holden Caulfield will forever remain a brilliant literary character as equivalent to Huck Finn in his episodic novel many decades earlier. Holden's cynical outlook on life makes him a very flawed narrator, however his satirical insight sheds new light on situations that forces a overly optimistic or even naive reader to reconsider their belief that the world is simply peaches and cream in a golden bowl of happiness. A very interesting character clearly makes this novel one for the ages both for it's controversial dialogue and nihilistic theme."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Salinger's classic use of structure and diction throughout the novel help to achieve his purpose of showing the moral problems and developments of Holden Claufield. From the very first few sentences, it is clear that Holden is telling us this story as he remembers it. He comments that he got into some \\"madman stuff around Christmas\\" and \\"had to come out here for a while to take it easy\\"(1). Thus the reader can conclude that Holden has taken a journey of some sort from the beginning of his problems to the state in which he currently lives. The structure of the novel also supports this hypothesis. It all starts the day he leaves Pencey Prep. From there on it is a journey through the black forests of moral confusion. Moreover, the reader can learn a lot from the diction that Salinger employs to show the developments in Holden. As the reader picks up the book and gets through the first page, it is glaringly obvious that Holden is not the traditional narrator. He presents himself to be immature, and the use of slang becomes a vital part of the book. This immaturity presented in the diction can best be observed in the analysis of Holden's sexual confusion toward girls. He comments that \\"if you don't like a girl, you shouldn't horse around with her at all, and if you do like her, then you're supposed to like her face, and if you like her face, you ought to be careful about doing crumby stuff to it...\\"(62). This mental train of thought, resembling that of a child's, shows that he has a sense of morality that is being challenged, which serves to teach lessons to make him more mature in the future. It is also important to note that what he is battling is the fact that he is not like the average Pencey Prep boy who only lives \\"to give her the time.\\" He thinks that this is a weakness in him as he realizes through the episodes with the pimp that the whole world is just as corrupt. Overall, through the use of structure and diction, Salinger gets to the center of Holden's confusion about morality, while crafting a great work. Many claim that this great novel is for anyone who is at all confused in life about morality or just having a tough time."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The great thing about &quot;The Catcher In The Rye&quot; is it's total lack of metaphors, boring literary device, and hidden meanings. Salinger leaves nothing to interperation, and presents his story of an aggrevated teenager, melancholy and cynical, in a black and white, analylitical fashion. By far the best book I have ever read, it's the only book I ever enjoyed. It's neither too long nor too short, hard to follow or monotonous, serious or comical. Instead, it is a portrait of the perfect novel, cutting through the sugar-coating and &quot;beauty of literature&quot; and getting right to the story and the point: that everything is nothing, and NOTHING is not worth wasting your life on."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Sarcasm. Blunt profanity. Endless streams of ridicule. These are the three main things that spout continuously from Holden Caulfield's mouth throughout the course of J.D. Salinger's &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;. Holden is a boy who always manages to bring out the negativity in even the most positive situations. Despite being an outcast from his friends and family, he dwells on his misfortune rather than changing his perspective on life. &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; is a cut-and-dry journey through the mind and life of a boy who deals with the difficulties of being a teengager, but somehow manages to find happiness in the end. I wouldn't call it a must-read, but I enjoyed it somewhat."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book some years ago in HS.

It is just the coolest."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Disappointing to find out all the hoopla over this book only applies to people who enjoy whiney bores for main characters. Holden may be realistic but is his every thought interesting? No. Most peoples' aren't (except maybe to them). Would have been more suited to a short story rather than a full book. Covering 24 hours of a person's uninteresting life over more than a hundred pages makes for bored and frustrated readers. Salinger beats us over the head with his repetition, and lack of imagination. It might have had more oomph if I had read this as a teenager, but not likely a positive effect. It doesn't compare to Bless the Beasts and the Children which I still recall even not having read it for 15 years.A little more plot/action/motivation and less diatribe would have kept my attention. Since I couldn't sympathize with Holden I felt apart from what little action there was, more a spectator. Kept waiting for Holden to &quot;lose it&quot; ---grab a gun and start shooting the phonies.Anyways, not recommended for discerning readers who value their time. Authors with more skill and consideration for their readers await..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"interesting but way too overblow"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am glad I finally caught up with this book. At 53, it was about time.I didn't rate it highly but I suspect it's one of those books that will grow in stature as I think about it. Lots of books we forget about as soon as we finish them. Some great ones live on.When was this book written? 1949.Well, I imagine it was ground-breaking then and a bit risque.The language flows like it could have been written yesterday - with the exception of the odd word such as \\"gay\\", meaning happy, and \\"flit\\" meaning homosexual.Salinger has captured the voice of a teenager brilliantly. Nothing much has changed in 60 odd years. His first-person main character is angry, confused, hyper critical, exaggerating and searching for a place in the world.The plot is what I call linear. No twists, no turns, the story never folding back on itself.That disappointed me but perhaps the story will continue to play out in my mind.(less)"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J. D. Salinger's novel can be summarised quickly:It is about a confused teenager who runs away from his prep school to New York after being expelled for flunking his subjects and learning a girl he fancies got on a friend of his. The story runs through a day of his life in New York.That is actually it.But from a plot which is thinner than the edge of a piece of paper, written in a stream of conciousness manor, through the simple words of a confused teenager, nothing so beautifully true, funny, aware and self explanatory has ever (to my knowledge) been written. Holden not only sheds light on his life, but the hypocrisy of entire adult world around him, and even more impressively probes at the mistakes we made ourselves at his age.Reading this as a teenager you will feel relief and comfort to know that your not the only person who thinks this way, or maybe you will just find it a bit boring and Holden a bit unlikeable. As an adult you will grimace, reminisce and empathise as Holden guides you through the same blunders and mistakes of you too made, and the shocking realisation of what a phoney the my young teenage self would think of you now.In short, a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I first read this when I was in high school back in the mid-1960s. I enjoyed it then, but reading it again was truly rewarding. The book seems to get a bad rap these days, but to me, it is an utterly engrossing and entertaining tale that merits a full five stars."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher and the Rye is an excellent \\"Coming of Age\\" book. I believe it is a MUST READ for all. It will be an eye-opener for the sheltered and maybe a comfort for others to realize they are not alone in the world with their feelings. Loneliness can really affect ones lives, how they perceive it and how it guides their thoughts and actions.It can make some desperate for attention but so bitter that no one wants to do anything with them. They need love the most, but push it away, a very vicious cycle, one hard to break, but very possible if they find their soul mate. The book is written where most can relate to it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Awesome book. I understand why it's considered a classic. I never read it when I was in school. I can't picture younger people reading it in school because of the language. It has very adult language but, it was very good. Deffinetly recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger explores the \\"phoniness\\" of the adult world and one boy's attempt to stay young as Holden tells his story from the mental institution he is currently living in. Though Salinger employs many stylistic elements that increase the literary merit of the novel, there were also a few elements that were subpar.In order to mimic the teenage point of view Salinger is writing from, he uses stream of consciousness. Most of the time the stream of consciousness is well used, but there are also many times where it leads to rants about details that don't have any importance to the plot. It causes the reader to lose interest and gives the book a sense of invalidity. Rather than focusing on the themes of phoniness and youth, readers become lost in the never ending details.However, the stream of consciousness does highlight the immaturity of Holden. It makes the book relatable for those who are coming of age and brings to life the teenage point of view. The provocative language also helps bring to light Holden's immature state of mind. He talks in teenage vernacular that was unusual for novels during that time period.The ideas Salinger struggles with throughout the novel make the book an essential read for young adults who relate to the struggles Holden experiences. Though some of the actual events are outdated, the theme behind it is still relevant today. As we get older, we learn the truths of the world and realize just how phony people can be. We often don't want to grow up, but just like Holden we are forced to join the adult world.Salinger provides one of the greatest coming of age novels of the 20th century. It is a timeless classic that continues to be read years later. Though at times is seems to lose focus, over all the book accurately represents the trials young adults face as they grow up and join the real world."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm super happy with this purchase.

It sounds old-timey, but its a true voice from that time. I'm just saying that some writers can't capture the voice of our youth in present day, but Salinger was able to do that when he was writing his novel.As an adult, I've found Holden Caulfield to be annoying and whiny. In a way he's just a kid who's trying to find himself and figure out what he wants in life. Many kids of every generation go through this. Being in his head for the duration of the book is what made him annoying. He repeats himself - no wonder he fail his oral literature class (whatever it's called). He hates everyone and everything he encounters. Everyone is a fake, but apparently not him, even though he's respectful to the elderly, he's silently badmouthing. I'm sure he represent the youth of the 40s/50s and I'm sure if I was a teen when I read this novel I'd think Caulfield was the coolest person alive. But I'm not and I don't.I think Salinger is a great writer for the reasons I mentioned in the first paragraph, but I would not want to spend another minute reading this book and being inside Holden Caulfield's head."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"after nearly 40 years of shirking the responsibility as an American interested in literature, I finally read this one.

I don't want to go into depth and deconstruct the thing. What would Holden Caulfield say about it? \\"It was swell, it really was.\\" He'd leave at that. But I will add that he had me at the scene with Old Spencer (it's classic). It's very sensory, and we get a sense of what were in for with Old Holden. He has no bravado. He knows exactly who he is and is actually apologetic about it, which is the brilliance of this novel. And oh my gosh, Holden and Phoebe dancing in the bedroom--brilliant. Listen, read this book and really open yourself to receiving what Salinger is trying to convey. Now that's all. 5+ stars from me. The only other book I've ever gave 5+ stars to is The Great Gatsby.

After reading it, I thought I had found my best friend in Holden Caufield, the main character.Basically, the novel is a short autobiography of what happens in an apporxamatly three day peroid after Holden is kicked out of school and before he moves to California. That is what happens in the novel, by the theme is, in my mind, about the abstract nature of humans and of society in general. You really have to read to understand why I say that.Most people who do not like the book base their complaints on two aspects: 1) The swearing. 2) The dialogue. Now to address those points.1) So he swears, big deal. The cursing is maybe as frequent as what you would hear on an episode of &quot;The Simpsons.&quot;2) The dialogue, in the minds of some, is terrible. When you hear someone say that the speech in the story is mostly &quot;He really did,&quot; &quot;It really was,&quot; &quot;I really did&quot; etc they are telling the truth. The simple truth is that Holden does not have a really dynamic or artistic voice, but then again he is a 17 year old who gets kicked out of just about every school he attends. How do you expect him to talk? I think Salinger did a great job of capturing the voice of his very unique character.All in all I think it is a great book, and worth the time to read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"When I first picked up Catcher in the Rye, around three months ago (my mom said I would love the book and that I should read it at thirteen...so of course I avoided it at all costs;) I was in really bad shape emotionally. I, 16, have been frustrated with school and was having trouble relating to all of humanity (I'm kind of messed up to begin with, but this was bad.) I basically buried my entire life into the my music, or the viola (I still do, actually) and I blatantly refused to put even the slightest effort into school (its pretty Totalitarian in New York....regents) and I felt like no one understood me. Then I finally discovered Holden.He helped me through this school year, I swear to god. Everything he said I could immediatly relate to, every word that came out of his mouth seemed to give me a new hope for humanity; He helped me beleive that i wasn't alone in a world that is blinded by money and snobbery and pointless fads, and I finally didn't feel like such a loner anymore (I was into music, but it was totally ego driven at school and everyone [was bad] anyways.)I enjoyed Holden's adventure because he didn't do what society wanted him to do- he knew that if he were to find his soul and niche in the world he couldn't conform to other's expectations. He was, whether anyone thinks so or not, a brilliant and creative person whom was lost in the world, and not only did I identify with him as a Teenager but also as an aspiring creative mind.Along with Catcher in the Rye there are two other things, in different media forms, that I adore and beleive the Holden fans will adore also. They are the comic book and Movie Ghost World. Ghost world, like Catcher, has a very bitter and cynical theme, and the plot also takes a backseat to the emotions and impulses of the character (another part of Catcher that I loved) I won't get into Ghost world-I'll just say that it is unbeleivable and visionary, like catcherIgnore the many Gramatical errors...I really don't [care] if they were there or not so I didn't check"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"'And indeed we see it ever falleth out that the forbidden writing is thought to be certain sparks of a truth that fly up in the faces of those that seek to choke it, and tread it out.'-- Francis BaconIt has often been commented upon that the best way for an author to achieve fame (and, if still alive, fortune) is to have his or her book banned. Of course, one has to play it right. Part of Galileo's initial fame came from the efforts of the Church to suppress his writings--as he stayed in Church-dominated areas, he didn't achieve much fortune.Controversy worked well also for J.D. Salinger (Jerome David Salinger). He was an American-born (actually, New York City-born) author whose only enduringly popular piece has been 'Catcher in the Rye', which continues to sell a quarter-million copies annually.'Catcher in the Rye' follows the tale of Holden Caulfield, a boarding-school truant who critiques society and himself in the course of trying to achieve adulthood, most expressly typified by the typical American rite of passage, that of losing one's virginity. Caulfield is in many ways a typical male adolescent, both naive and worldly in an odd mixture; both passionate and violent without mature ways of expression; sullen, withdrawn, yet yearning for acceptance and love.In many ways it has become an anthem or manifesto of violence against a phoney system. The man who shot John Lennon was influenced by this book, as was the man who shot Ronald Reagan. 'What scares me most is the other guy's face...'Of course, to ban this book is to admit that there is something that needs to be considered and dealt with about youthful, and particularly male youthful, drives and desires. So much of society seems inadequate to the task of giving a framework for this. Lest you think I am decrying modern society in favour of a 'Father Knows Best' world, remember -- 'Catcher in the Rye' was published in 1951. There is something timeless about the struggles of adolescence. There is likewise something timeless about the overall difficulty of dealing with society which is simultaneously moralising and falling from grace.This is no case of banning Edmund Crull's treatise on the curing of venereal diseases (circa 1708, a quack treatise that always advocated cures that, not surprisingly, could always be procured in Crull's shop); it really isn't even of the calibre of a banning a la D.H. Lawrence, which could have a more prurient element as the focus of the bans -- 'Catcher in the Rye' is in issues of language and sexual expression in no way untypical of many unbanned books. But, it espouses a critique of society that is uncomfortable while using a base language and subject to do so -- this is a combination, a pile of straws with one straw too many, for many jurisdictions to bear.So, as D.H. Lawrence would perhaps pen, the 'censor-moron is on the loose'.In John Guare's recent play/film, 'Six Degrees of Separation', the character Paul states that his thesis in college had been on 'Catcher in the Rye'. He launches into his own analysis of the text with his own critique of society, made all the more ironic as the play progresses by the fact that Paul is every bit as phony as the society which both he and Caulfield blast with scathing observation. In essence, they are right at home, save for the fact that they both make the more comfortable set less comfortable.A book worthy of being banned is worthy of being read! I don't know, in point of fact, that I would recommend the book (not really my kind of literature), save for the banning. And thus, the censors lose again."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The quintessential coming of age book. Holden Caulfield is on the lam from the prep school he's flunked out of. His name alone has become synonomous with teenage angst. Sad, enlightening, hilarious, ultimately hopeful, if you haven't yet read it, do so. Then buy another copy and give it to your favorite teen."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. There is so much symbolism and so much personification that you will find yourself believing that you actually know the main character. This book sends a strong message to all readers about growing up and protecting yourself and others from falling into a world full of phonies. This is one of the greatest books ever written."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I enjoyed this book, but would not consider it to be a great piece of literature. It was a great character, one of the best, but still not a very memorable book, in my opinion. Still recommend though, especially to teens."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"When I first read &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; I was 11, yet even then the book left a lasting impression on me. Recently I read it again, and the second time I read it I found that I could relate to it even more.Holden Caulfield, the main character of the book, is so strong a character that he easily becomes real to the reader. I think that the reason many people do not like this book is because Holden Caulfield represents too much truth; often people like to be shielded from the modern world and its people. The people I've talked to about &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; seem to be on one of two sides; they either love the book or hate it. There is no middle ground.&quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; represents the very essence of a troubled teenager's life. J.D. Saliginer brings the reader into the text by using simple yet complex language, and for some people this is too much. Some people do not want to relive this feeling, or even just experience it. How do you feel?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I admit i'm a teen. I read this book pretty quickly and i usually dont read much but this has inspired me to check out Sallinger's other writings. What's wrong with most teens is they don't understand how people feel. This teaches that with a great point of view by Holden Caulfield. A must read for everyone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I found The Catcher in the Rye to be an adequately decent book in which I found myself captivated and intrigued. Notwithstanding, I feel that the novel was overrated and came no where near my high expectations. This is not to say that the book was not enjoyable, for it certainly enraptured my attention, but I feel that a person's time could be better spent. You are captured into the life of the severely disturbed adolescent boy, Holden Caulfield. Time seems to last forever in Holden's depressing world consumed by phonieness. Holden could never seem to find anything that pleases him, and was once again flunking out of school. He was not an asinine boy, however, effort was not something he often practiced. Unless Holden was amazingly stimulated by a topic, which was hardly the case, Holden would exemplify no effort, for he saw no point. He begins these five perpetual days with a great deal of cash which is quickly spent at nearby bars and clubs where he hopes to encounter a friend. However, when he is actually invited to join someone he declines for the mood is never befitting. Numerous dates and calls are made to many of his old acquaintances hoping to restore past relationships. At first, he finds him self in love, but ends hating them for as always they're just \\"phonies\\" and counterfeit. Holden experiences numerous issues and doubts that are greatly common among adolescents today. Almost every person of every personality feels a relation to Holden's views of day to day life and the world surrounding him. In my opinion, however, Holden's character appeared somewhat obnoxious, and it is still an enigma to me how this book was ever considered a \\"classic.\\" Nonetheless, this book should not be viewed in a negative light; it is a commendable piece of literature that I would comfortably recommend."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"There is simply nothing left to add for those who already KNOW this is one of the great classic novels in American literature, except the following. There are many writers who are writing profound treatments of various aspects of American culture. Yet the literary poo-baahs, such as the high and mighty editors at the New York Times Book Review and the New Yorker CHOOSE who they focus attention on. And that's part of what makes this book so timeless in its commentary on society. The phoniness Holden encounters is timeless. It pervades all aspects of our culture even in 2002. As an author of nonfiction who has enjoyed a taste of acclaim, I know from where I speak.Recognition involves talent and politics, with particular emphasis on the latter. Yet, we're supposed to act like this isn't true, and if you simply work hard you'll get your just reward. That's b.s., the same way Holden dramatizes it was b.s. in the New York City existing in the early 1950s. I keep rereading this book, as well as Ralph Ellison's &quot;Invisible Man,&quot; a timeless look at racial realities that remain true in 2002, because of the manner in which they reveal the stubborn aspects of human nature that refuse to be scrubbed away. For those who just don't get why this book is simple brilliance, too bad. It is one of the Great American Novels, written in the voice of a teen, yet with wisdom people of all ages can appreciate. As a result, Sallinger had to go into hiding after it hit big, because everyone sought him out. He's now in his 80s. I hope he has lived a happy life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I was very impressed with the book. I thought Salinger did an excellent job of writing such a detailed three day excursion in just 214 days. Of all of the books I've had to read in my high school career, I've only completed three books, and this being one of them. The book was written in such an irregular way, and that's why I think I enjoyed it so much. Catcher wasn't grammatically put together. I would reccomend this book to people, but only if they can handle going from one scene to the next in a few short words. The only part I didn't like so much was the ending, because the novel just ends abruptly. I guess that can be a good thing too, because it leaves it up to the imagination as to what happens to Holden."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The way the book starts, it grabs your attation, at least it did to mine.

Overall this was a great book and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I remember reading this book when I was in high school, but many years have passed since then. My own kids recently were assigned this book for their own literature class, and I decided to pick it up and re-read it. Wow!! This book is awesome. I got a lot more out of it now, as an adult, and it put me in better touch with some issues that kids face when they reach that point in their lives where they are expected to make a life transition. I would NEVER forbid my kids from reading this book. It is very insightful and touching, and was even more powerful for me today than when I read it 30 years ago."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"October 10, 2002Catcher in the RyeHave you ever been kicked out of high school, but you still hadn't told your parents, and you don't want them to find out? So you go on a train to New York and take it from there? But you never thought ahead? Step into Holden Caulfield's shoes and find out.This book The Catcher in the Rye is a book that has been censored through out the country. That doesn't stop it from being a good book though. This book has amazing writing and is a very good story. It is a good story because you can't that this might have really happened to someone; and it's also nice o get another's teenagers point view of a few things. This book might be a little offensive or inappropriate because this story is about a boy that is having a nervous break down. In addition this book has a lot of cursing.This book is about a teenager boy that gets expelled from school before winter vacation. Before going to see his parent he takes a short vacation of his own to New York; but I wouldn't say it was the best action ever. During his vacation he has a nervous break down because he is so depressed about almost everything.This book probably for someone that likes good writing and likes an adult adventure into New York. So if you don't mind the cursing and a little depression then this book is defiantly for you."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book tells the tale of a 16-year old boy, Holden Caulfield, who got expelled from prep school and throughout the book he seems to be looking for something, kind of like an aimless wander to find subtlety. It gave a new dimension to reading, with the narrator being more sagacious and cynical, as opposed to the more amaible narrators in previous books up to that time, and it realistically gives an accurate insighty to a cofused adolescent's life during a time of such confusion and experiences. It's definitely an honest and a no-holds-barred book, and it may be a stretch to say that this book is almost 'mandatory reading,' but it should definitely be read no matter who you are."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the rye is by far the best book I have ever read, and It is amazing to me just how ahead of its time and controversial it was back in the early fifties.

I loved the way he thought and especially,how he talked. This was one of the greatest books i've ever read, especially for school!!!!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher In The Rye, by J.D. Salinger, is a book about a guy named Holden Caulfield. Holden Caulfield was a guy that had no direction in life. He went to different schools not being able to complete a year there. He was never able to really focus in school. What led me to believe, why he was such a disturbed person, was due to his brothers death. His brother's name was Allie Caulfield. Holden and Allie had a very good relationship and it seemed that Allie was the only person Holden got along with. Holden's brothers death affected him so much that he demonstrated his anger by breaking the windows of his house with his bare fist. Holden was never himself after Allies death. This seems to be when everything goes wrong for him - in school and with his friends. Holden begins to feel depressed and lost the meaning of life. He begins to let his frustration out by experimenting with various things, in search of finding love and the purpose of life. I believe, in order for Holden to have realized that there was hope and much love in his life, he needed to experience difficult situations and learn to overcome them. I recommend this novel to those who have had many harsh experiences and have a need to understand life's ups and down. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this book a seven, because in some aspects of the story, I can relate my life to the character."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I thought it was very interesting and theres no other character quite like the prince himself"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I believe that Holden is angry at people because of his brother .

Also that he hates how people slip into an abyss and of deciet and hypocracy when they breach their teen years . Look closely ; in the story who does he hate ? People when they grow up because they are &quot;phonies&quot; . And then look at his dream . I won't spoil the book but think about what comes after childhood , the &quot;phonies&quot; . Now think about what the field represents . So read the book ."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger's &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;, must have been the best book I have ever read. At the age of 15, I felt that Salinger's character, Holden Caulfield, relates to teens including myself. Holden is the type of character that drinks, smokes, has a problem with liars and phonies, and relating with people in general. I think the language, events, and the emotions had to be the part that interested me the most. In my opinion, &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; earns 5-stars ***** for its creativity and suspense.

My mother went out and bought it for me, and from the moment I read the first sentence I loved it.

You may finish it in an hour but without disecting it, even disembowelling it if you may, you will never get the underlying message that is being conveyed by this gem of a book. One of the beauties of this book lie in the fact that this thorough exposition of the human condition talks to you as the character Phoebe, but in truth shouts at you as Holden Caulfield. Only after putting the book down and immersing yourself in all the details, but at the same time looking at it as a raven would a carcass, from the air, will one truly see the essence of the story. Indeed not meant for the superficial. Even superficially, it can hold its end. Its precious if one gets to finish this book, but it's priceless if one gets its message."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read the Catcher in the Rye, and I thought it was great.

Holden understands the Human race, sees its many flaws, and it is this which drives him into his depression. In other words the people who didn't understand this book are not the Holdens of this world, they are proabbly the &quot;phonies&quot;. Those who truly did, I don't mean they could just relate to him, they truly understood him, are in it with Holden: Trying to struggle through the absolute horror of life. I am not just being melodramatic, life isn't a nice business and it is those who &quot;misunderstand&quot; this book which that make it that way.

I still found it brilliant at times, although it still seemed to drift somewhat without any direction I could decipher. But the good sections were VERY GOOD, so Catcher in the Rye still gets four stars from me. &quot;The Triumph and the Glory&quot; was great, the young pilot reminded me of Holden Caulfield."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is a simple masterpiece. I do believe though, that it takes a certain kind of person to enjoy it to this extent. Holden Caulfield cannot in any way be characterized as a typical teenager. In fact he's not a regular person at all. J. D. Salinger in this book brilliantly takes us into Holden's exquisit mind, and exposes us to a whole new perception of life. I can honestly say this book had changed me and made me see the real imortance in life. Anybody who cannot understand this book this way now-never will.

Amazingly entertaining and witty. I read it more than once and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed J. D. Salinger's, The Catcher in the Rye. It would usually take me about a month to read a book, but not this one. I could hardly put it down. In my opinion, this book is very well-written, and I can't find any reason to criticize this great piece by Salinger. I especially enjoyed the main character of the book, Holden Caulfield. He is a troubled teen who can't seem to get his life straightened out. He has flunked out of many schools, and at the time of this story is flunking out of a rich school called Pency. The whole story takes place in a span of just over two days in New York City. Holden is preparing to go home and tell his parents that he has flunked out of yet another school. In this story, there is only one person who Holden cares about, his kid sister, Phoebe. Everyone else he dislikes, mostly because he thinks they are phomies. There is one part of the book I particularly enjoyed. Holden is on a train and runs into a woman who has a son who goes to Pency. Holden begins telling the mother what a wonderful son she has, and how well-liked he is In real life, he is a very disliked boy whom no one can stand to be around. J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye is and always will be one of my favorite books of all time. It is truly a classic that people will enjoy for years to come. I would recommend this book to both genders from teens to adults. This book is not suitable for younger children because of the harsh language."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I never read such a boring, depressing or un-captivating book in my life.

The rather 'simple' language with 'bad words' used here is essential to giving the book its reality since the narrator is supposed to be a 16yr old. In fact, the brilliance of the book is its ability to articulate the moment, the emotions, without the use of overly flamboyant bombastic literary jargon that is in itself a component of the 'phoniness of the adult' that Houldon despises. Anyone who reads this book and doesn't understand the angst has to be some socially-to-well-adjusted bourgeois common-minder who ignorantly refuses to believe that such emotions, and the people who have them, exist out there. Houldon is the prototypical teenager confused with the pain and angst common to many in his transitory state, and is the antihero of the teen generation."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'd be lying if I said that I knew exactly how to review this book. The story is meant to be a simple one, but the complexity of young Holden Caulfield, the opinions he holds, and the manner which he so candidly speaks them, keeps the reader guessing and thinking long after the book has been finished.Holden is so straight forward, so easily spoken, that I couldn't help but smile at his written thoughts, even when they occasionally seemed petty and immature. Now, don't get me wrong, I love the book and I love the character, but you have to admit, he does tend to gripe.(just a little though)I doubt there are many of us who have already forgotten our teenage years(some of our fellow Salinger readers are still in them)but if you have managed this awe inspiring feat of memory loss then I'll clue you in. They were awkward. And the author's use of sprawling, disjointed, narrative does a good job of thrusting that fact right back into our face. We, as Holden demonstrates so well, experimented with opinion, were quick to judge our peers(an unfortunate number of us were on the losing end of that trait), heard our speak grow sharper, and realized that &quot;phonies,&quot; as Holden so casually put it, were everywhere.Then came dorm life and the first meeting with our very own Stradlater. Obnoxious, vain, indifferent, and strangely likable even with these faults. Don't you think Holden cared about Stradlater in a way? Granted, they did fight, and hurtful words were thrown around, but I found it next to impossible during my own school years to easily push someone I spent so much time with aside, even when that time wasn't necessarily voluntary. I doubt Holden would be any different. Part of me wishes I had been given the chance to find out.Salinger does something amazing with this book. He helps us remember. Even as I've been writing this ramble of a review, memories of friends I haven't seen and places I've been just keep popping into mind. Holden states at the end of his story: &quot;I don't know what the hell to say. If you want to know the truth, I don't know what I think about it. I'm sorry I told so many people about it. About all I know is, I sort of miss everybody I told about. Even old Stradlater and Ackley, for instance. I think I even miss that goddam Maurice. It's funny. Don't ever tell anybody anything. If you do, you start missing everybody.&quot;It is funny. How things remind you I mean. And how things once so difficult seem so humorous and easy in hindsight.Folks, don't let this book slip through your fingers. Grab hold, read slowly, and soak in what it has to say. Even if it does ramble.Just like me."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield is angry, afraid and frustrated, but most of all, he's human. Holden possesses a quality that every human being can relate to- be it rage, fear, love, or the need to protect everyone from everything- including themselves. Holden needs love, and he strives to preserve innocence. He feels he has to be the savior- a catcher in the rye. The Catcher in the Rye addresses many issues. It is a commentary on the insensitivity of modern society. Holden is a hero who stands against the hypocrisy that almost all others accept. As much as he would like to accept the world and be comfortable like almost everyone else, he can't pretend that his society is worthwhile. The novel is about a boy who struggles to remain faithful to what he sees as the truth. His version of truth, however, is very subjective, and not necessarily correct. In his mind even good or beautiful things can be tainted because of the true motives of their creators. But primarily, this is a novel about a disturbed teenager who refuses to grow up, and let go. He has a fixation on childhood, which shows itself in his glorifying of children, his inordinate admiration of his younger sister, his idealization of his dead younger brother, and the joy he gets from reminiscing about his own childhood. He brings on his illness so he won't have to face his approaching adulthood. He's afraid of what lies ahead in his life, and clings to what he knows will protect him- that innocence that all children possess."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this twice, the first time expecting it to be the greatest book ever, the second without all the expectations and just for a good read. Both times I was disappointed. Don't understand why a kid with a bad attitude makes for such a popular book. By page 50, he had me mad at everything. Maybe I'm shallow, but I don't understand the world's love affair with Holden Caulifield, nor anything he represents.

I knew it was supposed to be this great classic and everyone was SUPPOSED to love it, so I, of course, didn't want to be like everyone else. Unlike the rest of America, it wasn't required reading at my school, so I didn't know much about it. I read Nine Stories, also by Salinger, just by randomly picking up the book in the library, and I really fell for his writing style. The great thing about Salinger's writing is that he portrays the nuances and quirks of human behavior in a realistic, engaging manner. The Catcher in the Rye is about the everyboy, the everyteenager. Anyone who has searched for his identity and his place in the world can relate to the story. Holden Caulfield embodies the idiotic, impulsive, emotional teenager. Salinger didn't write a character, he held a mirror to an American archetype. This is a touching book, and what makes it so touching is that it doesn't try to be. Holden is sometimes a moron, sometimes the nice guy, sometimes profound, but always interesting. This is a great book, and not because it's a &quot;classic,&quot; but because it doesn't push. It's simply a great story that speaks truth at every turn. If you don't mind seeing the word &quot;goddam&quot; on every page, you'll love this book. It's a rewarding read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"... Catcher in the Rye is a wonderful piece of literature that is easy to read, funny and wise. I loved it!While not very plot-driven, Catcher in the Rye tells the story of 16-year-old Holden Caulfield, a cynical, jaded teenager who is expelled from boarding school for his bad grades and lack of classroom attendance. The story spans the two days after leaving his school and follows Holden on his journey home via hotels, bars, and bus stations. And while the premise of the story doesn't sound like much, reading this book was a lot of fun and some may even being able to identify with Holden's attitude toward life.Having read this for the sheer pleasure of it, I'm now pondering the reasons Catcher in the Rye has reached its \\"classic\\" status. Possibly it broke new ground with all of its cursing and sex-talk, which was most likely unheard of in the 40s, much less from a novel written through the point of view of a teenager.

There's also the little matter of this book's influence on the stalker who deprived humanity of the presence of John Lennon: admittedly that was in my mind, whether it fairly deserved to be or not. The Catcher in the Rye emits the scent of its mediocrity like a radioactive glow, and if it were to be read in unbiased fashion sans a reader's prejudiced knowledge that this is \\"One Of Those Important Books You MUST Read Or Be Non-Literate\\" then that reader would probably instantly identify the novel's inherent lack of greatness. I think I approached it with a fair mindset, giving it a fair chance and frankly expecting to like it when all was said and done. In the end I felt like a joke had been played on somebody, if not me alone then certainly the American public as a whole.The plot of this hollow book can be analyzed as follows: preppie kid doesn't realize how easy his life is, has an unidentified need for struggle in his soul but the laziness of the life he has been given deprives him of the chance to struggle, labor, explore, spread his wings, so he becomes warped and fills the vacuum of his neutered spirit with mentally unstable contemplations, an unhealthy sister-fixation, and a phobic reaction to the eff-word, the use of which in fiction at the time of this novel's release was shocking and gave it a twist in the direction of \\"bold, daring new horizon sort of book.\\" To someone in 2005, seeing that particular word in a book is about as startling as hearing a toilet flush on a late night cable re-run of All In The Family. Holden Caulfield basically needed a few months spent doing good manual labor on a farm or undertaking volunteer work for an unselfish cause. He needed to quit being so self-absorbed and grow up. It kept coming to mind that young men a few years older than him didn't spend their time going on about the misery of their lives and the hollow nature of human pretensions: they didn't have that luxury while Fascists were shooting at them. Holden is a spoiled brat who wouldn't know a real crisis if it bit his big toe in the kiddie pool. The Catcher in the Rye is a short, lackluster case study in adolescent egoism and middling angst elevated to attempted high art."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this for a school project and was pleased with the flow of it. It's not that hard of a read, and Holden is a very interesting character -- he contradicts himself and is really just as lost and confused as every teenager has ever been. I think everyone has felt like him at one point or another.I don't know why -- besides the cursing -- anyone would ever protest this book. Yes, Holden curses the world, but he even admits that he's just as big a liar as everyone else out there. The obvious hypocrisy is present in all of our lives and it's very easy to see. How anyone could take this as a harmful influence is beyond me."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is much more than a disillusioned youth complaining about life in general. This, at its core, is a very sad story about a boy who lost his childlike innocence too early and recognizes that fact. Holden doesn't want the same thing to happen to all the other &quot;little kids&quot; in the world. I read this book for the first time when I was 14 and loved it. Every time I reread it I get more out of it. Holden's motives and perceptions become clearer to me the older I get. He is not a &quot;spoiled preppie,&quot; as some have purported. He grew up in a rarified environment and that is partly to blame for his view of the world. He mentions several times that he wants to move away to the mountains and live as a deaf mute. This isn't intended to show him as cynical. This shows his reaction to the environment he was lived in all his life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book as a teenager, as a part of my literature class in highschool. I admit that it took me several tries to end it, because I didn't connect to it at all.Surprisingly, all of my friends loved it, and talked about how \\"Cool\\" the book is. Others simply read it as you study for an exam, memorizing.Knowing that it is a classic, and attracted by its author's alleged mystery and the conspiracy theories related to the book, I was glad to have a chance to read it.However, as I said, it was hard to get through. Holden Coalfield, the main character, didn't appeal to me at all. It was impossible for me to identify with him or to understand him. Salinger's writing didn't help the reading to be any easier, on the contrary. The way the sentences are designed and the general weirdness of the book, made me dislike it.Not so long ago I saw a review of the book in the New York Times that said exactly that, and I was happy to find that someone whose opinion worth stating agrees with me.As he says there, I don't see \\"The Catcher\\" as universal. I think that it appeals, if at all, only to the American youth, and if others enjoy it, it might be a proof to the place American Culture is getting abroad. I don't think it's brilliant, and it's defiantly not one of the best books I've read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye was a very unique reading experience, and it presented a very realistic and straight view of life. The main character, Holden Caulfield, is an adolescent who is very rebellious and immature. His use of constant profanity enhances the books realism and the ability for identification with other teen-agers. The fact he did not wish to obey the bounds of society helped me understand I was not alone in my struggle against authority. Its ending morale is very inspiring and illustrates a change that occurs in your life when you begin to take a different perspective. I also thought the elusive title's meaning was very profound once realized and clinched my liking of the book. It has a very positive message in the end, which is able to be conveyed through the controversy the book exhibits. The book also has an outer political war it wages for the first amendment. I feel that the books paradox, the fact it is a quality piece of literature while using some vulgarity to convey the idea, strikes a blow for the freedom of speech. The overwhelming honesty and frankness of the book with its profanity, which illustrates its reality, denounce the view of those who feel their morals are being violated by freedom of speech. I do have some problems with the book and Holden's behavior and viewpoints. The book is very slow in the beginning and actually throughout its duration. Its pace is awkward because Holden is always reassuring us in small sentences like, \\" I really did.\\" He also calls many people \\"phony\\", and when you begin to understand his perspective, he becomes hypocritical and \\"phony\\" himself. This makes Holden less credible in conveying ideas to you, which may be Salinger's intent. I also thought that the character of Phoebe played an important role in how one perceived the book. Phoebe was the metaphorical child by the metaphorical cliff that Holden must metaphorically catch. This was actually very significant because by Holden saving his little sister from his lifestyle, he also saved himself. This gave the most positive outlook on the book, by showing salvation was possible at any juncture of your life. I liked the idea that the unruly Holden could still have enough clarity to see what he was doing was wrong and he should not want to inflict it on one he cares about. Holden's Yang type quality gives him a seductive aspect while allowing him to teach a powerful lesson, which is why the book is so appealing to me and other adolescents."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I think The catcher in the rye is a reall ygreat book , really interrestant , the kind of book you can't get out of .

And let's face it, most of what we have you read is kinda boring. However, there are a couple of books we assign which are really worth it. NO, not a Seperate Peace or Alls Quiest, but books like To Kill a Mockingbird, Julius Caesar, and Catcher in the Rye.Catcher in the Rye is a great book. The adventures of Holden Caufield will be enjoyed. Holden's mental collapse and visit to NYC are just as relevent now as when Salinger wrote this book years ago.This is a book that after you are forced to read it in school, that you will read again on your own. Its worth it. Dont Cheat, forget Cliff and Spark notes...read this book. You will be glad you did."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I just finished reading The Catcher In The Rye for a school project. Everyone said it was a great story but I didn't know what to think, so I went ahead and read it. I'm very glad that I did! Holden Caufield is a character that I believe will never be repeated. His negativity is brought forth by an intense focus upon other people's lives and the reactions they get from others in the world. Salinger allows Caufield to talk about life's most important topics in a not so serious manner. At first I had this sense of feeling that Holden was very insecure with himself which made him believe everyone around him had a fake personna, but towards the end of the book I realized that he actually had other people's best interests at heart. I enjoyed the book and I felt like it was an easy read but had a very indepth meaning. If you don't mind a little bit of foul language...this book is fabulous. It makes you think about life and the people around you on a day to day basis."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Some people live their lives thinking that many people are 'fake.' There you meet Holden Caufield who thinks that everyone has a fake personna about themselves. He is very negative and condradicts people. This book is very entertaining and is an easy read. Salinger uses many kinds of language to allow the reader to get what they want out of the book. It is a really good book for people who think others are fake because it makes you have an entire different outlook on life. This book was an easy read and I recommend it to people above the age of 13 because of the foul language. I really enjoyed the book though."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Ernest Hemmingway once said, &quot;all of American Literature comes from one novel, Huck Finn.&quot; Today Sallanger's Catcher in the Rye is the story of Initiation for the Twentieth Century. Holden Caufield is the typical anti-hero, that everyone comes to admire by the end of the novel. With the Great Gatsby, The Catcher in the Rye is one of American liturature's marvells."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher In The Rye was a great book and it keept me intrested the whole time I was reading it. The only problem I have with it is that there seems to be no point to the story. I know it is supposted to show the difficulties of being a teen and all, but the story dosent go anywhere. Other then that the book was very good and involving."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is my bible. I have read it 27 times. I f you have a problem with this book, then YOU have a mental problem and absolutely no tase whatsoever in literature. The underlying themes in this book are monumentally moraly impacting in my life.

I believe that you will be a better person for it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield was the best character in any book ever written. J.D. Salinger did an excellent job at catching the reader's eye by making Holden's expierences worth reading. If you only read one book in your life, be sure to read this one."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm sure I was supposed to read this book in high school but it was so long ago, I can't recall reading it (not to mention that I didn't care for school, like my new friend Holden Caulfield). It is refreshing to read a book that is written as though the main character is talking to you, and not so concerned about grammar and proper writing etiquette. Since the book was written in the fifties, a lot of the stories and scenery seem dated. Some important things about the book, for me at least: 1) the book is short (around 200 pages); 2) easy to read - never a dull moment; and 3) not too fast-paced like a novel written by a lawyer. Before I bought the book, I read the reviews on Amazon.com and even considered the negative ones before I bought the book. But now, having read Catcher, I would guess that those people are the ones that Holden would refer to as phonies. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that has Attention Deficit Disorder (or self-diagnosed ADD, like myself) OR to those of you that just don't care to read books much (also, like myself)."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Like so many others, I first encountered this book in high school. I can't really remember what I thought about it then; as cynical and distrustful of authority as I was, it didn't have much impact on my life. When I reread it recently, I experienced all the things that people who love this book have already described to the point of cliche. I couldn't put the book down. I can't think of another book where I was so impressed with colloquial writing often filled with poor grammar. It's one of those rare books that change on further readings, and I'm sure it will be rewarding when I revisit it later on.There's an irony to the censorship this book often calls for. Holden tries to do some censoring himself near the end of the book. He keeps finding a particular vulgarity written on the walls, even on a glass case in a museum. He wants to protect the innocence of children, but he can't go on erasing this word from walls forever. And you know that he has grown up, if only a little bit, when he realizes that you have to let kids do what they want, and &quot;if they fall off, they fall off, but it's bad if you say anything to them. I wish the censor-crazed would grow up a little too."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Before I got past the first page of this book, I was hooked. While some of these reviews tend to identify Holden as a stereotypical teenager, and teen angst ridden, I knew right away he wasn't stereotypical. Most teenagers wouldn't worry as much as he would. Most of his comments aren't angry as much as down right honest. This book centers around the theme of a guy trying to save innoncence, and his refusal to see that it's impossible. Funny thing is, most of the people that write him off as whiny are the very people that Holden is against."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have to admit, even if you don't like or connect with Holden Caulfield, this is an excellent read. Our confused teenager is trying to escape the responsibilities of modern society, and proving he is vulnerable along the way. Ironically, he sees himself as above the average man (or &quot;phony&quot;, as Holden reiterates). I read this over two days - about the length of time of the story itself. I had trouble putting the book down, as Holden spiraled out of control, I kept wondering how it would end. Fortunately, he had two saviors - his younger siblings - one of which only being a fond memory. I am convinced his destiny was saved only when he woke up to the terrible life turn to which he was inspiring his sister. This is not a cheery book, but it is real drama, certainly not &quot;phony&quot;."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I don't even know how to begin. It's hard to put my feelings into words. But this hyped book has really affected me, and I recognised myself a lot. I think it has affected many people. For example the person who assassinated John Lennon. He had read it several times before the assassination. I definitely can't see any reason for killing someone after reading this book!I think many teenagers recognise themselves in the book, because this is a story about a young man who feels like he doesn't belong anywhere. He just feels like a lost soul. That's the way you sometimes feel when you are in your teens. You try a lot of different trails before you find the right track. Many youngsters are most likely identifying themselves with Holden Caulfield -the main character in the novel. He is a normal teenager who has been kicked out of his school, Pencey Prep, because he flunked all his subjects except English. With fear of going home he spends some days in New York among bars, parks, cinemas and phoneys which he calls almost everyone. We follow him during his adventures in N. Y. It's a very tragic book, but at the same time it is very funny. Holden describes and remarks on everything in a way that makes you smile. But in a way it isn't right to smile at him, because he is a very depressed boy, who doesn't seem to like anybody or anything. It seems to me that the only things he really cares about is his little sister and being the catcher in the rye. He wants to save kids from falling from the edge of a cliff. That's what he wants to do all day.It is his sister who convinces him to return home after the few days in N.Y., and that's also what he does. Well at home he is taken to a hospital and it's from a bed in the hospital he tells us the whole story.The story contains loads of flashbacks which can make it a bit tricky to read. The language is also filled with lots of swearing and slang. It was written 40 years ago, (published 1959) but I'm impressed by how modern his language is. In the beginning it was a bit annoying with Holdens &quot;americanisms\\", but after a while you get used to it. Then you don't bother about the \\"phoneys\\", the madmen or the other \\"helluva \\"stuff that just kills him.The writer manages extremely well with making us sympathise with the honest Holden. You really can feel what he feels and sometimes you just want to crawl into the book and take him home with you, and show him how wonderful life actually is. But the outcast Holden can't see things like that. He's caught up in his cage and thinks everything is terrible. But I think that deep inside of him there's a great loving side. He just doesn't know where to search for it and how to express himself."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"(...) The Catcher in the Rye: by J.D. Salinger.My opinion:I rather find it a good book because it is not boring to read and it is also written in a fluent way. There is a lot of vartiation in this story.The story is told by a boy, who&#8217;s name is Holden and he tells about his own life, what he has been through and about his feelings. While he is telling his story you get to know the other characters.The story is told in a very pleasant manner. There aren&#8217;t many difficult words. So when you start reading the book you want to read it in one breath.The persons in the book are discribed very clear because you also get to know what they think and who they really are. For examle: you get a lot of infortmation about Holden&#8217;s little sister Phoebe, who likes Holden very much.The story is also very interresting because the main character is a 17 year old boy, so he has almost the same age as me. We are in the same position, for examle we have the same age like I said already and we are both students. So I can imagine what he wants to tell and that it isn&#8217;t always so easy to make friends and that the lessons can be very boring.This story goes about daily events. It&#8217;s a non-fiction story because there are so many students who struggle with themselves and with there studies at this age. There are also many student who are repeaters just like Holden.I like the main character as well because he is not such a boring person but he makes sometimes jokes and he has also a good sense of humour.My final conclusion is that I first thaught it would be rather difficult to read an englisch book for the first time, but finally I&#8217;m glad I read it !!!!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Opinion about &quot;The Catcher in the Rye.&quot;Normally I rather prefer thrillers or books where things are happening fast but despite this I have enjoyed reading this story. Although I don't like to read very much, especially not when it's an assignment and certainly not when it's about 200 pages, I thought it was a successful book. When I started reading I couldn't stop because I always wanted to find out what was going to happen next and what Holden's (principal character) emotion/reaction would be.The main reason why I enjoyed reading the book was the well written and extensive descriptions of the persons and their feelings. I was so fascinated that it felt like I was right in the middle of the story, just like an observer. Also the nice description of the environment made me feel like it happened to me. Another very refreshing aspect in the story was the language which was the language used by the young and the way some words were written just as they were spoken.What I didn't like was the constant repetition of some words and sentences. This made it boring to read sometimes.If we add this all up, the positive sides win from the negative ones. So all in all, it has my approvement to be sold !!!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye (J.D. Salinger)I can't really say I liked this book, but I also disliked it. There isn't really a story in it. Just a boy, who is kicked out in his school. But in a few days the Christmas vacation starts. So he decided not to go home till then. In the book he's telling what he's doing this time. The book is quite funny. For example: he way he's asking what will happen with ducks in the winter. Normal people wouldn't even think about it.I don't like Holden very much. He seems to me very labile. And he gets so easy depressed; almost everything makes him depressed. He is just pathetic. He doesn't really believe in something, he has no butt in his life. He isn't motivated to do something with it, to make something of his life. I find him a bit a loser.There is just not really happening something in this book.It was quite amusing to read it, but at the end it was a bit boring. I would have like it more when he came home and told something about the confrontation with his parents.But roughly you can say it wasn't too bad."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is the best book I have ever read in my short 17 years. I don't doubt that I'll read more amazing or truthful books, but this one really hit home with me. Holden Caulfield thinks and talks like any cynical, insecure, complex teenager, even now in the year 2000. This book made me laugh so hard I cried, and made me relate so much that I could've cried. JD Salinger has created, to me, one of the most potent and memorable characters in literature. Holden represents discovery, change, and acceptance in a world full of phonies and cynics. This book is so good. Don't even buy the paperback, just go straight for the hardcover so it'll last longer."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"First of all, I agree with that one guy who said that the readers who try to assume Holden's identity are missing the point. I also think that by saying Holden is a typical American teenager, you are overlooking a few things- for one, his emotions may be typical, but his environment and his affluence are certainly not. He speaks for the American teenager, but he is definitely not the typical American teenager. Remember- Holden is telling his story from a psychiatric hospital. Salinger made Holden an extreme. His actions were extreme, his words were extreme... he did not wear a mask... he was an effusive, uninhibited bundle of emotion, of ambivalence. I think that nearly every teenager feels the same as Holden does. We all, at times, wish to be saved from the adult world- while at the same time, we think that we deserve to be treated like adults. When I read it the first time, I was Holden's age- 16. I saw Holden as a genius. I thought that he spoke truth with every word. Now, I am 18.. even in those two years I have developed a new perspective on Holden and his &quot;genius.&quot; When I was 16, I didn't see Holden's immaturity- I saw his actions as brave and noble. After reading it again yesterday, I was able to really see his fear of growing up and his fear of the inevitable. I saw it when I was 16 in myself; I guess I just recognized it as something else. I think I am rambling. I guess that my point is- read it when you are Holden's age- absorb the 16 year old world as much as you can.. then allow yourself a while, and read it again.. because I appreciated it this time in an entirely different way."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"..........A 1950s teenager kicked out of his fourth prestigious prep school. A teenager who runs away to live on the streets of New York City. A teenager who undergoes countless adventures, from aggravating his roommates while still at school, to other antics after running away, such as hiring a prostitute and fighting her pimp, sneaking drinks from bars and getting drunk, irritating cab drivers with trivial questions, making girls cry, and running away from the only man who will help him in his troubles due to homophobia, before finally returning home. He is a teenager recounting his endeavors from the confines of a mental institution. If this sounds exciting to you, then perhaps you should consider reading J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye..........Holden Caulfield is a sixteen year-old student at Pency Preparatory School. Or rather, was a sixteen year-old student at Pency Prep. You see, he has gotten \\"the ax\\" due to his poor grades - failing every subject except for English. In a fit of agitation, fear, and sheer spontaneity, Holden runs away from Pency Prep a few days earlier than when he is supposed to leave, and spends the extra time essentially a fugitive, bearing it out on the streets of New York City..........Although Salinger's mind-blowing epic novel of teen angst and juvenile delinquency was an innovation in the literature of the time (thus keeping it on banned book lists even today), the novel's poor organization and second-rate language mechanics detract from the overall thrilling nature of the story. The book, itself, is overrated. But if you, the reader, can get past the shoddy writing, you will find Catcher in the Rye to be a very enchanting tale, indeed."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"First of all, I can see why people might like this book. J.D. Salinger writes well, and this novel was certainly different from anything else being published at the time. However, I think this book [stinks]. Why? You see, the backbone of the book is the protagonist, the self-absorbed, shallow, wimpy, bitchy, neurotic Holden Caulfield. \\"Catcher in The Rye\\" is basically the ramblings of a lame character, and if you can't stomach Holden's incessant whining there is nothing else to enjoy.Holden Caulfield is not someone I can relate to, nor do I see similarities between him and my peers. He's like the weirdo in high school you felt sorry for but made fun of anyway. I have absolutely no sympathy for Holden. He's a stereotypical rich, priviliged snob, and too stupid to realize that he's as affected and materialistic as the \\"phony\\" people he despises. Holden is depressed, I'll admit that. But instead of facing his problems, he gets kicked out of school, drinks too much, treats women poorly, and spends obscene amounts of money. What a role model. Let's not forget about his relationship with his kid sister, Phoebe. I don't understand why a sixteen-year-old boy would brag about his exploits to his prepubescent sister, burden her with his troubles, and pinch her bottom.Is Holden Caulfield the voice of a generation? I hope not. He is undisputedly a depressed, hormonal teenager. He is not, however, hip, edgy or worth reading about. Holden Caulfield is, in his own famous words, completely and utterly \\"phony.\\" I give this book two stars, only because I enjoyed J.D. Salinger's casual writing style."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Twice now I've read &quot;The Catcher in the Rye.&quot; As a high school freshman, I found it difficult show sympathy towards Holden; I wasn't impressed, engaged, provoked or amused. A year and a half later I could relate much more to his sentiments, though I still don't see any quality in regards to Salinger's writing, execution or characterization. It's either a book you'll love or one you'll hate. And he hyped Pheobe up; she wasn't that interesting."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I hate this kind of thing, I really do. I mean, trying to review this thing when 1249 other people who are smarter than me are phoney and arrogant enough to write some corny review, like it means anything anyway. and all these people identifying with Holden. It kills me. It really does. I mean, who cares? They flash this book title up and tell you there is going to be a catcher...but there isn't a baseball mitt in sight, just some corny story about some illiterate kid with problems. and so what? Don't you hate when someone writes a novel that is timeless, that strikes a chord in the world still in fifty years. it's so corny you could cry, you really could. I think I&quot;m going to give a copy of it to my sister, because you'd like her. and you'll like this book, you really will. even though this review will make no sense if you haven't read the book, you'll probably say it was useful to you. That's the kind of phoney you are"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book about once a year, to keep myself in check. I have to make sure I am not becoming &quot;Phoney.&quot; When I first read this in high school, I didn't relate to Holden all that much. I think I was too apathetic relate to his passion. But as I have become more mature (or jaded, some might say), Holden, and this book have become more and more important to me. Caufield is one of the most dynamic and well drawn characters in modern literature. If there is one drawback to this book, it is a bit dated. But then so is Hamlet. If you havent read it, get your hands on this book, It is unequalled. If you aren't already a bit bitter at the world, at the very least, this book will make you ask yourself why you aren't."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The best I can say of the book is that I could not put it down after I began reading it. Niether could I relate to the character, Caulfield nor did he seem like a very likable person. It was just interesting to see the world through a cynical teenager's eye. Sometimes he does make sense when he wonders at the pretense in our society, but mostly he just comes across as a self -centered, spoilt teen."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I must say that this is one of the most pointless books I have ever read. It seems to appeal to the &quot;typical teenager&quot; who thinks the world is full of hypocrites. The book itself holds no redeeming qualities at all and served no purpose except to waste my time."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I was very disappointed when I read this book. Aside from having no real plot or character development, this was probably the WORST book I have ever read. The story is completely repetitive, it goes like this: Holden Caulfield goes out and does something stupid, complains about it, then goes out and does some other stupid thing. I never once sympathized with Holden because all his failures were HIS OWN FAULT!! I am a 16 year old male, and this was the worst book I ever read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye is a novel of a teenager who pretty much hates everybody. In his derisive, frustrated, bored slang, Holden Caulfield complains about anything and everything in the space of a few hundred pages. This novel has been praised as original and capturing what it is to be a teenager. It was maybe original in its time, but this is not a realistic portrait of adolescence. Most teenagers are not bored whining rich kids who hate everybody.The book mostly fails because the main character is not likeable. the book could just as easily be titled &quot;Holden Caulfield's gripes and complaints against the world&quot;. I don't know about you, but i'd rather not read pedestrian, sycophantic complaints from a mentally unhinged rich kid. But that's just me.Catcher in the Rye is also extremely dated. If it were a decade that inspired nostalgia for dumb pop-culture, like the 70s or 80s, this wouldn't be as much of a problem. But, unfortunately, the book inspires the early 50s, before the decade defined itself as the rock n roll decade. Catcher in the Rye doesn't have much to say that hasn't been said much better and much more engagingly a million times.In short, don't waste your money on this &quot;classic&quot;. Buy some Dave Eggers or Chuck Palahniuk or something *interesting*, for crissakes."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Perhaps the most overrated book I have ever read.

It flows smoothly and doesn't have sophisticated language that teens have to dig through. Also, it's about problems and stuff that teens can relate to so many appreciate this novel.

I personly think that Catcher In The Rye is the most down to earth book I have ever read. I do not belive that there could be a more indepth, realistic and interesting a charictor as Holden. There is no finding a more real charictor! The book made me think more than any book I have ever read. I would understand why people don't like this book (it's not the book it's you), but for those who do your in for the best read of your life! (Holden is not gay- thats for you Even)"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I suppose you want to know what I thought of this story, Holdan Caulfield and all that [garbage]. A lot of what happens to Holden Caulfield is what we've all experienced. Many of us have been chewed out by teachers (but probably not while they're sickly and their pajamas!). A lot of us have blown a date by putting one of our feet in our mouths (&quot;You're giving me a pain in...&quot;). And I think most of us have been obnoxious to our fellow classmates (&quot;I'm really enjoying reading this sentence over and over, Ackley Kid!&quot;).Holden hates phonies, but to a certain extent can be a phony himself (lying about his age and telling his date whom he cares little about he loves her). It seems like the only one who can set him straight is his little sister, a tough girl to fool. She also corrects him on the song &quot;If a body catch a body...&quot;, oops, I mean &quot;meet a body&quot;! Whatever!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is one of the best novels I have ever read. It is funny and real. The character is very realistic and one is able to really relate to him.

The part about him winding up in a psychiatrist's office years later I really didn't pick up on until years later when I reread the story. It seems like wherever he goes he's running around in circles! He gets kicked out of school, chewed out by an ill teacher, acts obnoxious to his schoolmates, dumped by an old girlfriend (after sticking his foot in his mouth!), and gets ripped off by a hooker. With the exception of the last adventure mentioned (although may be typical for some), these are all situations familiar to every teenage kid. Like most teenagers, he sees the phoniness in others and yet is willing to be a phony to virtually anybody else- except his younger sister. She in turn sees right through his games and is his only friend!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This was the best book that I've ever been forced to read. I loved the insight from Holden even though he complained a lot. I also admired the relationship he had with his younger sister."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger's A CATCHER IN THE RYE is remarkable yet painful tale of the angst of a young, disillusioned youth named Holden Caulfield. Salinger's use of imagery and few words adds to the confusion and passionate yearning of Holden. In the end you are compassionate towards him, yet the reader has no problem identifying with Holden. You unwillingly leave A CATCHER IN THE RYE breathless and forever changed, having been inside Holden's head far too long, yet not long enough."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is a superb book.

Not my favoite (of mice and men) but it is close. Thestory of Holden a teenager who, after having many problems, goes crazy, is really interesting, he is the narrator and he is talking to his doctor and telling him story that happened back in New York City Great book, read it and you will enjoy it , if you are a teenager , great book for you, many people feel the way Holden Caulfield feels in the book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is one of the most enjoyable books that I have ever read. It is about a seventeen-year-old boy named Holden Caufield that is expelled from Pencey Prep. He doesn't want to tell his parents that he was kicked out of school and goes to New York City to spend a couple of days. Here he has a lot of adventures. Holden is a boy that thinks that everything is phony, he seems to hate everything, sometimes gets depressed, and is a terrible compulsive lyer. This book is mostly for teenagers, and talks about a lot of real issues that many people face in the world; it is also very easy to read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is definitely a book requiring reflection upon completion. Holden Caulfield, as portrayed by this author, was merely an actor on society's stage, hoping to find the right exit.In some ways I find myself relating to Holden - often times annoyed by the world's fakes and \`phonies'. Those people who put on warm smiles and yet stare cold eyes. But aren't we all those such \`phonies' at times, putting up fronts, keeping out the spectators of our soul? I don't feel the intensity of Holden's alienation from the world was completely justified. His senseless vulgarity and disregard and distaste for those around him made the immaturity of his character quite clear. Perhaps all of this controversy was a front put up to protect himself from the world. Maybe he had the illusion that if he hinders himself from the rest of the world that life's pain and anguish would never again taint him. This is illustrated by his last two lines: \\"Don't ever tell anybody anything. If you do you'll start missing everybody.\\" Life is full of both happiness and misfortune. If you shelter yourself from it, you are merely cheating yourself of life.Don't misunderstand my review; it is just critiquing Holden's character. Overall, the book itself was well written and flowing in its entirety. I might even go as far as to say I liked it. Although I don't agree with the extent of Holden's personality, J.D. Salinger, clearly knew what he was doing when writing this thought-deriving book. Perhaps upon reflection is makes us all want to take a closer look at our own personalities. Are we, too, merely one of the many \`phonies' the Holden so deeply hates?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book opened my eyes to the world. After reading this, one never lookas at one's self or at the world the same. Every one sees a little of Holden in them self, and if you don't, then you are lying to your self. This book WILL make you think and see the world difrently. You must read this book in your lifetime."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I suppose you either read this book and love it or read it and hate it. I loved it.I read this in eight grade, and thought it was easily one of the best books I'd read up until that point. Holden Caulfield is a moving character and Salinger takes pains to make you see the world through his eyes. The emotionality of the story was impressive, and I can honestly say that this &quot;moved me&quot;.If you're a teen, read this book because Holden is the romantic rebel up against a sea of troubles. If you're an adult, read this book to see what the teens are thinking."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye, by J.D. Salinger, gives a four day look at a boy who feels he is being oppressed by the world and what it contains. Holden, the main character, is a boy who is struggling with life and what it holds. He often expresses his confusion and loneliness throughout the story, which many teens can look back on and relate Holden to themselves. Holden feels that the world is full of confusion and full of a bunch of &quot;phonies&quot;. One can relate to his loneliness. He feels that no one will talk to him and comfort him. He is trying, throughout the story, to be around people and carry on a conversation, but it seems like no one will listen or care what he has to say. He wants to escape the world and run away. It is a four day story that one can relate times of confusion and loneliness, throughout their own lives, to."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A deeply troubled adolescent, the streets of New York, and a Robert Burns poem construct this novel of youth and beauty. Holden Caulfield has become the patron saint of world-weariness, bewildered vulnerability, and a perplexity leaning on desperation. The novel has a narrative voice that verges on the vernacular but consciously avoids it and a minimal plot that is set into action by a single decision. The sorrow in \`Catcher in the Rye' does emerge from solipsist insularity but rather from a deep concern for innocence lost, or in peril. He feels genuine empathy for, among others, a disregarded child walking on the street, ignored by his parents, in danger of being hit by passing cars, another child in a movie theater who is hushed by his mother, herself weeping at a dramatic scene, when he says that he needs to use the bathroom, and young whore named Sunny, too ignorant to realize her own sullen wretchedness. But perhaps most foreboding of all is his fear that perhaps one day his beloved little sister, Phoebe, may become corrupt, or at least a part of our corrupt socety. His distress and pain arise from conviction, and an acknowledgement that it is impossible for a single person to save another."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is the most recent novel I have read and any novel that I have been able to read from cover to cover is a good book in my book (haha...) Although I don't read that many books because I simply do not enjoy reading as a hobby but more like a chore, I enjoyed this book by J.D. Salinger about Holden Caulfield. I thought this story was confuseing at first because it starts off in the future, where Holden is in a mental institute. It then reverts to the past where the rest of the story takes place and eventually brings you back to when the story started, in the future. I have no problem recommending this book though because it is so easy to read and all you need is to get started. Even if you don't enjoy reading in general like me you may enjoy this book!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Upon reading the first page or two of The Catcher in the Rye, I was certain that this was not my kind of book. However, I had always heard how excellent it was and I knew that I had to finish it. This novel is truly a classical piece of American literature. Although this book is most definately your typical classic with heroes and victims and morals that leap off the page, Salinger's novel is real.Holden Caufield is an unusual narrator. He is honest, which is refreshing as he notes the superficial world surrounding him. This honesty alienates Holden from society, for he will not conform to the typical schoolboy personality of those that he has lived with all of his formal education. He becomes a watcher and analyzes the many people he encounters. In due course, he confirms the human being as a indecisive creature that thrives on interaction. Regardless of ho hard Holden tries to separate himself from his clueless, high society parents, Phoebe, his sister, and the kind intentions of others affect him.Through his many experiences prior to his sixteenth Christmas, Holden reaches some realizations, but eventually he has concluded that life cannot be planned. Also when we bear our souls and secrets to someone, in the absence of their company, we find ourselves very lonely and regretful.Some may find the language inappropriate for a novel, but it is only reality that is found on the pages. This book has remained on banned book lists for so long because people are afraid of the truth, and many can find the confusion or cynicism that Holden possesses in themselves. I simply ask that you look past the front and find the great symbolism throughout the novel. There is a piece, however small, of Holden in each of us and we cann all learn from his frankness."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I was setting off on a business trip to New York, my first, and it seemed as good a time as any to finally get around to reading this classic. It was obvious to me why this book has become such a classic, though to have banned the book seems a bit extreme. The book does go a long way in capturing the teenage experience, with every bit of cynicism that we at least wished we had at that age. I don't, though, think of it as a young-adult novel. I'm not sure that it is the sort of book that should be taught in high-school courses. Its trick is in how we, as adults, read Holden and his view of the world. It depends on us understanding his foolishness. As a teenager I would simply have focused on how right he is. Reading this, and enjoying it, does encourage me to get around to reading all those other classics that crowd my bookshelves."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is one of the \\"classics\\" I've somehow avoided until now. It was actually a movie, \\"The Good Girl\\" with Jennifer Aniston and Jake Gylenhall, that prompted me to finally sit down and read this book. First of all, the book has no plot. Second of all, I'd heard all about Holden's teen angst but it seemed less angst more teen obnoxiousness to me. Holden was a bored, spoiled, rich kid who didn't like anything. That's basically the essence of the book. Still, as much as I tried not to, I liked the book. I chuckled and smiled and looked forward to reading Holden's \\"take\\" on the world around him even though I thought he was a bit of a phony."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The book starts out wuth the main chracter, Holden Caulfield, getting kicked out of his school. Hold is sort of a trouble maker at school, so this isnt his first time getting kicked out.Holden is supposed to stay at the school for about a week, he really hates it there, so he decides that he is going to go to New York City, New York, instead of srating at the school. He has some money from his grandparents that he had gotten for his birthday, so he is going to hopefully use that to have a good time before he has to go home to his parents, and he knows that they won't be happy when they find out that he got kicked out of school again. Will Holden be able to live in the city without any help? Will he go to school once again? Will is parents be upset with him about getting kicked out of school? All of this and more will be answered in the book, The Catcher in the Rye.If you think that this book sounds good, then I recommend it to you. My godfather recommended it to me, and I really liked it. It is a little slow and a little boring in parts, but overall it's a great book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read Catcher for the first time in high school, as part of the freshmen English class readings. Liked it, but didn't really get into it. Then, like any other hot-blooded, cynical, somewhat awkward and introverted youth, the onset of teenage depression and angst promptly arrived. Without really realizing it, I picked up Catcher again and re-read it. This time, something, somewhere in the brain, clicked. The feeling was analogous to suddenly being able to see three-dimension in a two-dimensional drawing, or being able to suddenly spot intricate pattern in an otherwise ordinary cloudy sky. Since then, I must have read and re-read Catcher all the way through high school and college for what seems like a thousand times. Catcher provided me an outlet, a voice, and a listener for all the raging teenage emotions. After college, the passion for Catcher has somewhat dissipated over the years. But occasionally, I flip through the book before going to bed. Gone is the intense empathy with the story and the narration. Instead, a wave of nostalgia washes over me every time I flip through the pages. It's amazing how a simple little book can capture, catalog, and evoke so much feelings and emotions that are associated with growing up. In my opinion, Catcher in the Rye is quite possibly the ne plus ultra of the genre, even Salinger himself could not outdo. Funny, melancholy, and quietly moving, if this is not great literature, I don't know what is. The only books I've read since then that call to mind Catcher and definitely worth checking out by fellow Catcher-philes are \\"Bell Jar\\" and the graphics novel \\"Ghost World\\". For people who simply don't get it, forget about it, you never will."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've been skimming a few pages of the reviews, and found that most opinions are at the extremes, some love some hate it. I've been especially reading those who disliked the book. Most comments are that Holden is a complainer, or that there is no plot. And the only thing I can say is that those people need to look deeper into the text. Trust Salinger. Everything in that book happens for a reason. This book isn't about some angry teenager who hates everyone, it's Salinger showing us the loss of innocence in the world. Throughout the book Holden shows a extreme hate for \\"phonies\\". Adults who live to make money. The headmaster of his school(s), people who produce movies. etc. And yes, Salinger shows us how Holden is phony too at some times. Basically, Holden dislikes most adults, because let's face it, for most adults these days making money has become a large chunk of the day. Too large, according to Salinger. This is why, I think Salinger retired from public life, and why he is now writing stories no one else can read. But back to the book. Holden shows frustration for most adults who have been corrupted by their surrounded materialistic world. And then there are the children, particularly Allie and Phoebe, the two people in the book Holden shows a strong liking for. They are also the only children Holden knows closely. Unlike the \\"phony\\" adults, Allie and Phoebe were still innocent, and pure. They were protected from the world out there that's about making money, and \\"getting the most miles per gallon\\" etc. This brings us to teh title of the book. \\"The Catcher in the Rye.\\" the guy who catches children who fall off \\"some crazy cliff.\\" That's what Holden wants to be. He wants to save children from falling from the realm of innocence and childhood into the phony business adult world."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is one of those books that can easily be over analyzed, but is never understood. Some see that as part of its intrigue, but I simply find it ridiculous. The Catcher in the Rye, while not a horrible book by any means, does not live up to its widespread fame and appeal. It is a staple on school reading lists and is considered to be a &quot;must-read&quot; for all educated people. Why? Good question.I've come across many people who claim to love The Catcher in the Rye, who say that it is full of deeper meaning and symbolism. Unfortunetly, when I ask them to elaborate and explain what it means, there is silence. I think that a lot of people say that they like the Catcher in the Rye because that's what you are supposed to say - you're supposed to like it. I just don't see what its appeal is."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"My teenage daughter and I were so excited to read this book because we've always heard so much about it. I hated it. I thought it was the whiniest, poor-little-rich-kid story I'd ever read. Of 'course I had a much rougher childhood, so maybe that had something to do with it?I thought maybe it was that I should have read it when I was younger so I was interested to see what my 15 year old thought of it and was careful not to let her know beforehand what I my opinion of it was because I didnt want to influence her.She couldnt wait to read it because one of her fave actresses had read it like 100 times....however she was also disappointed for similar reasons.she is an old soul so maybe that has something to do with it as well...I dont know but i found this book tedious and contrite....i found the main character a superficial as the adults he was questioning....I keep thinking I must have missed something since its considered a \\"classic\\"...however I really don't want to spend more precious hours of my life re-reading it! :)o well, to each his own!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've loved this book since the first time I read it in college. Holden simply thinks and \\"speaks\\" his mind in so many bizarre ways and yet he is so perceptive that it makes us laugh. And he also has a deep, sentimental side. He looks for his mission in life and it's simple: To be the catcher in the rye, saving children who accidentally fall off a cliff while playing. We all need a purpose in life and that's the message in part. He seeks his identity as we all do in life. It's an enjoyable read. --Fred P.

It's one thing to read about childhood angst, or the pressures and stresses of adolescence, but Holden's attitude at first made me concerned, then sad, and finally, apathetic.There was no growth on the part of Holden, nor was there any inkling on his part that a majority of his problems are of his own making. Even the pleadings of his &quot;favorite&quot; teacher fell on deaf ears. I've got news for you Holden, life is hard, and it takes a lot of work. Maybe Holden will someday grow up and start to see life differently, but within the confines of this book, Holden is just one of those guys you end up shaking your head at while thanking heaven you aren't him.Perhaps I just missed the point..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This was one of those books that they made you read in junior high.

Of course, &quot;Catcher..&quot; was on my list and I'm glad that it was. This book really deserves two or three readings (at least) in order to really understand where Holden is coming from. Holden is so far ahead of his time. He still is. He will always be ahead of his time. He is a young man struggling to comprehend a world that makes no sense and one that offers him nothing in the way of challenges. I have not yet hit the big 30, but I constantly find myself looking for something to question. Enlighten me. That's what this book has done. It's a shame that teachers have to force a child to read a book such as this. Wouldn't it be nice if teachers could just put the suggestions out there and let their students decide for themselves. Wouldn't students get a lot more out of their reading if they did?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"To me this book is very good. Some people may find that this book starts off slow. To me though this book starts off fast enough for me. you will find that this boy describes how some peoples life go.

Still as fresh as ever. &quot;She was skinny, Rollerskate skinny&quot;"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Well, I had to read this book for English, and it was a mixed experience. First, for the bad. One of the most annoying parts is the language. Maybe it's because I'm a modern teen, but the language was so annoying, it made me want to stop reading. I mean, he keeps calling everything crumby, and calls everyone a phony. I realize I do the same thing with different words, but it's really annoying reading them. The second and last bad thing is how depressing it is. Again, maybe its because im 14, but he says everything &quot;annoyed the (censored) out of him&quot;. I mean, every little thing annoys and depresses him. And then there's some weird stuff at the end. These 2 things made me really want to stop reading, but I'm glad I finished. Besides those bad things, the rest of the book is really good. Its narrarated in a very unique, and strangely pleasing way. The author manages to ctach your interest in even the littlest things, and there are some really good parts.

The story of Holden Caulfield was interesting. His dealings with guys from Pencey, his teachers, his family, and all the others along the way were great.

The story of Holden, the classic immature young man trying to hold on to his past had me entertained throughout.

Readers, remember, YOU ARE NOT HOLDEN CAUFIELD. Yes, he is a cool character, but he is his own person.

But don't BECOME the book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have just spent about 30 minutes reading through some of the reviews. Most people gave 'The Catcher in the Rye' 5 stars( Well done, all of you!) and as for the other's who give it only 1, then I seriously do not think they got the morale of the story.One of the reviews (By David.P, or something). He said 'What is The Catcher'? In case you haven't noticed, it indicates Holden Caulfield, and how he refuses to grow up into the world of troubles and worries. He doesn't want other people to go the same way, so he wants to protect others from falling off the cliff. That is 'The Catcher in the Rye'Moving on: If you read through the reviews on this extremely superb novel, you will see that 99% of the readers of The Catcher, have either rated it 5 stars....or 1 star. Hardly any rated it 2 stars..or 4 stars, merely 1 or 5. Doesn't that fascinate you? You go to other books: reviewers state 1, or 3, or maybe 5. It just shows how magical this book is. If has tremendous dialogue, and absolutely excellent background setting.You either hate this book, or you either love this book, there is no other solution!If any of you out there have rated this book 5 stars, then congratulations and well done on getting the basic morale of this novel THE BEST BOOK OF THE 20th CENTURY!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I just finished reading The Catcher in the Rye. It had a few funny parts like when Holden was drunk. I did not find the language too harsh since I hear that kind of language every day in school and on T.V. However, I found it hard to follow because Holden talks to himself thoughtout the whole book. I felt Holden was too depressed to be the main character, and there weren't that many characters in the book. He would talk about people and never meet them. The book was well written. I like the scenes and the way J.D. Salinger used the language in the discussions. However the plot was too hard to understand by anyone let alone a 10th grader. I would recommend this book to an adult or a bored teen, not because of the language but because of the lousy plot. Only a bored teen would read this book. Maybe one day I will understand the meaning of this book but for now I have no clue what the writer J.D. Salinger was trying to get across. Holden says that every body is a phony but maybe Holden is the real Phony."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This story is about a teenage college failout living in the late 1940s in New York City.

He hopes his dream will one day come true so that he can do this.I enjoyed this story because it tells of a normal teenager in a normal setting.

While I thought it an interesting read, it does not speak to me.Rating a book is pointless, reading a review of a book is not. It is the only way to determine if a book may be something you wish to read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye portrays Holden Caulfield as a sixteen-year old, white, upper class, New Yorker in the 1950s. The book shows Holden's unwillingness to grow up and his struggle with loneliness. Salinger does a good job of describing how Holden feels about people and things. For example, when he is talking about a young man he met that went to a good college, he says \\"The jerk had one of those very phony, Ivy League voices, one of those very tired, snobby voices. He sounded just like a girl.\\" This helps you understand that Holden doesn't like phony people. He uses language that convinces readers that Holden is a young man from New York in the mid-twentieth century. This book is easy for teenagers to relate to because they can associate with his stupid actions and propensity for deception, along with his adolescent silliness and his genuine care for innocence. I think the book is provocative and well written."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Why is The Catcher in the Rye so amazing? Because we've all been there. I have never met a person who can't somehow identify with Holden Caulfield. The brink of adulthood. We have all been there, but no one captures it quite like Salinger. Even as an adult, there are still those days when no one can relate, things don't seem quite right, and you want to walk around forever and never go home. Holden Caulfield is about being real. He knows no other way.

He decides to return to New York early, and encounters all sorts of darkly comic adventures. Caulfield is the quintessential anti-hero; he tries to be angry and alienated, but still wants to catch people, to save them. He is not angry, but weary and jaded. His wild dreams of escape are shattered by reality, rendering this story a true tragedy."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye, by J.D. Salinger; is a great novel for anyone who loves to read. This is a very descriptive novel that goes into the life and into the mind of the main character, Holden Caufield. Holden is a seventeen-year-old high school student, but he is not your average teen. Holden has had much trouble in school. He has already been kicked out of two schools and now another for excessive bad grades. Holden is stressed from roommates in his dorm and what his parents will say to him when they find out he has been kicked out of Pencey High School. Holden, on the other hand, seems to be the type of person who doesn't care what people think of him. This made him very enjoyable to read about because he relates to the way I feel personally. Holden then decides to leave Pencey and go to New York to lay low for a couple of days until his parents find out what he had done and give them time to cool off. In New York, Holden gets a hotel room and is stressed from rude people in the big city and is depressed because he feels lonesome. He begins missing his sister Phoebe. He goes to see her at night but doesn't want to confront his parents so he wants to leave after visiting his sister. When he sees her and decides to leave Phoebe wants to go with him. Holden gets very upset arguing with her and breaks down. Holden couldn't take any more of the pressure and Holden suffers a bad thing. You have to read it to find out what it is. This novel will keep you entertained and you won't want to put it down"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Unprolific as he might be, Salinger is one of America's most beloved writers, and for a damn good reason: CATCHER IN THE RYE is a masterpiece, one of those rare books which is read and reread by one generation after another, destined to be discussed and celebrated for all time. There is no one to whom I would not recommend this literary jewel.

I'd heard a lot about the book, and I expected it to be interesting, with a good message. Instead, it became boring. I kept feeling that it was about to get good, but it never did. I was starting to get sick of the negativity this 16 year old repeatedly spoke of. I went through some of the same struggles when I was a teenager, but I wasn't blaming everything on other people. The book is worth reading, but don't expect it to get good or anything."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Believe me that's what I felt after finishing 'Catcher..' I mean this was really amazing how the human nature, wherever you go, remains the same.Though I hardly share any of the cultural similirities with Holden, as I'm from the eastern philosophy, and much stronger are its roots inside me.I come from a state having quite a strong literature and philosophical background in India, Many of the modern authors of our language shared the same kind of feelings and we'd identified our egos with those.But even though the expereience given by Holden is all that closer to me. The lonliness and intense fear of losing the innocence is not only restricted to his age but can be experienced at any stage of life.In Holden I've found my own anguish about my family and it's ties. The beloved ones and my friends. The strong inhibitions against all those 'phonies' around me, all those so called 'well-wishers' clobbering over me from anywhere.Over and above that the language which makes it so intense and one from the bottom of the heart, that even though you may not really agree with what he says, (actually there's nothing concrete or 'enlighting' which he says, the better expression would be you may not feel the same way he's feeling)it's a great literarry experience even for a stranger to English language like me. For me English was very unfamiliar and very distant language, not definitely after I've read 'Catcher..' Thanx Mr. Salinger thank you very much."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It is rare that a book with such social significance and impact comes along. Although this book is now a classic (crafted 1951), it's message and importance is still relevant to this day.The Catcher in the Rye is the story of 16 year-old Holden Caulfield, an alienated teenager searching for meaning in life. Holden's troubles range from his poor school performance to the almost maddening feelings of disgust he has toward the plethora of phony individuals that he must deal with during the course of his day to day life.The story, told from Holden's point of view, takes us through Holden's mind, as well as the locations he visits on his quest to find the meaning of his existentialist purgatory.A superbly written, concise account of the life of an outcast teen, The Catcher in the Rye, in addition to entertaining us, inspires us to think: to question our own existence and encourage ourselves to be better people through compassion and understanding of the human condition. This book is a must read, especially for teenagers, as you WILL find something in this novel that you can incorporate into your own personality: something that you can make a part of you."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I knew nothing at all about the plot of The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger before reading it. Turns out there really isn't much of one to speak of. This book is often included on lists of books that are considered essential reads, and after reading it, I can't figure out why. The author certainly captured a unique tone and voice which underscores the disease of youth that makes every teenager believe they know everything there is to know. Holden Caulfield is the main character/narrator, and his know-it-all arrogance coupled with his inflated sense of self-importance make him a largely unsympathetic character as he gives details of what amounts to the extended temper tantrum of a petulant, entitled brat. The novel is certainly authentically original, and credit must be given for a work that can rouse such a visceral ire and disdain for a fictional character, but taking all things into account; it's not a journey I'll bother taking again."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The story of a haughty, aimless, irresponsible teenager wandering around for a couple days, doing nothing of importance: thoroughly uninteresting. I don't see why people like this book -- it's just &#34;Hey, look at the antics of this stupid kid!&#34; I suppose the traditional answer is that it reminds many people of themselves (it didn't for me -- I was always quite down to earth, perhaps too much sometimes), but what would make such reminiscing about ephemeral, meaningless, and unimportant stupidity enjoyable to someone? I don't get it. Alternately, maybe they empathize with Holden Caulfield, but I could muster up no such empathy when I read this at 16 or 17.This book was obviously successful, so it must have done something for lots of people. It did nothing for me."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"WEll, I sure wouldn't want to argue with so many favorable opinions, but I just finished reading this book for the first time and I just thought...hmmmm..o.k. I really was not moved in any way and found the repetitive....&quot;I really did&quot; etc... a little annoying. The relationship Holden had with his sister was a bit strange too."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This over-hyped collection of words drags the reader through the mind of a confused adolescent with tapestry generally reserved for a low brow detective story featuring the obligatory out-of-luck private investigator. The narrative presentation is as phony as the opining of the central character. No doubt the only reason this book became a popular classic is because of society's willingness to proclaim the wares of Art and Literature to be avant-garde simply for being outrageous or gross without consideration of intrinsic beauty or meaning. Escape the herd and shun the elitist dupes."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I can sum up this book very quickly. Whiney rich brat that thinks his life is horrid. I wish my life was as bad as his."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm trying to figure out how a piece of pulp fiction became a classic. I just read 224 pages of drivle, and I believe I just may have wasted the last two hours. There is no literary content in this \\"novella\\", and there are no brilliant concepts. We have the story of a sixteen year old named Holden Caulfield who does nothing but complain. Besides uncovering all of the \\"phonie\\" tendancies prevalant in America today, Mr. Caulfield exposes himself as the biggest \\"phonie\\" of all by displaying a two-faced attitude towards all of his acquaintances. What the kid needs is a good lecture.I stopped counting the cliches after a page and a half because I found it impossible to discern where one cliche ended and the next began. There were cliches within cliches. Most importantly, though, is that this book simply has no point. Please, someone point me in the right direction if I missed it, but I was a fairly troubled adolescent as well. What did I do with my time? I learned to write so I could accurately portray my thoughts onto paper without confusing the hell out of anyone who might eventually read my work. I'm certain that Salinger intended to butcher his English in order to sound more like a sixteen year-old who flunked out of every class except English. If I was Holden Caulfield's teacher, I would have flunked him out of English as well. That is just another of the reasons why this book itself is a \\"phonie\\".This book took me barely two hours to read. It would have taken me half that time if I didn't have to constantly re-read sentences that were poorly written. If I see one more \\"and all\\" or \\"goddam\\", I think I'll go write a \\"F--- you\\" on a wall just to make Mr. Caulfield angry."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"How ironic that a book that was once hailed for boldly exposing the stereotypes of our world has now become one itself. The moody, rebellious teenager, bored with the world after a decade and a half of living, stops going to school and wanders the urban wasteland in search of himself. Catcher might have been the original, but it's now one of millions of copycat teen-angst novels. The writing may be a little better than the modern hollywoodized versions, but the subject matter is old hat today. For a typically rebellious teenager, it might be a refuge; for me, it was kind of depressing. I expected more than a whiny kid."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"If you've ever witnessed a small animal being run over by a car you have some idea of what this book is about.

I'm not a high schooler by any means and i've had a lot of time to reflect over this book. I find it as pointless as the day i read it. You would be much better off reading a nice Grisham, actually and algerbra textbook would be more interesting than this book. Unless you like things repeated three times by a mentally disturbed main character i would suggest you disregaurd all the good reviews.

It's a classic, and I'm a little ashamed of myself that, while I've had it sitting on my bookshelf for years, I haven't discovered it first-hand until now.I would highly recommend this book for teens and pre-teens.

Salinger. There were things about this book I enjoyed, but there were also things I wish I could've changed.The main character in this book is named Holden Caulfield. Holden is sixteen years old and had trouble finding his place in society throughout the entire book. This part of the book I enjoyed. There are a lot of teenagers who are still trying to find their identity and feel like they don't quite \\"fit in.\\"Another interesting part was to see how many different things happens to him in just a short span of four days. The part of the book I wasn't too fond of was the flashbacks. It seemed like a large portion of the book was narrated in the form of these flashbacks. It's hard to remember if he's talking about the past or if he's talking about the present because it switches so rapidly. The beginning of the book takes place in December before his school closes for Christmas break. He ends up getting expelled from Pencey Prep School. This happens to high school students. So this made it realistic and believable. Another part of the story I felt was a little far-fetched was when he was in New York City trying to get a prostitute to have sex with him. At age 16 looking for a prostitute seems highly unrealistic to me as a reader.Throughout this whole book he tries to fine a degree of understanding. He tries to find his place in the world. From all of his encounters from the various people he meets in the city, he along with the readers, realize that he is very different from other people. Another thing I didn't like about the book was how depressing it was. It created a very dark and gray picture in my mind. I'm not sure I'm into the whole depressed side of the story but I really enjoyed wondering what was going to happen next.I thought it was weird for his younger sister, Phoebe, to question his negativity when he finally came back home to his parent's house. I was surprised when she confronted him about it and asked him one thing he would like to be. When he replied the name of the title finally made sense. It wasn't until that point that I understood where they got the title from, Catcher in the Rye.\\" I knew towards the end of the book he was going to eventually \\"snap.\\" I definitely saw that coming, but I think it was good he was sent to a mental hospital in California so he can at least get better.Overall I enjoyed most of the parts of this book and would recommend it only to teenagers who can handle somewhat depressing books."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is truely a great book.

In the beggining Holden gets kicked out of his school. He then goes into New York City and thats where a lot of crazy things start to happen. Holden is a great character and I highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is an all-time must-read. An American classic. 'Nuf said."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a novel about a 16 year old boy who's just been expelled from another school. The story is four days long and describes his experiences. Holden Caulfield, the main character, is a pretty disturbed teenager who spends most of his time criticizing other people. He believes that, nowadays, most people are phony. He was expelled a few days before the end of the school year and doesn't want to go home yet. He then decides to go spend some time in town. I liked the book and, being a teenager also, I could easily put myself in his place. The book's content isn't so offensive, it's just realistic. I believe that Holden depicts people's attitude with so much accuracy that it disturbs some.I recommend that you read this book, especially if you're a teenager. It would be a highly beneficial experience."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is one of those books that it seems nearly everybody read in high school, except me. There are a lot of great \\"modern classics\\" that I somehow missed out on in school - for whatever reason I was never required to read them - so now that I'm in college I've been trying to catch up on my own. \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" is the latest of these that I've completed, and while it didn't stop me in my tracks, it was certainly worth the time spent. The story follows one weekend in the life of sixteen-year-old Holden Caulfield, who is disillusioned and depressed by the \\"phoniness\\" of the world, but is at the same time unable to escape and finds himself playing the same social mind games he is so disgusted by. Every time he tries to \\"break out of the mold,\\" so to speak, something else goes wrong in his life.Holden's descent into what can be seen as either madness or simply severe manic depression (the latter seems more likely) begins when he is kicked out of Pencey Prep, yet another school in a long line of high-class institutions where his family has placed him. Not wanting to go home early and inform his parents that he has once again been booted out, he decides to find a hotel in New York City and wait out the last few days of the term. Left alone with far too much time to kill, Holden's mind focuses more and more on the seemingly pointless societal affectations performed by everyone he meets, and which he must play along with himself.Though the story takes place in the 1940s, Holden's disillusionment is very similar to what many teens of today go through at some point or another while growing up. If Holden were a teenager of today, a doctor would probably put him on antidepressants post-haste. He's not the kind of person one would probably like if one were to meet him in person. But by reading Holden's inner thoughts, the reader comes to pity and, perhaps, empathize with him. Even though he despises so much of the world, Holden has good intentions throughout the book. He keeps track of the things that really matter most: he defends a former girlfriend from his predatory roommate, even though all it earns him is a bloodied face; he maintains a fond remembrance of his dead brother Allie, and keeps Allie's old baseball glove close at hand; he makes a donation to a pair of nuns he meets in a cafe; he sneaks home to visit with his kid sister, Phoebe, and is filled with real joy just by doing things to make her happy; and when he sees lewd graffiti on the walls of Phoebe's school, he does his best to rub it out, for fear that one of the children might see it and be introduced too soon to the world he himself is struggling with.Perhaps most heartbreaking of all is Holden's answer to Phoebe's question, \\"Name something you want to be. Like a scientist. Or a lawyer or something\\" (pg. 172). All Holden can think of in the way of a reply is that he'd like to spend his time watching children playing in a field, and be there to catch them if any of them should fall. He doesn't want to grow up and get a real job, and take on the responsibility of adult life - he just wants to be \\"the catcher in the rye.\\" This is perhaps where the greatest number of people will identify with Holden. The fear of growing up and facing real responsibility is something that nags at the corners of nearly every young mind.The book's first-person narration reads just like something a sixteen-year-old would actually write. The slang is, of course, a bit dated, but Salinger has achieved a style that rings strikingly true even today when compared to the workings of a teenage mind. And yet it is still easy to follow. It is ironic that the only subject Holden was not failing at Pencey was English, and perhaps Salinger deliberately crafted his character this way in order to ensure that something written by Holden would be coherent to his readership. The writing is simple, and conveys the not-yet-polished style of a teenager, but at the same time makes for very easy reading.Though I did not read \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" in high school, now that I've finished it I honestly wish I had. It is a work that certainly should be read and contemplated by all teens and young adults. Holden's story can be seen as many different things - social criticism, a satire on teenage life, a cautionary tale - and it is probably a bit of each all rolled into one. Every reader will likely take something slightly different from it. Some readers will identify with Holden, some will pity him, some will feel threatened by or disgusted with him. Some will feel a little bit of everything about him. And the end of the story is somewhat ambiguous. There are hints of what happens to Holden, but we are not told outright, and so it is left up to the reader to reach a conclusion. But regardless of what you may end up getting out of the book, do read it. It is thought-provoking on many different levels, and is definitely well worth the read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I don't want to say that this book doesn't have its appeal. It does and always will. But this is what disturbs me: there are sublte things throughout the narrative that are disturbing. Holden is always depresed and angry, cowardly and actually, impotent. He has a problem,. And no one ever points this out. Afterall, we learn that our Holden is telling his story from the lawn of a mental instutution and ends his story there. Still, no one ever comments about this.Cute as he is, the kid is really not well. He seems heterosexual, alright, but when a prostitute offers her services to a hormone-drenched teenager like Holden, how does he react? Depressed and he ends up thinking of Pheobe--his little sister. A few years ago, the author, Joyce Maynard came out with a stunning work called: 'At Home in the World'. I wish more adult fans of Salinger would take the time to read this important work to find out about the disturbed, pedophilic author, J.D.Salinger. At the age of 52 he hit on a doe-eyed, virginal, 18-year-old Maynard and only years later did he let her go--amid alot of pressure from his adult,literary peers!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caufield, a 16 year-old boy on the verge of adulthood, is not sure of how to behave in a world filled with \`phonies'. Holden wanders around his hometown New York, after he got expelled from this fine school Pencey for bad term results. Not wanting to face his parents, he tries to find out what life has to offer, if there is a way out of superficiality.What makes this story so controversial is that it attacks the basic values of the American Way of Living. At the age of sixteen Holden realizes that life is not like the make-believe of the pictures. After some embarrassing confrontation he realizes that what lies behind the faade of normality is often very painful, but still offers its own dark pleasures. Holden's biggest wish is to escape from everything \`phony', but what he gets is confirmation of his own faking.The Catcher in the Rye is a book that has been analyzed by scholars like no other book. Trying to summarize the impact in a few lines is simply impossible. What can be made clear though, is that no matter if you hate or love the book, it will leave a permanent impression behind somewhere in every readers mind, a little devil that awakes at the most unexpected moments. If their is ever going to be made a list of most powerful books, The Catcher in the Rye is bound to be heavy competition for first place.What the character Holden hungers for the most, is exactly for what Salinger himself has found the courage to accomplish: the author now lives in a secluded cottage, isolated form everything \`phony'. Rumors say that he is still writing books, but refuses to publish any of them. I find it very admirable that Salinger does not betray his own principles. But then again, if means that we cannot read what masterpieces he is bound to have written..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger delveloped Holden wonderfully. Holden became a character any teenager could relate to. Holden became one of my friends throughout the book. Stream of conscience has always bored me until this book. I tried not to be too analytical, but Holden was easy to disect. He was thoughtful and intriguing. His hardcore attitude did not fully disguise his respect and interest in children. I admire Holden and could understand his points of view and his unreal justification for his actions. Overall, I loved this book. It's different and that is what makes The Catcher in the Rye spectacular!!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book was a little confusing but it was well written. It didn't really keep my attention through the whole book but certain parts I liked. The parts I liked the best were all the sections about Allie. I don't really like books that are about peoples lives. I like to have a plot and if not a mystery. The book was well written and was defininately not hard to read. Holden was a great character for the book. J.D. Salinger really captured the voice of a teenager. While reading you could really give Holden a voice and you could hear him talking. This book lets people know what the life of a teenager back in the forties was really like. It captures some of the problems and the turmoil that someone might and could of had back then. J.D. Salinger has written a good book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The book &quot;Catcher In The Rye&quot; is at sometimes quite puzzling, trying to identify with Holden, and what was going through his mind was a struggle.He was a very fickle person, but being as fickle as he was he never crossed the line of his morals,making me respect him more. Holden thought that it was himself vs the world and that noone would want to help him, but what he didnt understand is that people did want help him, he just wouldn't let them. Holden is trying to find a sence of self,trying to find where exactly he stands in the world. Holden wants to be perfect, he wants to find the perfect companion, but with as negative as he is he will never be able to find the right person to fit his needs."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I thought that the book was good, especially the part when Holden is talking about the museum. In the book Holden talks a lot about a museum and how everything in it never changes, but the people that go into the museum are always changing. I also like how Holden is always worring about his sister Pheobe, and what she's doing. When she gave him her money he didn't want to spend it because it was her Christmas money. One part that I didn't like is when Pheobe refers that Holden can't really like Allie because he is dead."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Like many other people, I read this book as a school assignment. The book was okay. It didn't change my life or make a huge dent in it. Some parts of it were very emotional. Those parts were good. I do believe that my favorite part would be the part where Holden was saying that just because Allie was dead doesn't mean that he couldn't like him. I gave the book three stars because I didn't like the structure of the book. I enjoy reading books that have a major plot and a attention catching ending. All this book talked about was Holden's life. As for the ending, it just ended. Nothing was resolved and you didn't know what was going to be the outcome."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I really liked The Catcher in the Rye. It was a very confusing book, but it was still really good. The end was not my favorite, but I do think that it suited the book as a whole. I really liked Holden and I liked listening to him. He was a very memorable character, even though he did whine a lot in the beginning. I really changed my opinion of him when I saw his affection for his siblings. Even though he didn't get along with his parents, he did genuinely care for his sister, Phoebe, and his late brother, Allie. I found that to be a very admirable trait in such a disturbed guy. In a way, I kind of felt sorry for Holden in the respect that he didn't want to get close to anybody or trust anybody else. I really really liked this book and think that it was very well-written, especially becuase it was confusing. I think that it was just confusing because it was a book told completely from the perspective of stream-of-consciousness. I would definitely recommend this book to other people who like to read different books!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is a mirror of every emotion i have ever had, and every emotion ive never admited to. J.D. Salinger took the character, Holden Claufeild, and molded him into someone you love and someone who is intensly intriguing. In reading &quot;The Catcher in the Rye,&quot; I formed an extreme respect for J.D. Salinger himself, and since then have read many other works of his. All due to this peice of literature, that I hold very dear. There is no other book on this planet that I have been able to reread many times, except for this one. In recommendation &quot;The Catcher in the Rye,&quot; would be on my list, although it may not be for everyone. Especially those with no regard for real emotions and those who arent as open. In conclusion, this book has changed me and the way i think, I am forever in graditute to the author. -Thank you Mr. Salinger"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The book had a unique way of putting imagination and real life together.

Was it \\"cool\\" back in the fifties to like it because of all the swear words?? I guess I just don't get it. It's going back to the bookstore where I got it!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher In The Rye by J.D. Salinger took place in a very different setting then that of my life but some people may be able to relate to this. New York in 1950 was very different from the world we know today. Drugs were one thing that was looked upon differently. The main character Holden smoked a lot, and he wasn't the only one. Many of his friends smoked as well, and they're all around sixteen years old. I couldn't believe even his parents did not care that his little sister had been smoking. \\"I just lit one for a second. I just took one puff. Then I threw it out the window\\" (177). She doesn't even get in trouble for it and she is so young to be smoking. I think it's crazy how some people have no direction in life and they do not do anything about it. It's almost as if they've given up in life already. I think a lot of this book is about choosing a direction or path to take in life. \\"Anyway I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff\\" (173). This is Holden talking about what he wants to do when he grows up. Honestly I think you have to be mentally unstable for you to come up with this as your dream job. This story doesn't really fit into a main genre of novels, but it could be considered inspirational, or uninspiring depending upon how you look at it.Holden is a very boring person, he leads a somewhat odd and interesting life in the way that's it different from mine and probably most other people. He drags out his life though and he talks about the boring things in life and not what really matters. Like for example \\"I got bored sitting on that washbowl after awhile, so I backed up a few feet and started doing this tap dance just for the hell of it. I was just amusing myself\\" (28). Then he keeps going on about it for a whole page. He complains about everything, he hates everything, and he is completely miserable. The whole plot is about him running away from the things he hates. There's no action and nothing exciting about the plot at all. This book is sometimes difficult to read because it goes off on tangents about the oddest most worthless things that Holden thinks about. He's always complaining as well, and it seems to give the book a sort of annoying feel to read. Often times it was not an exciting story at all. Actually to be honest it was never exciting to read. The book gets the point across well but not in an entertaining way. I really didn't enjoy reading this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"After reading this novel, I wonder what possesed me to finish it. The point of the story was virtually nonexistent. Salinger's supposedly great work is boring and unintelligent. Anyone who has a highly opinionated friend or sibling has already lived this story to some extent. If you are looking for a deep or meaningful novel, I suggest reading Brave New World, Walden Two, or anything by Chuck Palahniuk or Geroge Orwell instead."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I thought the book was very good because it was so realistic that I was apalled at how people can live that way so depressed and frustrated. Holden was so depressed I felt bad for him. But I was surprised when he went to another school at the end of the book. The main thing that made me give this book a three was how he never had anything good say about anybody or anyhting. But I did enjoy the book and I would recommed it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The book The Catcher In The Rye was a very bad book. It made no sense whatsoever. I found the book humorous in a few places. For example, it was amusing when Ackley came in and started looking through Holden's stuff. I also found it boring to read about Holden getting drunk and walking through the park. That whole part makes now sense. He talks about getting pneumonia, and if he would die who would come to his funeral. I couldn't rate this book any lower than one star; otherwise it would have negative five stars. I really didn't mind the language that Holden and all of the other characters used because I hear that kind of language every day. And what does Catcher In The Rye mean anyway? What does it have to do with anything? I mean J.D. Salinger could at least made a title that went along with the book. And another thing, what is with the ending? It's a whole chapter about nothing. Just skip the last chapter and end the book sooner! I would not have read the book if I had known what I was in for."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It was alright, a little confusing in the beginning but I got used to it. Overall it was very realistic in my opinion."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I very much liked the image of the catcher who keeps those kids from falling over a crazy cliff. But I had to wade through a lot of slag to find that gem. The problem is that Holden is such an unsympathetic character. He's a rich, East coast WASP who has been given several opportunities for a free education. How does he respond? Well, he can't apply himself because everyone is too phony. Hell, Holden could find phoniness lurking in a fruit bowl. What passes for tragedy in Holden's life? Losing his fencing team's foils on the subway or discovering that a seedy hotel also has seedy clientele. How can you care what happens to a character like this?Perhaps, if Holden was freed from his parent's economic bondage he could finally toss off those golden manacles; become homeless and head downtown for the free eats; stand in a soup line three times a day and finally get hit with some Freakin Real! I hate Holden, Catcher and all, I really do."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I cannot understand peoples' obsession with this book and its protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Holden is a sniveling, spoiled brat, and I suspect the author's idolized self-portrait."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is an enormously overrated book. It's essentially about a confused adolescent who - much like Peter Pan - doesn't want to grow up, and who doesn't want anyone else to grow up either. The guy doesn't want to learn anything (apparently he thinks he knew all he needed to know by the 5th grade and refused to get beyond his juvenile mentality), and yet he can't figure out why his life goes nowhere and he's getting left behind as he ages. Some reviewers say Holden has \\"universal feelings\\"; and while confusion as an adolescent is common, wanting to be childlike forever (even at age 16) is definitely not universal, IMO. The guy is also essentially a hypocrite, calling the adults \\"phony\\" but then noting that he is a liar himself. I guess he figures it's ok for him to lie, because he's somehow special. After all, he wears a red hunting hat to show how special he is.Hopefully the only lesson to get from this book is how NOT to live your life, to instead go ahead and grow up, actually learn some things and make something of your own life. And if the story had found the protagonist actually growing up and realizing how ridiculous he'd been acting, there might be some value to the book. Unfortunately too many people admire the kid and even may want to emulate him. I can just imagine an army of Holden Caulfield wannabes all wearing red hunting hats, to show how \\"individual\\" they are. I don't know if JD Salinger intended that Holden's deliberate immaturity should be admired or derided, since he never commented on the book after writing it. But given that Salinger's life seems to have been a confused, searching, and reclusive one, I suspect that the author actually admired and identified with his protagonist, and didn't \\"get\\" that Peter Pan's refusal to grow up was not a desirable lifestyle choice."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a classic by a masterful storyteller. This is the kind of book you cannot put down and will think about and even read again throughout your life. If you are a J.D. Salinger fan I also recommend Nine Stories.Nine Stories"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"\\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" tells of Holden Caulfield, a 16-17 year old who, after being expelled from his boarding school, decides to pack up and leave. From here we experience him in the adult world, spending money, staying in hotels, experiencing (or trying to) sex. Meanwhile we are introduced to his mind. The character has a very speculative, cynical outlook which shows a sense of Salinger reaching deep inside himself to portray these complex and incredible emotions. It's a powerful portrayal of a misunderstood state of mind. Or perhaps I'm just thinking way too deeply about it. Either way, this is one of the best reads I've ever had.Long story short, I think this is amazing. Right from the first page I was hooked. I'm very much on the same level as Caulfield. His mind set is similar to my own, and he came to life right before my eyes. It's difficult to put my finger on why I love this novel so much, I think it's because of how introspective it is. I spend a lot of my time thinking, and I suppose that aspect of my personality transcends the form of this story. For my own reasons, this is one of my favorite novels. I think that the majority of people can relate to this, as there will always be things in this world that anger us, and this is a brilliant indulgence in the cynical side of ourselves.From what I've experienced in other reviews, there's a divide between those who think the character is unappreciative and the novel simply boring, and people who say it is a brilliant classic. It's the detractors which I will address. The beauty of the novel (at least for me) is the cynicism. Don't let this criticism put you off."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had to read this in middle school and thought I'd hate it. I was not some angst-ridden teenaged boy. However, I fell in love with it; with Holden, with the writing style. I think it can touch something in anyone who has ever felt down about themselves, the world, whatever.If you are assigned this for school, do yourself a favor and DO NOT READ CLIFF NOTES. The main thing that's fun about this book is the way Holden talks. Besides, it's a short book and easy read. Don't cheat yourself.I'm now middle-aged and I still love it, by the way."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The main character is a guy who has been thrown out of school. It was a landmark book by Salinger. This is one of the best books ever written. Your fiction reading is incomplete unless you've read 'Catcher in the Rye'."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Not having read this book in school, I decided recently it was one of those classics I missed out on which might be worth reading. While I do think the book is somewhat interesting and well-written, I believe it might be better appreciated by young adults. Much of the type of angst seen in Holden is diminished with age, for the most part.At age 16, Holden Caulfield has been kicked out of Pencey, the latest of several private schools which he's attended. He lacks direction in life, both in the long term sense and in the short term of what he's going to do next. He's not upset about leaving Pencey at all, he didn't really like any of the other students or faculty there much. In fact, there are very few people whom Holden likes. Asked to name people he genuinely likes, Holden would probably name his younger sister Phoebe and his brother Allie, who died young. He views a lot of the people he encounters as phonies. He hates movies and dislikes shows only slightly less, although he does take his friend Sally to one. Even when he calls friends up, they quickly get on his nerves. In general, Holden is rarely truly happy.I can see how some young adults might identify with Holden's character and attitude toward others and life. At that age many people are unhappy because the toys and games of childhood have lost their appeal, yet they cannot partake in all the things in which adults find enjoyment. However, reading this as adult I found myself easily tired and at times frustrated by his character."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye has been a controversial book from its very beginning, banned in numerous school districts all over the country. J. D. Salinger depicts the life of Holden, a young boy disillusioned with his life who holds the belief that he must be the \\"catcher in the rye,\\" a savior of innocent children.Although it has been praised and well received by the younger generation who feel that Holden is a character they can relate to, I found the novel rather boring. Holden might be lost and confused, but it does nothing to soften the annoyance felt at his immaturity and the absurdity of his thoughts. The situation with Holden's brother Allie does elicit some sympathy toward his mental condition and even his immaturity. However, his frequent childish notions to pay for a prostitute and to call up an old friend merely to engage him in a sexual conversation make his actions less forgiving. Even though most teenagers from various eras have found connection to Holden, I personally find Holden's thoughts too extreme and too incomprehensible for me to relate at all.Nonetheless, Salinger's characters are developed extremely well. Even after reading the whole novel, there is still much more to the characters than Salinger chose to reveal. In addition, the characters are all fairly realistic and fairly likable, especially Mr. Antolini. Mr. Antolini is one of Holden's old teachers and the one that Holden looks up to. Clever and sympathetic, Antolini, like other teachers like Mr. Spencer, tries to reach out to Holden. This, however, makes Holden's story all the more frustrating. He has so many people in his life who are willing to help and guide him, yet he refuses to listen and insists on acting like a grown up child.It is also undeniably true that The Catcher in the Rye is masterfully written. Full of symbols and images, Salinger succeeds in conveying the traumatized nature of Holden's mind. The vivid descriptions Salinger employs in his narration aid in envisioning the situation and engaging the reader in the story.Salinger frequently uses italics to emphasis certain words that Holden places an emphasis on. The italics are usually indications of the deep cynicism that Holden harbors for anything and everything in the world around him. J. D. Salinger narrates in the voice of Holden using short, choppy sentences and utilizing to the fullest extent the technique of fragments. Through such syntactical structure, Salinger creates a fast pacing that reflects upon the frantic and haphazard stream of thoughts that characterizes Holden's through process.Although Holden fails to exert the same pull on me as it does on other teenagers, it is irrefutable that J. D. Salinger is a master of his art. A reader looking for a easy and lighthearted read will find The Catcher in the Rye a tedious and pointless read. However, those disenchanted with the society around them may find it easier to relate to the young Holden and thus, enjoy the book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger is a reclusive writer. This book is his classic novel about Holden Caulfield who gets kicked out of prep school and goes to his hometown of New York City in post-World War II era. Sadly, Holden lives and deceives some of his pals not intentionally but because he has got nothing better to do with his life. Throughout the book, Holden's life comes unglued or disected into feeling an empathy for him. He has no empathy for the world around him. He wants more than the standard way of living. Caulfield is a highly intelligent man who is disconnected with the world around him by choice. I feel pity and sorry for him and hopes that his misery will come to an end soon but he is no better than those he writes about in this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"My older brother is going off to college, and he bought this book and read it.

It depicts a frustrated and confused boy, nearly a man, who is at that pivotal point in his life where he must decide to either enter adulthood and participate in society, or turn his back towards society and live exclusively in his own mind.Holden Caulfield has just been expelled from school for failing his classes and decides to wander around New York instead of tell his parents the news. The reason he failed isn't that he's not capable of passing his classes --he is a very intelligent boy -- but that he doesn't want to pass them. He is frustrated at everyone around him, particularly the \\"phoniness\\" he observes in their interactions with each other. Holden is an extremely perceptive teenager who criticizes nearly everything he comes in contact with. At first, I chuckled at his observations and I could easily relate to them as my own, however, as this consistently critical attitude continued to play out throughout the story, I found myself becoming more and more annoyed with them. I started to realize that this boy was dealing with more than just some minor annoyances in his life, but that he was dealing with depression, loneliness, and a debilitating outlook on life. He was a loner, and the more he chose to listen to his \\"inner voice\\"; as opposed to his teachers and mentors that try to help throughout; the lonelier and more isolated he becomes.There are many issues that Holden is dealing with in this book from his confusion as to \\"why are people the way they are?\\", to his desire to just give up and isolate himself from humanity, to the distress he feels at the loss of his beloved brother, to his longing to preserve his sister's innocence so she won't have to face the realities of life. As the books progresses, I found myself feeling more and more sympathetic towards Holden. I began to understand his frustration and anxiety about leaving adolescence and entering the surreal world of adulthood. Towards the end of the book, there are several moments where you realize he knows the severity of his decision; the decision either to find out who he is (find out \\"what size mind he has\\" as one of his teachers said), or to fall into oblivion, never to be heard from again.There is no wonder why \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" is one of the most read books of our time. This little book packs inside some of life's most important lessons and is told in assessable and relatable terms. For anyone that finds themselves frustrated with life and/or people from time to time, or for anyone who hasn't quite \\"found\\" themselves yet, then this is a book you will surely treasure."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Believe it or not I somehow made it through high school and college without reading this book. Even more incredulous, I'd never really heard anything about it other than it was considered a classic. And now for the humour, due to the name of the book, I thought it was going to be about life on a farm and harvests. Yeah, I was definitely wrong.Holden is a teenage boy who has just been kicked out of his school for failing most of his classes. As the term has not quite let out for winter yet, he is still on campus, but after an altercation decides to leave and explore the big bad streets of New York by himself. Here he gets himself into mild trouble, almost sleeps with a prostitute, and generally just gambles around talking to himself and attempts to keep himself entertained. This is all done while expressing a genuine dissatisfaction at the world around him.Holden is not an endearing character. Sure he has his moments when it comes to little glimmers of helpfulness and appreciation in him, but for the most part he's just not that likable. And I really think that was the intention. He is not your general hero and instead portrays a depressed, ego-centric, angst-ridden teenager. Which is probably immediately identifiable to a big portion of the population. Especially those who are his age as well. There are other characters in the novel as well but we only see them through Holden's eyes. Therefore, if he likes them they are described in glowing terms, like his sister, or if he doesn't like them he makes sure you know it, like his roommate at the school. But in the end, when it comes to Holden himself, I really didn't care what happened either way to him.There wasn't a normal plot to this book. It kind of just rambled on like Holden's stream of consciousness without a break. I actually found it kind of hard to read as I'm not fond of the stream of consciousness type of writing. It works ok in the movies when a person is actually talking, but in writing it doesn't translate as well or lend itself to being readable. That being said it was a rather tragic book and a good look at how people can feel lost at times. But I won't say I enjoyed it. I actually found the book pretty average. Maybe not worth the hype it's been given, but not anything I'd say I'd hate either. At most I'll probably remember it for a few days and move on as it didn't spark anything in me.I can't see myself reading anything else by Salinger. But this wasn't as excruciating or as wonderful as I thought it would be judging by others opinions. It simply was out there.The Catcher in the RyeCopyright 1945214 pagesReview by M.

The book had arrived via email, but I had to severely reprimand the seller for not sending the book in a timely manner before he politely informed me what an e-book was. The reading experience from my lap top was somewhat refreshing in that the print size could be increased as necessary for aged and tired eyes.The book was a nice letter to the authors mother, in first person. While the book didn't really have any slamming climax, nothing to make you grab your socks, it was very adept at keeping your attention. The author was able to go off on many tangents, yet stay focused on returning to the story. It was written in very \\"as-spoken\\" language, easy to follow for a fellow delinquent, with cool new contractions, like shouldn't've, wouldn't've, and couldn't've. The non-conformist attitude and the characters habits of coloring outside the lines were relieving, in knowing that other lost souls survive, at least in thoughts.The ending, although not the climax that I anticipated, was somewhat subtle, but provided the long anticipated \\"what is going to happen\\" ending. The novel placed me back into the realm of my adolescence, and except for the profanities and womanly exploits, the character couldn't've been any one except half've everybody I wouldn't've known in the seventies--yet the era clearly was pre-television."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"As a teenager, many of the things written by the protagonist are very relatable.

Still, I'm just not sure that accurately capturing the language and the emotions of youth is all that groundbreaking. This is a decent read, it will entertain you.

Although maybe there's something there that everyone can identify with. Whatever. But I reckon that half the people who read it are phony as hell, anyway."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am of like mind with the reviewer who found &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; to be quite tedious, a novel with no plot, no character development, and very little value as a novel. I like my fiction to be stimulating, emotionally and intellectually; and entertaining, while also making a clear and worthwhile statement about the human condition. Recent novels like MOTHER OF PEARL, or MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA, or THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY are far more to my taste. Obviously, &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; has proven to be of immense value to many people. I'm just not one of them."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read a lot of the reviews here and I can understand why someone wouldn't like this book.That wasn't my personal experience, however. Even before I read \\"Catcher In The Rye\\" I knew that my favorite books were ones with which I become intimate with the characters and they become your best friend for the duration of the read. I have read great books that I've enjoyed that were written better and plotted better, but don't touch me quite the same way because I didn't connect with the characters.The book has a strong stream of consiousness feel. Not to an extreme extent like William Faulkner, but \\"Catcher In The Rye\\" feels like Holden's deep thoughts and feelings on paper in the chronological order that he thought them. He doesn't hold anything back.There is a lot of angst represented in the pages. If it was just angst I probably wouldn't have enjoyed the book as much as I did. However, his friendship with is sister Pheobe is beautiful. It shows that he does care about certain things in life.His angst has two faces. The first face is the most typical teen type. A general, unrational, and frivilous hate directed at anything and everybody that irks him. The second kind is the educated kind. He can put into rational words why he is angry at something.The example that comes to my mind first is his distaste of the oral presentation class. Holden verbalized how he got constantly frustrated when speakers who went with their passion and strayed from the topic, but gave great heartfelt speaches, got low grades.In a way, this book is like a photograph. It's a snapshot of a certain period of time in a person's life. Not everything feels resolved, but it's like a picture of a pitcher throwing a baseball. You see the pitcher's throw, but you don't see the result. Was it a strike out? Did the batter hit a home run? All we know is that a pitch was thrown. In this way the book concludes.While I can't go and hang out with Holden after work, this will undoubtedly be a book I read again over the years."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Let me admit, it has gotten to the point that I like anything that's older than I am, so CATCHER IN THE RYE falls right in there.When I first had read CATCHER, oh, thirty years ago, I had hated Holden.Re-reading this classic as an adult, I still found Holden obnoxious but, now, I also understood him and pitied him.What bowled me over now is the prose of J.D. Salinger. Written in the 1940's, it is as fresh as the most modern writer's. And, some of his phrasing must have been of the first usage, as when he describes a character as \\"Joe Somebody.\\" \\"Joe Whatever\\" is so much a part of the current American lexicon that we take its origin for granted.As an adult, I can see what I missed as a kid: CATCHER IN THE RYE is, indeed, a brilliant work."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this first in high school and thought it a masterpiece. That could've had as much to do with Ed Banky's car as anything else. I've read it since and I wasn't quite so impressed. It is however a very important work in our collective catalog and no literate person should miss out on it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"After i finished Catcher in the Rye for the first time, i wanted to blow my brains out, because it was so true. Holden speaks of all the little annoying pieces of humanity, that most people ignore or tolerate, and chronicles his breakdown from the bottom. Reading this book made me more secure in myself, and in the thoughts parading throughout my mind. It was breathtaking, knowing that it was okay to dwell on how phony people are, and to think deep about things most people blow off as small beans. I just love it, and even though i don't think everyone on the planet would enjoy or understand it, i do think you should give it a chance; it has the potential to wipe the sleep out of your eyes if you allow it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Some hail this as the greatest book ever and delve into the millions of themes and hidden meanings and blah blah blah.... and I can agree with all of that. But the bottom line is, Holden's narrative is so wonderfully honest and simple - we all feel like him sometimes, and not just immature, cynical teenagers, but all people in general. Read it, and it will make you think about all of the people around you - and yourself - differently."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"this is truly a great book, i love the way the book is narrated, and its real easy to put yourself in Holden Caulfields perspective."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is an interesting book, which describes many of the things teenagers must deal with while growing up. Holden(the main character) describes his thoughts and feeling while traveling around New York. He is a very interesting and slightly eccentric character. It is a good book, until the last chapter where the book just drops. Its a terrible endin, but the rest is good."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in The Rye is a quality book that many teenagers would enjoy. It has suspense, sex, drama, suicide, and many topics that interest teenagers. The book has a very interesting point of view, and many people would be interested in it, especially if they enjoy reading what is high in todays standards. The book is known to be very controbversial, which will probably draw many people to it in the first place. The part of the book that did disappoint me was the ending. It really gave you no hint as to what happened next in Holden's life, which botehred me a lot. Althougth some people like getting to pick their own ending to a book, I would at least like to know what direction it went in. The book would have been much more enjoyable to me if the rest of Holden's life would at least have been hinted at."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher In The Rye is a good book, and I would recomend for all kids my age to read this book. Each page makes you want to read more and more because you never know what Holden is going to say or do next."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I think that this book is great, and makes good use of an untypical hero. Holden Caulfield, who has already dropped out of a few prep schools, has dropped out of another. He isn't a typical person either, not by a long shot. With a strong hate for phonies and the movies, Holden tells the story of his time alone in New York after leaving Pencey Prep.The Catcher In the Rye is an incredibly descriptive book, but in a different way than most. The story is filled with a plethora of Holden's thoughts and ideas. He is a very, very developed character. Another great quality of this book is its uniqueness. It is unlike any other book I have read. The development of the main character makes it seem very real, and can really help you visualize the story. People also speak realistically, actually swearing when it's appropriate, making the book more interesting and even more real. Sometimes the thinking becomes a bit obsessive, but not much. This book is great, especially for those interested in a classic novel."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"i reas this book when i was in the 9th grade and i was moved by holdens love for his brother even after he had died. i can relate to this because my brother died when i was 12 and i saw the way that my family was affected by this. my mother was a nervous wreck. i also liked the part of the teacher that helped him out when he left pencey. they gave him support when he needed it. this book is full of surprises and you never know what will happed next"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"One can't sum up what kind of book this is by words alone. There's really no way to describe how 'The Catcher in the Rye' made me feel. It takes 3 days out of 16 year old Holden Caulfied's troublesome life and inscribes it on paper. This timeless classic left me yearning to know not only what happened moment for moment after that, but it also left me dying to know second by second what exactly had occurred in the first 16 years of his life that had lead up to the moment when Holden was kicked out of Pencey Prep. Holden's negative outlook on life is familiar to each readers thoughts, feelings, values and morals at one point or another. Everyone can relate to this book no matter what age, ethnic background, religion etc. A true masterpiece in my eyes (and in the eyes of millions more)"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I started reading catcher in the rye because my dad thought I should. I thought it wold be some stupid old book like all the other books people told me to read. It took me a little wile to get through the first sevan or eight chapters but after that I could not put that book down. It was probably the best book I've ever read. I think most teenagers who &quot;don't like to read&quot; (that's what they all say) would love this book because it relates to them getting kicked out of school and facing your parents are things kids worry about. It's very interesting but at the same time the plot is very easy to fallow. Everyone needs to read THE CATCHER IN THE RYE because it's worth the cupple of hours, at most, it will take to read it and It's a great Amarican book I give it five stars only because I cant give it a million(or more)."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I really love this book and have read it many times. I bought the book after hearing it analysed in the movie &quot;Six Degrees of Seperation&quot;. You can get so much more out of this book after hearing it discussed in such depth. The problem with people that think this book is over-rated is that they have expected to much of it and think it is going to be really deep, complicated, and full of metaphorical language. In truth it is the books simplicity, straight-fowardness and the characters immaturity and honesty that make this book so good to read. It is left up to the reader to either take it as simply a boys story or to look further into the meaning to find many interesting (sometimes disturbing) insights into the world and the adolescent mind. I LOVE THIS BOOK! Please email me with any thoughts you have as I love to know other people's thoughts on this book. My recommendation to people who have read and enjoyed this book is to read my next favourite which is similar to 'Catcher in the Rye' - 'The Bell Jar' which is the only novel written by poet Sylvia Plath (her poetry is excellent as well)."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I thought that this was a wonderful novel. It was very interesting and always kept me occupied. I could really understand it well. I could also relate to it since the main character is a teenager. The theme of the book is great and I loved how the tite tied into it. It is about one boy's life and how he is on the borderline of childhood and adulthood. He is begining to lose his childhood innocence, and in a way doesn't want to. He begins to fail school and runs away to New York City and discovers the real adult world. He is confused about which way to turn. I loved this book because it really made me realize and appreciate more how important childhood really is. And if you rush through it too fast you'll begin to regret it later in your life. I think that it is a great book and I think that every teenager should read it. I highly reccomend it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Write out the Alienation going throughout the nove"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"&quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; is one of the best dramatic books there is.

Damn Phonies.. the lot of them"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"First off i would like to say that any thoughtful teenager should read this book. It is a great aspect on things that are wrong with society and i really related to this book. I also am someone who criticizes society a lot.

I love the point of view the book was written in it really adds to the complete image."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This novel shows that one person can survive the hardships that the earth can give you on their own. It has a uniques way of doing this. It shows it by telling the story od Holden as he travles from one school to another. Another idea that the author, J. D. Salinger, wants you to get out of this novel is the innocence of kids. They have their innocence for only a little of their life, and Salinger wants them to hold on to it as long as they can. He shows this by the way he feels when he sees the F word in the school, and when he diescribes his dream. These factors come into play all throughout this great and exciting novel."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This one of the best books ever writen. First of all, it is emotionally moving. Second of all, it is very intelligent. Every sentence in the book can be interpreted differently. Yet The Catcher in the Rye is by no means showoffy.Because it has so many interpretations and hidden themes, I would recomend reading it a minimum of twelve times.This book is in no way predictable. Read it. It would make the world a better place if children read this book as soon as they learn to read. Don't get me wrong, though. It is not a children's book, though it is about a child. This book is for anyone- absolutely anyone. So read it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a beautiful book. Although I did not appreciate it when I first read it - much like Holden would have not appreciated it if he had read it at 15 (or 17), I suspect - several years later, when I read it again, I not only saw myself in Holden Caulfield, but found myself laughing all the way through the book. This is a wonderful read that speaks as clearly now of the experience of youth as it did when it was written 50+ years ago.This book was J. D. Salinger's only novel; his other &quot;books&quot; are actually collections of short stories. Yet, The Catcher in the Rye, by its very brilliance, has put Salinger on the list of great (even if eccentric - he went into seclusion) authors of the 20th century.In short, Caulfield is what one would now call a &quot;troubled teen&quot;. He refuses to focus on his schoolwork, is constantly in trouble for acting out, has the mouth of a sailor (on a bad day, for that matter) and, at the start of the story, decides that he is going to simply quit going to school and take an early - and extended - winter vacation. Here the book begins.The importance of the story, however, is not the actual development of the plot - his failed attempt with a prostitute, his looking up an old girl friend, his visiting his sister - but is, instead, the thought life of Holden; Salinger portrays him sympathetically. Amidst all his cynicism, Holden shows himself to be a naive optimist, and the holding of these two things in tension is what gives Holden his dynamic. &quot;If a body catch a body, comin' through the rye&quot;, he sings to himself: he wants to save the world.The question by the end of the book, however, is whether or not Holden can do so or if, instead, he will &quot;die nobly for some highly unworthy cause.&quot; One of Holden's old teachers, in a scene with a strange bit of homoeroticism, tells Holden that he fears he will end up as a quasi-martyr; Holden himself, in his very desire to save the young from the cliff that he himself stands so close to, confirms this fear as being a realistic one.Yet, by the end of the book, Holden is almost &quot;saved&quot; by the simple love of his sister who worries about him and wants to help him out but at the same time cannot grasp the complexity of his situation. The real gift she gives Holden is her own simple and loving trust.We learn by the end of the book that Holden is going back to school with what seems to be a clearer sense of direction than he had previously. For me, it's a fairly unfulfilling conclusion, but it serves its purpose in that it diverts attention away from what *might* be Holden's future and returns it to the focus of the book: Holden's time playing hooky, running from his problems, not finding himself so much as being found in being touched by the love of his sister.It's a beautiful work that I highly, highly recommend."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is one of the most entertaining books I ever read. It is a book that make teenagers to to think about their own lives and the decisions they are making. I think it is a wonderful book to read when you are in high school becuase Holden, the main character in the novel, is a teenager who lives the same experciences most of us are living."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I really anjoyed this book because it taught a lot about how it is for teenagers to grow up. I feel that a lot of adults don't truly understand how hard it is for teens to find their place in the world, and Holden's character goes through many of the same things that most teens face today. I think everyone, not only teens, should read this book because then everybody would have a better understanding of growing up and what goes through teen's minds during this time."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I really wasn't interested at all in reading the book.. because it was required for high school but as i read it i became attached to the book..it is a great novel ,every young person SHOULD read it!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book completely captivated me from start to me. We were reading it as a class for about 4 weeks, but I read the book from start to finish the weekend I got it. Honestly, there were times in the book when Holden was taking words right out of my mouth. Every teen out there should read this masterpiece."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a wonderful portrayal of teenage life. The way in which Salinger shows Holden Caulfield going through depression is phenomonal. The things I truly liked about the book was the accuracy of teenage bitterness toward the world. This bitterness is shown by Caulfield's sarcastic views on his school and his surroundings. The phoniness in Caulfield's life and his hypocritical outbursts of phoniness in an effort to be happy as his peers are truly makes a connection to teens everywhere. The way which Caulfield views things that are happening in his life really makes you feel for Caulfield while also almost coming to hate him. Caulfield's character deals with a self caused anger at the world and needs to somehow get over it. He seems to point out everything that is wrong with the world and nothing that is right. Caulfield goes through a list of girlfriends who almost none he truly seems to like. He also seemingly has no friends with the exception of a younger sister who seems to connect to him while also noticing that his depression is caused within himself. Caulfield seems to know this throughout the novel and his actions speak loudly about the way he feels. The Catcher in the Rye is an absolute must read for teens everywhere. I do not read much but this is a book that I truly felt I connected with and I am truly happy that I picked this book up off of the shelf."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger's, The Catcher in the Rye, is an exceptional portrayal of the problems and situations that teenagers experience in their lifetime. Holden Caulfield, a seventeen-year-old boy, writes about his previous expulsion from Pencey Prep. He tries to cope with the death of his younger brother, his obsession for lying, and the problem relationships with his peers and teachers.Before Holden came to Pencey Prep, he lived a hard life. His father is an obsessive businessman, and his mother has yet to recover from the death of his younger brother, Allie. Holden fails in school, tends to get drunk and uses vulgar language.Throughout the rest of the novel, Holden encounters other students and teachers that just don't understand him and give him a hard time. Mr. Spenser, his history teacher tries to be sympathetic to Holden's problems, however he fails after a while because it is sometimes frustrating communicating with Holden. The headmaster asks Holden to leave the prep school as he is failing four of five classes and not applying himself. Holden returns home, borrows money from his ten-year-old sister, Phoebe, and leaves for the night. After that night, Holden decides to leave home, for good, and head west. Phoebe begs to leave with him, but Holden refuses. He remains confused about returning to school. The novel ends with Holden in a mental institution.I thoroughly enjoyed The Catcher in the Rye because of the complex problems that Holden faces throughout the novel. Not all plotlines have to portray perfect lives of people. It is nice to have a different and unique plotline for once. It relays real-life experiences that teenagers still face today. Although this book was written 50 years ago, it remains a good lesson for children and young adults to learn today. This book kept me on the edge of my seat, wondering what was going to happen next. I read it all in about 3 hours, and I usually don't like to read books, however this book was different; I never wanted to put it down. Just remember, like Holden, be true to yourself, but don't overdo it and waste your life failing out of classes and getting drunk. The first step to success is succeeding in yourself and knowing who you are and what you have to do to succeed."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a little masterpiece of a book which is told beautifully in the first person.It narrates the cynical thoughts of its hero cleverly and compulsively as he goes to new york for three days after getting kicked out of school.That is the plot for what it's worth,but the book is mainly about author Salingers cynical take on life and the human race(I suppose this is why,even now,he's a recluse).The hero of the book,Holden Caulfield,is grieving over his dead brother and this is,in my humble opinion,salingers device for putting older more cynical thoughts into his young heros'.I do feel that we all learn of the &quot;phoniness&quot; as we grow up but I would have found it a little hard to swallow that such a young man could be SO extreme without Salingers device.On the subject of phoniness I'm sure we could all talk for hours.For me,what makes this a great book is the prose which is fantastic."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is perhaps my favorite novel of all time. While Holden is a whiny, unambitious teenager, his observations on life and the world around him suggest a sadly wasted intellect. As a teacher, this is the aspect of the novel that draws me to it.In the beginning, Holden is telling his story from an unnamed place, where he claims he &quot;came out here to take it easy.&quot; He confesses that he doesn't want to share his life story, but rather a few interesting days in which he was expelled from a prep school and made the concious decision not to return home, to roam the streets instead. He cleverly describes that day as &quot;that kind of crazy afternoon, terrifically cold, and no sun out or anything, and you felt like you were disappearing every time you crossed a road&quot;(5). And so Holden's misadventure begins.One of the most common complaints involving this novel is its negative language. This is simply a reflection of Holden's pessimistic and negative outlook. Regardless, he is surprisingly insightful.Perhaps the most outstanding scene of the book is when Holden has discovered graffiti at his sister's school, the &quot;f-word&quot; in fact. He is angry, thinking of his sister discovering it. Holden rambles in his own way about how nothing is sacred: &quot;That's the whole trouble. You can't ever find a place that's nice and peaceful, because there isn't any. You may think there is, but once you get there, when you're not looking, somebody'll sneak up and write &quot;F--- you&quot; right under your nose. I think, even, if I ever die, and they stick me in a cemetery, and I have a tombstone and all, it'll say &quot;Holden Caulfield&quot; on it, and then what year I was born, and what year I died, and then right under that it'll say &quot;F--- you&quot;(204).In spite of Holden's whiny, negative personality, it is the spark of hope and wasted intelligence in him that gives this novel its life. Brilliant and impressive."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have come to the conclusion that, no matter how good the book, when i am forced to read something for an english assignment, i never can never enjoy the author's writings. I am a sophomore and i was assigned Cather in the Rye earlier this year. I found the language whiny and aggrevating. However, when i reread the novel, i realized that my original opinion was incorrect. While Holden can become aggrevating with his over use of the word &quot;phoney&quot;, he is a character that i think any teenager can relate with at some point in their life. As a teenager, i do relate with Holden and i can understand his resentment of change. I have come to realize that my first analysis of the book, was completley incorrect and i can now read cather in the rye and enjoy it!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger proves to be a novel about nothing more than the depressed misadventures of flunkout, Holden Caulfield. Holden through out the entire novel complains about nothing more than the whole world and how everything in it is phony. Listening to his on-going bouts with depression is not the most enjoyable thing to read.Holden's views of the world and the people living in it are a little less thoughtful than the average description. Holden just flat out judges people on something as simple as the way someone carries themself in their profession. He comments on the piano player Ernie, who is so good, that if he were to talk to he wwouldn't give you the time of day! This is totally wrong and extremly childish of Holden to consider someone phony if they are a master at their profession. Holden does comment himself as being childish, (pg.9) so these type of views,although prejudice, should be expected. Defining prejudice in the case of Holden would be thathe is obviouslly jealous of those who can be considered phony. If being phony means being someone who has made a living for themself and has achevied what most people would consider sucsess, all Americans, or at least mostAmericans, would want to be phony! The list of phonies goes on and on. Ernie, Mrs. Morrow, Stradlater, the boys at Pencey and the boys at Holden's other schools. It seems that the only people who are not phonies are, Phoebe, Holden's sister, Allie, Holden's dead brother and Holden himself.Holden through out the novel struggles with his depression, this prehaps the largest conflict of the book. All other disputes seem to disappear compared to Holden's on going battle with himself.Salinger uses flashback like descriptions of Holden's brother, Allie,who died of cancer. Salinger used memories of the baseball glove to give us some insight into what exactly is going on in Holden's head. Maybe, just maybe, the reader can make some connection between Holden's past and his depressed present state.The theme is simply this; nothing can destroy your life faster than you can. If you can not come to terms with your own struggles, no other problems can be resolved.A catcher can not catch without the glove. Allie's glove is one of the things that Holden remembers best about Allie. Allie died as a young child. The child singing on the street is a direct connection for Holden. The field symbolizes life, when a field runs of out to a cliff, the vegatation slowly dies out, once the rye is completly gone the only place to go is off the cliff. Falling off the cliff, in Holden's mind, is death. Holden feels if he can catch the children, he can save someone from the pain that he felt at his brother's death. Although he may not relize it, he is saving more than the cchildren, by commiting himself to others, he is saving himself.I think if you are looking for a book that's underlying message is something you must figure out yourself, this one is for you. If you tend to become offended by course language, prostitutes and underaged drinking, you might want to steer clear of this one!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I liked the book, but it is not, in my opinion, worthy of the praise which is bestowed on it. I rate a book by whether I would like to read it again, and this one I wouldn't. However, it is a book that should be read by everyone, like in high school."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"\\"The Catcher In The Rye,\\" by J.D. Salinger is a book that targets the trials and hardships American teens face before they are hurled into the frightening world of adulthood. The book is filled with underlying implications and symbolism that keeps one in suspense as to what will happen next.In the begining of the story, one is unsure of the characters' location or who he is speaking to. The main character, Holden Caulfield, has just been expelled from yet another boarding school and he is telling the entire story from his rather negative perspective. He is on his way back to his home in New York when he makes a few startling discoveries about his life. He ponders where the ducks go when the pond in central park freezes over and why things are constantly changing. He thinks about his brother that passed away and he wishes he could save children about to make their great change into adulthood. He realizes that he is not ready for the life ahead of him. He also realizes that his younger sister is still trapped in a world of innocence and fears for her as she inches towards the world of adulthood.Throughout the story, Holden is having many conflicts. He has conflicts with society and authority figures as well as within himself. He has a problem with any person with power over his life. He feels they are phony and has no respect for them. Within himself, he seems to feel out of control. He feels unable to change the course his life has begun to take.\\"The Catcher In The Rye,\\" is a book that is hard to put down. It makes one think about the story on a symbolic level. It reminds us all of our own loss of innocence and journey out of childhood and into adulthood. The story takes a teenage boy through his own feelings of such issues as love, loss, sex, grief, depression, affection, and need for attention."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"You have to let yourself enjoy it, and then it will mean something to you."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Well, first off, when I heard we had to read this book for my English class I wasn't too happy. I'm not much of a reader of anything not Sci-Fi or Tolkien, so when I started reading and 'as hell' or 'phony' popped up every few sentences I wasn't impressed. BUT, I kept at it because of the sheer fact it was required. So, after about an hour of reading and 6 chapters to go I was ready to die. It was just a bunch of words on paper driving me nuts. Once I finally finished I sat there thinking and realized that even though there were 23 chapters worth of nothing to me, I got this weird feeling that I had learned something out of the other two chapter that made sense. If I hadn't endured the 23 chapters which meant nothing to me, the other two chapters worth of writing and ideas wouldn't have sunken in as deeply.I don't expect many to have the same opinion or feeling I do because I am not much like anyone else but I do recommend this to anyone who has strayed from their path, needs help finding one, or just need to see what all the commotion is about."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The entire time I was reading this book I was expecting the next page to become \\"The Great Book\\".

(Wait, I am only 23.)I can however say it may have taught people lessons about life, especially young adults or it wouldn't of become this \\"GREAT MASTERPIECE\\" everyone has been talking about for fifty years.To me it was like phantom of the opera, although I really didn't want to read the book, I did, because it was supposed to be a great Literature Masterpiece. Maybe I should stop being a follower. I am wasting too much time.Two Stars because 1. I liked some of the dialouge and 2. It only took me three hours to read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have read some of the reviews that say that this book was honest and is about a teenager trying not to lose his innocence and trying to stay away form all the phonies in his life. Maybe I am not as deep as some people reading this book but I think the biggest phony in the entire book is Holden. He keeps saying how he hates it when people pretend to be nice or being phoney as he calls it, but he does it all the time more than anyone else in the book. And if he wants to keep his innocense so bad why does he always wish he were older so he could drink and smoke and not get a lecture? He probably gets along better with kids because they never tell him he is too young to do something. The book was not all bad though, in fact the only part of the book i wasn't too fond of was Holden's character. He said things over and over and over. There were glimpses of humor on his part but i don't know why everyone in the book put up with him. I am on Stradlater's side for punching the hell out of him, I would have done the same thing."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a fantastic book, a true classic if there's ever one. Salinger has a way of writing that brings the characters to life, and what's more, is that they're characters that we care about, and want to read about. The reader can't help to identify with most of the characters.One of the characters that we can all identify with is the main character, Holden Caufield. As the reader, we're able to get have the treat of spending two or three days with him. We see how negative he is, but yet we wish him the best of luck. Why's what do you ask? It's simple....we can see some of ourself in Holden. We can't help to care about him, b/c he's us. Maybe we're not as negative as Holden, but at times, we're him. We're him b/c he's an honest character. Holden could be our neighbor, a family member, or a friend. That's how strong of a writer Salinger is. He has the power to hold us to the page. We want to see what Holden's going to do next.We see Holden getting kicked out of school and spend the next two days with him, and are able to look at his life. I like the ending b/c it makes you think.I highly suggest this book. Once you start, I promise you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I could really relate to the character in this book because...well I don't know but he's pretty realistic. So are the others in the book, especially those he views with some disdain. If you liked this and you are a girl you will probably also like The Bell Jar and Invisible Monsters by Chuck Palahniuk. Maybe."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book was recommended to me by a random book store woman in Las Vegas who just came up to me and said, 'I really do think you'll enjoy this book. You seem like you would. I loved it when I was younger.' I was very excited to be recommended such a famous book, and to be told that I seemed like I'd enjoy it. Let me tell you-it isn't worded like any Establishmentarian, but even so, it is still extremely well written. J.D. Salinger really delivers this novel. He tells you straight out how the character feels. No super-fancy wording to describe it. This book is somewhat metaphoric at parts. It seems to make you think-which is good! I highly recommend this book from ages 9 and above. If you don't understand it while you're young, read again later when you're sixteen, and it may make more sense."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a literary masterpiece that symbolizes the preservation of youth and the rebellious attitude that children encounter in the teen years of their life. Holden Caulfield, the protagonist of the story, is the epitome of a rebellious teen. Because of lack of work and caring, Holden is expelled from three schools. A chronic liar, he cheats his way through his childhood. Though he has this terrible attitude, and an awful view on everything, he drags you into his life, and you begin to have sympathy for the character. The only thing that he would like to get out of his life is to become the \\"catcher in the rye\\", the one person that can keep children from going over the edge, and by edge I mean stepping into adulthood. This book is one of the best written, and certainly the most interesting book I have ever read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye is a psychological examination of Holden's attempt to preserve the innocence and authenticity of youth. As Holden becomes exposed to the fatal rituals of pretence and all of adulthood's injustice and narcissism he assumes the role of protector of all youth in an attempt to save them from an awakening into this culpable world. The genius of the book however, lies in its sheer pertinence; the ease with which one can identify with Holden. Holden epitomize a time we all face. Thus reading this book will not only provide you with many entertaining hours of captivating reading but also with many hours of introspective and worthwhile reflection. The Catcher in the Rye is one of the crowning achievements of American literature and a must read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield is a confused teenager who is trying to find out who he is and where he fits in. He thinks that he is an adult, but he really does not have the skills to be one. He narrates the story of several of the gloomiest days in his sixteen-year-old life as a flashback. The story begins when Holden is expelled from prep school for poor grades. Because he had flunked out of three or four other schools, he waited around in New York City for the day when all of his classmates went to Christmas vacation before he went home to break the news of his expulsion to his parents. In those several days, he gets drunk, goes on dates, wanders the streets and even sneaks a visit to his apartment to visit his sister, Phoebe. Holden tells Phoebe that what he really wants to do is be the catcher in the rye; that when all of the little kids were playing games in the rye he would be the person to catch the kids before they fell off the cliff. He wouldn't play the games with the kids, but he would just help them to not fall off the cliff. This means that Holden felt like an outsider and longed to be included, but deep in his heart he really wanted to help people.Holden Caulfield's cynical attitude toward everybody and everything gives him the different personality that he has and makes his story a good read. At times you just laugh at the book because some of the things he does are so stupid and thickheaded. In the end, you will find that Holden Caulfield is a troubled boy who thinks that the world is out to get him and make him do things that he does not want to do."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield carried around a lot of emotionalbaggage for one so young ( sixteen ). His growing painswere overwhelming at times as he was entering manhood;his rite of passage, if you will. He saw his older brotherJ B the writer as a total sellout for becoming a hack writerin Hollywood. Holden loved his younger sister Phoebe. Hethought she was wicked smart. He still mourned his littlebrother Allie who had died of leukemia. Holden had a hardtime handling Allie's death. Somehow he just didn't seemto fit in anywhere. He had a problem dating girls his ownage. He fought with his roommate. His grades were failingat his second prep school of which he was asked to leave.Holden Caulfield didn't seem to really belong anywhere!I think that Salinger has nailed it in this novel. He hascaptured the essence of a lost youth's plight. A great read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book deserves all the credit it can get! It rocks.... Although,yes, it is depressing at times, it is also hilarious and real. I'm 17 years old, only a year older than Holden,and, actually, I can kind of relate to his story-- All of the guys at his prep school, Pencey, seem very real.I'll admit, teenagers can be some of the phoniest people in the world. He does mention how much he hates phony things.... From teachers, to students, down to people he knows from other places, and how phony movies are. He is mature and seemingly wise beyond his sixteen years; and, yet, he acts like a twelve year old, too. He's the one of the most real teenage boy characters I've read about..... My favorite parts are when he talks about his little sister, Phoebe, and, his dead brother, Allie. They are believable characters, and, you can't help but like them, too. Holden's actions and responses to his experience is witty, but, it can also open your eyes and make you realize things from his point of view. It's too bad that this is on banned book lists, because, as a high school student, I think that if this book was offered in the ciricumlm, teens would read this, and enjoy it as much as I do!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have never met a character as real as Holden Caulfield before this book. The main character literally speaks to you (in first person) about his struggles, fears, likes, dislikes and reveals so much about himself that you end up rooting for him. In a nutshell, the story revolves around the everyday goings-on of a fifteen-year-old school dropout. You may be tempted to discredit the plot/story line as mundane, but let me assure you that this book has so much more to offer.Some may find Salinger's portrayal of the angst-ridden youth a tad whiny and frustrating, but that's just part and parcel of growing up. The author paints this brilliantly - emphasizing that the road to self-discovery can be a frightful, lonesome experience. And all this, in Holden's very own words. Very candid, very real. Personally, I could identify with a lot of the observations Holden made about himself as well as others (he once called himself a yellow chicken because he hated fist fights). Salinger also splashes the book with ample humor, making this one of the more memorable reads I've had.Overall, &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; is a brutally honest book - one that peers into the soul of anyone who's still searching for a direction in life, whether you're fifteen or fifty. Read it, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Although I am not a very literary type, I just have to chime in with my 5 stars. One of the most beautiful, humanly deep and touching novels I have ever read! But if you don't appreciate the type of wry wit and cynical look on phoneys that characterizes the lyrics from rock group Steely Dan, this book is probably not for you.I perceive this writing as the American equivalent of French Canadian novel genius Rejean Ducharme's vision of childhood vs. the cramped hypocrisy of adults.Love at first read!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is the best. Even though it's a classic it's not one that you would hate to read but still want to be able to say you have read. If you want to know what all the fuss is about, read it, because yes it has been criticized and banned in schools. It is the story of a troubled youth, Holden Caufield, who has just abandoned his fancy boarding school, Pencey Prep. He journeys to New York City and repudiates all society has to offer. It is a witty story about the abandonment of youth, shattered idealism, the shunning of one who is different, the fake glamour of life, the love one has for a sister. Read it, you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"If you are searching for a great book, the search is over. Catcher in the Rye is the best book, period. I do not say these words lightly. It is not just the perfect reflection of teenage turmoil and right of passage, it stretches wider to form the closest an author has ever come to describing the movement of the American self. Written in the 1950s, it still hold massive relevance in the 21st century, the character of Holden Caufield transcends generations and fashions to become the voice for any lost sole. It is more than 5 stars good- there is no description of what this book will do for your life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger is a novel about a 16-year boy who goes to a prep school called Pency Prep. The main character is Holden Caulfield and some of the other characters are, Jane Gallagher, and Phoebe Caulfield. The story line is that Holden gets expelled then goes to New York for a few days and considers moving away.Despite what most people say about this book being one of the best ever written I did not particularly like it. It lacked a good ending and the plot was also boring and not eventful. The only part I liked was when he gets the prostitute and just talks with her and still pays her. The book did not stand out from any of the other books I have read. It was an average book and by far not the best one I have read.The characters in the story were fine. Holden was very depressed and did not like anyone other then himself. Jane is a girl that Holden used to have a thing for but then he went on a date with her later in the story and realized she wasn't what he wanted. Phoebe was Holden's little sister. She was what made Holden realize that he really didn't want to move out. The characters in the story could have been stronger.The author only wrote this one novel. He wrote other short stories but no other books. I believe that Salinger wrote this book based on something that happened in his life. He wrote the book in first person. It was published in 1945.I believe that one of the reasons it is so famous was because of how controversial it was. It was banned from schools and bookstore when it came out. When john Lennon was murdered his assassin had a copy of the book. In 2005 it was one of the ten most challenged books. Throughout the story the \\"f\\" word is only used 6 times and it is always referred to when he sees the word written in a school or museum while the word goddamn is used 245 times. The controversy surrounding this book is what I believe made it so popular.This book is for teenagers and adults. It appeals to teenagers because it involves themes that teenagers face everyday."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this for the first time as an adult and I have to say that I was VERY disappointed. I did not understand what the big deal was although I have a theory. I think that if I had read this when I was younger, it would have probably had a greater impact one me because of the subject matter. I did not really enjoy this book but I am still glad I read it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've tried and struggled to understand what it is about \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" that draws so many people. I've heard people tell me that it's brilliant, wonderful, a great way to spend an afternoon... So many people love this book, call it a classic, call it the \\"best, most brilliant book ever\\". It is, however, nothing of the sort.\\"The Catcher in the Rye\\", in its most basic sense, is teenage angst. Perhaps the fact that nothing like this had ever been written before was what made it intriguing, but nowadays, when teenage angst is splattered all over the internet, that's not particularly interesting or drawing. When you look a little deeper into the book, you find that Holden is a troubled teenager. The book, in all honestly, simply follows him around for a few days, gives us an image of what sort of person he is, and then ends. It follows through him trying to be an adult, trying to be a child, and then moping around for a bit. Any 15 year old could say the same.If it was simply angst, it still might be okay, but unfortunately, where Salinger could have saved this book, he destroyed it. There's absolutely no plot! It's a day in the life of a horny teenage boy who doesn't know what he wants with his life. While, yes, Salinger added some \\"pretty\\" and meaningful parts (the title comes from one such moment where the book feels thoughtful and reflective, but really has no point, though it is a rather nice moment), and while perhaps Salinger is a good writer (this is the first book of his I've read, and to be quite honest, I don't feel any inclination to read another), \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" is neither truly well-written, nor is the plot good enough that I could call it good through that road.I didn't actually find \\"Catcher\\" dull, as many other people do. I simply think that you're better off reading another book. Yes, it's a quick read, but it's quite pointless! Holden Caulfield is a troublesome character; some people connect to him wonderfully and others despise him, thinking he's an annoying child who should just shut his mouth. I fall somewhere closer to the second category. I didn't like him, the way he viewed the world, or the way he tried to face it. After all, I'm close to his age, and I would never act the way he did. I don't just think it's a boring book, but I do think that people ought to realize what they're getting into:1. Holden Caulfield can be an annoying, irritating character. While some view his behavior as one who wants to remain in a world of innocence, others view it as running away from reality. He's a tricky main character, and I found him difficult to connect to.2. \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" is teenage angst that is written in a slightly nicer manner than that found on weblogs.3. Just because the book is CALLED \\"best book\\", etc. it is not necessarily so.All in all, you probably have to read the book to figure out if you fall into the \\"LOVE!\\" category, or the \\"UGH!\\" group. If you've got nothing better to do, I guess you're welcome to pick this book up and breeze through it. You should probably just be warned that you may not like it. It's not actually that good of a book, neither particularly interesting nor a \\"classic\\". Read it if you must, but there are significantly better books out there."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Personally, I loved this book! It really does indeed show how a typical teenager can think, since there were some points where I thought \\"Hey, I'm like that, too\\". But mostly, throughout the entirety of the book, I was reminded of this one friend I have. I couldn't pin down why until I read some reviews and finally I discovered why Holden reminded me so much of this one friend I have. Mental issues. Isn't that a lovely thing to remind you of a person?Mostly, I could identify with Holden and his reluctance to let go of innocence and to protect it. Although I disapprove of many of the actions that Holden took, i.e. smoking, drinking, hiring a prostitute, etc., Holden is one those \\"good boy\\" types, he doesn't really want trouble, but he couldn't help it then.The best thing I loved about this book was the writing style. I'm a nut when it comes to speaking properly, so this book drove me crazy, but all the delicious sarcasm was enough of an apology to me.It's a great book. It really is."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye was a pretty good book in my opinion. The author, J.D. Salinger, told a story about how it is hard for a teenage boy to live on his own in NYC. Catcher in the Rye is an adventure book. It is an adventure book based on the aspect that Holden runs away and lives on his own in NYC. He goes to many places and meets new people and sees people he already knew.J.D. Salinger had a very unique writing style for this book. J.D. writes as if he was a teenage boy who has a lot of trouble in school. He swears a lot. I like this style of writing because it helps me understand the character more and it also helps me understand what the character is thinking. I think that it was a good style of writing for this book.The book is about a kid named Holden Caulfield. Holden is a teenager who goes to a prep school called Pencey prep. Holden is the kind of kid who doesn't like school much. He doesn't get good grades because he doesn't care enough about school. Holden had already been failed out of some other schools before so it didn't come as a big surprise to him when he failed out of Pencey. Holden didn't have many good friends at Pencey that he liked anyway. He was a roommate with a kid named Stradlater who he thought was conceded and the only other kid that he was friends with was a kid named Ackley. According to Holder Ackley was an annoying kid who lived next door. In the book Holden says \\"about eighty-five times a day old Ackley barged in on me\\" (pg 19). When Holden got failed out of Pencey he runs away. He decides to take the money that his grandmother gave him and to go stay at a hotel. Holden decides to go to a nightclub before he goes to the hotel. He tries to order a soda and some scotch but the waiter wont get it for him because he wasn't old enough. Holden get a scotch and soda. He just drinks and listens to conversations around him. He thinks that all the people there are \\"phony\\". Then Holden sees Lillian Simmons, one of his brother's old girlfriends. When Holden talks about her he says she's \\"strictly a phony\\" (pg 86). Lillian invites Holden to sit with her and her boyfriend. Holden says that he was just about to go. The Holden leaves and goes to the hotel. On his way up to his room the elevator boy, Maurice, asked Holden if he wanted to prostitute for $5. Holden says yes. When the prostitute comes all Holden wants to do is talk to her. Then when the prostitute leaves she asks for $10. Holden only gives her five. Then she leaves very upset. In the middle of the night Holden hears a knock on the door. It is Maurice and the prostitute. They say that Holden owes them five more dollars. Holden wont pay them so Maurice beats Holden up while the prostitute takes five dollars. Then they leave. After this Holden says that he wanted to commit suicide, but he didn't.Holden goes on in his adventure meeting up with many people including his old teacher who gives Holden a new impression of him. Then Holden decides he wants to run away forever. Holden tells his sister to meet him at the museum so they can say good-bye. When his sister gets there she has a suitcase. She tells Holden that she wants to go with him. What will Holden do? J.D. Salinger comes up with a very intriguing ending to the book. You will have to read it to find out what happens."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I think the book is a very nice book because it is so realistic. You've been put into the mind of Holden, a boy who lives on the streets of New York for a few days. You get really into the book. I really like it. The language is American English and it's the language you hear in movies and American series a lot. It is easy to understand and I like it a lot."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm afraid I'd have to yell at Holden Caulfield if I ever met him in real life. Arguably Salinger's masterwork, this book is a first person narrative of a troubled teenager who can't seem to think straight, much less act deliberately. Caulfield wanders from place to place and person to person seemingly on a whim. The most troubling part of this book is that Caulfield's thoughts both repeat and contradict themselves; this makes the prose style difficult to read.I admire Salinger's ability to turn out a stream of conscious narrative of this type. Few authors have this ability. As a coherent novel, it works well, despite the jerky narrative (a hallmark of any true stream of consciousness novel). The secondary characters seem brighter at times than Caulfield, a nice touch; I particularly liked Phoebe.There is plenty of art to be dissected and meaning to be squeezed from this novel. However, I would say that its full impact would likely be felt in the more tumultuous teenage years, rather than later as an adult. Caulfield's fumblings come off as convincingly adolescent, a moderately frustrating impression if you no longer live that way. This is worth reading, but not among my favorite classics."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"While the story is extremely attractive, as it introduces us to a variety of realities, Salinger's genius is in his choppy syntax. Being a victim of formal writing, I found reading the story quite challenging at first, but once I became familiar with Salinger's writing style, his story became entrancing. A definite \\"need to read\\" for the imaginary whom poses the inability to imagine truth."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Although I am only twelve, I don't have that much trouble understanding this complex novel. For my honors english class, we had to pick an outside reading book at high school level. We were then asked to pick 8 passages that illustrate the following: protagonist, antagonist, setting, climax, theme, ethical issue, resolution. This is not an easy thing to do. For one, the conflict isn't made apprehendable what so ever. You have to put two and two together, and really focus on the universal expieriences Holden Caulfield goes through as a teenager. I suggest reading certain passages over and over. If you are not a dynamic person, you won't understand the deep meaning to the story- TRUST ME!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is about the twilight between childhood and adulthood. We, us adults, have all been there and those with teenagers are dealing with it now but from the adult prospective. In other words, we DID lose something of that childhood innocence.Phoniness... Haven't we all dealt with it? The characters in the book reflect on so many experiences we've been through or are going through. We all know about the Ackleys, Stradlaters, etc.No matter how much some teenagers wish to be treated as adults, there's always that fear of leaving one part of our lives behind and never being able to get it back. That's the hardest part, in my opinion, about growing up, to never have again what you once had.Holden is pretty much on his own after his brother's death as his parents deal with their own loss in their own way and, since he was only a child, was probably meant to grow out of the pain of having lost his brother."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"OK. I read this book for an English book review. I first heard about it when I watched Conspiracy Theory and I wanted to read it to find out how it fits in with the movie. I read it, thinking the whole time that Holden is insane. The kid scares me. But I want to know what the point of this book is. I couldn't see one. I opened the book with an open mind, I usually read fantasy and this book isn't one that would ordinarily catch my attention. The swearing didn't bother me. I actually found that amusing. But the book bothered me in some unknown way. I want to know what the point was. It was an ok book, but I didn't exactly like it a whole lot."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book has become my favorite book of all time. I am a junior in high school, and I read it to understand whats happening around me. It is a book that everyone can relate to, saying that many people are phonies because of what they do. All of Holden's experiences has somewhat happened to me somewhere along the line as well. This is just a great book. Plain and simple. Thank you J. D. Salinger"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I understand all these excellent reviews do have backing, I can't continue to read it. Salinger didn't intend to make ypou all happy, he was shpwing the effects of his life in literaure. For example the theme of phoniness. His mom changed her name so that her husband's family would except her."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Didn't anyone wish that Salinger had written more about Holden's interactions with Jane Gallagher? For me, the most heartbreaking section was where Jane broke down crying during the checkers game and Holden began kissing her. After that she disappeared and Holden never got into &quot;the mood&quot; to call her. Maybe after his disastrous encounter with Sally Hayes he didn't want to see what old Jane had become herself. Anyhow, I thought the plot was marginal, but in a story like this if there's TOO much plot it overwhelms the character. And Holden is an incredible character. To all the people who complain that Holden is whiny and pessimistic: re-read the book. Holden doesn't indiscriminately label everything as &quot;phony&quot;, &quot;lousy&quot;, or &quot;corny.&quot; When he is pleased with something he is direct about it. What is heartbreaking is the way he continually demeans himself and his intelligence, while his remarks and insights really show him to be a child (not an adult) of incredible intelligence and sensitivity. He's so lonely and vulnerable that you just want to give him a hug, tell him that you understand his troubles. I think the purpose of the plot was basically to place Holden in many different situations (many involving the consumption of alcohol) and leave the reader to piece together his character. The section where Holden hired the prostitute and then just asked her to talk, then was threatened by the oafish elevator man and broke down crying, was blackly funny. He's such a little boy."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book was probably the most interesring book I have ever read in my 17 years of being on the planet. It was tear jerking, discusting, and best of all- Hilarious. But after I had finished the book, somebody asked me what it was about. I found mysely struggling to answer them and I finally said, I'm not sure. So I give Mr. Sallinger 3 Big stars for a great book. But please-- what is the point??"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a well written book with an interesting plot. Holden Caulfield is very cynical of the world around him, and perhaps especially of himself, and he becomes what I would call depressed. Holden becomes angry and bitter, and all this is displayed quite realistically. For another book in this genre (a better one in my opinion), check out &quot;Lost in Place,&quot; the story of a boy/man growing up in suburbia. Like &quot;The Catcher in the Rye,&quot; &quot;Lost in Place&quot; deals with life and the protagonist's outlook on it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have no i dea why this work is so popular; it is equivolent to a PG-13 movie about a teenager that lacks a plot."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I was just given this book to read for grade twelve english and I couldn't put it down.

I would highly recommend this book if you like reading about alienist loners."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've read this three tomes. Definitely a classic. In my mind ione of the top five books of the modern era. Brash and honest, Holden Caufield is a young man every old man should look up to.

The sooner the better."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have been forced to read many terrible books in school and this is the only one that I truly liked and is one of my favorite books I have ever read. It's very enjoyable but can be hard to understand. You have to read between the lines for this one."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I haven't needed to be so simple about any book except this book. In fact, most of my reviews on other books fill half the page with my views. Yet, this book is simple of pure genius. It is about a depressed soul, Holden Caufield, but it creates many stereotypes. In reality, many of us of often Holdens. We often share his view. And that is why it is so insightful. This book isn't just about some 16 year kid, it is about ourselves. It is about us. It is about youths. This book was rated to be one of the 100 best English novels ever writeen this century. If a person doesn't enjoy it, or doesn't understand it, then I suggest that they take a literature course in university or take high school English all over again. It is pure genius. We cannot find this a bad book because it depresses us. Of the greatest books ever written, they are often about a world of horrid nature, such as Aldous Huxley's &quot;Brave New World&quot; or George Orwell's &quot;Nighteen Eighty-Four.&quot! ; It is very important to note that if you don't find the character satisfying, there is a reason. He's not satisfying. Holden's a loser. But he was meant to be that way. To read this book, one must understand literature. A character who is pathetic is meant to be that way by the author. It is used to show an aspect of human nature. I won't give a literature lesson, J.D. Salinger is a genius in communicating human nature in his book. I would recommend all young adults to read this book once in their lives. And if they really understand it, it is always beneficial. The complex genius of J.D. Salinger and the revealing of how it's like to be a youth is what makes this book so special. A simply must read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had to read Catcher in the Rye in a Young Adult Lit. class in college a few years ago. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and hung on to it so I can reread it someday and enjoy it all over again. I was surprised reading through the customer reviews on here that quite a few people actually detested this book. Although there were also many people who loved it. I guess it's just one of those books that you either love or hate..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Cathcer in the Rye not only opened our High School English classroom into a realm of unexplained thoughts and language, but it made most of the students realize that literature (required reading) isn't always dry. Holden expresses himself the way children in today's society do, with explicit actions and vulagarity, and if people aren't willing to except the morals and lifestyle of their youth, then they can band it, and similary books of extraordinary thought -but reality. It is the only book I read twice, and the first book that I thouroughly enjoyed, both times. To be honest, it changed the way I act in society, instead of behaving like a turtle in my shell, protected and shy - Now, whether it is exceptable in society or not, I say what I think and act on instinct, and many more people respect that then they do a scared turtle. Thanks Holden!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Think about it. Has the life of a teenager really changed from the 1950's to the 1990's? Holden proves to me that it has not. His arrogant &quot;I know everything&quot; attitude is masterfully detailed by Salinger. The sex, alcohol, and &quot;don't give a damn&quot; attitude of Holden is really the reality of just about every teenager, even today. That is what makes Salinger's book a classic. Holden is someone we either were or someone we knew at some point in our lives. We ALL sympathize with Holden, yet at the same time we say to ourselves, &quot;what the hell is this kid thinking?&quot; Yet, we all know exactly what he is thinking, even if we don't like to admit it! If you open your mind and your heart to Holden Caulfield, you are really opening up to yourself!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"&quot; Catcher in the Rye&quot; is simply...brilliant. Holden is extremely funny when he calls everyone phony and a prince. The Ackley guy also adds humour to the story but there is also a great deal of sadness in this story. The way Holden phones everyone up and they are not in or don't want to meet him is depressing. I do not agree with some of the comments on this book, such as this is a book for rapists or killers. If I wasn't misinformed the guy who killed John Lennon read this book just before commiting that terrible crime. But that guy was CRAZY he could've picked some other book, even if Holden did mention killing. Every person on Earth should read this book and believe it can never be over rated."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is not your ordinary book. It is both good and bad. It is written very well, very realistic, and is a book I might've enjoyed had I chosen to read it myself. The point is, there is no physical plot. Holden Caulfield is a 16 year old teenager, as am I, and the reason I think those who give this book a horrible review do so because it strikes to close to the mark. No, I'm not an alcoholic, and I don't even swear, but it still strikes true on the depression level. If you want a good book with a plot, this book is not for you. Forget that, if you just want a good book this is not for you. This book is for you only if you have forgotten what it is like to be a teenager and think the world's against you, scratch that /know/ it is against you. This book is not for those that think every book needs a plot, of which I am one. I really identified with Holden, too much in fact. If you do not fully understand what depression /is/, not just the definition, but what i! t truly /is/, read this book. Read it anyway. But don't expect this book to come out allright in the end or anything, because it won't. It's a slice of the life of someone I personally wouldn't want to meet. I'm sure if you've read it you'll argue that he has some good, but you're just saying that to argue. Almost every review of the 267 I've read is polarized between Good or Bad. This book is a dark gray ppl, don't be prejudiced! I can see both ways right now, and I choose the side that says this book shouldn't be read without knowing about it beforehand. That is why this book needs a Warning Label, to let you know what you're getting into. END"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I was introduced to Salinger by a female friend. She recommended I read &quot;Franny &amp; Zooey,&quot; which I enjoyed so much I went to the bookstore the next day and read all of &quot;The Catcher in the Rye.&quot; I liked it much better.Salinger resembles Vonnegut (one of my other favorites) in his ability to make the characters the plot. This book has no real bad guys. It's the story of a 16 year old trying to make sense of his world, as he's moved beyond the affectations and prejudices of his peers, yet doesn't have the age or the understanding to be accepted as an adult. There's no great action, no blatant mysteries to be solved. Salinger does an excellent job of making us see the world through his character's eyes, and in this case, as one reviewer mentioned, it is a very narrow view. This story evokes the wonderment one feels as that narrow view slowly expands. And that's the beauty of this book. It's like a painting, but of an entire stage in life I think we! all go through.Or maybe not all. When I told the girl who had recommended to me &quot;Franny &amp; Zooey&quot; my preference for this title, she was surprised. I told her I thought it was a guy thing -- the social wrestling in the bars, the macho wrestling in the dorms, the confusing encounter with a prostitute -- all represent a different area in which any man must feel accepted and competent before truly feeling complete.Interestingly enough, another male friend to whom the same girl had recommended &quot;Franny &amp; Zooey&quot; also had gone on to read &quot;Catcher.&quot; And he too preferred it, claiming it was a &quot;guy thing.&quot;Simple enough to read quickly through the first time, profound and real enough to read again and again. And to get something new each time."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I must have read and re-read this book 10 times, and each time I read it again it just gets better. What is more amazing is that the experience you gain from the book changes with age. I first read it as a freshman in high school, and now, being a sophomore in college, I pick up more things and interpret them differently than before. Important to understand while reading the book is that Salinger did NOT write it to describe today's &quot;rebellious&quot; youth. He was writing in a much different time, so many of his stereotypes don't apply to today. What hasn't chagned is the deeper meaning of the book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book a few months before my sixteenth birthday - and I've never found a character I liked more than Holden Caulfield. The monologue is heartfelt, realistic, and funny. The things he goes through in this novel are timelessly relevant to a teenager's thoughts and feelings, yet the writing is so good, the character development so thorough, that it can appeal to any reader. I can't put into words my love for this novel, because it struck a chord deep within me; I read it at just the right time in my life (and I've read it many times since). I definitely recommend this.. it's a must-read for ANYONE. A million stars."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The funniest, smartest, most enjoyable book I have ever read. Haven't we all felt like Holden at one time or another? I still laugh every time I read it, which has been many times since it was assigned to me in 11th grade."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye, a book by J. D. Salinger, is a teenager's journal. Holden's (the protagonist) troubles begin with him being kicked out of his school. It's not that he is stupid or lazy - he just does not give a damn. Holden doesn't want his parents to know that he was kicked out, and spends a week wandering around New York city, listening to jazz, talking to old friends and strangers.Throughout the book, he tells time and again how disgusted he is with everybody he has a chance to meet or talk to. He is not a nasty person at all; on the contrary, he is kind and caring in the heart. The book is about a teenager growing up, about rebellion against accepted norms and stereotypes of behavior.Holden does not sound like a person who you would want to have tea with, but his reasoning is interesting and captivating. The way he talks about each of the characters that he meets is just like listening to a . . . You can't explain it. You just have to read it.I liked this book a lot. Holden makes life seem so simple and not worth living. This book plays with your mind - it seizes your mind, forces you to think the way Holden thinks. That's the main reason why I loved this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I just finished reading this book for the second time. The first time I read the book was 7 years ago as a senior in high school. I find that even as a successful adult, I still identify with Holden Caulfield.The book iteself deals with the a day in the life of a trouble adolescent, who has found the world to be riddled with phonies. Some of the observations Holden makes are very profound for an adolescent. Some see Holden as a boy who hates everything, but this is not what is found as you read into the character. Holden has a great deal of love and compassion in his heart. However, based in the fact that he is young and still learning about the world and the fact that he borders on manic depression, he has trouble expressing love or perhaps even knowing what love is.Overall, this story of the rebel without a cause is well written and is still equipped to give us some insight into the lives of both adolescents and people in general. I love this book so much that I will likely read it again some day. I hope some day there is a quality movie version of this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. I am amazed at the ability of Salinger to peer into the minds of his characters and pull out an illusion that anyone can witness and feel. His short stories do the same, inviting you on a psychological endeavor into the minds of fictional characters. These are thoughts and actions we all can relate to and it makes the characters much more interesting when this can be done. All of Salinger's work is very unique and very special, but this story in it's entirety is on another, a higher, level of greatness. In my opinion, Catcher in the Rye is one of the greatest books ever written. Read it. The paperback is cheaper, but you might want to spend the extra money to place this one on your display shelf for multiple readings and admiration."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is a nice book. It isn't very special, it's not like you should read it and know it by heart, but I like it. At first I thought: Oh no, another book to read for school. But when I started to read, I liked it more with every page I turned.The language J.D. Salinger used in \`Catcher in the rye' is kind of simple, it's easy to read. That's one thing I like most about the book: it's simple. You don't really have to think about it, you just let it all enter your mind and that's it. That makes the story so \`light'.The main character Holden Caufield is a sixteen-year-old boy who had just been kicked out of high school a few days before the Christmas-holiday. So he decides to go to New York with the money his grandmother sent him and enjoy life there. He goes to a hotel, invites a hooker, drinks a lot, meets a lot of people... but it disappoints him. The adult world is just all about money, and that's it. The story is very recognizable and you really know what Holden is talking about. His feelings are clear and sometimes you feel like YOU are Holden yourself. Now, let's not overreact, but sometimes... he thinks like young people do.The story wasn't too long and not even too short, it was good as it was. During reading, I never felt bored.I liked it, because it's a great book. So read it !!!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I think this book is in one way a kind of tragic. Holden Caulfield is a pathetic person who doesn't know what to do with himself or his life. I think J.D.Salinger did a wonderful job at this stage, he wanted Holden to be so and the reader believes he really is. That's something I liked very much about this book. You know exactly what Holden thinks, you know exactly how he feels and what he'll do and what he won't do. That's a reason why I liked reading The catcher in the rye.But I don't think the story was good. It was a bit boring, it are only 3 days out of Holden Caulfield's life and although Salinger has described it beautifully, it didn't interest me. Holden Caulfield's life is boring, that's why it takes so long to read the book. You do not feel the must to know the end, you just read until the end, not exactly to know the end just to finish the book. But there is no end, the story isn't finished because Holden Caulfield doesn't die or anything, he just moves on.What bothered me about this book were the choice of words. J.D.Salinger uses a lot the same words and by a lot, I mean really a lot...I didn't count it, but the word phony or helluva began to bother me. Every time I read the word I thought: \`not again this word!' And I do not like it in a book when the author uses a lot the same words.In the beginning it didn't go fast, the reading I mean. But once you get to know Holden Caulfield better, it goes faster, but still not interesting. I'm sorry, but for me there wasn't really a story in this book.Of course there were a few things I really liked. For instance the relationship between Holden and his sister Phoebe...Salinger gives you the feeling that these two have a relation where nobody comes between. Nobody can touch them, and I love that idea. I also loved the descriptions of Salinger, the way he describes Pencey or Caulfield's life in New York...I can understand Holden Caulfield, he is just a normal teenager that still has to find his way.I didn't mind reading this book, but it was too long. The story wouldn't stop and after a while it seemed like an obligation to read just until you finish the book...For me that's terrible because I love reading (I read a lot in Dutch), and I don't like it when I have the feeling it is an obligation to read a book...But besides that, the book wasn't that bad. I don't say it was a good book, I'm saying that the book wasn't bad...Salinger did a good job, but the story wasn't that interesting.(Elien Plompen)"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"My opinion : \\"Catcher in the Rye\\"Catcher in the Rye wasn't a very amusing book if you ask me. In the beginning you can laugh a lot with the personality of Holden Caulfield, but it starts to annoy a person very soon. Holden is a person who seems to hate everything and everybody, they all make him depressed. The comments he has about everybody are really funny in the first chapters, but after a while it made me feel depressed too, it really started to bore me. When I read a book I think it's important that you can recognise yourself in the leading person of the story, or at least feel any sympathy with him or her. In this book I can't. Nothing really happens in the story, it are just a couple of days picked out of someone's life. And it aren't exactly the most exiting days, nothing interesting seems to happen in those days. Besides that Holden himself isn't really interesting too. In fact he's a very immoral boy, he lies and he drinks a lot. He also talks about the most uninteresting things. I'm not surprised when some people get sore at him for that, some of the things he wants to talk about are really boring. If I didn't had to read the book for school, I would never have finished it I geuss."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I find it a beautiful story. I admire the manner how the writer wrote the story: the language (the change from \`written' English and \`spoken' English) and the fluent way of telling everything. (During the reading of the book, I had the feeling that I was drifting on the water).Sometimes are the descriptions too long (for example the museum, Jezus and the belief,...). Holden also tells too much about the things that happened in the past and that aren't necessary for mention because it hasn't to do anything with the (main) story.The most beautiful parts of the story are the times when Holden and Phoebe are together. I find it lovely how they talk and cheer up each other. Especially when Phoebe stays there with here suitcase and says that she will go with him, when Holden is waiting in the rain while Phoebe is sitting on the carrousel and when holden cries and Phoebe comfort him. You can feel how much they love each other. I couldn't imagine before that a brother and a sister could be such of good friends.I can see in Holden a friend of my which also has a lot of troubles with school and the system, only the way of ending up the story is spiteful different.Rinse de Kok"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had to write a book report for school on this book, so that follows, but lemme first say something. Books are a form of entertainment, just as TV and movies are. There have been a lot of movies that were very entertaining, yet extremely stupid. Most books, however, tend to be more focused on story and plot than on entertainment. However, anything without sufficient plot to go along with it's entertainment value, whether it be movies or books, is gonna suck. This book fits into that category. Forget the critics who blow smoke and say The Catcher in the Rye is wonderful just because they dont wanna feel stupid or be the black sheep who says it's awful, in a crowd of folks saying it's terrific - American Beauty movie critics were the same way - this book has little substance, and is just a lot of fluff. American Beauty was entertaining and &quot;different&quot; and new and uncliched - but really, it was about stupid people doing stupid things. The author tried to pass it off as something &quot;deep&quot; and that we should be in awe of, but it wasnt and it stunk, much like this book. Here's my high-school book review:\\"If you really want to hear about it...what my lousy childhood was like...and all that David Copperfield kind of crap...I don't feel like getting into it, if you want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff bores me.\\" J.D. Salinger sets the tone of this story right from the get-go. Salinger captures the life of a 1940's teenager, using brutal irreverence and raw emotions in an attempt to bring a sense of realism to an otherwise worthless story. I must admit, Salinger almost pulls it off. The story, essentially, is about three days in the life of a teenager who habitually screws up and get kicks kicked out of private school. I'm sorry if I'm not not enthusiastic, but (at the beginning) the storyline sounded lame and boring. But that's what is so odd about The Catcher in the Rye. It actually IS interesting.Holden Caulfield, our afore mentioned subject, is a jerk. He's self-centered, smart-mouthed, and completely dreadful to read about. But for some reason, I found myself liking him and almost rooting for him. He comes from a middle classed, joe-average family. He's confused, frustrated, and seemingly annoyed by every little thing in life. He hates \\"phonies\\" and he hates people who play mind games. He finds both the arrogant and the painfully insecure to be irritating. He mouths off to people he should respect, and he hurts people who don't let him have his way. Sadly, I can relate to him. I found myself thinking a lot of the same things Caulfield did. I even found myself nodding in agreement when he ranted about certain topics. I could even relate to Caulfield putting his foot in his mouth when he was with Sally. I think we're all a bit like Holden Caulfield in one way or another. I believe that simple fact is why this book has gotten such high acclaim. Caulfield is an average person with many faults and failures. He's not the super-strong hero or the smooth talking ulra-suave gentleman we see in the movies and read about in other books. There's no sappy romances or thrilling action scenes. There's not even an &quot;underdog surprises everyone and saves the day&quot; ending, either. Bottom line, there are relatively few cliches in this book, which is awesome and great, but still not enough to cover the fact that Salinger has no story here. Salinger provides us with a nice change of pace, but little else.Although this story was entertaining and very interesting, I was still unsatisfied. For starters, the amount of four-letter words used throughout this story annoyed me. It just seems so uncharacteristic for a person in the 1940s to be using that kind of language that often. And the idea of a sixteen year old getting a hooker also is a bit odd. But I think the thing that most annoyed me about The Catcher in the Rye is that it lacked any real substance. Overall, a story about a day in the life of an ungrateful, snot nosed teenager just does not cut it. I need more than that. Sure I can relate to Holden Caulfield as Salinger intends...but the question that BEGS to be answered is this: why should I care? Why should I care or root for someone who aspires to be a rebelling loser all his life?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book really spoke to me. I really felt like I was Holden Caulfield. He was a real person. All the stuff about fake people is so true. I felt like I was sitting there having a conversation with him. It made me want to runaway. I loved it!!!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Great book, perfect existential style. There's nothing like the wasteland Salinger creates for Holden and his readers. This book is barren and beautiful. A must read!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"In fact, I think kids should be forced to read it. This book portrays the negativity of community and how community is inclusive. Inclusiveness yields segregation and makes people think they have to have other people to survive and that they have to care what others think. He rejects this community, yet seeks it desparately throughout the novel. He is a sweet, sensitive kid--just like most kids this age. I have no idea why this book is forbidden. Society wants to make puppets of us all and I guess they do not want children to have brains of their own--or think that they can't think for themselves. It is beautiful. I am glad my teacher is cool and understanding enough to make me read it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye is one of the best books ever written. I believe that most people can relate to it in some form or another. If I had to recommend any book to someone this might be it. I believe that the character of Holden Caufield is amazing. I hope one day when I have children they will appreciate it like I did when I was their age."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"After reading this book, i never wanted to put it down again. I immediately read it over, and over and by now I must have read it 50 times but still love it jsut as much. Many people read this book and think that Holden is such a bad person, but i dont see him that way at all. I just think he needs someone to talk to, and some help to deal with the nightmares he faces in his every day life.

I love this book and I love Holden."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden re-inforced the ideals I have about society and helped me see people for what they are.

Lots of teenagers would easily relate to his trilas and tribulations, but I think the sense of the book would be lost to anyone who's past that phase in their life. I'm 21 and barely out of it and think Holden was a big phony. That's probably the reason why he was depressed so often."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I loved this book. It not only gave an in depth look at society and the stuggles of adolecnets, but a humoorous look and what it is like to be a young adult. I laughed out loud many times thoughtout the novel. I love Holden's hypocritical veiw of phonies. It shows a side of all of us we do not like to admit to. I think the government should devote time to more important things than denying people the joy of this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is by far my favorite book of all time. I was required to read it in my 11th grade english class . I happened to be 16 yrs. old,and just like Holden, I was going through a turning point in my life with parents and school. I felt as though Holden was the only one who could relate to what I was going through.

Some of the things that Holden does I wouldn't agree with like all the swearing and the drinking.

Salinger's colorful descriptions and use of language make you feel like you are 16 years old, wandering around New York City. It is littered with thoughts and ideas that teenagers have in todays day and age. But the hardest part to figure out is where is Holden Caufield when he is telling this story? A guy asked me that once in Washington Square Park, and I absolutly coulnd't remember, so I picked the book up and read it again. Salinger out did himself on this one."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The first 40 pages of this book are fine. Then, the dialogue becomes monotonous and boring. Holden says the same thing over and over again. It's always &quot;old Pheobe&quot; or something. Everything is &quot;old.&quot; He cusses when he doesn't need to."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caufield forms the bedrock of post-war American literature,just as Huckleberry Finn forms that of the 19th century.What is it about this teenager rebelling against middle class values, his curiosity and fear of sexuality?The adult world with all its phony Hollywoodized behaviour supping on the innocence of youth represented byHolden's young sister Phoebe and his deceased younger brother Allie.Both siblings are described by the adjective \`old'. Expelled from his prep school a few days before he's due to leave he runs away to hotels,bars, theatres and night clubs in New York.He gets together with a prostitute but can't go through with sex and though he pays for it he gets beaten up by her pimp.He gets himself blind drunk and sick,calls up Sally Hayes,an old girlfriend,asking her to go away with him to the countryside, which she refuses after spending time ice-skating with him.He also has an older brother D.B.who writes short stories and is now out in Hollywood,'prostituting' himself.The book is famous for coining hipster slang terms and idiomatic expressions,'raining like a bastard','goddam',\`lousy','and all','coming pretty close to doing it with a girl','that killed me'. What is most noticeable is the familiar tone of Holden talking to the reader like a friend.His rebellion's energy is curbed by thesentimentality aroused by Phoebe and he can't wait to see her again.In the end she wants to run away with him and he just can't let himself do that and he is drawn back home.Her essential \`niceness' is the hook.Holden seems to be repelled by many of the features of modern life.It's hard to imagine him growing up.A teacher who understands him and who he goes to when in trouble makes a homosexual pass at him when he stays at his house.The Catcher was Salinger's only novel although he wrote short stories.The enormous fame and wealth he gained made him a recluse,living like Holden mute in a country cabin.The novel is a remarkable performance,Holden's monologue which he seems to be retelling as a form of psychoanalysis,'all that David Copperfield kind of crap'.Unluckier than Huck Finn he has no territory he can light out for:his only escape is into illness.The one void in the novel is we know nothing of the parents and we get no counter voice to check his headlong impatient blindness.The author Salinger Is Holden Caulfield."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I bought this book on account of all the weird stuff that surrounds it. It's a good book too,I was glad when I got done reading though,that's the thing about a book,even if it's good,you're always glad when you're done reading it. I read it in about 3 days,I could have read it in about 2 days but my brother got married.That's the thing about brothers,they're always getting married right when you're reading a good book,it happens all the time. No kidding.Plus I had to watch my daughter too,you gotta watch babies pretty close,they're always trying to kill themselves, everything in the whole damn house has life threatening potential.A piece of cotton,a Lego,the t.v.,you name it and it can kill a baby before you're done blinking so if you want to read a book get someone to watch your baby so you can concentrate a little.The story is about an angry, over-sexed teenager who suffers from some kinda depression or something. he didn't kill anybody in the book but I bet he left that part out.I know it's a fictional book and all but he was a serial killer,you could tell,I swear you could.The whole book starts on Friday and ends on Monday I think? It's hard to keep up with what day it is sometimes. All this kid does is drink and hit on women and you start to think maybe he's gay but he likes girls too much to be gay. He's a virgin too,by the way,but he hates it I think. I bet he turned into some kind of Jack the Ripper before it was all over. You could tell that's where the story was going,you really could. But he ends up in some mental hospital at the begining and by the time the story ends you're just kind of depressed and all. But it's a good book and you should read it, just wait for your brother to get married first so you can get it over with."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Paperback: 288 pages* Publisher: Back Bay Books; Reissue edition (January 30, 2001)* Language: EnglishThe world that surrounds Holden Caulfield is full of excruciating disappointments, like the phonies who attend his prep school. And like the adults who teach there. Parents are often portrayed with all of their flaws, too, as Holden very diligently examines the world he sees and describes it for the reader in his first-person narrative.Almost from the opening paragraph, the reader can feel what Holden feels; see the world through his eyes; and begin to completely relate, even if the reader is an adult. When this sixteen-year-old shares his thoughts and feelings, we are reminded of our own adolescence. And while we may not have been prep school students living in New York, the feelings are universal.Not belonging. Doubting everyone around us. Questioning the realities we see.Holden has been expelled from still another school, and he has until the following Wednesday before his parents find out. He grabs the opportunity for freedom and leaves school early. On the streets of New York, his observations of life continue as he seeks out old friends who make him feel \\"not so depressed.\\" One by one, they manage to disappoint him in some way, however, until finally he reconnects with his younger sister. And with her, he shares his passion to be someone who protects and saves other children from the disasters of life. He envisions them running toward a cliff in a field of rye and he \\"catches\\" them.Sometimes I found Holden very depressing, but, of course, his feelings were coming through. His disillusionment was intense. I especially felt for him when the one adult he turns to near the end, a mentor and favorite teacher, does something he perceives as appalling, thus crushing still another idol in his mind.A glimmer of hope presents itself near the end as the rain falls in the park and everything seems cleansed. Like a new start.Beautiful and evocative,The Catcher in the Ryeis a timeless coming of age tale. Five stars."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm 29 and finally picked up Catcher in the Rye. I sort of read it in grade school, but at that age the story line didn't have much meaning to me, and I didn't understand what was going on.This book may be controversial for it's time but I really don't see the big deal now. Sure he says \\"Goddamn\\" a lot and there's a bit of sex talk going on, but that's about it. PG 13 at the most.Holden gets kicked out of high school and our story begins with him telling us his last days of school and returning home. The time frame of the book is only 2 or 3 days. Holden believes everyone is \\"phony\\" with the exception of a few people he actually likes.I enjoy this theme of finding ways to cope with the \\"phonies\\" of the world. I'm a big Kurt Vonnegut fan and this theme is often covered in his books. \\"and so it goes\\"Anyways, I don't know if I would consider this a classic, but it's a good book for sure."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The first book I ever read twice. I read it the first time around 20+ years ago when I was about twenty. It knocked me backwards. I didn't know they wrote books like this.

Holden is so able to bring out the best and worst reaction in you within the same sentence. Like driving past a disaster, you just have to see the worst and hope for the best. You want to shake him and hug him at the same time. And at times I had to stop reading because I was too worried about what might happen to him!The voice of Holden is rich with rye opinion and delivered in his whiny, endearing vernacular. Holden is cynical ~ but not the voice of a typical cynical teenager ~ he is damaged goods who wants a perfect world but sees only \\"phonies\\". He is such a touching malcontent."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I last read this when I was sixteen and imagined that reading it now, twenty years later, it would not have the impact it had back then. Not true. This still feels fresh and compelling. More moving than I remember it too.

I was immediately drawn to this deeply sensitive and intellectual complex teenager. I imagined that I would love to rescue this boy who had left his prep school for the big city.. He has the loneliness of Huckleberry Finn mixed with the fearless rebellion of one of S.E Hinton's many rebel characters (The Outsiders, Rumblefish..) The illustrative descriptions of both the main character's pain and joy kept me turning pages and forgetting how far into the book I had gotten. A must read classic for everyone :)"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"As an undergraduate in the '60s I could barely get through CATCHER. I didn't care about some crude spoiled preppy kid who couldn't get his act together. In a word, I was clueless.I reread the book last fall and discovered something profound, that Holden was suffering from PTSD stemming from the death of his brother and from witnessing the suicide of a schoolmate who bailed out of a dorm window wearing the sweater Holden had loaned him. I began noticing the symptoms Holden was exhibiting: depression, poor concentration, attention deficit, crying, uncontrollable rage, lack of motivation, self-isolation, sleeplessness, etc. I'm intimately familiar with these symptoms because my own PTSD diagnosis stemming from childhood trauma. I get Holden's struggle. I live with that same feeling that I need to save kids from danger. I had to watch boys get horrific beatings in the orphanage where I spent the last nine years of my childhood. It's this compulsion to protect children that drives my writing.To me CATCHER is less about teenaged coming-of-age angst and more about a kid struggling against the downward spiral of mental illness. Without professional help he was doomed to submerge and did, ending up in a \\"rest home.\\"Holden was barely \\"holdin' on.\\"A greater sense of Holden Caufield/JD Salinger can be found in the film FINDING FORESTER, which is purported to be based on Salinger. In a 1953 interview with a high-school newspaper, Salinger said that the novel was \\"sort of\\" autobiographical: \\"My boyhood was very much the same as that of the boy in the book ...it was a great relief telling people about it.\\"Salinger, when writing CATCHER wouldn't have had a clue about PTSD, as it wasn't even in the diagnostic manual (DSM) for psychologists until decades later. He was just writing what he felt, blasting his feelings onto paper and letting the chips fall.Many people see Salinger as a sort of literary genius because he sold 70 million copies of one book. I'm not saying he wasn't talented and educated; he had plenty of both going for him. I'm saying he leveraged his talent on top of some inner need to get this desperate crisis part of his life onto paper and kept going until it was done.A great segment of the literary world has, quite understandably, interpreted Holden's PTSD symptoms as mere teenage angst. This is a gross oversimplification. It's his masterfully presented array of extreme symptoms that's largely responsible for the success of the book. It's too complicated, or too sensitive, for English teachers to talk about mental illness; so they focus on the simple and more obvious interpretation. Such teachers are missing a phenomenal opportunity to reach kids who are in crisis or know someone who is.We'd have fewer cases of teenagers going postal if CATCHER were used to teach about mental illness.I keep a copy of CATCHER in my backpack, with passages underlined, marked up, flagged, asterisked, annotated and cross-referenced. Holden is me and I am Holden, from opposite ends of the economic spectrum.BIRDBOY-1: Prince (BIRDBOY: STORIES FROM AN AMERICAN ORPHANAGE)"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Let me begin by saying I love all kinds of books-- Harry Potter, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Huckleberry Finn, etc. I knew this was a classic, but I wasn't prepared for what a true work of art it was. This book appeals to all people, young and old. Whether you're 80 or 13, you will be able to connect with Holden and the phony world around him.I didn't really get into this book until the very first line of the third chapter. \\"I'm the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life. It's awful. If I'm on my way to the store to buy a magazine, even, and somebody asks me where I'm going, I'm liable to say I'm going to the opera. It's terrible.\\"To me, this isn't a book everyone can understand. It's more than a book about a no life messed up drop out. It isn't full of metaphors and similes. There wasn't a \\"Once upon a time\\", nor do I think there was a \\"Happily ever after.\\" You have to have some maturity, some creativity to understand this book. I think it doesn't matter what age you read this book. It's strange, at first I thought I was the only one who could relate to Holden. Not because I'm depressed. But because he speaks of life! He has a voice for us all. He may be insane and narrow minded, in a way, but he challenges what we'd so like to believe. He challenges the smallest things -- from saying \\"Good luck!\\" To much bigger things, like religion. To me, he is the Peter Pan who couldn't think of happy thoughts other than saving the innocent from the bitterness of reality. People complain there is no real plot. Is life plotted out? Does life always have a perfect beginning, a clear ending? No. To me, this book was a portrait we all see, but take different things out of. I will definitely remember this book for years to come."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book was awesome, plain and simple. This book really shows human beings at their weakest. The protagonist; a boy that's about 16 is kicked out of school and leaves early to live on the streets for a few days before going home, but during these few days he makes some really stupid decisions. The whole book revolves around teenager's insecurities; about himself, about life, about the way the world works and quite a bit about girls actually. J.D Salinger did something really terrific. He only had one character really. Holden is still trying to preserve his child like innocence while discovering the world of adulthood. You really get to know and appreciate Holden throughout the book because everyone goes through that time in life. So even though the plot is not complicated and it's most definitely not action packed, you get so much character development that it makes a pretty big impact because everyone can reflect on what happens to Holden and what he thinks about everything. This book was wonderfully written and brings Holden to life perfectly. I congratulate J.D. Salinger on writing one of the best achievements in American literature."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A Catcher in the Rye is a book about a late teen-aged boy named Holden Caufield. Holden is expelled from prep school for sub-par grades. Holden then spends the next three days in New York City by himself. While in the city, Holden gets a taste of the real world. He also formulates cynical opinions about society and finds himself needing a break from the constant melancholy the people around him create.Although J.D. Salinger published A Catcher in the Rye in 1951, kids today can identify with the main character. The diction used in the book is very similar to that which is used by today's adolescents. J.D. Salinger does an outstanding job creating the mood that Holden Caufield emanates. Holden exemplifies an extreme cynicism that much of today's youth possesses; however, this parallel to adolescents today makes it a great book for people between the ages of 13-17. By the end of the book many of life's lessons come through and leave the reader pondering about his or her own childhood and beliefs.I really enjoyed this book because of the unique way in which it was written. J.D. Salingers thoughts flow onto the paper so smoothly that it is almost as if he is speaking directly to the reader. I would definitely recommend this book to all youth that battle the perceived need to conform to society"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"For several years the connotation of a being a \\"classic\\" had kept me from reading J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. Not knowing specifically what it was about, I finally gave into curiosity when I read it for a literature class. I was instantly sorry I had waited so long to read this book. Holden Caulfield is a lazy, cynical teen in 1950s America and he has just left his third prepatory school to return home to his family in New York City. His parents are expecting him home on a Wednesday, yet it is Monday, so the events of the novel unfold over two days in the Big Apple.The theme that struck me the most was the one of trying to grow up too early. Holden is very much like this. He presents himself as a mature figure, smoking, drinking, hanging out in clubs, yet in his personal relationships with people, he acts quite immature. In one part of the story, Holden calls up a prostitute, wanting to become a man after all the stories he had heard about girls from his class mates at Pencey Prep, only to acquiesce to his lack of experience and asks if the prostitute would \\"like to talk\\".My main complaint of this novel is that it reads like a journal, giving only Holden's perspective on the events that occur. I believe it would have been an improvement if Salinger had given us a look into other character's minds so we could see their perspective. This is an especially important flaw because Holden, at his center, constantly wonders what others think of him.I would recommend this novel to teenagers, especially those who feel they do not fit into their particular environment. I know when I was younger I could definitely relate to Holden. I also find it a delicious irony that much like Holden, J.D. Salinger has spent the better part of a century in seclusion in his Northeast home."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book was pretty good. At first, I really liked the main character (and narrator) Holden Caulfield. But as the book progressed, I started to like him less and less. While he criticizes people for being \\"phony\\", he at times is very \\"phony\\". He also made me hate the word \\"phony\\". He gets pretty annoying, and he is pretty immature. I really don't feel that sorry for him at all. But don't get me wrong, the book does make you want to keep reading and reading, but in the end, I felt that the book really was like, nothing. Sure it was very different when it first came out, and people all ran to get it, but it wasn't the best book I have read. I can name many books that are far better than this. I got mad at Holden a lot. There is nothing wrong with being a pessimist, but he just hates everything. His sister even asks him at one point in the book if there is even anything that he likes. It's stupid, also, that he keeps flunking out of school. The book is interesting and is worth a read, but it really isn't that great. It starts off kinda low, then gets better and even really good at one point, but then it just goes downhill and I really didn't like it in the end. Read it, though, and make your own conclusions. As Mark Twain once said \\"A classic is something that everybody wants to have read and nobody wants to read.\\" This may be a classic, and I am glad I read it, but I really don't want to read it again. Umm, Enjoy! (?)"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye is believed to be one of the most honest and stunning books of the 20th century. The journey of Holden Caulfield through his departure of prep school and the events that follow, is one that teenagers and young adults have been able to identify with since the books publication. Holden represents the journey of wanting to change the future, but not knowing what the future should bring, a question that lingers in the mind of most who are Holden's age. Basically, the story follows our main character through one of the most defining times of his life up to this point. He describes his dislike of the school that he has been attending, the disinterest he takes in his classmates, and the general alienation he feels from those around him. Realizing that his presence there is utterly pointless both to those around him and to himself, he leaves the school for New York City. Though the story is clear, much of it is spent looking back upon Caulfield's life, the various mistakes he has felt he made, and the memories that are brought up by mere conversations. What is so remarkable about Catcher in the Rye, is that the main character not only shows what many see in themselves, but his journey is one that is both plausible and almost eerie in the readers ability to relate. Most certainly a book that will stay with me my entire life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is quite good and i simply loved it.

He's no loser, but he's not the life of the party either. The book follows his search to find his place in life. As boring as it sounds, he has all the awkward moments you've ever encountered as an angst ridden teen (remember high school?).The overwhelming angst isnt quite as annoying as it is inspiring. He's going through everthing you had to deal with when you were that age. We're not all that different and it's ok to feel all the stupid things you feel.If you want to read a more grown up version of this genre, take a look at Jack Kerouac's \\"On the Road\\". Also highly recommended."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Reading The Catcher In Rye is like looking into the soul of each and every one of our lives at one point in time. J.D. Salinger was able to capture the poignancy of a teen's life in its purest form. The main character, Holden Caulfield, was facing expulsion of yet another boarding school, which he attended in Pennsylvania. With a bad attitude that plagues most sixteen year olds, Holden must try to come to terms with the loss of his younger brothers death. Not knowing what to do next, Holden's journey leads him to New York City where he would be as inconspicuous as a leaf falling in the autumn night.Just as Holden had done, each and every one of us wants to grow up all too quickly. However, we tend to miss out on what growing up is all about. Innocence. The author depicts this when Holden is trying to persuade a local bar keep to serve him alcoholic beverages. Although the book was written over fifty years ago, many teens can still relate to Holden's trials and tribulations. J.D. Salinger used a style of writing that is easy to comprehend.The Catcher In The Rye is a highly recommended book, which will question ones adolescent life through the eyes of another. Despite the fact that the author gives an overall feeling of cynicism toward the world, one must not delve into the mind of Holden. If one inadvertently does so, then the world becomes a dim one."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Underneath all his ranting and complaining, Holden reveals what society is today.

He is pretty much a trouble maker. The story starts off with him telling you who is family is and he's telling you about them. Next, he tells you that he goes to a private school in northern Pennsylvania which is called Pency High. When Holden is at Pency, he visits his old professor that he had at some other school he droped out of. His name was Mr. Spencer. I think Mr. Spencer gives Holden a lot of advice for the near future. He has a roomate in one of the dorms that he hates. I have no clue why he hates him because his roomate acts like a real nice guy. His roomates name is Ackley. Finally Holden tells you that he is tired of school so he drops out of Pency High. After he drops out, he moves to upstate New York by himself and he stays in New York for a while. When he goes to New York, he visits his sister Phoebe where she tells him that they miss him and they want him to come home.

The internal wanderings expressed to the reader directly from the narrator(Holden Caufield) coupled with the external adventures and many interactions with other characters show the reader a lonely boy's search to define his place in a world he neither trusts, due to the death of his brother nor feels connected with, because of the estrangement of his parents (who didn't feel that at his age?).The book becomes a wonderful vehicle for non-nostalgic teenage memories and provides relief for all those that have come through those nasty teenage years alive to find a world we can accept and be happy in.May the poetry of childhood come to light in darker days and dispel those destructive negative and bitter tendencies."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Listen - its a very light book. Its not the best book I have ever read, and it doesnt come close to it either. I got this book from a friend who guarenteed me that this book was the one ... - the one which would change my life. It was a nice book and all, but it just wasn't that. I suppose it comes down to the individual.If you want to read the book, read it. Its a book complaining a lot I believe, complains a lot about life - and the people which make it up. I got a little frustrated at times, I wanted to jump into the page and really speak to this guy.. who the hell does he think he is? But I suppose thats a good thing. It makes our minds more open and aware of the fact that there are different people on earth.The story line is simple - a boy who struggles at school, and who plans to run away from home, and doesn't. Thats it. But its the way its told that makes it different than any other book Ive read. A light read, but in short, a book that tells you something in a unique way. A boy who is very unsettled, and has a strict dislike for life. The exact opposite of me."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A play can have brilliant actors, brilliant sets and a brilliant director, but if the script is no good the play isn't worth a [darn].It's much the same with Catcher In The Rye. One can posit all this book's themes as brilliant: The story of a boy beaten down by society, draining away in its downward spiral. The purity/innocnece/cutting genius of youth. Emptiness, running on a hampster wheel with nowhere to go. Wandering, lost in society's black hole. The death of being bourgeois. Society's turning of a boy with potential into a hopeless boy, searching for meaning in a world with none. The hypocrisy of labeling everyone a fake while being a massive fake oneself.These are all great themes, but the bottom line is this: they're worth nothing if not presented properly, and Catcher is just not a good book. It packages all the above themes poorly; one feels as if one is running on that same hampster wheel as Holden with each sucessive page turn. Some might say that's part of the book's genius -it makes one feel exactly as its main character feels- but feeling that a book is pointless as one reads it just doens't inspire one to continue. Ultimately, this book does not deliver."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am only half way through this book and I already know I am going to love it.

This young boy had to face all these obstacles on his way to becoming a young man, his problems were adult problems of some sort. Also, he had a lot of phsycological problems, that he managed to hide from a lot of close people really well. Im not going to recommend this book to everyone, but i will say that this is a book for anyone who 1. likes classics 2. has a lot of problems on their mind 3. likes the kinds of books that talk about life. 4. is a phsycologist 5. just wants a good read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Somehow I dodged the &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; bullet in high school, and only later learned to appreciate it's depth and resounding beauty.

I am 15, turning 16 soon and have NONE of the feelings that Holden does, except a profound love for golf. I have never desired to drink, get a whore or anything. Holden is a character that represents a bout .01% of this population, much like the Kids who attacked Columbine. It was just something about them.My suggestion to anyone looking for a book to readis this: stay away from catcher in the rye."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I don't know, maybe it's just me, maybe I missed something, but I thought this was the most pointless, boring, and redundant book I ever read. There was no climax; there was no meaning. The supposed &quot;conflict&quot; was non-existent. Just heed my advice: Don't read the book. Heck, even if you do, I'm sure you'll throw it out after the first 10 pages."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book wansn't that bad. the story couldn't have been better. I was described as if Holden was talking to you. I think J. D. Salinger is a great author."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is the worst book I have read in a long time. It's full of complaints and Holden doing stupid things. Reading it a waste of time. It will put you in a nasty mood and make you feel like there's less to life than you originally thought. It was reccommended to me by a teacher and I was ready to slap her when I finished the book. I can't find justification for it being called a classic."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The first thing you'll probably want me to say is how great 'The Catcher in the Rye' is, and how it changed my life, and all that existential angst crap - but I don't feel like saying that, if you want to know the truth. It's just a book, for chrissakes, about some lousy goddamn kid who goes to New York for a few days. If there's one thing I hate, it's phoney books. Don't even mention that Holden Caulfield guy to me. So he's a bit screwed up and all. So what? And don't start talking about the human condition, either - I'm touchy as hell about that. We've all gone through that madman stuff; I don't need some goddamn crazy author telling me how it feels. I know how itfeels. I swear to God, if I ever saw that JD.Salinger I'd go right up to him and tell him what a corny book he's written. I'd really get a bang out of that. You know, I'm the most terrific liar you ever saw. If I read a great book and somebody asks me if I liked it, I'm liable to say I hated it. It's awful. 'Catcher in the Rye' - a masterpiece of American vernacular and all."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am sorry if I offend anybody by my review of this book, but I think it was soooooo stupid! I am a pretty big reader of books and this one just made me mad because it never got anywhere and just rambled on about nothing. I could've written a better book than this and I am only 16 years old! I am mad I wasted my time reading this book and I am upset with Salingers writing of this book, he could've donw a lot better! AMEN!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"THIS BOOK WAS HORRIBLE. I AM IN HIGH SCHOOL AND WE HAD TO READ IT IN ONE OF MY ENGLISH CLASSES. WE WERE TOLD THAT PEOPLE WANTED TO BAN IT AND I TOTALLY AGREE. HOLDEN WAS JUST THIS LOW DOWN DEPRESSED PERSON THAT ALWAYS FELT SORRY FOR HIMSELF. PLUS THIS BOOK HAD TOO MUCH BAD LANGUAGE AND SEXUAL CONTENT IN IT. I'M NOT THE TYPE OF TEENAGER EVERYONE THINKS ABOUT. I DON'T SWEAR,DO DRUGS OR SLEEP AROUND. BUT WHEN I READ THIS BOOK, I FELT LIKE SWEARING BECAUSE THE WORDS WERE CARVED INTO MY MEMORY. AND THEN WE HAD TO WRITE A PAPER ON IT USING WORDS HOLDEN USED. I DIDN'T USE ANY SWEAR WORDS AND GOT A BAD GRADE ON IT. THIS BOOK REALLY MADE ME MAD. I WOULDN'T HAVE READ IT BUT I HAD TO FOR SCHOOL. DO NOT READ IT!!!!!!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'd give it no stars, but that's not an option. For me, the book was simply about a whiny teenage brat. I'm a teen, and maybe I'm just weird, but it was one of the worst books I've ever read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Didnt really enjoy it at all, I am a hard core book reader and I din not enjoy this ine at all!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I thought the book was going to be a good read. WEll the book was ok at the begining. As it got further, no plot developed. Reading what Holden was saying got real frustrating because he kepts saying the same things over and over. Like the words. PHONY.. and he used the word &quot;REALLY&quot; 1,000,000 times too many. &quot;I told you I am crazy. I really am.&quot; that line is in the book about 500 times. And aren't authors suppose to stay on the subject? I found my self skipping over pages at a time, while holden tried to explain something in the past.. Very boring. I wouldn't recomend reading this garbage. Yea its a classic but who the hell cares it SUCKED! I will take your comments via e-mail @ pm44815@navix.net"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye was an enjoyable and worthwhile read, but everyone's enormous praise for this book made it a huge letdown. It's very preachy and the points it makes are misplaced.Holden, the main character, is extremely cynical, sometimes understandable, sometimes not, and is yellow.With all of the people who have fallen in love with this book over the years, it makes me wonder if there is something wrong with them, or something wrong with me."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Unfortunately, I had to read this book for school as an assignment, and of course, I had do those review questions for tests and so forth. Well, I have to be honest, I don't like this book. I mean, I think the plot is powerful and the point of view is, but it's not only confusing, but it gets on your nerves. Holden Caufeild is the most irritating character I've ever read in a book! Every word he says is like hearing nails being scratched against a blackboard. If I knew this guy, I would say to him, &quot;Look, if you want to see a real phoney, look in the mirror and you'll see him!&quot;"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Salinger's cult novel, ridiculously easy to read, is generally liked by those who sympathise or identify with Holden's plight. But how seriously should one take his existential angst, and what are the implications of his outlook?Holden displays a sort of 'hyperconsciousness' where preoccupations of his intellect negate his attempts to enjoy everyday occurrences. It is difficult ro recall in the book anywhere where Holden feels real humour, joy or love without qualification and introspection. The critic Philip Roth considers the book upholds a sort of elitist ethos, based not on actual status or achievement, but on dreams of the individual as somehow special or chosen ,created, maintained and protected by the haughty, solitary personality.Whether this type really does possess the truth, and if society (however one chooses to define it) is as guilty and phoney as Holden suggest, the reader must decide. How society would need to be reconstructed, and what difference it would imply is never touched upon; but then this style of criticism is, by and large, wholly negative.The book, widely praised for it's structural originality, should be seen in the light of a literary tradition, that Salinger was quite aware of.I hope I have not sounded too critical of this work. My target is more the misleading, partial critique, widely reproduced in other reviews on this page. Salinger is famously reticent for commentary on both his craft and his intentions. I feel this book is as much a loving lament, than an endorsement, of this sad, solitary character Holden Caulfield.For the finest literary examination of many of these issues, read Dostoyevsky's 'Notes From Underground', and 'Crime and Punishment', novels which stand head and shoulders above 'Catcher', but are equally as gripping and easy to read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Nothing really happens...the beginning of the book is very interesting, the way it is written attracts you to read more and more and you are really looking forward to what would happen next. One third into the book, it hits you that nothing is changing, it is basically not going anywhere, and the situation keeps on repeating itself. The interesting personalities disappear, and it turns to be just a normal story not really headed to any conclusion...The last third is just continuing the New York adventure, just in detail how the night develops, and wondering would this night ever ends...Anyway, some situations could be funny reading the book in the right mood, but if you have time to read, I would seriously re-consider."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'll be the first to confess to a cultural Achilles' heel that runs up my back, over my skull and down to the unlovely bags under my eyes. As such, I am frequently at a loss to understand what the fuss is about. And it is perhaps for this reason that I still remain perplexed, nay flummoxed, by the cult status of this book and that of its repulsive protagonist, Holden Caulfield.When I first endured this merciless literary thumbscrew, it was in the late 1970s, at the behest of a high school English teacher who wore clogs, wooden jewelry and ambulatory tents made of faded denim. She believed with almost anguished sincerity that her students would \\"connect\\" with Holden, or find something \\"relevant\\" in the book. I quickly came to a conclusion that a recent re-reading has done nothing to dispel: Holden is a jackass. He's a spoiled prep school jerk who's so sickeningly self-involved that he has no clue that the people around him exist as anything other than background figures in the melodrama going on entirely in his own skull. He constantly refers to anything that doesn't meet with his schoolboy approval as \\"corny\\" and labors under the delusion that he's the first person who ever noticed that the transition out of childhood is awkward and uncomfortable, or that it's just no picnic facing grief and loss. Listen, you pustular little spud, we all go through it, and it's about as cosmically significant as a crumpled wad of used Kleenex. Maybe half a century ago, this hog wallow of teen angst was something fresh. But if Salinger had some larger point to make about coming of age it has all but disappeared in the fetishization of adolescence that took off not too long afterward, and has clung to our culture ever since. And the excruciating way that Holden speaks-the kid sounds like his lines were written by some Monogram Pictures hack who specialized in gangster dialogue for Bowery Boys movies. All that's missing from Holden's self-consciously brittle patois is some edgy patter about the agony of acne or the distressing appearance of pubic hair. (\\"One crummy day these goddam phony red spots started sprouting all over my mug. Next day it was some corny cork-screwy hairs poppin' outta my BVDs. . . .\\") On the plus side, this book did make me feel embarrassed to admit that I was 16, but I was one of only two people in the class who felt that way. The other one is in prison today. He strangled an impossibly precocious brat named Allie.The book does, however offer one appealing if thinly drawn character. This is Edgar Marsalla, the hero who blew an audible fart in the chapel. I can't help feeling that he was expressing his opinion of his grating classmate, and got along much better in life than Holden ever did."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Allow me to begin by saying I'm an avid reader. I've read everything from classics to pulp fiction, and I favor the former more than the latter. However, I struggled to make it through this book. The protagonist is a whiny brat who I have tried to sympathize with, but found myself wishing I could beat into the floor instead. I read this book once when I was 15 and once more when I was 23. Both times I found myself wondering why I was subjecting my mind to this exercise in tedious self-indulgence.The most painful part of this book for me was the writing. I'm not keen on the stream-of-consciousness writing style. I feel that's something that should be reserved to journal writing and not a work of literature. It has no beginning, no end and no real climax. This book is an onerous trudge through a brief period in time in one vapid teenage-boy's life. How this book became a classic is beyond me. I feel if this book must be considered a classic, then we must look to the entirety of Twitter, Facebook, and whatever other blog sites have you for our future literature list. After all, this book reads like an over-long Facebook post by a moody teenager.I tried to give this book another chance, I really did. If you enjoy structured novels or you're looking for an upbeat read, this book is not for you. If you must read a depressing book, go read Crime and Punishment. I wasn't terribly excited by that book either, but at least the writing was tolerable..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Why is this rambling mess with no story whatsoever considered a classic? As I kept reading this steaming pile of garbage, I kept expecting it to go somewhere. It went nowhere. Absoltuely nowhere. It involved characters that I could have cared less about and nobody was doing anything remotely interesting. It was almost like reading somebody's journal, a bunch of pointless entries. Somehow, this thing became a classic and I think everyone has jumped on the bandwagon and agrees that it is one just so that they can say that they have read a classic. If a mess like this can get published, there is hope for aspiring writers everywhere."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have been studying this book in my English class this half term, and my teacher gave the book great praise. However, I was thoroughly disappointed with the book, struggled to read it and have still not finished it, even though I normally read ahead in class and am a avid reader. Holden Caulfield is a depressing character. I and my classmates have comnpared this novel with \\"Jacqueline Wilson\\" books (also disappinting novels). I have personally compared Holden Caulfield with a character from a reality television series. He is one of those irratating people that does not go away. This book, although perhaps skillfully written, is, in my eyes, a load of rubbish. It is boring, has no real plot and I really do not see why it is/has been on the banned books list. there really is no stunningly outrageous content. The \\"bad\\" words used I knew as an eight year old (as did the rest of my generation), no one I know is likely to follow Holden's example, because, to be quite frank, his situation is one we are unlikely to ever find ourselves in, and if we did, we would each cope with it in our own personal way.Apologies to those who believe this book is absolutely amazing - I and pretty much all my class were disappointed and found it incessively boring."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"If you're fascinated by the ruminations of some whiny rich kid who thinks the world owes him a living as he ponders Central Park ducks and goes whore-chasing, then maybe you might like this book. No wonder Salinger has kept hidden from the public so long"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye is an extraordinary example of timeless literature, and though many would call the book pointless (rather than realistic) and refer to Holden as hypocritical (and not a teenager) I still find this book identifies with me as strongly as anyone from any other era, due to the realist/pessimistic views it displays from the teenage vantage point, rather than playing off the &quot;best-years-of-your-life&quot; clich&eacute;.There's far to much to place here about the book, the author, and the message, and I feel obligated to urge anyone who reads this to pick up everything Salinger you can get your hands on, because he is truly an amazing author, and has such a way with words that even in his latter writing years, you can still identify with him as if he were a friend writing from the room next to yours. Catcher is his only published novels, but his reprinted short stories (Franny and Zooey, Nine Stories, &amp; Raise High the Roofbeam, Carpenters) are also gems. If you can find them, the 22 unpublished shorts are also great.There's really nothing a review can say that will show what you will learn and discover from this novel, and to attempt this would be pointless. Like Holden, I guess, we are all a little hypocritical."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It might be that Salinger invented adolescence. Previous to this American standard or classic, whichever you choose, we were a less adolescent-obsessed and preoccupied society. That maligned condition has since expanded by many years- starts around 11 and ends around 32.Give or take.The book transforms kids from book bored to book possible. I have never come across, in 30 years of work with kids, one young person, in any culture, of either gender, who having read the book, (implying they could,) did not love it. They claim it, and feel as though it were a personal match, \\"that's how I feeel!\\" They are still, of course, in a state of complete selfcenteredness. They join it in symbolic affiliation.No matter how desperately close, the imitators have gotten, there just is no other book that generates this kind of response. It is a one shot deal, but often sufficiently positive to further attempts with the literary life.ONLY IN AMERICA, could a Holden Caulfield come along and capture generation after generation. Just as Huckleberry Finn did before him, they work our forms out a little more, sculpt us a little bit firmly."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This has been one of my favorites. Every time I return to it, I always seem to find something more in it. Structurally, it is challenging. Although the vocabulary is simple, the repetition of symbolic imagery makes this a complex read on one level. Holden's fascination with ducks, museums, and even bathrooms is intriguing. But on a personal level, Holden gives voice to all the things that we once thought but found too dificult to face square on. For example, what happens to our loved ones when they die? What is the meaning of life or the point to living? I think part of his answer is that the connections we have with those whom we love, although temporary, is what keeps us motivated to live. We want to see and be with those who mean the most to us. We want to see them happy and their happiness is what makes us happy. It took Holden a long time to figure this out. He contemplates suicide, escape, and even undergoes a mental breakdown. But the ending to me is positive in the sense that he foregoes his unrealistic desire for an ideal world, one without evil, and accepts the bad in order to enjoy the good this world offers. This book inspires those who think life is meaningless and offers them something to value in a world that sometimes seems to lack any value."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in The Rye is about a young adolescent male named Holden Caulfield who loses his grip of reality. The theme of catcher in the rye is Holden wanting to be a catcher of children to save them from growing up to adulthood. He has not been able to make the transition himself. This is shown by his constant finding fault with everything (the phonies) but he then justifies the phonies to make them acceptable to fit into his life. He is constantly disappointed with people and things which creates a state of anger and frustration. For him things and people are either totally right or totally wrong. He can't find the balance of reality. Holden begins the story as a young man who is dealing with just being kicked out of Prep School. He is trying to deal with the reaction to how he feels how his parents are going to react and of the perception of others on him as well. His encounters with Mr. Spencer, Ackley and his roommate Stradlater present Holden finding fault with everything (the phonies) . Nothing is good enough for him. His ramblings on throughout the book is a dialogue to the reader (or therapist) demonstrating his inability to organize his thoughts in a logical and reality base. Just as he finds distaste for many things and people, he in turn justifies the events or people as to make them not so bad. His self-deception creates a false perception thus producing his distorted view of his reality. Holden leaves the stability of the prep school to go to New York City for many experiences that would be more typical for an adult than what a young boy of his age would normally experience. He sees himself as an adult capable of drinking, having sex and just being self-sufficient. He also thinks of himself as being better than others as in his relationship to his experiences with the nuns. He wants to experience the luxuries of adulthood but not the responsibilities. In the latter part of the novel, Holden is sick physically, because of lack of sleep and proper nutrition, as well as, mentally sick. His thought constantly returned to his sister and his perception of protecting her. He doesn't want to have things change as in his reaction to the items in the museum. They stay the same. The scene where Phoebe is on the merry go round Holden finally stops assigning absolute values to things and finally breaks emotionally. He cries releasing his tears of delirium The book Catcher in the Rye has many themes and underlying ideas but one basis of confusion. Holden sees adulthood as a cliff to fall off, instead of a mountain to climb. His pessimistic perception of the world is what really does him in. He is his own worst enemy. If Holden could only realize it is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose...this is not a failure, just life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"On July 16, 2001, Holden Caulfield--arguably the most talked-about youth in literature (get in line, Huck Finn and Harry Potter!)--turned 50. That same day, my own mother turned [ edited for delicacy's sake ]. So, Holden and Mom share the same birthday. That just kills me, if you want to know the truth. Anyway, I don't think they're related. But if they are...well, that would explain a few things about my character.And let me take a moment to explain something about my character. You probably don't give a good goddam about my character. I'm just a micro-blip on the computer screen of your life, and that's fine, it really is, but I think, and please correct me if I'm wrong, I think I speak for a lot of people when I say I never read The Catcher in the Rye. Not until July 16 in the Year of Our Lord Two-Thousand-and-One, that is. On the occasion of Holden Caulfield celebrating a half-century of shelf-life, I finally introduced myself.That's right, ladies and germs, if my literary life had been a tabloid headline, it would have screamed:I WAS A 38-YEAR-OLD CATCHER VIRGIN!\\"I don't know how it happened really. One day, I was fifteen and reading everything I could get my hands on--John Updike, Saul Bellow, Erich Segal--page after page, book after book. Complete and utter lack of self-control. I was [sob] a library slut. And then, I turned around, and I was grown up--a saggy past-his-prime man who'd never read J.D. Salinger.\\"I always wondered what the fuss was all about. What was in this book--that paperback edition I'd seen so often with the orangey-red cover and simple yellow-lettered title--what was it, exactly, that I was missing? And how had I let so many opportunities to read it pass me by? I consoled myself with the fact that I personally knew some highly-educated people--good, honest people with sheepskin degrees on their walls--who had never ever read Moby Dick (the losers!).It's not like I grew up in a close-minded community (don't let the fact that I'm from Wyoming fool you). No, I could have put my sweaty-slick teenage hands on Catcher at any point during my Acne Years. Certainly my 10th-grade teacher--the balding, beak-nosed man from Alabama--the same one who had an unpublished novel called \\"The Scatological Implications of Brick-Laying\\" sitting at home in his top desk drawer--that teacher of mine was progressive enough to have assigned the book to our class. But he didn't. Which is curious. He is, after all, the one who encouraged me to read Updike's Rabbit, Run, which is sort of like Holden Caulfield, the Later Years if you want to know the truth.No, the truth is, I have no one to blame but myself.But whatever the reason for my virginity, I feel I have to be openly honest with you, the anonymous you floating out there in cyberspace. Just so you see all my cards on the table here in front of us. I come to you with no extra baggage, no wild-eyed, drool-lipped ravings of \\"I've read Catcher twenty-eight times, forward and back, upside and down, and I can recite any passage to you at the drop of a hat--go on, pick a page, any page.\\"No, no, none of that life-long fanboy stuff from me.I won't sit here and tell you J.D. Salinger first introduced the world to Holden Caulfield in two short stories, \\"I'm Crazy\\" and \\"Slight Rebellion off Madison,\\" which were published in periodicals during the 1940s. You probably already know that.And I won't bore you with the fact that Time magazine called The Catcher in the Rye a \\"tough-tender first novel\\" or that The New York Times loved Holden's narration, calling it his \\"own strange, wonderful language.\\" Or that the book, beyond anyone's expectation, rocketed up the bestseller list and stayed there for seven months. Or that the title comes from a Robert Burns poem (\\"if a body meet a body coming through the rye,\\" though Holden thinks it's \\"catch,\\" not \\"meet\\"). You probably know that, too.Nor will I ramble on and on about the censorship--how Australian customs officers impounded a shipment of the book in 1957; or how, a year later, Catcher in the Rye was displayed on a \\"Smutmobile\\" parked in protest outside the state capitol in Oklahoma City; or how it was banned in school districts throughout the 1960s and 1970s and how, as recently as 1992, school libraries in Iowa and Florida took it off the shelves due to its cursing and \\"lurid passages about sex;\\" or how Salinger one day in 1953 just up and retreated to Cornish, New Hampshire and, as Amazon.com states, \\"hasn't published a syllable since 1965\\" or how the novel had its darkest hour in 1980: on the evening when Mark David Chapman fired five bullets into John Lennon, then pulled Catcher of his coat pocket and sat down to read. You know all that.No, I'm simply going to tell you how I, a slump-shouldered man of nearly four decades, approached the book with the quivering pink tenderness of a first-time reader of 15. No prejudice. Very little preconceived notions. And a Moby Dick-sized anticipation.Now, I crack open my 1951 hardbound edition (no dustjacket, plain black board cover, arthritically-cracking spine, deckle-edged pages, faintly yellowed, sniff the pages and they smell like fifty years of back shelves in bookstores).Now, I read.Now, I finish, look up at you and say (voice fluttery at the edges): \\"It's goddam good.\\"Reading Catcher in the Rye--especially the first time--is like sitting astride a galloping horse. You bounce and jounce, you make that funny uhn-uhn-uhn sound, you lose your breath then catch it again. In the end, all you can do is grab tight those deckle-edged pages and hold on for the 277-page-ride.Here, for instance, is how Salinger bursts out of the starting gate:If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them. They're quite touchy about anything like that, especially my father. They're nice and all--I'm not saying that--but they're also touchy as hell. Besides, I'm not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or anything.That's jet-propulsion writing if I've ever seen it. As they say in the movies, \\"He had me at lousy childhood.\\" I was hooked like the trout that swallowed the caddis fly. But that's the thing about Salinger, see. One sentence moves you to the next and the next and there is rarely a time when you want to stop, look up, then decide to put the book down and go do household chores. The laundry can burn and the dinner can go unfolded as far as I'm concerned.Holden's is a simple voice, a voice full of angst and self-pity and frustration and depression. And yeah, profanity. That stuff kills me. Not to get on a soapbox or anything, but Holden Caulfield swears because, as John Lee Hooker said, \\"it's in him and it's got to come out.\\" His profanity is not there for shock effect; it's an expression of his rage against the system--the mindless, do-as-they're-told masses. Those slump-shouldered gobs of humanity (like you and me) tend to get all squirmish around Holden and his fierce independent spirit. Four-letter words are both his sword and shield against their conformity--Holden uses \\"goddam\\" to slash and protect.So maybe you're out there in cyberspace, mouth-breathing all over your monitor, and you're wondering what exactly I'm talking about because you, like the former me, are a Catcher virgin. It's okay. Nothing to be afraid of. Stay calm and everything will be all right. We'll get through this, you and I.The first thing you need to know about the book's plot is this: nothing happens...and yet everything happens. It's that simple. Salinger takes us on a journey through 48 hours of one boy's life as he gets kicked out of Pencey Preparatory School (\\"molding boys into splendid, clear-thinking young men\\"). He's flunking every class but English. This is just before Christmas, so you can just imagine what this must do to his peace-on-earth-goodwill-to-men spirit. He decides to ditch the last couple days of school and heads for home where he hopes to say good-bye to his much-loved younger sister Phoebe before he heads out West where it's pretty and sunny and nobody'd know him and he could pretend to be a deaf-mute.That's it. That's the \\"action.\\" Over the course of those 48 hours, the sixteen-year-old Holden fights, smokes, drinks, hires a prostitute (unconsummated) and writes an English composition about a baseball glove.Through it all, there's his voice. Oh, what a voice. Salinger builds the book based on the cadences of language. Every \\"anyway,\\" every \\"boy,\\" is carefully calculated according to the Principle Law of Staccato and Repetition. Holden is a drumbeat on our ears. pocketa-pocketa-pocketaHolden reminds us of every anguished teen we've ever seen. James Dean. Go Ask Alice. The Breakfast Club. Young Elvis. Ponyboy and the Outsiders. Those snap-fingered kids from West Side Story. Maybe--no, probably--Holden reminds us of the slightly-confused person who used to stare back at us from the mirror years ago. Holden's just trying to find his place in the world. Aren't we all? Isn't there just a little bit of Caulfield in each of our spleens even now?\\"Did you ever get fed up?\\" Holden asks a girl he's taken out on a date. \\"I mean, did you ever get scared that everything was going to go lousy unless you did something?\\"The funny thing is--or the sad thing, if you want the truth--Holden, for all his talk and bravado, never does strike out West, but ends up taking his sister Phoebe to the park where he watches her ride the carousel--a ride that goes around and around but never gets anywhere. But yet there's always the promise of the prize.The thing with kids is, if they want to grab for the gold ring, you have to let them do it, and not say anything. If they fall off, they fall off, but it's bad if you say anything to them.And so, on the one hand at least Holden is a bit more self-aware by page 275. On the other, he's not the most perfect of travel guides through the razor edge of life. His reliability is called into question early in the book. Chapter Three begins:I'm the most terrible liar you ever saw in your life. It's awful. If I'm on my way to the store to buy a magazine, even, and somebody asks me where I'm going, I'm liable to say I'm going to the opera. It's terrible.But we stick with him anyway (if nothing else, to find out what is real and what is conjured from the thicket of his mind). It's impossible to resist the pull of his voice. He is the moon, we are the tide.So, now you've come this far with me. I hope you're not expecting a goddam medal or anything. If you're anything like me, you're drippy with sweat and you have to pee really badly. Well, tie a knot in it Junior, 'cause I've got just a little more to say to you. Yeah, you, the mouth-breather who's leaning too close to the computer monitor. (That kills me. It really does.)Listen, I can't say this any other way: If you read only one book this year, read The Catcher in the Rye. If you were lucky enough to have someone force it down your pink quivering throat back in the Acne Years, fine. Fine and jim-dandy. But if it's been years (decades, even) since you sat down with your tatter-covered, dog-eared copy, well then you know what you need to do.And if you're one of those poor schmucks who's managed to make it this far in life without your eyeballs rolling across Salinger's pocketa-pocketa prose...Well then,it's about time.Oh, and Happy Birthday, Holden, you old so-and-so."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I think that part of the reason people can hate this book so much is because they began with a preconceived notion of what it was already about. I read it with barely any knowledge on it - I knew it was a famous classic, but I didn't know anything as to its plot or characters or adolescent cynicism, and it turned out to be one of the best books I've ever read.Not because I felt like Holden Caulfied was a great guy or my friend, I probably couldn't stand him as a friend. He's a jerk and as moronic as he states he is. Nor because of the plot - it's not that it lacks one, but that the plot can't proceed because Caulfield is too paralyzed emotionally and mentally to push forward. He just gives up all together.It's great because it gives you a chance to see the world through in a different way. It's that, if you ever wanted to know what life would be like if you just gave up, this book gives you a chance to explore that world in great depth, in the most extreme way, as opposed to the idiotic-American-Pie, mushy-teen-coming-of-age-romance way. And there is a sort-of plot, and there is some heart to it, especially in the scenes where Holden's with his little sister. It's almost adorable."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is about an adolescent growing up into an adult, about 17 years old, trying to escape a world of \\"phony\\" people and rescuing young innocent lives, like his sister, from entering it. The book is a story of Holden Caulfield telling his life of a three-day adventure he had. He had recently been kicked out of his third prep school, Pencey because he was flunking every single class except English. Scared to face his parents, Holden decides to leave early from Pencey Prep and travel downtown, New York. On the way, he runs into many different people such as taxi drivers, three girls from Seattle, a prostitute, two nuns, his little sister Phoebe, and a former teacher. Holden gets sick of the friends around him at Pencey prep thinking that they are &quot;phony&quot;; leaving for New York only showed Holden that the entire world is &quot;phony&quot; also. As he tells his story, he gets into trouble and tries to find out who he is or who he wants to be. His little sister Phoebe tries to guide him to find out who he is or who he wants to be. Holden tells his sister \\"I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids and nobody is around--nobody big, I mean--except me. And I am standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff--I mean if they are running and they don't look where they are going. I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I'd do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the only thing I'd really like to be.&quot; Holden wants to prevent young innocence from entering the world of \\"phoniness\\". Holden is unhappy, lonely and bitter. To get away from this world of \\"phoniness\\", he figures he should go live far out west in a cabin all alone. Thinking he would be away from people, a place where nobody will know him, so he doesn't have to be involved. On his adventure for the meaning of life, he searches for a perfect relationship. He realizes that perfect relationship is the relationship he has between him and his sister.The most memorable part of this book is the time he spends with his sister, Phoebe. When he visits her that one night just to talk to her and see her because he lover her company. Another memorable moment would be when he was talking to the nuns at breakfast and donated ten dollars. He finds a state of happiness while he was with the nuns and his sister, Phoebe. He even stated that \\"I felt so happy all of a sudden, the way old Phoebe kept going around and around. I was [almost] bawling, I felt so happy, if you want to know the truth. I don't know why.\\" To know that he felt this way made me feel good. This book was well written. J.D Salinger uses a style of writing where you think you were in a conversation with the main character in the book. There is no plot and the things he talks about just happen, like life. You never know what is going to happen, you just have to accept and appreciate it as God hands it down to you. He uses slang and sarcasm a lot so it seemed as if you were talking with a 17-year old adolescent. While you are \\"listening\\" to the story Holden is telling you, it is easy to relate to one of his many situations. It might come across your mind that you may have said \\"That has happened to me before\\" or \\"I know what he's talking about\\". That is the best part about this novel. Many people can relate to Holden's story. Once you get through the symbolism of the book, you will realize the things J.D Salinger tried to point out. This book is a long life lesson. People these days try to please others rather than speak their mind, which expresses the &quot;phoniness&quot; in people. I recommend this book to everyone because it will give people a different, fresh, and new point of view on life. If you are the type of person who likes to be kept thinking after reading a book; \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" is the book for you."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"As I browse through other reader comments, I'm glad to see that most readers enjoyed Catcher in the Rye. J.D. Salinger's writing style is easy to follow and the tone that he expresses through Holden Caufield is very personal.I remember reading Catcher in the Rye for the first time as a teenager in High School (more than ten years ago). To this day, whenever I interact with other people I often consider how Holden Caufield would read the situation. It keeps me from becoming overly pessimistic or cynical about anything. Whenever I catch myself thinking like Holden, I try to open my mind to alternative perspectives--optimistic or neutral viewpoints.The theme of the novel also helps with understanding people like Holden; the cynical, pessimistic, irrate, grumpy, moody, depressed, ect... And although the ending may seem abrupt, I think this was Salinger's intention; it sets up the reader to think critically and imagine whatever fate they want to attach to Holden.I am thankful that Catcher in the Rye was required reading in high school. Salinger doesn't play around with too much vocabulary or symbolism. Catcher in the Rye is one of the first novels that peaked my interest in books and stimulated my critical thinking patterns."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm still not sure if it's genius or crap, and I've read it a dozen times. That's just about the best recommendation i can offer.The more information about the story itself you're frontloaded with, the weaker your experience will be, so I'm keeping it general.Here are 4 more reasons why you should read this book:1. Everyone else has read it. Even the people who hate reading have read it, and most of them actually liked it. You've got to read this and find out what all the fuss is about.2. You'll hit the jackpot in terms of subtle, hip cultural references.3. People have such stong opinions about this book. You can really get to know someone well, just by asking them what they think of this book or at the very least its narrator. If you enjoy good conversations with interesting, thoughtful people, you've got to have this book in your aresenal.4. As you change and grow, so will the book -- I'm not even talking long term, here. Give it a month, reread a section, and wonder if it's the same novel. Everytime I want to say that the book is crap, I rememeber how my perspective alters the story and am awed by this magical quality."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye is the story of Holden Caulfield, a 16-year-old boy in a very depressed and unhappy state of mind. The story is of his removal from prep school and his return back home to New York City.The book is set in modern day New York City (actually the 1950s, it is written so well it is unnoticeable). Holden spends most of time telling bits and pieces of what he thinks of people, and why he dislikes things so much. Holden himself experiences a lot in a few days, everything from beating attacked by a pimp to drinking and dancing a bar to making an old girlfriend cry.Holden goes through the story mostly alone, simply because every time he visits or meets with someone, he either finds fault in them or they find fault in him, and he leaves. Holden's observations seem to show that he gets increasingly depressed as the story goes on. The story captures a period in everyone's life (usually mid or late adolescence) where everyone and everything seems depressing or without joy. The reason that so many people identify with the story is perhaps because of the depression. Depression, a state of mind that most people seem to feel at some point in their life, is universal. As many other reviewers agree, it is in identifyingHolden, as the narrator, states what we feel during that time, almost perfectly. Holden scrutinizes things we normally don't, primarily the way people act toward other people, whilst ignoring the way he acts. His observations range from seeing profanities scribbled on a wall and getting upset to watching a man in a hotel room put on women's clothes.The overall theme of the book I would say is \\"discomfort.\\" Holden is rarely comfortable. When he even approaches the chance of being comfortable, something always keeps him from getting there. Along the way, the book also deals with alienation and fakeness, and loneliness and deception. Overall, the book is a reminder to me that everything falls apart."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"At first I looked forward to reading Salinger's Catcher in the Rye - after all, it is a classic, right? I wanted to like the book; really, I did. But I couldn't.J.D Salinger begins his novel from the perspective of Holden Caulfield, a teenage boy who talks of how he ends up in his current position in a rest home for therapy. Holden speaks to readers directly as he recounts the events that lead up to his being sent away. I expected the tale of some horrific event to unfold, instead I was informed of Holden's expulsion from school, his dilemma of having to tell his parents, and some things that happen in between. Nothing really happens.The book is written like a drab, repetitive rant and gets annoying fast. Upon completing the novel, I felt as if I had read an entirely different novel from the Catcher in the Rye that everyone seems to rave on and on about. Maybe it's just lost some of its flair with age; or perhaps, it's just gotten too overrated."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I was given this book when I was 12 and have loved it ever since. I cannot count how many times I've read it and all the other J.D. Salinger books I could get my hands on (Franny and Zooey, Raise High the Roofbeam Carpenters, Nine Stories). IT's a wonderful book, especially for an adolescent to read; I think it captures some of that experience well."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The book changed my life. I related to Holden (Main Character) in so many ways. I knew that I was not alone anymore after reading the experiances that he went through. It is a classic and will never go out of style. Anyone who has experianced their teenage years and has a pulse will love love this book, a great book for all."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I first read \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" some twenty years ago. I was prompted to re-read it when my sixteen year old son was set the text as part of high school English curriculum.The book covers a mere two days in the life of Holden Caulfield as he describes his expulsion form an exclusive American boarding school and his travels back to New York City where his parents live. It is a coming of age novel as the young Caulfield traverses an adult world. To a greater or lesser degree, all adults can relate at least partly to Caulfield.At the time of the book's publication it was shocking and, indeed, was banned in many jurisdictions. This may seem strange by the standards of today but we need to remember that America is a different country from that of the 1950s. Caulfield's language, his drinking, smoking and relations with women may seem very tame today. In the 1950s, however, \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" was a very edgy novel. So, yes it has lost some of its \\"street cred\\" as time has passed but the traumas and travails of the young Caulfield still resonate. Caulfield is gradually moving into an adult world but, underneath, seems to long for the stability of youth. A youth where he can act as a catcher in the rye to the very young. A protector of the innocent.Read this novel. It is a true American classic that still talks to current generations."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I just finished reading \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" and now I'm wondering where this book has been all my life. It's definitely the best book I've ever read, and trust me, I've read a lot of books.The main reason I enjoyed it so much is because it's real. It is filled with thoughts shared by millions of people (about the world, life and people in general) and I think everyone is able to relate to Holden (the main character) in one way or another. Also, I've read some of the negative reviews on Amazon; people saying Holden is a \\"loser\\", \\"very repetative\\", \\"angry\\" and \\"pathetic.\\" Well, that's just how you feel when you suffer from depression. You don't see the good in things, only the bad. And Holden is depressed, and the events of this novel are told from his point of view.The entire story takes place over a two-day period, and shows the rapid decline of Holden Caufield's mental and emotional state. The events in the story aren't actually occurring as he's narrating; he's talking about his emotional collapse one year later, while recovering in \\"some crumby place\\" in California.\\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" touches on many human thoughts, emotions and feelings, and it has a bit of everything; drama, comedy, adventure, suspense and action. It's one of those books you'll want to finish to see what happens, but at the same time you won't want it to end! Trust me, you won't regret buying it. Add this classic to your collection."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have always wanted to read this book. It did not disappoint me. A must read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I was extremely impressed with this book and there are two main reasons. One is the fascinating story all by itself, and two is the incredible way in which the story is told.Also, another point that has to be made, is the fact that the book was written in 1951 and still captures the interest of people to this very day. That, in itself, is remarkable. So many books written in the past become historic in the negative sense that people can no longer relate, and the gap is widened as time goes on.Another reason why I think it's so classic is, although it's fiction, it's amazingly reality based. I think that contributes to its worldwide love. There are many books out there that cannot speak to different groups of people, but I can imagine this book being of great interest to just about anybody, from teens to adults. Enjoy, and thanks for checking out my review....Carla"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is about a teenage boy. His name is Holden Caulfield. This book explains his last couple of days before Christmas break. He attended an all boys' school named Pencey Prep, which he left. He then went into New York City for a few nights. He tells this story as though it is a monologue. Holden is in a mental facility as he recalls these past experiences.It all started one night with his roommate Stradlater. Stradlater became interested in one of Holden's female friends. Holden didn't like the idea of Stradlater and Jane Gallagher together. He expressed his anger in the only way he knew how, fighting. This was not a good idea, because Stradlater ended up getting the best of Holden. This whole incident makes Holden decide he is going to leave his school, and he leaves in the middle of that night.Holden then travels to New York on train. His family has lived there his whole life. He checks into a hotel, and has many interesting things happen to him. He gets involved in unimaginable predicaments. After two days, he decides to go sneak and see his sister Phoebe, and after all of the bad things that have happened to him this makes him feel better because he has always been able to communicate with her. He told her he is going to move out west, but this never happens.Holden never really talks about his condition, or why he was hospitalized. That is left up to the reader; I personally think it is because he had a severe case of depression. He was always a very lonely person, with no real ambition or drive in his life. He is sort of a lost soul. It seems as though he matured, and began to see the world with a wider perspective, and became more understanding towards the end of the book.I would not recommend this book for a couple reasons. I think that the book focused too much on one single character, I would have liked it to expand more on other things. The book is not all bad though. Phonies, lies, imagination, and innocence are portrayed quite well in this book. Holden focuses a lot on people being phony, and all the phony things in the world. However, I really enjoyed how this book makes one think. Holden brings up many interesting points about life, and if you look behind the words, it will make you think also. Although this book did have some good points to it, I would not recommend this book, I think that it can become redundant and at some points boring."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book does have a plot, just a pointless one. I think I'm the only person on the planet who didn't like this book. I didn't see much of a reason for the writing of it, but is was a quick, engrossing read. I flew through this thing, I couldn't put it down. I wanted to read every word and follow every path the writer lead me through. However, in the end, I was very disappointed. There didn't seem to be any point to the story at all. Whatever, it was fun to read and I give it 3 stars just because of that."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"As one of the &quot;great books&quot;, and one that a former consumer I worked with listed as her favorite, I felt a certain obligation to read &lt;em&gt;Catcher&lt;/em&gt;, at least once.Alienation? You betcha.Amazing insight on the part of the Narrator? No.Interesting insight on the part of the author, into cynical teenage angst? Somewhat.I didn't particularly enjoy reading Catcher, nor did I see, at the time, what the &quot;greatness&quot; that was supposed to be mined from the pages. Reflecting on it now I can begin to see a little of it. Perhaps this is one of those books that was meant to be read and discussed as a group, rather than consumed in a solitary mode."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"When I bought the Catcher in the Rye, I was aware of its sarcastic, sometimes melancholy tone. The main character was, at first, immediately endearing to me, despite his sourness. His sayings and wry attitude are entertaining. As the pages stretched on, my patience began to wear thin; the narrative has a somewhat slow pace. I found myself skimming much of the middle, but was always tempted to read whatever page I randomly came upon. I also liked Phoebe's character--through whom we see a bit of Holden's sympathetic side.But potential buyers beware: this book is on banned book lists for a reason...Salinger's writing style employs the use of a few choice curses, spread liberally throughout all 288 pages. It was enough to make me, as a person who takes offense at such words, to black out many of the phrases Holden uses in his witty narrative. Although the Catcher in the Rye is a classic in its own right, this reader personally found the ending inconclusive and unsatisfying...but not every story has to be about personal growth, and that certainly wasn't the style back in the 1950's when this was written.So love it or hate it, the Catcher in the Rye is certainly like nothing I have ever read before. It's definitely worth a look."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book has been referred to as a great American novel by well respected reviewers. What, slow day in Literary Land? I really, really didn't like this book. I really, really didn't like Holden. I really, really don't get all the fuss about the coming of age message, the teen angst, etc. Glad I got through it so I can read a GOOD book!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"When Catcher in the Rye came out it was something of revolution. Never before had anyone took time to explore the mind or problems of the over-privileged, white, American teenager. It is an esoteric novel, a low brow piece of literature that sells to its particular crowd: people who haven't read much, or experienced actual life beyond the age of twenty. Now, it's not necessarily the worst thing I've read, but the acclamations people have given it are beyond absurd. Only a fool could identify with Holden Caulfield. This book is basically the 'Twilight' of its day. The only reason it's regarded as a classic is because enough time has passed. Somehow the imagery of an era gone by is enough to cement itself as something of a must read. But you don't need to read it. The story is very simple. It's about an angry white kid, who travels across the city, and finds out that there's more to life than his incessant, introspective whining...and of course there is."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Just a fantastic book that everyone should read.

The numerous apologetic tics of Holden, such as the use of \\"old\\" as a term of affection for anyone and everyone, wears and grates, eventually ruining this reader's nostalgic memory of the book as read in an earlier time. The swearing gets in the way, too. No, the book should not be banned, but it would definitely have benefited from extensive editing. Holden is obviously a candidate for analysis."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The description lead me to believe it was with some disruption. The notes made in the book have lines drawn all through the pages with hand written notes all over the margins. If it had been highlighted it would have made it easier to read. I guess I get what I pay for."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I wanted a Spanish edition for my classroom, and I was excited to think that my students would have the opportunity to read this in their first language.

Now I don't really trust the ads."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is the best book anyone can read. The first time I read this book I totally fell in love with it. Later on when I got to highschool I read it agian and loved it even more. This book is a timeless book a teenager from today can read it and very easily identify himself with it. I love Holden, he is so nice, smart, and so sensible with everything. I love the way he thinks and the way he expresses himself. I think everybody should read this book at least once. I got so into the book I felt so bad that Holden was going through all that nervous breakdown. I think this books fits all and I recommend it to all the people who love to read good books."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"For all the high schoolers out there who dread reading those boring novels assigned by your English teacher and read cliffs or sparknotes instead, do not pass this book up. I read Catcher in the Rye my junior year in high school and to this day it is still one of my all time favorite books.I'm not an avid reader. In fact, I hate reading. I can't even stand reading those Hallmark cards that have too many words on them (ha ha). But when I picked this book up I could not put it down. I'm in college now, and I still have yet to find a book that I like better than this one. I was able to relate to the main character, and I enjoyed the bitter sarcism and dark humor. I never got bored reading his thoughts.However, I do caution people who get easily offended to read with an open mind. Many of my more conservative friends found the novel distastefull.So for all you teenagers who prefer to party instead of do homework and get an oral summary from the smart kid next you in math class, the period before Englsih, at least give this book a chance. BELIEVE ME, YOU'LL LIKE IT."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This used to be my favorite book, when I was a teenager. Not that I am far removed from that now-I am 24, but this book still had a profound effect on me. I first read it when I was 14, and thought it was genius. I re-read it every couple of years, to see how my interpretations of the book change as I get older.At 14, I thought it was the best book I had ever read. At 18, I couldn't get over how angry Holden was. At 24, I see Holden as a teenager, having trouble finding his place in the world. I know he's a fictional character, but he could represent all teenagers and I hope that he will fall in love, find real friends and his niche in the world.For a book famous for being read by teenagers, I wouldn't recommend it to them. I would really recommend this book to a young adult, maybe over 22, who was an angry teenager, to see that they are not alone and how far they have come from that place in their lives."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I adore this book. I think that more people should read it, and especially use the vocabulary, because it's really awesome. It's not just a great novel, it's a dictionary for really swell words from the 1950's, and also has one of the hippest characters ever. Holden Caulfield is my hero. It is by far JD's best book, actually it's his only novel, the rest of his books are short stories, mostly about the Glass family. I guess once you've written the best why try the rest? I love how the book portrays the mind of teenagers. I think that everyone can identify with The Catcher in the Rye because most people have had a time in their lives when the world is totally open to you, and you're still completely lost. Also, it is one of the funniest books I've ever read, because Holden's ideas are so honest about everyone but himself, although he acknowledges, as does the rest of the world, that he's a madman. When we read this book at school some people didn't enjoy it because they thought that it was hard to follow, but given its world-wide popularity I think that it is definitely worth at least trying to read, and nearly everyone who does really passionately loves it, as I do."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Hard to believe that this book was written 56 years ago! Also hard to believe that high school kids read it, it's so edgy and scary in a way. I see this book today very differently from the simplistic individual v. society view I held in high school over 30 years ago. Today for me it's an eerie portrait of a young person for whom the sub-text of daily life, the constant stream of petty frustrations that we all experience, has taken over and become reality. Caulfield is hanging on by a thread which frays by the minute as he wanders through NYC. His sensitivity to others, good (the nuns and Phoebe) and bad (Ackley), overwhelms him! The writing is superb, right down to the grammatical errors that so perfectly capture a teenager trying to sound like an adult--&quot;I and Brossard and Ackley got on the bus...&quot; A tip for book clubs: save the light fiction for the beach or airplane, and read classics, even if you've read them before--makes for great meetings!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've heard that Mark David Chapman, John Lennon's assassin, often used to read this book, and since John Lennon is one of my biggest idols, the book caught my interest - standing there in the school's cupboard. I thought it must be a very special novel. Every book that can be read more than once is out of the ordinary - and particularly if somebody special enough to kill John Lennon reads it.And very much indeed, The Catcher in Rye is a special book - one of the more special I've read. The story sets off by Holden Caulfield, the main character, telling you about him being kicked out of his fourth school - the fine and merited Pency Prep in Pennsylvania.He takes farewell of some of his friends, travels to New York and spends a few days there. All this time he is thinking about whether he should go back to his parents or not. Everything in the book, except the quite many flashbacks, is happening within a few days.Holden is a very special person. He doesn't really like anyone, except his little sister Phoebe. He is pessimistic and miss-trusts almost everyone he meets - which first annoyed me as reader, but after a while amused me because it's so well-written. The whole story consists of Holden telling you what he thinks about the people at Pency, the people at the other schools he went to and others he knows. The book also describes his way of thinking about ordinary things like &quot;where do all the ducks in Central Park go when the lagoon is frozen?&quot;.Holden is very anti-clich&eacute; in general, but he is especially against the adult society as such. He was not kicked out of the schools because he wasn't clever enough, but because he couldn't get along with the teachers, and he also couldn't cope with his parent's way of life. Perhaps it's because of his age (right between being a child and a grown-up) or because of his childhood, but he always seems to want to be rebel and revolt against society, without really knowing why. But he also wants to do something good to society and speaks well of people who do - for example some nuns that he meets. He has a dream, that some children are playing in a rye field up on a cliff, and he is the one saving (catching) them from falling off the cliff and into the ocean.I absolutely think that The Catcher in the Rye is a great story. The ground-story is very banal with him being kicked out, going to New York, and thinking about whether he should go back home or not. One doesn't even get to know what happens when he gets back home, but even though, the story is utterly worth reading - it's the self-reflecting thoughts that Holden has and the ideas behind the book that count."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is simply the best book ever written. It has layers to it that would be trivialized to try and explain, but for the sake of righting some of the unfair and horribly hollow reviews this novel has received, I'll try. To begin with, the book is about the kind of teenager who is so deep and insightful it just hurts you to read his thoughts. Anyone who has ever truly appreciated something seemingly inconsequential will connect with Holden Caulfield, because he is the epitome of that type of person: someone who hasn't got it all figured out, but wishes to, and who's got a shining soul as straight as a sword. In the book, the reader is left to decide if Holden is actually crazy (or on his way there) or not. Even a few *good* reviews of this book said he had a few screws loose. In my own opinion, that is not the case. Holden wasn't going crazy. He just printed everything he thought. Truth be told, if each of us typed down everything WE thought and got it published for others to scan, they'd think we were crazy too. I don't even think Holden is a true pessimist. Yes, he can be cynical, albeit often, and seems to have a &quot;half empty&quot; kind of few on life and things in general, but that is NOT the case. In actuality, Holden is an idealist; he just covers it up with pessimism to protect himself. Many &quot;cynicists&quot; do. You see, Holden wants everything to be perfect and lovely so badly, it depresses him to see anything fall short of its full potential. I won't go any more into it for fear of giving too much away (I probably already have), but the fact is that Holden's innermost, true self is everything all of us should try to be: a seeker of that which is solely good and right, one who can appreciate every little thing that manages to have no significance yet mean all the world, a champion of everything true, and an empath to the last."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The catcher in the rye J.D.SalingerI must admit that I don't really like reading books but I liked this book very much. I think the book has a very good subject for people of our age. The book is about a boy that has about our age so it is very easy to enter yourself into the part. The boy in the book, Holden, has a lot of problems with schools. In this story he had to leave school and because he had still a couple of days before he had to go home he just went to a hotel and stayed in the city for a couple of days. What I really liked about the story was the fact that it wasn't to long and it was easy to follow. Sometimes you had to read a thing twice because it was written in spoken language, but that wasn't bad. The book didn't count to many characters so you didn't have to concentrate to hard to be able to follow the story. I really liked the main character, Holden, because he was just a regular boy that didn't really know what to do so he just did the things that he could think of. The book wasn't what I had expected from it, it wasn't just an ordinary book like we always have to read. The book wasn't exciting but it was good to read, I enjoyed it.Nick Oris6MWb"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the RyeI'm not such a good englishreader. It took a lot of my time to read this book. In the beginning it didn't read fluently because there were a lot of words I don't know. But to the ending it went a lot better.In this book the author wrote, like people speak in our real live. I like that sort of writing but it also has disadvantages because there were also a lot of words that aren't in a dictonnary. I think it's a bit of a strange book. Most of the time it bored me because in fact there wasn't a real story. It only goes about a boy, Holden, people descripe what he does but that's it. He doesn't go through adventures. While I was reading, I've never felt tension from the beginning till the end. I like more story's when you can replace yourself with the person in the book. I never felt, I would like to be that boy, now way, he has a bored life and does nothing sensfull. Sometimes there were funny parts in it, for example : Holden asked everytime when he took a cab where the ducks rest during the winter. I like books with a lot of tension and adventure. I don't like open ends, this book doesn't realy have an open end because there nothing happened. But we also don't know how Holdens life made progress. I like to know the confrontation of Holden with his parents.The book didn't fascinate me and I was happy when I finished it. I don't want to break off the hole story, I didn't feel bad that we had to read such a story, for a time it's fun to read it once but not to much of those story's."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Funny book. I'd like to meet the kid who wrote it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I know this book is \\"it\\", and there is a lot of blather from ecstatic readers about universal coming of age and a rueful sadness at loss of innocence. Okay, fine. It's in there. I laughed a couple or three times, and I even recall a good belly laugh. Good. And obviously there is Salinger's gift for spoken language and keen insightfulness regarding social peccadilloes and irritating manners. Most folks can identify with Holden's exasperation and frustration toward those who adapt to and adopt those \\"socializing\\" manners and peccadilloes as they transition to adulthood. Holden seeks to resist that polluting influence, which is admirable, right?Only, there's a problem. In spite of his recognition of the problem(s) in others, he is part of the problem himself. He candidly admits that he has a variety of personality quirks and negative behavioral characteristics. But he also has irksome and annoying behaviors that he doesn't recognize, and so his conduct contributes to the same noisome and spoilsome social corruption that he laments in others.This book has a tremendous fan base. It is beloved as a cultural and literary artifact. It is also praised for its dialog and characterization, and rightly so. The story is skillfully presented, no doubt. Superlatives are tossed about (notice the terms \\"genius\\", \\"master\\", and \\"brilliant\\" in the gushing spotlight review dated July 21,2000) when this novel is discussed. I understand why this is so, but I find myself tending to agree in sentiment with the tone of the one-star review below by Michael Atkins. This book is over-hyped. While Caulfield's character may ring true in both voice and observation, the result is a confection that is light in substance. Holden is a study in sweet angst, yes. So?The theme of the book isn't related to the word picture captured in the title, contrary to the regurgitated observations made below. The theme is that humans are broken, and while they may be able to see what is wrong, they aren't much capable to do anything about it. Even if they can act to resolve a problem here or there, they are instigating and engendering their own set of problems elsewhere.The musician Sting authored the popular song \\"Every Breath You Take\\" while a member of the band the Police. He has voiced his consternation at the way the public responded to his song, which was #1 on the music charts for some time. Sting points out that the song is not about sweet, devoted love at all, but is rather about an obsessed and ugly jealousy that is controlling and disturbed. The public was happily and haplessly ignorant of this, naively not picking up the clues in the song or the video, even though the high-key, low-fill lighting used in the video gives a classic noire, deep-shadow depiction of a character with a dark side. Sting has often confessed his exasperation with the public's inability to recognize the song for what it is, and he finds the song's great popularity as a wedding song shocking and shallow.The same is true of The Catcher in the Rye. As the other spotlight review by Jack from Des Moines illustrates, readers typically tend to identify with Holden Caulfield. Jack's statement is sterling: I AM HOLDEN CAULFIELD. \\"The number of readers who have been able to identify with Holden and make him their hero is truly staggering,\\" claims the SparkNotes.com website. The ironic fact is that Holden Caulfield is one of the most pathetic and self-deluded characters in English-language fiction. He is, in his own wrecked way, as much a phony as any of the other characters upon whom he appends that label. Holden is everything he despises, despite his limited recognition of his own failings. For any reader to make the choice to happily identify with Holden Caulfield is to embrace in oneself the personification of foolishness. It is nothing less than gleefully claiming to be a phony. Look again at that SparkNotes quote above, then go figure.My two-star rating is probably more a function of my reaction to the story's popularity, a la Sting, than my reaction to the humor and craft of the story itself. I would probably give the story three or four stars (3 maybe?) based on those qualities. I would be willing to give the story five stars for it's superlative depiction of the inability of humans to recognize their own shortcomings while they so easily dwell on the failures of others, except for one thing: the evidence suggests that Salinger failed in making his point. In a tremendous irony, one perhaps not unexpected, readers on the whole appear to be incapable of recognizing the true theme and purpose of the story. It seems that hardly anyone learns from the novel, they just LIKE it. Reviewer Damon Garr, in his 5-star review below, even mourns that he wasn't quite as cynical when he was a teen as Caulfield manages to be in the story. How utterly bizarre!Yes, people are Holden Caulfield...and what a sad, pathetic, shameful, and repulsive situation that is. Salinger proved a truth rather than exposed it--that is a failing--and the book loses any luster it might have been able to sustain because of that monumental shortcoming."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"While reading this book, I, being a teenager myself, came to understand Holden, the main character. He isn't so different from some friends I know. It is my wish that there be more teacher who are willing to to love their students, and help them bestow meaning to their own lives.Holden, when expelled from his prep school Pencey, leaves it as soon as he can. Taking care not to tell the news to his parents sooner than necessary, he lingers in New York. He encounters a series of incidents --- cab drivers, a prostitute, the two nuns... --- as he dives deeper into his \\"phony\\" world.Troubled adolescents like Holden are not rare these days. I realized that the source of such repugnance towards one's surroundings is lack of care. No one, atleast it seemed so for Holden, cared enough to give attention to what was going on in his mind. The place, other than his home, that should take the blame more than anywhere else is Pencey. The school was full of phonies, because the curriculum was not so focused on making the students \\"find the idea that fits one's mind best.\\" Finally, Phobe, the only person in the story that is capable of giving Holden the much needed affection and care, saves Holden from his deep fall and sets him straight.This story, written in first-person narrative and conversational tone, ends with an happy ending. But I keep asking myself: Will every troubled boy find his Phoebe, The Catcher in the Rye?It depresses the hell outta me when I think about it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is best read for the first time as a teenager, preferably as a book NOT assigned by school, because teens quickly grasp that Holden Caulfield is on to something about the adult world -- namely, that much of it is phony. The allure to Salinger's classic, then, is in its contrary mood and anti-establishment tone. Holden has little patience for most anybody and can pick up a phony on his \\"radar\\" from a mile away -- a gift many teenagers share when it comes to the adult world.Readers tend to fall into two camps regarding Holden. One camp, the majority, holds him as an endearing rebel with a regrettable depression problem that grows as the novel unwinds. The other camp, an admittedly sizable minority, holds him as an annoying whiner who complains about everything and gets nowhere in life (as you'd expect). Clearly Salinger intended readers to tune into the former, and if you embrace Holden in that spirit, you will personally gain something from his travels through New York and realize that, deep down beneath all his cynicism and sarcasm, Holden really does care -- too much, in fact -- and has a code he not only lives by but judges others by.While there are no end to the characters Holden criticizes, take note of those he respects as well. Old Jane Gallagher with her kings in the back row (checkers). The nuns at the sandwich bar. The little girl with the loose ice skates. Phoebe and Allie. For readers feeling hostile to Holden (or to a teacher who has assigned this book and thus changed it by putting it under a microscope or assigning pop quizzes about it), I suggest going out of your way to look for these positives. You'll see that Holden is incredibly sensitive and ethical, can be sentimental about others, cares about women and girls, and understands right from wrong.Read in that spirit, the book can't help but be viewed as a modern classic saying as much about the world as it does about teenagers. If you've ever caught yourself wondering about some really strange (and unique!) things like where the ducks in Central Park go in the winter, then you'll identify with this lost soul in search of life's meanings.This is Salinger's best in my opinion. I say that because it holds up to multiple re-readings, and any book that can offer new insights under such scrutiny MUST be doing something right..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I just recently read The Catcher In the Rye for the first time, and I have to admit I really didn't get it. I am only fifteen and this is only my first time reading it so I am sure that with age and re-reading I might come to love this book and truly recognize why it is one of the most accomplished books in literature, but for right now I just didn't get it.What I liked about the book was that while Holden's outlook on life was negative and blunt, it was still funny and strangely true--even if we sometimes wouldn't want to admit it. I enjoyed laughing at his charasmatic, and sarcastic attitude, and his interpretations of the events around him.What I didn't like about the book was that, it was so repetative. True J.D. Salinger's whole point of repeating things was to help us get an idea of the character of Holden, but sometimes I found it boring to read his same opinion on something over and over. Also sometimes Holden's erratic train of thought was difficult to understand, I found myself having to read passages again to try and understand what Holden was trying to communicate.To wrap it all up, I was expecting that by the end of the book there would be some monumental conclusion on Holden's story to give this book such a reputation, but i was seriously disappointed when the story just sort of trailed off. I didnt understand. There was no point in the whole story.So anyways, I gave this book a three because of the things explained above and I hope that the next time I read this book I will understand it a little better."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am a college teacher (math), and every term I give my new students a questionnaire. Among the questions I often ask is &quot;Name one book, movie, TV show, or piece of music as your all time favorite, and explain why.&quot; &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; has been cited more often than any other book, and I finally decided to find out why. I'm STILL trying to find out why. If my students relate to this book, then they are more bitter and loutish than they appear to be in my classes and out-of-class conversations. I regret that those who attack the book have often done so on the grounds of its vulgarity. That just devalues their argument. The fact is that the book is lousy because it portrays as a hero a teenage kid who is nothing but a bitter, maladjusted punk. He interprets courtesy as phoniness, and in fact assumes that anyone who doesn't immediately give him whatever he feels like having must be cruel, or a phony, or just generally subhuman. This kid is supposed to be teaching us something about life? About adolescence? He's learning about himself? He has no interest in any of that - he's interested only in what other people can do for him. He is sensitive to nothing but his own feelings. If you liked the movie &quot;Five Easy Pieces&quot; - another portrayal of an &quot;alienated&quot; and oh-so-sensitive lout which caused the critics to cream their jeans - then you'd probably like &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;. The world is full of bitterly unhappy people who confuse cynicism and hostility toward the world with artistic sensitivity. Many of them write reviews of books and movies, as they have done here. But avoid such people. They live lives of misery, and spread the misery around so they don't have to be alone in their hatred of the world. And &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; is their favorite book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"&quot;Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist.&quot; -Ralph Waldo EmersonIn his classic literary work THE CATCHER IN THE RYE, J. D. Salinger hits the proverbial nail on the head in relation to teenage issues. The main character, Holden Caulfield journeys from his school (Pencey) to his home in search of some measure of spiritual meaning in life. Through his experiences and adventures, Holden gains much insight on the meaning of life. This issue of finding meaning in life is pertinent to adolescents everywhere. In this way, Salinger addresses concerns of teenage readers and relates them to Holden.Whereas the transcendentalists of the nineteenth century fled to nature to look for meaning in life, Holden flees to the urban sprawl of New York. During his travels, he has many paradigm-shifting epiphanies: his brief relationship with a prostitute demonstrates the folly of superficial love; his disastrous date with an old friend teaches the same; and his encounters with profane graffitti around his younger sister's school teach him that the world is a cruel place and that no place is exempt from the sacreligious nature of humans. In such, Holden's brief journey can be seen as a representation of the period of time in which adolescents define themselves morally and spiritually.Young Holden, in his rambling, elects to fight against all things phony. The iron of his morals and beliefs is forged in the fiery cauldron of the &quot;real world.&quot; All teens experience this formative period when they choose which morals/beliefs to accept and which to reject. Indeed, it is only after this system of beliefs is established that one crosses the brink from the awkward uncertainty of adolescence to the calm assuredness of adulthood.The simple conversational prose of Salinger's THE CATCHER IN THE RYE conceals many truths about life. In holding such deep meaning, the novel is worthy of any reader's attention. However, it rings even clearer to the teenage reader in that Holden faces many of the same momentous questions that adolescents face every day. Reading this novel is similar to talking to a close friend about life. Very few works of literature can claim that honor, but Salinger's masterpiece does. Holden's thoughts are the same as those of Thoreau and Emerson; they merely apply to a more modern setting. If one wishes to read about explosions and fireworks, they could just as well see a movie. However, if one wishes to ponder the meaning of life, they need not look any further than to the nearest copy of THE CATCHER IN THE RYE."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Like it or not, there is a little Holden Caufield in all of us. Who hasn't been disgusted with his present situation at one time or another, with the same drab setting and boring people, the same tedious authority figures, the seemingly inescapable occupational path laid out in front of him? Caufield is our phony-exposing id, getting kicked out of school, running away from convention, and telling anyone in his path exactly like it is. I, for one, feel like there's as many frauds around now as there were in Caufield's world (New York's boarding school establishment in the 1950's)- just pick up any paper- and would love to at times similarly pack up and escape them all.Caufield's heart is in the right place throughout this tale of, essentially, a young man's mild descent into madness (I say mild because it is accompanied by none of the gun-wielding trauma we have come to associate with disillusionment among today's post-Columbine teens). He says goodbye to a professor at the boarding school he's tossed from; he defends an old girlfriend's honor from his cad roommate; he fondly and regretfully reminisces about his dead younger brother; and he dotes on his sister Phoebe throughout, even entering his parents' house under the cover of darkness (and in a drunken stupor) to check in on her while she slept. When he visits her at school and takes her to the park the next day, right at the brink of his collapse and threatening to leave his environment forever, the scene is as touching as it is suspenseful.I would like to have seen more resolution from this story, such as his making contact with his unrequited love, who was never mentioned after Caufield fought his roommate for dating her. However, I recognize Catcher is more about one errant weekend- albeit a very revealing one- than it is Caufield's life's story. Plus, the surprise ending merits a mere couple of paragraphs, and the merest of allusions within them, yet exceeds the rest of this book in its power."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye, by J.D. Salinger is a timeless classic in which a young boy tries to find himself while living in his Ivy League world. The young hero of the book, Holden Caufield, tries to reestablish a relationship with his younger sister, and decide what he wants to make of him self.Holden has been expelled from Pencey for academic failure, and after an unpleasant evening with his self-satisfied roommate Stadlater and their pimply next-door neighbor Ackley, he decides to leave Pencey for good and spend a few days alone in New York City before returning to his parents' Manhattan apartment.Upon reading The Catcher in the Rye I had high expectations. As I have never met a person who has not only enjoyed the book, but has been able to relate themselves to Holden, I only hoped that my expectations could be met. I read the book with ease, the riveting plot keeping my attention, I not only realized that my lofty goals would be met, but far surpassed. I have never before been able to relate my self to a character such as Holden in Salinger &iacute;s masterpiece.Holden &iacute;s witty humor and deep thoughts leave you in disbelief of his personality. Is he a poor rich kid? Or a person trying to discover himself before making the final steps into the real world? The readers of the book will make their own opinion of why Holden seems to suddenly have psychological breakdown at such an early age. Although Holden is intelligent and sensitive, he narrates his story in a cynical, jaded voice. Though he never says so outright, he longs to live in a beautiful and innocent world, and finds the hypocrisy and ugliness of the world around him almost unbearably painful.The Catcher in the Rye is not only a timeless classic, but also a story about a young boy on the brink of adulthood, finding the world full of hypocrisy and ugliness and wondering how he will fit in."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I loved the book, mostly the part about the lake.

It seemed like it was very pointless but when I started reading I thought it wasn't that bad I actually somewhat got in to the book and thought it wasn't that bad. I thought that it was wicked cool that Holden wasn't afraid when he got fed up with everything that he just got up and left on his own to New York. I would love sometimes to just leave and go to dance clubs in New York City. I recommend this to most people except for people who will get obsessed with this book and try to shoot someone the day the patriots are playing Miami in a playoff game. But then again you can't shoot John Lennon again. Other than that I think most people will enjoy this book. Also I liked the random characters that if they didn't come it wouldn't have been an interesting story. Like his best friend wasn't in the book much but he was in it enough to make the book about forty pages longer because of the stress and conflict that Holden went through. There was also that prostitute and her pimp that added like twenty more pages and Holden wanted to commit suicide, which is never a healthy thing.

(It is, perhaps, a \\"classic\\" in the sense that Britney Spears is a \\"star.\\") Having recently read the book for the first time, I discovered (regrettably, too late) that I had been misinformed. It is not at all about a young man coming of age, beset by archetypical teenage angst and alienation; it is about mental illness. I also suspect it is autobiographical, and so do not blame Mr. Salinger for the book's lamentable lack of any literary merit. I fear, rather, that in the writing of it he simply could not help himself."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye, by J.D Salinger, is an evolving and ever-changing story of a young man&#8217;s reality, out on his own for the first time. The book tells of Holden Caufield, a restless, over privileged teenager who attends prestigious Pencey, a competitive boy&#8217;s boarding school. This dynamic character inevitably flunks out of the school, as a result of the four out of five courses he failed. Ashamed and confused, he sets off to his home, New York City, but is reluctant to tell his family. He spends a few nights in an expensive hotel with some of his father&#8217;s gift money. The book tells of the hardships of being out in the world for the first time, and the people along the way who help shape Holden and force him to deal with the chronic, destructive emotions that he has so carelessly brushed aside. I recommend this book to all readers. For people who like adventure, it is there. Adventure is shown when Holden is out on his own, not knowing anyone, and trying to make it through just one night without mistakes. For people who like drama, the book is full of it; giving detailing to Holden&#8217;s family situation and the mental struggles he has gone through. An example of this would be towards the end, when Holden finally returns home, and spends precious time with his little sister, a special bond is remembered. Also included in this wonderful story, is a person in search of passion and thrill for something in his most complicated surroundings. In addition, this book has many lessons, but I believe the most prominent one is to find something in life that excites and challenges, something Holden didn&#8217;t learn from of his school, his friends, or his family, in that important chapter of his life. These examples are each different and unique. He seeks comfort from a stranger who happens to be a disliked peer&#8217;s mother, and pretends to have a tumor in his brain to impress her. He then has an intellectual conversation about Shakespeare with a pair of nuns, again, teaching him generosity in strangers. Next, he experiences a most odd encounter of having an elevator boy send Holden a strange prostitute to his hotel room, teaching not to trust everyone, this book is a roller coaster of adventure and life lessons. One reason why some may not enjoy this book would be because of the use of language. The book&#8217;s descriptions, although somewhat humorous, are told in a manner that some may think is crude, as seen through the eyes of a teenage boy. This story is told in everyday language and tone, with a relaxed flow to it. Some people may not be used to this style of writing, though some may find it enjoyable and readable. Although this one flaw is different, it still adds to the reality of the story, and adds depth to the characters. Overall, I found this book to be truly unique and wonderful, and gives the reader a clear insight into the life of a struggling human being in search of himself."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book was a sensation when I first read it in 1956 as a teenaged prep school boy. I loved it then. What the hell, it was about me. That's how we all felt in 1956, we preppy, suicidal virgins. Today I can't understand what all the noise was about. Salinger was known for his alienated presence. Today this is a common trope in literature and films. The prototype of all teen angst books, it seems incredible to me that anyone can read it today without laughing out loud. This includes modern teens who have to see this museum piece as stilted and embarrassing. Salinger gets 3 stars for being early, but like a pop record that everyone just loved 45 years ago and today seems tinny and phony, it just doesn't hold up. All in all this book is best left a memory.EKW"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"My husband wanted this classic to retread after many years.

Most do not see the reason that he wrote such a book. The reason Salinger wrote this book was to comment on Holden growing up to face his adult life. Holden grows immensely through out this novel. As he goes through each phase of his life, he matures while commenting on the fakeness of the world. While Holden understands the &quot;phoniness&quot; of society, he is unversed in the ways of the world. Going into the city, Holden is exposed to many elements of life that force him to mature not only spiritually, but mentally as well. To be able to fulfill his mission, Holden must first be able to understand the culture of his society and surroundings. Salinger, through the voice of Holden, tries to show the reader that what is on the surface is not always what is true. While the book does show autobiographical elements, Salinger is not telling his life story. This book is a great example of depth in a novel. Holden's language is not an example of crude intention, but rather, it is necessary to show Holden's immaturity as well as his cynical outlook. Often, Holden is shown as a hopeless cynic with no hope for the world. However, Holden is a model realist, and often, the world is a gloomy place to be. In the end, Holden, with the experiences of his life guiding him, he realizes his place in life, not as a catcher, but as an informer. Salinger wrote a wonderful novel in The Catcher in the Rye. He perfectly portrayed the life of a young man struggling to mature and accept all aspects of society while understanding his purpose in the world. This novel is wonderful to show maturing adolescents that life is confusing and maturation is part of being here."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is an excellent example of real life. It puts all the phonies in their places. Speaking as a high school student and a well- read young adult, I would recomment this to ANYONE over the age of 13. Reading it has removed the blinder of my fellow students . Even though some have written bad reviews, it has given them a new insight of the tortured souls of their peers. I liked the fact that it was alluded to in the movie Conspiracy Theory. When I had to read this book as an assignment I thought it would be a treat for others. Instead, I think it horrified or confused them. It was like nothing they had ever read and most of their opinions on this book were negative because they didnt understand the meaning of the book. I know that it can be very easy to hate this book because Holden Caulfied rambes, lies, and does nothing but try and get drunk throughout this book. But what are the majority of high school students doing? I just wish one of my fellow students would have just gotten some glimpse of what Holden was really talking about when he used the metaphors such as the ducks or being the catcher in the rye. The duck represents his personality frozen to everyone else and one caring about what really happened to him. To be the catcher, Holden is trying to catch the other children before they fall into the abyss of adulthood. A no bull acount of the life of a misfit teen, this book inspires me to think and question my own phony actions and try to better myself. I believe this book will always be one of my favorites and Holden always my favorite characters."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this novel when I was slightly younger than Holden and found that I had a lot in common with the main character. We both lived in NYC, went to prep-school and had dysfunctional families. It is because I identified so closely to the main character that I would not want to revisit this text at my age. I know that I am far more cynical than Holden ever was, and don't hold the author (Salinger) in the highest esteem. I believe Salinger has been afraid to come out of his self-imposed exile because he knows he will never find another voice as authentic as Holden's. I had a friend in San Francisco who absolutely insisted that Salinger and Pynchon were the same person. I guess it makes a certain amount of sense in an Oliver Stone kind of way. I would urge a young reader to read this book as it truly is one of the best accounts of adolescent angst and mistrust of the older generation that has been produced in literature. And if there were such thing as a perrenial theme, wouldn't that be it? If I were still teaching English, however, I might get a bit fatigued in rehashing this work; for in hindisght, I find Salinger's dystopian viewpoint and Caulfield's negativity about as puerile as a latter day Ellis novel."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book explains many teenager actions to other people who do not understand. It also shows insite of the auhtor, that he did not tell us, but showed us these facts. This is a must-read for everyone"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I would love to say something like: all those people who didn't like this book just don't know what life is all about, but I won't. This book is a classic and deservedly so. Salinger captures the spirit of Holden so emphatically that the book takes on an uneasy reality that few others have ever done for me. I suppose its true that you either love it or you hate it, but either way this book will take you to the extreme. And the ending (it just killed me:)) has got to be one of the best endings ever - so epicly overstated that it leaves you completely numb. Definitely a must read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"&gt;I may be missing something.Yes. You are. I'm sick of books trying to portrary a teenager's life as a beautiful. Because it is not. It is hell and as depressing as wanting to be a deaf-mute in the forest. There is no big moral or life lesson I can see in even life itself. Thank you J.D. Salinger for all the ones who still can't appreciate works like this. If it wasn't for them, there would be no books like this."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a modern psychological novel I enjoyed very much, probably because it was a lot easier to read than other novels that explore the depths of the human mind, such as A Portrait of the Artist as A Young Man. Holden Caulfield is one of my favorite characters in literature. I like him because he is so human. Yes, he's a phony, yes, he is inconsistent, and yes, he has pointless pet peeves, but when I look at the world, I see that we all possess these characteristics. Overall, Holden is a nice, caring guy, but he has major problems. The novel is extremely entertaining, and Holden's comments are hilarious. Many of his observations about life and people are dead-on. Salinger tells this story almost flawlessly, and I especially love the ending - nothing happens. This was a book I had to read for school, which means I had to read it looking for themes, symbols, and patterns, and because Holden is such a round character, these things just jumped out at me while I was reading. This novel is an excellent chronicle of the \\"troubled teen,\\" and I think that as time progresses, the greatness of this book will be realized even more."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am 12 years old, and I read &quot;Catcher in the Rye,&quot; while flying Boston-Germany. I liked the general idea of the book, but I thought Holden Caulfield was very negative towards life. He always seemed to be finding the negative of people, yet I could find instances where he seemed very nice. A lot of the language in this book was 'inappropraite,' but I felt that helped convey Holden's confused, almost angry attitude towards all the &quot;phonies&quot; in life. He at times seems vulnerable, and at other times seems like a &quot;rough and tough&quot; high school student. I think maybe I should have read this when I was 14 or 15, just to get a clearer idea of what he was actually going through. I liked the book anyway, though. 4 stars!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I know this book is, for the most part, universally liked, so I will make only one point. I recomend everyone reads it, but especially late teen and early twenties males such as myself. I read the book when I was 19. Never before in my life have I indentified with a novel like Catcher in the Rye. You feel as though Holden thinks your thoughts. This book gives an indepth account about comming to age in a modern world and the difficulties you encounter in discovering who your are."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book when I was thirteen years old and I fell in love with it. I read it for twenty four hours a day, page after page, reading it through everything, putting it in a plastic bag in the bath...going to all extents to finish it. I finished the whole book in two days and I absolutely loved it. The whole story is witty, funny, sad and you feel really involved with the story and you know the character like a friend, perhaps even part of your family. It is hard to believe the book was written such a long time ago but it is definitely one of my all-time favourites. It brings out the best in J.D Salinger."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I thought the book was good, however it lacked a certain binding and it seemed like random thoughts jumbled together. The book captures a different time period. Holden was a smart, lazy, unfocused teenager. He was paying for it in a way that kids today don't. With grade inflation and lower standards in academics a Holden today would be managing alot better. I think Holden expressed himself in a weird interesting sort of way. His dialogue was a touch bit different and the way he expressed his emotions was different from most books I've read. The whole book aims towards the future but we never actually get there with Holden. We are left hanging without a neat Hollywood ending. I wanted to know more when it was over. Everyone is trying to change Holden for the better. We never know if they succeed."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"First off, I'd like to say that I'm a teenager and what people say about it telling about the &quot;average&quot; life of a teenager is almost next to being wrong.

The character, Holen Caulfield, gives a very descriptive narrative of the things going on around him and how he percieves them.

I liked it a lot because I feel that most teenagers can relate to the main character, Holden Caulfield. The book shows his struggle to find an indentity and what choices to make in life. J.D. Salinger really really uses a great deal of literary devices in describing Holden's adventures. This book was a wonderful book in which I enjoyed reading on more than one occasion. I truly recommend it for everybody."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger introduces a typical teenage boy in The Catcher in The Rye. Holden Caulfield, the main character, is much more than a teenager going through a tough time. He is a very special boy with special needs. He doesn't understand and doesn't want to understand the world around him as he calls everything he doesn't like a \\"phony\\". Holden doesn't express his normal thoughts or feelings. He doesn't trust his teachers and parents because he can't understand them, not because he doesn't like them or wants to separate from them. There is not much in Holden's world that he understands. The only people he trusts and respects are Allie, his brother D.B, and Phoebe, who is his younger sister. Everyone and everything else that he knows of are \\"phony\\". Holden uses the word phony a lot of times to describe his feeling about the people he doesn't like and things he rejects: his roommate Stradlater and Ernie for example. He also calls his school, Pencey Prep, a phony school because he doesn't like most of the students and the teachers. Holden said, \\"The more expensive a school is, the more crooks it has\\". Holden is being kicked out of Pencey Prep because he is failing four out of five classes. Although he's left with many memories, some are good but most are bad. Holden, being scared of going home from his parents, leaves school a few days early and travels to Downtown, New York. On his way, he runs into many people such as his sister Phoebe. Not only did Pencey Prep made him think it was a phony place to be, but Holden thinks the whole world is a phony place to be after seeing Downtown, New York. Holden's little sister, Phoebe, offers to help Holden because he wants to find out who he wants to be in the future of his life. Holden realizes what he really needs is to move out in the west and live in a cabin to escape from all the phony things in the world, and not be involved in anything with anyone. What he wants to discover is a relationship that will be suitable for him to live under. J.D. Salinger, the author of the book, wrote this book so well that when you are reading with your mind concentrated on the story, you imagine it as a reality. You think you are going through the phase that Holden is going through in the book. Salinger uses a unique style of writing because you imagine you are in the conversation yourself. I can't imagine this story having any weaknesses because of the way Salinger describes the scenes and the experiences of Holding. Thus, it has much strength as Salinger awaits you to find out impatiently what will happen next in the story. I would recommend this book to teenagers 14 years of age and older because The Catcher in The Rye is a interesting life story, for people who are confused about their lives, or don't know what to do with their lives and want to freshen up a bit."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a wonderful book... everyone should have read this book at some point in their lives. If you were not forced to read it in high school, you were deprived. This book is essential to every teenager's brain the way that every teacher should see &quot;Dead Poet's Society&quot;. The book chronicles the failures of Holden Caulfield, a prep school drop out, who vicariously avoids facing his music by laying low in Manhattan for a few days. Everyone can relate to his akwardness and his cynicism which is what makes the book so terrific. This is a definite must read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"No life is complete without Catcher.

There reasons are generally as follows. They either: Don't get it. Think it has no plot or are put off by the 'swearing'To those who say they don't get it, I ask, does the fact that your ignorance of the book's significant meaning mean that it is suddenly worthless? The book is read on a personal level. Rather chose not to review it because giving it one star just because you didn't see it's purpose is like a 12 year old critisising Chaucer.Those who dislike the book because it has no plot are even more ignorant than those who who don't understand it. Because, the only thing you are doing is saying that because there is no Steven King action or Wilbur Smith adventure or Tarantino twist that it is not worth it. For 'chrissake' Pride and Prejudice' has little plot either, are you saying that it is 1 star material too. Literature is not aboub thrilling polts of intrigue, it is about social comentary and art and the things that make us human. If you want a plot go and read Michael Criton's commercial stuff.And finally to those who lambast it for 'swearing'. I have heard worse language in Barney. Yes, there is blasphamy but it was justified in terms of the books actual meaning. Other than that the only word that might upset those who are so putritan is 'crap' and that should surely be cause a huge public outrage...please grow up.This book has touched me more than any other. Ignore the crits. read it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The story is completely narrated by the main character, Holden Caulfield, so there is very little, if any, conversation. Holden is a troubled teenager who has been kicked out of a private high school just before Christmas vacation. Like any teenager, he isn't eager to tell his parents that he's been kicked out of school. He's also getting very frustrated watching all the &quot;phonies&quot; in his dorm. But he's not expected home until Wednesday and it's Saturday. He decides to just leave school and spend a few days in New York City before going home. Holden takes you on a tour of New York City from the dark side of a person with little money and nothing to do. His outlook is very negative, but this is not surprising when you find out how nothing really goes his way. The story is told in a language diffirent from today's. His cut down remarks are &quot;phonies&quot; and describe their looks or actions as &quot;crumby&quot;. It takes a little getting used to. Holden can't seem to get a break from his friends, teachers, or his family. His older brother is a successful writer, but Holden thinks he's sold out because he works in Hollywood. His other brother died while young and you can tell it bothers him. I kept reading because I was curious what was meant by the title, The Catcher in the Rye, and was still a little confused, to tell you the truth, when it was explained."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book makes me want to be angry, sixteen and living in the 50's"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is the best book I have ever read.

I Think this book gives you feelings of death and insecurity. This guy is so stupid, because he thought his teacher was gay, when he only wanted to pretend he was his son. Also when he fought with Stradlater-his roommate-, if he was stronger, and he knew he was going to kick his butt, why did he fight with him?. I think that he is a spoiled child, because he called a prostitute and then he only talk with her.

Holden is such a cop-out and a bad example to readers of the book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"10 years ago I read this novel and hated it with a deep passion--dull and overrated. Recently, I decided to give it another chance and am I ever lucky that I did! I loved it! This is a painfully honest book. Superficially, not much happens. Assorted memories, thoughts, and strange encounters. Holden will both frustrate and fascinate readers. On one hand, he is brilliant and extremely perceptive. He's genuine in his desire to be a kind, good person and for people to treat each other with respect and dignity. On the other hand, Holden's views of life are completely distorted and idealistic. He is unhappy because he never allows himself to enjoy the moment fully for what it is. Even worse, Holden lets himself fall into depression and self-pity spontaneously and erratically. The fear is that he won't open his eyes and realize that he can't change the way that people are. He can only change his perspective of the world. Sometimes the most satisfying moments in life are the simplest ones."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"What a load of over-hyped rubbish.The main character seems to just have a problem with everything. I can't believe I read the whole book, I was waiting for it to get good then, all of a sudden, it was finished ! Some people need to wake up and smell the coffee and this guy's one of them."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I first read this book in high school about 11 or 12 years ago. It had a great reputation in my mind, for back then, in high school, I could identify with Holden Caulfield, someone who was isolated, a bit of an outcast, surrounded by &quot;phonies&quot;, and sensing his lack of independence. These things I too felt in high schoolNow, after graduating from college, I reread the book. The second time wasn't as exciting or enjoyable; this story definately lost its luster. I don't know if this was because I am older, more mature, and have had some life experiences or if was because I read more classics in college but I now feel that this Holden is a self-absorbed, disturbed, socially-maladjusted adolescent who is critical of everything and everyone, and hates his situation, yet can't seem to do anything about it except complain. I've met people like this in college; people who find fault with everyone they meet or middle-class brats who bitch and moan because not everything goes their way. They weren't pleasant people to be around.And I tire of Salinger's contrived writing style. Too many &quot;he really was&quot;, &quot;...no kidding&quot;, or &quot;...if you want to know the truth...&quot; It's like what Holden said about some of the performers that he saw - Salinger tries too hard to make the narrative sound like it was from a juvenile.The one part of the story I can still relate to though is when Holden tells Sally Hayes why they can run away now but not after they become adults and live a middle-class life. Being a youth does give you a certain sense of freedom that you lose when you hit the &quot;real world&quot; and have pressures and responsibilities to deal with.As a side project I think I'll list all the things that Holden hates."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"For those people who think Holden is shallow and believe this book is worthless: it is the exact opposite because Holden is so lovable for his genuine characteristics. He hates &quot;phonies&quot; because he simply wants to be true to himself. Personally, I can't stand it when people are so fake and superficial. Someone who believes that Holden is a jerk obviously has not tried to look at life on a deeper level--beyond the flaky surface of people...how people THINK they should act when what they are doing is much worse than communicating how you really feel. This book just hits the spot when expressing the frustrations of life during adolescence."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is one of a handful of great American novels of the 20th century that has the added virtue of being an easy read. Indeed, I read it in one sitting. Like Mark Twain, Salinger tells his tale from the ironic perspective of an adolescent narrator (Holden Caufield), whose voice Salinger captures with complete authenticity. The book is laugh-out-loud funny, far funnier than Huckleberry Finn (though this may be more a function of the modern reader's ability to relate to humor that is 50 rather than 150 years old).Salinger writes with economy of words and has a striking ability to get the reader emotionally involved in his story and characters. This book is particularly moving because we can all relate to the adolescent alienation of Holden. More importantly, we don't really have a good response to Holden's criticism of the phoniness of adult life and adult conformity. The criticisms are all true, of course, but we somehow find it necessary to make do as adults. Holden's melancholy about the passing of his youth and desire to savor and to save the purity of children (by acting as the \\"catcher in the rye\\" who keeps them from running off the cliffs of thier childhood) is very moving. The characters in the book are vivid and unforgettable, and one especially loves Holden's young sister, Phoebe.The rebelliousness of Holden is what I found most attractive about the book when I first read it for school years ago. But the sadness and humor of the book are what strike me most now.I'm not sure why this book gets only 4 stars. Even if you don't agree with giving it Great-American-Novel status, it is still thoroughly enjoyable and moving."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger published this reputed American classic in 1951, which was probably the most censored book in high schools and libraries until the mid 1980s. I'm not sure why it's considered a classic other than the fact that professors and publishers like looking for hidden meanings in each chapter. I'm not saying that I didn't like the novel, because I did enjoy it, but mainly because I think Salinger's descriptions and language usage of the late 1940s was terrific. I forgot about the word \\"crumby\\"- meaning inadequate, or \\"phony\\"- meaning pretentious. The narrator and protagonist of the novel, Holden Caulfield ( a seventeen year old boy ) uses these words a lot in his narration. And how about \\"flitty\\", or referring to people as \\"old\\" this or that? The writing in this novel is very strong, but the story is moderate at best to this reviewer. I don't see myself debating hidden meanings with anybody. I'm assuming it was censored in schools because of sexual allusions, the morality codes of the 1940s and 50s, family values and some coarse language ( very mild compared to today's language). The thing that puzzles me is the title of the book! Holden is walking through N.Y.C. and hears a little boy singing a song to himself. What's up with the title of the book? Shmoop states: \\"What's up indeed. The first mention we get of this mysterious catcher in this mysterious rye is when Holden overhears a little kid singing, \\"If a body catch a body coming through the rye.\\" Momentarily, it makes him feel not so depressed, in part because Holden is a fan of little children, and the only things better than little children are little children who are singing.\\" Apparently, Holden sees himself as the catcher in the rye catching the children as they fall off a cliff as he construed Robert Burns's 1796 poem. Who knows? Salinger was a kind of recluse and didn't give many interviews.The book starts off with Holden Caulfield ( our protagonist ) in a hospital in Southern California narrating the story of his previous December's adventures in Pennsylvania and N.Y.C. The reader doesn't know whether it's a mental or physical hospital. Maybe that is one of the debatable points of this book. Anyway, he is being expelled from Pencey Prep in Pennsylvania. The reader gets the feeling that this isn't the first school that he's been thrown out of. He doesn't seem to see why learning is important, doesn't get along with his teachers, or roommates, and doesn't seem to respect his very successful parents. And what does his \`red hunting hat' symbolize? He heads to N.Y.C. several days before his parents will receive the letter from Pencey Prep saying that he has been expelled. In N.Y.C., he books a cheap hotel and pines about his life. He likes to drink, smoke and make an ass of himself. He contacts previous girlfriend Sally, and makes a mess of things. He constantly thinks about calling another old flame Jane, but never does. He contacts his sister Phoebe, and an old teacher Mr. Antolini. The crux of the story is what happens on his adventures in N.Y.C, and the big debate with literary scrappers is : What's up with his mental health, and what does his movements mean? As far as this reader is concerned- who cares, just read and enjoy!I wonder after reading this book if this Holden Caulfield character is really J.D. Salinger as a young man. I had the same feeling when reading John Irving's 'In One Person'. Anyway, you literary debaters, I think if you re-read page 170 you will find out how Holden Caulfield really feels about school and life: \\"You ought to go to a boy's school sometime. Try it sometime,\\" I said. \\"It's full of phonies, and all you do is study so that you can learn enough to be smart enough to be able to buy a goddam Cadillac some day, and you have to keep making believe you give a damn if the football team loses, and all you do is talk about girls and liquor and sex all day, and everybody sticks together in these dirty little goddam cliques\\". Metaphorically speaking, I think Holden was literally drowning in boredom. Anyway, enough thoughts about Holden Caulfield's mental state that is being puppeteered by the cloistered J.D. Salinger! Just grab a copy and form your own opinions."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I just finished The Catcher in the Rye and sat down to write a review, and wondered what a review BY Holden Caulfield might look like. I mean, it's not a phony book. I hate phonies. They turn my stomach. I like to curl up in a chair with a good book. Why are people always saying that, I mean, what are we, cats? Have you ever seen anyone curl up in a chair or anywhere else? I gotta tell you I never have. I really haven't.This book, by J.D. Salinger, he captured exactly what I was thinking, it was kind of uncanny the way he did it. That's another thing I hate, the use of the word uncanny, I mean phonies use it all the time like it's some big deal. They really do.The best thing you can do is to read this book. It really is. It is the kind of book that you might not even like at first, sizing me up as a whiney little punk who could use a slap or two in the face to get me with the program. But the more you read, the more actual sympathy you feel towards me, or at least understanding of some kind, what I've gone through, I mean. Where I am coming from in terms of how life is affecting me at my young age. And you see that I am quite tenderhearted after all. I really am. I end up feeling sorry for people, and I help them whenever I can. There is even a scene where I kind of get suckered into hiring a prostitute, it just kinda happens, and when it comes right down to it, I find what we are about to do actually degrading, and I no longer want to go through with it.I recommend this book highly. You will be missing out on insight into the mind of youth if you skip this book. You really will. And there's nothing I can't stand worse than someone who is too phony to even read about me."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"As an undergraduate in the '60s I could barely get through CATCHER. I didn't care about some crude spoiled preppy kid who couldn't get his act together. In a word, I was clueless.I reread the book last fall and discovered something profound, that Holden was suffering from PTSD stemming from the death of his brother and from witnessing the suicide of a schoolmate who bailed out of a dorm window wearing the sweater Holden had loaned him. I began noticing the symptoms Holden was exhibiting: depression, poor concentration, attention deficit, crying, uncontrollable rage, lack of motivation, self-isolation, sleeplessness, etc. I'm intimately familiar with these symptoms because my own PTSD diagnosis stemming from childhood trauma. I get Holden's struggle. I live with that same feeling that I need to save kids from danger. I had to watch boys get horrific beatings in the orphanage where I spent the last nine years of my childhood. It's this compulsion to protect children that drives my writing.To me CATCHER is less about teenaged coming-of-age angst and more about a kid struggling against the downward spiral of mental illness. Without professional help he was doomed to submerge and did, ending up in a \\"rest home.\\"Holden was barely \\"holdin' on.\\"A greater sense of Holden Caufield/JD Salinger can be found in the film FINDING FORESTER, which is purported to be based on Salinger. In a 1953 interview with a high-school newspaper, Salinger said that the novel was \\"sort of\\" autobiographical: \\"My boyhood was very much the same as that of the boy in the book ...it was a great relief telling people about it.\\"Salinger, when writing CATCHER wouldn't have had a clue about PTSD, as it wasn't even in the diagnostic manual (DSM) for psychologists until decades later. He was just writing what he felt, blasting his feelings onto paper and letting the chips fall.Many people see Salinger as a sort of literary genius because he sold 70 million copies of one book. I'm not saying he wasn't talented and educated; he had plenty of both going for him. I'm saying he leveraged his talent on top of some inner need to get this desperate crisis part of his life onto paper and kept going until it was done.A great segment of the literary world has, quite understandably, interpreted Holden's PTSD symptoms as mere teenage angst. This is a gross oversimplification. It's his masterfully presented array of extreme symptoms that's largely responsible for the success of the book. It's too complicated, or too sensitive, for English teachers to talk about mental illness; so they focus on the simple and more obvious interpretation. Such teachers are missing a phenomenal opportunity to reach kids who are in crisis or know someone who is.We'd have fewer cases of teenagers going postal if CATCHER were used to teach about mental illness.I keep a copy of CATCHER in my backpack, with passages underlined, marked up, flagged, asterisked, annotated and cross-referenced. Holden is me and I am Holden, from opposite ends of the economic spectrum.BIRDBOY-1: Prince (BIRDBOY: STORIES FROM AN AMERICAN ORPHANAGE)"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Count me with those who came to this book late in life (my Catholic High School taught us \\"A Separate Peace\\" instead). I was hoping for something more.I would have loved to read a book that captured teenage angst and the dread of growing older and making compromises. But Holden just repeats the same thing incessantly: \\"They're all phony and depressing.\\" He doesn't in any way seem representative of what most teens go through. Rather, he just comes off as one very messed up kid. It feels more like an early picture of mental illness - of someone dealing with depression or OCD - than anything to do with the human condition. He then goes on to lie to virtually everyone, killing any of hope of the reader being able to sympathize with a main character who is so deceptive.As it became clear that nothing was going to happen plotwise, I hoped for at least some movement - some deeper understanding of Holden's situation. But all I got was: \\"They're all phony and depressing\\" - applied to virtually every situation. You do end up wanting to slap him and say, \\"Wake up!\\" I was hoping that someone would confront him, to make him take a hard look at himself, to have him learn >something&lt; but nothing changes. In truth, you could read the first third of the novel and get the whole picture.I wish I had spent the time reading something else."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Although the novel The Catcher in the Rye, by J.D Salinger, was first published in 1945, it is still very popular and interesting. In this book we meet, Holden Caulfield, the protagonist of the story. He is best described as a very judgmental and bitter person who is lost in life. He thinks that everything in life is just phony and fake. He wants to stay a kid and have fun instead of becoming more adult-like and facing the real hardships in life. Holden doesn't really like anyone, and he never takes anyone seriously except for his little sister Phoebe and his dead brother Allie. Phoebe Caulfield is not introduced until the middle of the book. She is very mature for a 10-year-old; she's even more mature than Holden. She listens to him and understands him unlike everyone else in the novel. Ackley and Stradlater are two guys who Holden knew from Pencey Prep. He describes them as mean and phony people. Mr. Antolini is Holden's old English teacher at one of his other schools. He is someone who Holden actually likes. Mr. Antolini is a very intelligent person who tries to help Holden in life. The main conflict in this novel is internal. Holden is his own enemy. He fights with himself on what to do in life. He doesn't have a goal or plan that he can attempt pursue. A significant event that makes up the rising action is when Holden decided to leave Pencey Prep early because it is the last good-bye. It symbolizes that Holden is now on his own without a plan of what he is going to do. He is just going to take it day by day. Another significant even is when Holden decides to stay at the Edmont Hotel because it marks the beginning of Holden journey and adventure.Overall I liked The Catcher in the Rye. It really caught my attention and made me want to keep reading. I liked that I had to keep guessing throughout the book. I never knew what Holden was going to do next. For instance, I would've never guessed that Holden would get emotional before leaving Pencey. I also liked the love that Holden had for his dead brother Allie. For example, when Stradlater told Holden to do his assignment, Holden wrote about Allie's baseball glove. Finally, I dislike Holden's personality and behavior. I don't like when he lies or criticizes and judges someone. I didn't like when he lied to Ernest Morrow's mother. I would recommend this book because it is very interesting and surprising. You never know what's going to happen next."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is one of the few books where the negative reviews actually make me appreciate the book more. The people who take issue with Holden's anger at the phonies and say he has a misguided distrust of society are the very people he was talking about. In a way such reviews only seem to validate how hard it is for teenagers to make the transition to adulthood. I myself am very misanthropic so I could relate to Holden though I too have taken slack for my general nihilism and ennui. I know Holden would kick me for using those two words!There are few other books written where you really feel like you are in someone's head and they are telling you their thoughts unfiltered. In other words JD Salinger did a masterful job of disappearing as the author and letting Holden take center stage. Catcher in the Rye is a true masterwork example of showing and not telling. I find myself quoting this book all the time my favorite line is \\"Sleep tight ya morons!\\" If you've ever wanted to yell that in a crowded room than this may be a book you enjoy. I get something new out of it every time I reread it. It's still unrivaled as the ultimate angsty teen novel."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had never read any of Salinger's stuff and liked this quite a bit. Very smart and still relevant 60 years after it was written. The birth of the anti-hero in modern lit?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This may be the most stimulating book I've ever read. So much so, in fact, that it has inspired me to delve into other classic novels.There were a number of things that glued me to my seat when I was reading it, and when I was away from the book (at work, etc.) kept me thinking about the book. Among them:-His unparalleled use of vivid description-The addictive \\"stream of consciousness\\" style of writing-His relentless general disgust with the \\"phony\\"-ness of most of humanity-The way he makes a seamless connection between and/or segues into two usually completely unrelated things-The way he's able to draw so many thoughts out of what is really a small amount of time (I believe the story takes place in 2-3 days total)But there are things that fascinate me in ways I can't truly describe. Such as:-I still can't decide if I like Holden (the protaganist)-How at it's root, it's a very simple story, but the thought provocation is anything but-How the plot is anything but linear or predictable, including the ending. For example--****SPOILER ALERT*** Whatever happens to Jane Gallager? You keep thinking something is there... that he might call... and yet never does... It's almost tragic, in a way ****END SPOILER****Finally, and most importantly, this book has gotten into my head more than any other. In the days during and after I read it I found myself talking, even e-mailing in Holden Caufield's style, using certain words, even sharing some of his outlook on life. It's kind of scary, when you think about it. But it certainly is an unforgettable journey of the mind in ways that you can't imagine until you've read it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"JD Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, known most famously in the hands of John Lennon's murderer, holds a paradoxical message. The story fully embodies the concept of a coming of age novel. The characterization, setting and writing style all further the theme of preservation of innocence. The Catcher in the Rye is a must read for every individual who finds themselves in a corrupt, phony world.The Catcher in the Rye is set in 1950's New York City, covering the few days proceeding Holden Caulfield's flunking out of Pencey Prep. Holden's personal history is relayed throughout the novel. His past appears scarred and his psyche damaged by various events both within and out of his control. The most significant of these events is his thirteen year old brother, Allie's death. Throughout the story, Holden keeps this brother's baseball mitt; a symbol of lost youth.Many characters appear in The Catcher in the Rye. Holden seems to analyze each individual with more than a little distortion. The only characters free of his hypercriticism are children. In fact, every time Holden sees an innocent, happy child, Holden claims to feel, \\"less depressed.\\" This exposes Holden's desire for innocence and his loathing of the adult world. Two characters truly realize this notion namely, Phoebe and Allie, Holden's younger sister and brother. Holden seems to love these two above any in his life. He greaves Allie and he claims Phoebe is the only person in the world with whom he perpetually yearns to speak. His relationship with every character further distinguishes his drive for innocence.The novel's setting additionally relates to the theme. Several places secure symbolic importance to Holden. The first of these revealed is the Central Park Lagoon. Holden ponders the effects of winter. He wonders if the ducks migrate when the lagoon freezes. Symbolically, this mirrors Holden's life. As external factors in his life change, he must choose whether to stay or to \\"migrate\\" himself, running from the problem.The second symbolic place for Holden, is the Museum of Natural History. Holden explains the exhibits in the museum. He notices with a hint of sadness, how those pieces never change, unlike himself, as he claims to feel altered every time. Here, Holden again explores his growing and maturing as a regrettable happening drawing him from innocence.The third place discussed, is Holden's old elementary school. When he attended classes there, he felt sheltered and innocent. He holds the image of this school as walls of protection surrounding the children attending. Thus it follows, Holden is enraged by profanity written on the walls of the building. He is so hurt that the corruption of the world has managed to slip into the school, he takes time to clear the words from the wall. This action is his symbolic atoning for his sins. He wishes to \\"clean\\" himself from his corrupt maturity.Salinger's writing style is far from conventional. He uses profanity throughout the novel to clarify his points. In addition, the use of vulgar language acts as Holden's personal proof of maturity. This is another symbol of Holden's fear of maturity. He faces growing with harsh words, superficies covering his desire to stay a child forever.The Catcher in the Rye is so named for a motif in the novel. The Robert Burn's song \\"Comin' Thro the Rye\\" reappears several times for Holden. The correct lyrics read, \\"...if a body meet a body coming through the rye\\" but Holden has distorted (once again) the lyrics to read, \\"if a body catch a body coming through the rye.\\" This line reflects his great sorrow of losing his brother, as he replaces \\"meet\\" with \\"catch,\\" the symbol of his brother's catcher's mitt. It also forms Holden's stated life goal. \\". . . I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff--I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I'd do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all.\\""},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book was so funny. The humor was wonderful.

No other author can capture synicism in quite the same way. Nobody else has had the audasity to question the way the world lives their lives and why (re:the constant use of the word, 'phonies').

It's a masterpiece of this century, and will never be matched. -Edgar Goatcabin"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield reminds me of myself. He has his own opinion on everything. J.D. Salinger really gets in touch with the life of a struggling adolescent.

Holden Caulfield isn't exactly like everybody else and that is what makes this book so interesting."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"When I first began reading this book, I didn't understand Holden's viewpoint or why he said and did the things he did. About midway through the book, I discussed it with my one of my male friends, who informed me that to truly understand where he was coming from, it helped to be male, but that it might help to try and read it from the male perspective. Suddenly, everything guys had ever done that didn't make sense started to make sense. My advice to girls who read it and are puzzled: Try reading it from a male viewpoint. All the things that teen boys do will cease to be completely irrational."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is absolutely amazing. I've never laughed so much in my entire life. It is a wonderful satire of modern society and the participants that make it up."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book not knowing anything at all about it, only that it had an infamous reputation. As I was reading it I related to Holden, which worried me as I knew that this book has been an 'inspiration' for serial killers! Some of his insights were spot on the mark, and I thought I was was some sort of weirdo for appreciating them!I carried on reading with a sense of impending doom as I thought something was going to hurt Holden, or Holden was going to hurt somebody, which didnt happen. Just shows you what a bit of commotion can do, sometimes its not as bad as first thought once you judge it for yourself.A wonderful book full of emotion, which I am glad I have read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Oooh, if Holden Caulfield could hear all these people calling this book a &quot;masterpiece&quot; or a &quot;classic,&quot; he'd puke. The book is still very fresh after all these years, and awfully funny. After rereading it recently, I realized how many of our good writers of the past twenty years, people like Raymond Carver, Don Delillo, Lorrie Moore, Thom Jones, and Gish Jen, owe a debt to J.D. Salinger. I also realized how sweet he is, Holden Caulfield, and how lonely. He breaks my heart. What do you imagine becomes of him? He won't be happy, will he?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Salinger's novel, &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; is on the one hand, an exceptionally simple novel, on the other, more complex than many others like it because it deals with the human mind. Its simplicity begins in its storyline - Holden Caulfield, a well-off teenager from new York has been expelled from his fourth boarding school because he has failed in class. Following a fight with a schoolfriend, Holden wanders out into New York and the reader is permitted to see new York through Holden's eyes, as he verges on a nervous breakdown. The story is disjointed, rambling and fascinating. Holden's mind switches form one train of thought to the other regulary. It is also an extremely honest book - Holden is honest about what he does and why he does them. The book should be read by anyone with an interest in the human mind and its workings."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"&quot;Catcher in the rye&quot; is one of my favorite books. One of the reasons is because it is &quot;descriptive as hell&quot; (If you read it you would understand the meaning of my title..)

This is typical Salinger in the fact that a child holds the spotlight or the key to how the story will evolve. There are those who do not like this book for its elementary dialogue, but I only think that it helps serve its point... we are talking about the views from the teenage Holden after all. The complexity of Holden is marvelous to read. An easily relatable work to most teenagers, I must say that this is one of my top three favorite books of all time. (If you like Holden and the way he acts, try Nine Stories, also by Salinger... Nine different stories that are very interesting in the details given and left out... something to really sink your teeth into.)"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Finally I've read this book and I've come to the conclusion I should've done that years ago. Holden Caulfield would have been my personal guide through puberty. You can read all the important stuff about how well written, how modern, how provocative, how funny this book is in the reviews above mine. And that's all true but... I think:the really important stuff about this book is that it holds a dark secret. And it's this secret that has brought this book up to the level it's on nowadays. It lies in the very beautiful, tender, recognizable, intelligent way Salinger makes you look into this boy's head. Salinger makes you weep about this boy and because Holden in a way stands for all intelligent boys alive, he makes you weep about yourself. And that's the most important thing a book van make you do. Holden Caulfield is the King and Phoebe is great too."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"&quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;You either hate this book, or love it.

This book is the best-book ever. I think J.D Salinger wrote this book in a very unusall and special way, it sure is a classic. Holden Caulfield, who has just been expelled, and the book is about a few days in this 16 yr old boys life.Read it! You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Was it just a Mel Gibson movie that has reawakened America's interest in Holden Caulfield? Or, are young people once again looking for an explanation of why people say one thing and do another, or why some people have normal thoughts and others seem to never find one. Or why adolescence is so often divorced from the wholesomeness and simple trust many of us were lucky to experience as small children, as protected and loved children.This is a perennial classic. Holden will always haunt us and we will always remember the pangs of a shared bewilderment and anger that things really do change and life is definitely not what it seemed before we grew.I hope another author, similar to Salinger in his spare and economical style, Jerry Furland, (&quot;Transfer-the end of the beginning&quot;) will be experienced by the high school set. Oddly, if Furland's gem of a novel is accurate, there will scarcely be time for it to become a classic. Given time however, I think it will be."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye is a great book. It is true-to-life and fun to read.

True, the book is about a couple of days in a sixteen-year-old's life, but there is a point, a reason in which Holden Caulfield explains about those particular days of his life. There is a process of alienation which occurs throughout the book and finally comes to a hidden conclusion at the end of the book, which results in having to read the last chapter very carefully to find out about Holden's whereabouts at that point. I had to read the last chapter three times before I finally understood where he really was and why he didn't give details in that chapter. All in all, this is a fantastic book about alienation and adaptation only for those who truly understand it, and for those who don't understand the meaning, it is a funny story about a cynical teenager's life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"OK, so it may not be the deepest reflection on life, nor a profound search for the human soul. And neither is it written in an elaborate fashion nor exploring new ways for literary expression. But I would be shocked to meet someone, at least a XX century, not extremely poor, male, who wouldn't identify with Holden at least in some passages. Most of us went to some phase in our lifes which we can relate to his. Certainly not the typical &quot;coming of age&quot; story, this book has a very well-known plot:Holden Caulfield, a rich kid from Upper East Side, is expelled yet again from a preppy private school. It's Saturday, but Christmas vacation begins next Wednesday. So Holden takes off from school and goes to live to a hotel in NY. He hires a prostitute, drinks himself to unconscience, wanders around town, dates a girlfriend, and remembers his life.So what's the fuss aboout a few days in the life of a spoiled adolescent facing life and getting confused and depressed? Of course, it's the character. The character is the most accurate method to measure a novel's quality. Plot and wording may be good: if the character is not attractive, the novel bombs. At least as a pleasure. Caulfield is smart, sensitive and down-to-earth. His love for his young sister Phoebe is tender but never corny.The novel is hilarious because Holden is a very cool master of political incorrectness, an angry young man perfectly conscious of the phony characteristics of the game we all play. Something that surprised me a lot, not being an American nor a native English-speaker, is the amazing resemblance of 50's kid-speach with their 90's counterparts. The novel can be read like it was written last year, for Chrissake, with those annoying commonplaces, and all. No wonder it's still very much read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A lot of reviews have been written about this book so I won't go into too much detail.I can say that there are probably 10 books in my whole life that I would the acclaimed \\"5 star treatment\\".

Brilliant in portions, contrived in some, this book does well to bring out the confused thought processes of an errant disillusioned teenager, and his love for his sister. The character development is too contrived in some parts, and very subtle and beautiful on some occasions. It would've been a masterpiece if the author hadn't gone out of his way to eulogise the protagonist's character, sometimes unduly, to forcefully justify his disillusionment."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"for stealing your book * that's why I sent it back * I thought you were the one..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher In The Rye was a very good book.
