Hopefully this is the only book i'll be disappointed with in her catalog."},{"Title":"To Please a Lady","review":"I've read almost all of Susan Johnson's book and To Please a Lady a very disappointing read. So's A Touch of Sin. The writer didn't seem to put a lot of thought in these 2 books. All i can say is don't waste your money. Ms Johnson didn't seem to care when she was writing these books. It is so unfair to the readers."},{"Title":"To Please a Lady","review":"This is the first book by Susan Johnson that I have read and I must say I was not impressed. The history lesson was good but I struggled to finish the story. The main characters were likeable but I was never convinced that them ending up together would be a good thing. I had a very hard time buying into the whole storyline."},{"Title":"To Please a Lady","review":"I used to buy Susan Johnson's books the moment they were published but not anymore. I wish I'd read some of the reviews before I shelled out my money.Here's my advice: Don't bother with this book if you're looking for an interesting hero, worthy of a strong heroine's love - the hero is an 18 year old Scottish Donald Trump (the Donald's money AND attitude toward women!). Don't bother with this book if you like to read stories where the main characters actually spend time together - they spend as much time apart as together with just a few love scenes. And please don't bother with this book if you enjoyed Ms. Johnson's sexy love scenes from Sinful, Wicked, or Blaze - you won't find enough here to make it worth reading. I suggest you re-read Sinful for the best of Ms. Johnson."},{"Title":"To Please a Lady","review":"Terrible. What has happened to Susan Johnson? This book and Touch of Sin have been simply awful. I am saddened that a tree had to die to print this book. The plot completely unbelievable, and the characters whiney. Don't waste your money and buy these two books."},{"Title":"To Please a Lady","review":"I have read every Susan Johnson book there is to read. She is one of my favorite authors. Unfourtunately, this book is not her very best, but I would say it is very good. If you read &quot;Outlaw&quot;, then you will remember Johnnie's brother Robbie from that book. I liked the story and the character of Roxanne, I wish there would have been more of a story between Robbie and Roxanne. Ms. Johnson is known for her great and erotic love scenes, and I wish there were more in this book! This is definitely a step up from the last two books she wrote. I wish she would get back to the style with which she wrote &quot;Sinful &amp; Wicked! I would recommend this book, though not her best work in my opinon, it ranks high enough for me to be a keeper!"},{"Title":"To Please a Lady","review":"This is supposed to be a romance novel, but there is so little romance in it. I guess this book belongs in a series and all the interesting things happened before this book started. I missed seeing the heroes falling in love. I had a feeling I was dropped in the middle of the story without knowing what happened and who is who. Well, after I sorted out who is who, I t got worse. OMG. The hero is a 18 year old whelp who thinks he is invincible and immortal and can do no wrong. Come on! Well, I know that back then people grew up earlier, but anyway. And the heroine was at least 10 years older then the hero. I might be stereotypical, but I really didn't like it. And she had far too much baggage. Five children??? Come on! Wouldn't two or three be enough? And two ex-husbands? Is there anything more you can find? It was simply too much. An as if that wasn't enough the heroine couldn't decide what she wanted. She loved him one moment, hated the next, accepted one moment, rejected the next. Made him beg again and again and again. It's OK if the hero has to grovel a bit, but not so much that he doesn't have any dignity left! Especially if he didn't really do anything wrong. The heroine simply blamed him for all the troubles and made him a scape-goat for all her mistakes and misfortunes. I don't know what they saw in each other. Except for sex. I do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"To Please a Lady","review":"I enjoyed this book and while I might agree that this is not Johnson's best work it was still very entertaining. I personally like the reverse May-December romance ( maybe because I'm the December end) and I think that strengthens the minority opinion that Mature women can indeed still hold an enormous sex appeal. Reading this book has spurred me on to order OUTLAW to get more of the history of these very intriguing characters."},{"Title":"To Please a Lady","review":"Susan Johnson does very lusty novels and that is part of her appeal. However, this book along with her previous book was thin on plot. The female heroine wasn't very appealing with all of her doubts about the hero. The best part was the footnotes."},{"Title":"To Please a Lady","review":"I started reading this on a Thursday and finished it on a Saturday. Once again Ms. Johnson has created a romance reader's dream. The story line is full of intrigue and adventure. There are moments of humor and plenty of love and sex. The main characters, Roxane and Robbie, are in love BUT are fighting an uphill battle as they deal with the turmoil surrounding Scotland's bid to not be governed by England. Of course, Ms. Johnson inlcudes footnotes, granting us a very acute BUT easy to handle amount of Scottish history. I recommend this book BUT do not paint it as her best. The tension between the characters at times was tedious...too much petty jealousy BUT in the end they do end up happy...which was well worth the effort to finish this book. I am a big fan of Ms. Johnson and encourage romance lovers to pick up a copy of this book."},{"Title":"To Please a Lady","review":"Sure, Robbie is only 18,but this is not a contemporary setting. I don't know why everyone is making such a big deal of this...I haven't been reading romance very long but it seems that in many historical romances the woman is much younger than the man. So the positions are reversed here. He is not an 18 year old of today either. He is very powerful and very wealthy. I liked the conversation too..a lot was very humorous. Haven't read Susan Johnson before so I can't say if this is better or worse than her others. I found it enjoyable with just a few questions. What's with all the footnotes? Do I really care about detail here? I didn't check any of them. It's a romance novel. This is all in fun..nothing serious about it. Also, some of the conversation was questionable. Did they really use those words back then? I don't really care. I liked it and found it very entertaining!!"},{"Title":"To Please a Lady","review":"In 1705, the outlawed Earl of Greenlaw returns from Holland to Edinburgh. Robbie Carre plans to claim the decade-plus older Countess of Kilmarnok as his and to reclaim the estate stolen from him. Roxane Forrester has survived marriages, childbirth, politics, and the machinations of Scotland-s most powerful individuals. Yet the thirty- plus-year-old beauty cannot resist the charming Robbie whom she watched grow from boy to man.Robbie's enemies will use anyone as bait to capture the insolent lad. The Duke of Queensbury thinks Roxane is the perfect lure to capture Robbie. To gain her cooperation, he will use her beloved children as blackmailing tool. To protect her children (including Robbie) even from her deceased husband's family, Roxane turns away from her lover to another powerful noble. However, she failed to factor in the fact that Robbie's love for her will impel him to risk everything to gain Roxane by his side.TO PLEASE A LADY is a daring, unique and well-written story that will please many of the author's fans, but shock others. Roxane is a wonderful character whose bravery seems inspiring. Robbie was a charmer in his previous appearance. However, in this novel, he seems more like a recalcitrant teenager than a loving hero, which in turn hurts the romance between him and his older beloved. The secondary cast adds a feel of intrigue with their plots, counterplots, and double crossing. Susan Johnson heats up Scotland with this fast-paced historical romance."},{"Title":"To Please a Lady","review":"The only reason not 5 stars is Robbies age. Since I have boys this young I have a problem -even knowing that times were different that Robbie only 18 could have been quite the man of the world, nor had so many sexual experiences. He was written to seem older, naturally so his exploits were believable to a reader, but not when I thought about it rationally. Baring that - I truly thought this was one of Johnson's better more complete love stories. Although I like her sex scenes that are hot and heavy, this book seemed to rely more on a truly intense, long term depth of caring. Roxanne had loved only once before in her life - her first husband that she had 5 children by. She was a very independent woman, and Robbie was a very commanding presence in her life. She fought this commanding way of his, but in the end it was really the kind of man she needed and wanted. He fought hard for her. I do not understand those that felt he acted immaturely - he may have been young but I thought he acted quite honorably. Actually at times it seemed that Roxanne was more the rouge - she seemed to have quite a sexual past as well - and I did not always understand why she kept throwing Robbies in his face. The political intrigue while a backdrop to the love story was interesting, for me it was just a backdrop. It was much more exciting watching the Carre brothers in action - and to see Robbie fight for the love of his young life. I really think this is a great Susan Johnson book and would be a must buy for a Johnson lover - also to follow up on the Outlaw book - which was in itself a true 5 star read!"},{"Title":"To Please a Lady","review":"I am a avid reader of all historical romances. I must say that I have found no other author who can touch a heart and soul like Susan Johnson. This book is one of my favorites...a sequal...

Susan Johnson has not lost her touch she is a wonderful Romance Writer and keeps me enthralled, I'm anxiously awaiting her next book in summer of 2000. She has not disappointed me with any of her novels. I recommend any of her novels to anyone who wants to read a book you just can't put down."},{"Title":"To Please a Lady","review":"Just a few comments on the book and the other reviews of thebook:While this book isn't the best of Susan Johnson's, and thestoryline could be improved, I still enjoyed reading it.While I thought the age of 18 years old for the man was abit silly (25 years would have been more acceptable) a manof 18 years a couple centuries ago wasn't a child (unlikethe 18 year old weaklings of this pampered lazy generation)he was a man, strong and tough, life was hard in the past,people worked hard and people grew up pretty fast back then.I suppose if a story was about a woman with five kids whogot involved with a man 20 years *older* than her (yech!)that would be acceptable? (yech!) I would prefer youth,stamina and virility in a man rather than old age.I guess a woman with 5 children isn't supposed to have asex drive or enjoy pleasure, much less even have a sex life?Society still doesn't accept that women can have a strongsex drive and enjoy their lifes even after they become amother or after they reach a certain age perhaps?!?And by the way, I don't think the reader from Colorado evenread the book.... or perhaps she is dyslexic??The 18 year old man was panting after and chasing and pursuingthe older woman, *not* the other way around. The woman in thebook is a beautiful woman with several powerful men who arefighting and vying for her attention, hardly some desperatewoman chasing a young man, she was resisting his advancesactually.Personally, I enjoyed the fantasy of a woman who had severalchoices of men who were all lusting after and fighting overher and who enjoys a sex life with a man younger than her.Must we be such prudes or so incest phobic that we can'teven enjoy a fantasy about sex with a handsome younger man?!?Quite sad, if even ones fantasies have to be sexually repressed!"},{"Title":"To Please a Lady","review":"I have always loved Susan Johnson's books too, but this one is a real bummer. I guess it's a sequel to something I've read, but after reading 69 pages that seemed to start in the middle of a story, I'm not even interested in finding the earlier book. Who cares about an older woman with five children panting after an 18-year old kid. Come on, Susan, get back to Blaze-type writing, please."},{"Title":"To Please a Lady","review":"I wish I had seen some of the later reviews before I picked this book up. Definitely, NOT one of Ms. Johnson's best efforts. Where was the plot? The character building? The descriptive narrative? The building of sexual tension? She did her usual historical homework, but even that seemed contrived to me. It seemed as if she had to keep up with her previous books by putting in endnotes, so let's find some information that might fit the time period. If they shrunk the typesetting and moved the margins outward, where her previous books were printed, I don't think this story would fill 175 pages. When I finished the book, I couldn't believe that was it, where was the rest of it? Argyll gave up way to easily, even if he was greedy. What of Queensbury? He just disappeared. Sometimes I had trouble believing that Robbie was actually 18. At other times he was the epitome of the horny 18 year old. Unfortunately, he was very difficult to take seriously. I won't even try to get into Roxy's character, or what little there was beyond craving Robbie's body. Please Ms. Johnson, I know you are capable of so much better than this. Quality over quantity will guarantee my loyalty as a reader every time"},{"Title":"To Please a Lady","review":"Susan Johnston is known for juicy and erotic love scences and all of that was missing in this book,after this I don't think I will be buying anymore of her books.First the hero is an eighteen year old who has basically lived a full life,he is in my opinion infactuated with a twice widowed mother of 5 and soon to be twins with the hero.the lovemaking in the book is very tame compare to her other novels,she has another one due out next year if I do get it I would rather saved myself the money by getting the book from the library."},{"Title":"To Please a Lady","review":"This one is for all your prudes who complain about excessive sex in Susan Johnson novels. This one, I will personally vouchsafe, is impeccably clean. I did not quite get what the danger in the book was all about , because Roxanne had to be shut up in some house in the beginning for a very long time. Robbie is more of a whining teenage boy, if that's the type of lover you prefer. Also, Roxanne has kids, which kind of diminished the exciting factor of romance novels. The lead antagonist is Argyll who lusts for Roxanne, but he gets vanished after a few chapters, though it would have been nice if he reappeared to show some consistency. Too clean and too boring"},{"Title":"To Please a Lady","review":"This is the worst of SJ book I have ever read. First of all Robbie Carr is too young, at 18 and spoil, selfish and acts like a child all the time, doesn't constitue what a man should be like. Sorry readers but I enjoy romance and love hot steamy sex but this book lacks everything. The only reason I finish this book was because I spend money on it and also I wanted to know more about Elizabeth and Johnnie(Outlaw). If I had to suggest a book it would be Outlaw and that readers you will get your money worth"},{"Title":"To Please a Lady","review":"Not Johnson's best effort--each new book by her is more disappointing than the last and this latest offering doesn't even have as much of the erotic scenes Johnson is noted for--at the very least her books her a sizzling 'forget about the plot just look up the naughty scenes!' diversion. At the very best, they are a blend of outrageous adventure, historical detail, and (usually forbidden) passion.WARNING: This book was neither of those things!It was okay. That's all. Just Okay. Not 'wow' or 'great' or even 'good'. The banter was funny. But if I wanted a funny book I could think of a dozen authors I'd pick before Johnson.The heroine is sassy and saavy as well she should be...she's a real woman, thirtysomething without a regret--not one of your virgin turned temptress maidens that you usually find in historicals. She is in lust with life and men. Unfortuately the hero is so...well, he's so young. Eighteen? What was the author thinking? Couldn't he at least be in this twenties? Even that is sometimes too young for me to imagine for a historical hero.They weren't a good match. He doesn't act like any eighteen year old I know. And even then, his 18 turned 30 persona was just too unsettling for me. Not exactly what I'd call a romantic fantasy. Johnson's heroes run the gammut--the only thing they tend to have in common is their prowess in bed. However, lately, most of her heroes have been too whiny and immature for me. Selfish. Macho. Misogynistic even. Womanizing. Maybe even a little whorish. Her heroines are great fun to read (except for that one with Trixie--I forget the name of the book but it was awful--even worse than this novel) but she must do something about her heroes! Here's a hint, Ms. Johnson: how about letting them grow up first! Save the cradle robbing for another genre."},{"Title":"To Please a Lady","review":"After reading Susan Johnson's novel, A Touch of Sin, I rushed to find and read her other books. I've read her entire library and enjoyed every title. I was really looking forward to her new novel, To Please A Lady. I'm sorry to say that I was very disappointed in this book! It seems that Ms. Johnson has not put the effort into this novel that she has put into the others - as I was reading I wondered if the book was written to fufill a contract. Ms. Johnson's other novels were full of historical detail, great characters, and incredibly erotic love scenes. This books seems to be missing all of those! I never really liked the hero, and the heroine was the sterotypical romantic leading lady and not the strong woman that Ms. Johnson usually writes. The best part of the book was the prequel to Ms. Johnson's next, unnamed novel. Come back Susan, we miss you!"},{"Title":"To Please a Lady","review":"The two main characters in this book already knew each other when it wtarted. There were references made to their past together and how he had seduced her before (it was in her previous books). So, basically, they were already in love when the book started. We don't even get to enjoy their falling in love. I normally love her books, but this one fell short of what I have come to expect from Ms. Johnson."},{"Title":"To Please a Lady","review":"I'm confused about what's happend to Susan Johnson over the last few years. A couple of years ago, I would have called her my favorite author. I eagerly awaited each new release and bought her books the minute they hit the store shelves. But the last three or four books (or maybe even more) have all been lacking the quality to which her readers had become accustomned.Characterizations are flat -- and maddeningly similar to those we've seen before. (Including many instances of word-for-word dialogue repeated in each of her last few books.) Plotlines are weak -- and she seems to have much more interest in educating her readers as to the actual historical events taking place within the stories than in creating dynamic hoops for her characters to jump through.As always, the footnotes are fascinating, but all this attention to historical detail -- with a corresponding lack of attention paid to character and plot -- makes me wonder if Susan Johnson wouldn't be happier writing non-fiction. Maybe if she got that off her chest, she'd be ready to once again write the quality romances of which we know she is capable."},{"Title":"To Please a Lady","review":"I honestly dont know where to start with this book. I guess for starters, I dont see the huge age gap between Roxie and Robbie sexy in the least. The whole book, I was trying to imagine Robbie as being older and Roxie as being younger. But the biggest thing for me was the yo-yo romance. Up one minute down the next. Very tiring! The only reason I finished was because I cant stand not finishing a book I start. I DO NOT reccomend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"To Please a Lady","review":"Clearly Susan Johnson has lost some of her earlier creativity. This book doesn't measure up to her others at all.

Davina Kotulski's helpful primer on gay marriage hit the press prior to the revolution breaking out in San Francisco (her native city) and Portland (ours). But though recent events will be missing from her primary arguments, the absence will in no way invalidate her message: Gays and lesbians deserve full equality now.Kotulski wrote Why You Should Give a Damn about Gay Marriage for three groups of people: the committed (who are, as I write this, marching bravely to the altar), the straight but not narrow (best wishes, Ms. Linn and Co.) and those queers, such as myself, who have long looked disdainfully upon gay marriage as a plot to domesticate our uniqueness. Although I have lingering fears that this part of our struggle for rights might propel Bush and the Paleolithic evangelicals back into power, Kotulski (along with a few wedding receptions last week) has convinced me that this is a cause worth fighting for.Kotulski rigorously marshals her facts both to promote a wider definition of marriage and to respond to many of society's fears (all of which are either baseless or born of ignorance). Her case begins with rights: \\"There are more than 1,049 federal rights that accompany civil marriage, and some additional 300 per state.\\" These are rights that cover medical emergencies, taxes, insurance, inheritance, burial decisions and such trivialities as frequent-flier programs. Even the right not to testify against one's spouse is denied queers, as Rosie O'Donnell and her now-wife Kelli bitterly discovered in recent legal battles.Kotulski emphasizes each of the legal problems that queers face with traumatic stories from real people who were left without recourse when partners were severely injured or killed, such as that of a homophobic father actually carrying his son's body off for a funeral that would exclude his son's long-term partner. This litany of abuse should put the lie to the idea that what we are demanding is \\"special rights.\\" Still, never underestimate the viciousness of the severely religious.\\"What do a serial rapist, a murderer, a child pornographer, a lifer, and an armed bank robber share in common?\\" asks Kotulski. \\"As long as they are heterosexual, they can all get married in prison.\\" Kotulski has much to say about the \\"sacredness\\" of heterosexual marriage; after all, \\"gay people did not invent the term wife-swapping.\\"It's depressing that in the 21st century, and in what is purportedly a secular country, that we are forced to entertain the views of an opiated mass of Baptists, brandishing the storybook of their sky god as if such ravings had relevance in rational discourse. Yet we must. Marriage is for procreation? \\"What about a man who wants to marry a post-menopausal woman?\\" asks Kotulski, or \\"a woman who marries a man with a vasectomy? Should these marriages be annulled?\\" There are also the fatuous Christian claims that gay marriage will pry open the lock on incest and polygamy, though the former is excoriated in the Bible unless it's between fathers and daughters, and the latter was practiced quite freely by David and Abraham, two of Jehovah's favorites. The \\"saved\\" should try and save themselves.Kotulski ends by supplying helpful outlines of letters to send our elected officials on the subject of marriage as well as an international guide to where in the world civilized minds have triumphed. \\"Gay marriage is gay liberation,\\" Kotulski stresses. Her book proves that it's also a victory for human rights. I see that now."},{"Title":"Why You Should Give A Damn About Gay Marriage","review":"This book is a quick and informative read, but if you are interested in justice and equality for all in the US, it will likely make you very angry. I already knew much of the information here, but having it all in one handy reference book is invaluable. The issue of gay marriage is crucial because of the far-reaching implications of denying equal rights to a minority of citizens. Please - read this book, keep it handy, and share it as widely as you can."},{"Title":"Why You Should Give A Damn About Gay Marriage","review":"True to its cover description: &quot;a quick-witted, common sense handbook addressing the absurdities embedded in arguments against marriage equality, as well as in separate-but-equal 'marriage lite' options such as domestic partnerships.&quot; It will make you laugh. It will make you mad. Recommended for anyone sitting on the fence, and includes tips on how to get involved."},{"Title":"Why You Should Give A Damn About Gay Marriage","review":"The intricate system of laws that protects heterosexual privilege while denying lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered (LGBT) persons the responsibilities, privileges, and benefits of civil marriage is another form of segregation - but made all the more insidious by its apparent invisibility. In her new book, Dr. Davina Kotulski, Ph.D., attempts to persuade us why civil marriage equality is an issue we should all, \\"give a damn about.\\" This task would challenge any writer, given the immense scope of the subject and the skepticism with which this issue is still met by many well-meaning LGBT activists -- it is one thing to say \\"1,349 rights, benefits, and protections\\" but another entirely more daunting task to list and describe them while also developing a cohesive argument.Fortunately, Dr. Kotulski begins with the most important point of all. Second-class citizenship demeans our integrity; it assaults the liberty guaranteed us by the U.S. Constitution -- and the U.S. Supreme Court, it would seem, now agrees with us (just read the fine print of the Lawrence v. Texas ruling). In Dr. Kotulski's words, \\"The language of love has power, and we have been given a very slim piece of the pie and asked to stay in our corner of the room and eat it quietly ... we live a half-existence compared to our heterosexual friends.\\"Dr. Kotulski is at her best when arguing that \\"Marriage Lite\\" (domestic partnerships, civil unions, reciprocal beneficiaries, etc.) is LGBT \\"Fool's Gold\\". These legal arrangements are only valid in their native states and most of the responsibilities, privileges, and benefits to which we have been denied access are enshrined in FEDERAL marriage, tax, social security, and inheritance laws anyway (for this reason, incidentally, the argument presented by many of our so-called political allies that this is a \\"states' rights\\" issue is a deceptive way of avoiding taking a position at all). And didn't the U.S. Supreme Court already determine in 1954 that \\"separate was not equal\\"? Dr. Kotulski offers her most compelling evidence when describing the process same-sex couples must endure to register a domestic partnership in California. The process, much more difficult to traverse than obtaining a simple marriage license, is itself demeaning because it reminds the same-sex couple of their second-class status.Although Dr. Kotulski has made a cohesive argument, the reader must be cautious to avoid missing the forest while wandering amongst the 1,349 trees. This book is best read in small portions; the subject matter is monotonous and tedious. But Dr. Kotulski has given us all many compelling reasons to \\"give a damn\\" about civil marriage equality."},{"Title":"Why You Should Give A Damn About Gay Marriage","review":"I love the passion which Dr. Kotulski has brought to this issue.At a time when I personally thought I had seen every public display of emotion possible on this issue, she surprised me (and many other readers, doubtlessly) with more examples. Same-sex marriage is not just being written about to make headlines or money, it is an issue which she personally feels obligated to stand up on behalf of.She believes that same-sex marriage is not something which certain GLBT people should care about. The legality of these unions is a human rights issue which everybody (including myself and other heterosexuals) should publicly support.Unfortunately, the examples which she uses (and the arrangement of this book) leave something to be desired. Since the far right is able to convince some voters of their own position largely through simplicity of their own arguments (i.e. \\"because the bible says\\" or \\"do you want to be moral?\\" Kotulski does her own argument a huge disservice.People who are scared of the changes which might be brought with legalized same sex marriage are not necessarily going to examine the intricate parts of this book for subsequent answers. Feeling confused, those same people will instead turn to the first source which can provide them with easy and immediate answers about this world...even if the ensuing positions are intolerant.I am concerned that the author inadvertently cedes an opportunity for social change by assuming everybody will take the time to calm down and reject fear. As much as I would also like this to happen, I have to recognize how powerful paranoia of the 'different' has been in American public policy processes."},{"Title":"Why You Should Give A Damn About Gay Marriage","review":"What a rich read this book is! Chocked-full of info, humor and insight into why same-sex couples should be given full marriage equality, this is the essential handbook on gay marriage. After reading this one, you'll be well-prepared to debate Jerry Falwell, George Bush, Arnold Schwarzenegger and all the rest who stand on the side of hatred, bigotry, and injustice. Highest praise for Dr. Kotulski's WHY YOU SHOULD GIVE A DAMN ABOUT GAY MARRIAGE. This is THE book on marriage equality and I seriously recommend you buy a copy and pass it around to friends, family and co-workers!"},{"Title":"Why You Should Give A Damn About Gay Marriage","review":"In Why You Should Give a Damn About Gay Marriage, clinical psychologist and activist Davinia Kotulski explains in plain language why everyone, gay and straight, needs to give a damn about the issue of gay marriage (a general term the author uses to encompass marriage equality for same-sex and transsexual partners). Marriage affords heterosexual folks some 1,049 federal rights and protections and, on average, 300 additional rights per state. Sure, a committed gay couple could hire a lawyer to draft wills, powers of attorney, medical directives, and a whole briefcase full of papers, but for those to work, they'd have to be toted on every vacation and to every consumer interaction. Many rights remain firmly out of the grasp for anyone who doesn't fit the American image of a marriage for one man and one woman.Kotulski's slim paperback volume lists the rights which are out of the reach of gays and transsexual citizens of America and contains rebuttals to many of the common arguments against gay marriage. Sure, marriage is in the Bible as being between a man and a woman, but that traditional view of marriage one in which women were the property of their husbands, and we've certainly moved past that as a society!Kotulski peppers her book with anecdotes about real-world couples who were denied their basic civil rights and pursuit of happiness due to the inequality in the American institution of marriage. Gay partners can be forced to testify against their spouses in court, while heterosexuals are afforded spousal privilege. Immigration protections and rights do not apply to gay partners. Social Security, life insurance, pension, employer health insurance, and even 9/11 survivor benefits are denied to gay partners in committed, decades-long relationships. In a strange twist of fate, federal ethics codes of conduct apply to straight spouses, but not to gay partners, so the unethical senator could have a gay partner accepts all the bribes he or she wanted! Of course, right now, gays do escape the \\"marriage penalty\\" in the tax code, but shouldn't we make them shoulder their fair share of the tax burden?I highly recommend Kotulski's book to all readers regardless of personal or political orientation. Its one weakness is the lack of a cohesive structure - Kotulski wants to describe law, history, policy, and society as well as recount personal anecdotes and give gay readers marriage ceremony advice. If she had limited herself to an academic study of marriage, supported by anecdotal narratives, I would have been able to give this title five out of five stars. As it is, this is an important title to reconsider during the 2008 election season, at a time when many candidates seem unwilling to touch the \\"marriage issue\\" in much detail. Kotulski reminds us just why we should all give a damn about gay marriage."},{"Title":"Why You Should Give A Damn About Gay Marriage","review":"Dr. Kotulski's book isn't just for gay people. We all need to think about what marriage means in the broader perspective of our society, our rights and responsibilities as individuals and what it means for ANYONE to be married. Everyone should do a little soul searching about the true meaning of marriage, why it is important to our society and why it is important for every adult to be able to choose to marry to whom he or she will marry. Simple. Yes. But at the same time a complex, highly emotional issue. This book will help you think it through no matter what your choice may be."},{"Title":"Why You Should Give A Damn About Gay Marriage","review":"This book is writen by someone who clearly cares deeply about the subject of gay marriage and many of the ideas she raises are insightful and will answer many of the questions that are raised by those who opose gay mariage.The way she structures the book is a jumble however. At the start of each chapter, she takes a \\"right\\" that is given to straight marriage and explains why it is wrong to opose it being given to gay marriage. As the argument for the right is explained, she introduces examples of how the \\"missing right\\" would work in the real world before moving onto the next \\"right\\".The two problems that I have with the book are the way she links the \\"rights\\" together and how she moves from argument to example.With my former complaint, I couldn't see why she went from one right to another. All the rights she mentions are important but it was never clear why she went from the rights for old people to rights in the military, for example. The link, in my mind at least, simply isn't there.With my latter argument, the way she moves from argument to example was simply \\"cluncky\\".Don't get me wrong, I liked the book it's just I think it could have been edited better."},{"Title":"Why You Should Give A Damn About Gay Marriage","review":"This book is very biased. It was hard to read even as a homosexual with intent to marry. I was looking for more factual information to support my argument for a research paper but read a whole lot more overly-opinionated monologue than fact. It felt like I was observing a one-sided argument at the bar.A fun read if you relish in your anger towards the hindering of gay rights, but it won't do much for you if you are trying to make a healthy argument."},{"Title":"The First Jewish Catalog: A Do-It-Yourself Kit","review":"The &quot;First Jewish Catalog&quot; is a book I consult again and again--to answer friends' questions and my own.

A treat for the knowledgeable as well as those new to Jewish celebration."},{"Title":"The First Jewish Catalog: A Do-It-Yourself Kit","review":"This has been called the &quot;Whole Earth Catalog&quot; of Judaism, and it certainly is that. A little skimpy on halacha (Jewish law) and day-to-day practicalities, this book is all about having a good time, making a difference, saving the world.Illustrated throughout with scary 1970's black-and-white photos, cartoons, and clips of Yiddish proverbs, this book actually manages to overcome its &quot;feel-good&quot; message, providing a joyful introduction to important Jewish themes. It might be nice to see an updated edition of this book, but in the meantime, it and its siblings certainly fill a gap.If nothing else, the &quot;Jewish Catalog&quot; books capture an era in Jewish thought, informed by the youth movement, when havdalah was hip because you could use incense, and Jewish music was anything Jews felt like singing together. We may mock it now, but maybe we could use a little of that enthusiasm today."},{"Title":"The First Jewish Catalog: A Do-It-Yourself Kit","review":"I use this constantly as a Jew. Get the original, not the newer printings. The original was done in the '70's and it just has this very open, dowhatchalike feel. Everything is covered from living Kosher to Shabbat to the Shoah. It's a 'how-to' manual for the Reformers. Good things abound. Take what you like and leave the rest."},{"Title":"The First Jewish Catalog: A Do-It-Yourself Kit","review":"It's a lot of fun and good info, now getting dated."},{"Title":"The First Jewish Catalog: A Do-It-Yourself Kit","review":"The Jewish Catalogue is certainly indicative of the Jewish renewal movement fueled by the sixties counter culture. It was written to reinvest \\"spirit\\" or intention \\"kavanah\\" into Jewish practices by young people who were dismayed by the increasingly ossified nature of institutional, organized Judaism. So the Jewish Catalogue contains such gems as how to make your own eternal light, ner tamid, out of a can; how to macram&eacute; a Torah scroll cover; the proper method of tying your own tallit; how to make a mezuzah; creating your own yahrzeit candles. Along with these do- it-yourself versions of Jewish worship and practice, there are the rudiments of halakhah: The basics of keeping kosher; the order of prayers for holidays and daily worship; the Passover Seder. This book is not a Shulchan Aruch or a Mishneh Torah in terms of detail, and some of its information is outdated (like contact information). Even more of its details can now be gleaned from the internet (how to build a sukkah, for example). Yet the Jewish Catalogue gains the ground it has lost over time by possessing a great deal of charm. The form of Yiddishkeit presented here is one that few people could have major objections to; do-it-yourself Judaism, after all, was probably the pre-modern form of the faith."},{"Title":"The First Jewish Catalog: A Do-It-Yourself Kit","review":"i love this book, people of all ages and all religious \\"ranges\\" can relate to it!

It belongs in the hall of fame for its genre: the large-format black-and-white early 1970s counterculture workbook/&quot;catalog.&quot; Make your own prayer shawl, make your own yarmulke, make your own wallhanging to indicate the direction of Jerusalem, make your own challah....make your own is definitely the name of the game. I'm not personally likely to do most of those things (though I do like challah), but I just can't get enough of the b&amp;w photos of young people sitting cross-legged on the floor with their long wavy hair, bell bottoms, beards and beads; and the eclectic, semi-disorganized format really holds your interest and keeps you coming back for more. I'm not qualified to measure the vision of Judaism presented in this book against traditional standards; but hippie optimism and &quot;make your own&quot; seem to marry well with the concept of tikkun olam. The connection to a traditional faith is definitely what makes this catalog a cut above the rest, such as the secular &quot;Whole Earth&quot; - makes it easier to take the nostalgia seriously at this late date, I suppose."},{"Title":"The First Jewish Catalog: A Do-It-Yourself Kit","review":"Although it took a while to arrive (we live in Hawaii), the book was in great condition. It looked like it was printed yesterday."},{"Title":"The First Jewish Catalog: A Do-It-Yourself Kit","review":"I must admit that when I first read this book - a very long time ago when I was beginning to research my Jewish roots - I enjoyed it quite a bit, mainly due to its format and informality. However, as time marched on and I became considerably more knowledgeable, I realized that the Jewish Catalog suffered from the same ills nearly all diaspora-based books suffer from: the treatment of Judaism as merely a religion and/or compendium of traditions, rather than the territorially-based nationality it actually is.Any semi-literate who reads the Bible from Abraham till the end of Chronicles II, must necessarily perceive the inseparable interconnection between G-d, the commandments, the Israelites and the Land of Israel. However, throughout the centuries, the rabbinical establishment has succeeded in virtually removing the latter from the quadrangle; Israel has become not much more than an abstract notion rather than a genuine homeland; it's just another country out there which 90% of all American Jews never even visit.The Jewish Catalog, for one, sadly reflects this state of affairs, relegating Israel to the end of the book, a mere afterthought. A non-Jew could easily get the impression that Jews are folks who love to eat deli, occasionally blurt out 'Mommela Tottala' and perhaps step into some synagogue for a few minutes on Yom Kippur.If one is searching for an interesting, informative book on what Judaism is really all about, I can recommend one which doesn't even mention pastrami, Yiddish or even rabbis. It's called the Bible."},{"Title":"Gospel Light - A Revised Annotated Edition","review":"If you are an avid reader of the Scriptures and are looking for some unique perspectives then this is the book for you!Sometimes we tend to forget that the Scriptures had their origin in the Middle East and that the Middle East is steeped in rich traditions.

These Semitic writers are a great BLESSING to the body of Christ here in America!

Anyways, based upon my 25 years in the professional law research, among others, I find the \\"Gospel Light\\" together with all of the commentaries Dr. George Lamsa and Dr. Rocco Errico wrote to date on biblical matters very insightful, illuminating, and really worthy of special attention to the serious Bible student or reader for that matter! I use my authorized Greek N/T (and Latin) to compare words and phrases, among other things, but I use the Aramaic translation and the Aramaic commentaries more often due to their better English sentence flow. Clearly, the Aramaic Bible translation is superior even to my authorized Greek and Latin texts (not to speak of our English ones)! Moreover, it is made easier for me to apprehend Greek and Latin words and their meaning in my (English)KJV N/T, in the context of Semitic culture from which they originated!I urge everyone to get these books while they last!

Another fast paced interesting read!! Love all of his Cork O'Connor books but gave this standalone novel a try and was glad that I did."},{"Title":"The Devil's Bed","review":"I am a great fan of the Cork O'Connor novels by William Kent Krueger. This novel is not part of the series, it is a stand-alone thriller introducing a Secret Service Agent named Bo Thoreson. I would very much like to see Bo become the protagonist of a series of his own, he is very interesting. His boyhood name is \\"Spider-Man\\" and he hung out in an old bus, under a big bridge, with Otter and Freak. Freak now haunts Otter and Otter turns out to be more than a homeless vagabond, but a saviour of sorts for Bo. A story of their boyhood lives together, what made them what they are today, would be a very intriguing novel.\\"The Devil's Bed\\" is a novel with three parts. Part one is Bo recognizing the heroine's life is in peril, tracking down the bad guy, and ending up in the hospital after a confrontation with Nightmare. Nightmare is very good, to me he is like a Hannibal Lecter, a very smart and too clever man, driven by a wicked childhood and torture bar none. Yet, inside beats a man with his own set of values, recognizing good in a world that has presented him only with evil. The adrenaline score in this part one reaches a nine.Part Two (to me, not the author) of the novel is soft, no adrenaline rushes here. This is the storyline that sets up the future storyline. We are out in the field, gathering the crops and essentially bringing them into harvest. Boring would describe the hospital scenes, the trips back and forth from here to there in Minnesota.Part Three is Bo on his mission despite walls so high he can barely navigate the terrain. Injuries pile up. Each discovery bring more danger and the adrenaline factor once again builds. I would rate this part a seven out of ten. I liked the ending, you can draw your own conclusions and in your mind, decide how you think it will turn out for Bo. Will he do as Coyote suggests? or will he return to the land that truly nurtured his soul in Blue Earth?I personally would like to find that out in another novel.

Ridge. I have to admit, I tried very very hard to like this because I was very impressed with the Cork series. In the end however this was bad on so many levels. The dialog was terrible...completely unrealistic. The characters empty. I still don't have a true sense of Bo. Also a love affair between the first lady and a minnesota secret service agent doesn't strike me as either interesting or believable.And the ending? I won't ruin it for those who haven't read it, but the climax occurred.....well it never did. It was like a decent football game that completely fell apart by the 3rd quarter. You keep waiting to get back to the excitement of the 1st quarter, but people keep getting injured and the game drags on. It's the game you turn off before the 2 minute warning.The book is also loaded with cheesy moments and cliches by the truckload. I was a little worried when I finished Purgatory Ridge that Krueger was going down the cheese road (Cork was a little too perfect for me in that one). I hope he got the sap out of his head in this book and abandons it on the next.

The result was that they all hit the big time and the national bestseller lists. William Kent Krueger has been a favorite for years with his Cork O'Connor mystery series. Now he joins this August crowd by writing a stand alone and it is every bit as good and entertaining as the others.Secret Service agent Bo Thorsen is assigned to protect the First Lady, Kate Dixon, when she heads back to her home in Minnesota after her father is injured in a farming accident. Unbeknownst to Bo, she is targeted by a mysterious killer who bears a grudge against her. At the same time, her husband, President Clay Dixon, is up for reelection and needs Kate's help with the campaign. Due to his apparent lack of moral fortitude, Kate has left her husband. This can fatally damage his campaign. One of the President's advisors look upon her as a liability and want to do something about it without the President's knowledge. Bo is up against, not only the battle of his career, but, of his life.William Kent Krueger's fast and furious debut thriller appears headed for bestseller stardom.

Bo suspects the senator's accident may have been premeditated. In the background are the U.S. President, his re-election campaign and his strained relations with the first lady. When escaped mental patient and assassin, David Moses, is added to the mix, the widening implications of the accident, the first lady's safety, and the president's re-election seem to be joined.By far the most fascinating character is assassin David Moses, brilliant, chilling and who has had an indescribable horror of childhood. David is the best drawn and consequently over-balances the book. \\"The Devil's Bed\\" begins with a riveting prologue, and begins with a compelling pace. Events seem to tumble over one another. The reader is given a good background on Bo, who has so much in common with David, but as a child was redeemed rather than permanently abandoned. About at the halfway point in the book, it starts to lose focus. The scope is so broad: government, conspiracy, agencies, and politicians; the story starts to spin away in ever widening ripples. To gather all his threads back together is almost a super-human task for Mr. Krueger, and I felt the ending a little flat.I'm always glad to see an author stretching his abilities and not getting in a rut with a comfortable series.

The plot is labyrinthine, opening with a gruesome murder by David Moses, who also turns out to be Nightmare, a deranged psychotic who is seeking to kill the First Lady because of a scorned love affair years ago.Add some vicious government agents, an almost romance with the First Lady and Bo, and some tense suspense scenes, you've got a rip roaring conspiracy novel. Sometimes Bo seems a little less than what you'd expect in a hero (he's always getting beat up), but he is human and that makes him engaging. Krueger's President Clay Dixon evolves from a rather self-centered ass to a really good president during the course of the novel, so that's unusual...if a little incredible.

Everyone but Dixon himself is relieved to have Kate out of the political spotlight for a while. She will be fine on the family farm, Dixon's advisors assert, especially since Bo Thorsen, Special Agent in the Secret Service, is stationed in the Twin Cities field office. Thorsen has a history with the Jorgenson family that dates back to his own troubled youth, which was spent in and out of foster care. Though Thorsen is troubled by a few details surrounding Tom Jorgenson's injury, the incident that put the elderly statesman in a coma looks like an unfortunate accident.Meanwhile, the President's father, William Dixon, a powerful senior senator from Colorado, voices his strong disapproval of Kate Dixon, though he tells his son that for political interests, he must keep his marriage together. He asks about Tom Jorgenson's accident, and points out that though the man's injury is unfortunate, it could help Dixon in the political polls.Krueger paints vivid pictures of both Thorsen's and Nightmare's desperate childhoods, which parallel each other up to the point where Thorsen was placed with foster parents who redeemed his future. Nightmare, previously known as David Moses, deteriorated to the point where he joined some extremely disreputable characters in order to survive.Krueger's thriller ratchets up the tension as a conspiracy that encompasses all of the characters is slowly revealed. Bo Thorsen and David Moses are the expendable scapegoats, caught in the vortex of the schemers, and it takes heart-pounding feats on both their parts to reveal the heart of the plot. This is a thriller filled with nonstop action, and though we suspect some of the bad guys, we don't know them all. The novel also has a touch of sweet romance and a touching, bittersweet finale.

The protagonist is Bo Thorsen, a Secret Service agent assigned to protect the president's wife. She hangs out on the family farm/orchard outside of the twin cities and there is considerable concern that a former government operative, now gone rogue, is determined to kill her.He is also interested in killing her father, a former vice-president who (he believes) has, like his daughter, betrayed him. The first lady's marriage is on shaky ground and all who see her (including Bo Thorsen) have a tendency to fall for her. The question is--is the real threat to her survival the rogue government operative, David Moses, or is it her father-in-law, a long-serving senator who will go to any lengths to advance the political fortunes of his son, even if the son disagrees with his methods?Moving in and out of favor with the Secret Service, Bo discovers a little-known government agency with its fingers (make that: tentacles) in every other branch and division of the national government.In some ways the agency-gone-rogue story is a very old one. It is an old one, however, because it works in fiction and may well be a problem in reality, though not usually to the degree that it is in The Devil's Bed. So basically we have a D.C. thriller, largely set in the author's home town, with lots of bad guys, lots of ordnance, and overarching doubts about who can be trusted and who, absolutely, cannot.The characters are interesting and well-wrought, but this is a book driven by plot and driven very well. There is one native American character in a minor role and, as mentioned above, a brief discussion of the ice-hearted, flesh-devouring Windigo, a figure who arises in several of the Cork O'Connor novels.I hated the cover, but loved the book. The cover was fairly uninspired and gave me the impression that this was a kind of throwaway, to be read only when the Cork O'Connor list had been exhausted. This is not the case. This is a terrific page-turner that introduces a character--Bo Thorsen--who I would love to see return in another novel. There is less texture here, less Ojibwe lore, and none of the cast from the Cork O'Connor novels, but WKK is on his home turf in the twin cities and he manages to exploit the location to considerable success as he presses forward with his pile-driver plot.

Set in the military theater of the Crimean War in 1854, the story first describes the background of the officers who played their respective roles in the courageous blunder. From the background, the tale turns to the land and sea scapes that surround and comprise the Crimean peninsula. With some details as to the commanders and the men, the illnesses and the errors, the story climaxes in the telling of the fatal messages that directed some 700 Light Calvary to charge a defensive position of overwhelming superiority.The British commander, Lord Raglan, was overlooking the action from the position on a hill some 600 feet above the plain of Balaclava, a valley approximately 3 miles in length by 2 miles in width, from Raglan's viewpoint. The valley was not flat although it appeared flat from the vantage point above. So, actions took place on the ground that seemed incredulous from above, and orders were given from above that were sufficiently ambiguous to allow those below to undertake entirely inappropriate actions.Cecil Woodham-Smith tells the story in such a mix of detailed confusion, with the glory, pomp, circumstance and blood of a battle that has been retold in books, movies and poems ever since. She does such a masterful job that, as the reader gets into the battle proper, one cannot set the book down. At the same time, one cannot but realize the severe consequences of poor leadership in times of resource scarcity. Of the 700 or so, who went into the fray, 195 returned."},{"Title":"The Reason Why : The Story of the Fatal Charge of the Light Brigade","review":"\\"The Reason Why\\" by Cecil Woodham-Smith and written in 1954 came as a recommendation through a friend of mine who is currently a major in the British Army. My familiarity with the Charge of the Light Brigade, which occurred during the British, French, and Turkish campaign against the Russians during the Crimean War up until reading this book was lifted from visual snippets from my childhood when my dad would watch the 1936 Hollywood production with Errol Flynn, by the same name, but taking place during the wrong war for the wrong reasons with all the wrong characters, and the often quoted Tennyson poem from which the title originates.\\"Their's not to make reply,Their's not to reason why,Their's but to do and die:Into the valley of DeathRode the six hundred\\"I'm glad I read this book and straightened out my truly twisted sense of British history on this one. I also learned a great deal more. This book is a masterpiece and I will feebly attempt to explain why. To understand what really happened during the Battle of Balaclava, Woodham-Smith starts to illustrate the political and military culture within Britain starting just after the turn of the Century and then directly after the British victory over Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815. It is very important to understand that British officers did not attend formal professional military schools nor did they move up through the ranks, they bought their commissions and either learned in the field, engaged in self-study if they were interested in subjects such as warfare, or they lead and managed men based on instinct. Officership was entrusted to and required of only the upper social strata -- those who had a stake in the country were those best fit to lead the military, and more importantly were those less likely to turn the military against the social elite, themselves. This was how the stability of the British aristocracy was balanced and maintained -- in peacetime it works -- the military is not going to over-throw the country. During times of war -- it also works since the military with it's sabre now unsheathed, is typically sent abroad. When sound military leaders emerge and victories are secured, the system is self ratifying. When defeats occur abroad, however, the facts can be easily distorted to hide the incompetence of the officer elite and then too the system ratifies itself, or the aristocracy quietly takes care of it's own. The reason why, not the title but the reason the Light Brigade trotted ceremoniously, not galloped, into the valley of death had everything to do with why the British system of officership was a failure and must be changed.The book is a masterpiece because it combines the domestic sagas of a Jane Austen novel complete with social circles, sex-scandals, and racial prejudices into a great discription of the reality of a military campaign in progress. Not just from the tactical descriptions of the battles as they were set-up and ensued but the logistics of supporting the infantry and the cavalry to get to those battles. After she describes in great detail the unlikely British victory at the Battle of Alma she quotes the Duke of Wellington who said, \\"Next to a battle lost, there is nothing more dreadful than a battle won\\", and from her descriptions of the pain and human suffering inflicted on both sides, the Duke was right. Yet Woodham-Smith adds even more to this book, the pure high drama of military incompetence at it's highest as Lord Raglan unwitting observes a battle unfold from his perch deep behind Russian, the enemy, lines. And of Lord Lucan, who want's to be in charge but is never in the right place at the right time. And to the Charge itself, when Captain Edward Nolan, who carried the charge order to Lord Cardigan, and who in a moment of his own clarity, the coup d'oeil that he himself had written about in the calvary manuals he had penned, gallops to the front of the charge to correct Cardigan's fatal misinterpretation of the charge and is ironically cut down by canon fire just before being able to divert the Light Brigade's direction away from the valley of death. High drama, ferocious battle, scandal, intrigue, incompetence, and an outcome that would forever change the way we train our military officers. A must read for every member of the military -- grunt to general officer, for every history buff, and for those who just like to poke fun at the British way of doing business or to understand why it is they do business their way."},{"Title":"The Reason Why : The Story of the Fatal Charge of the Light Brigade","review":"Theirs not to reason whyTheirs but to do an die.Into the valley of deathRode the 600.------------- Alfred Lord TennysonSo went Tennyson's heroic poem \\"Charge of the Light Brigade\\". Every School boy used to know it. But few know who ordered and led the light brigade of cavalry to slaughter in the Crimea in 1854.It was in fact a British aristocrat named James Thomas Brudenell, the duke of Cardigan (yes, the sweater's named after him). The story goes he fell off his horse as a child and injured his brain but not his birthright nor bank account with which he bought command of the light brigade.The charge into the Russian cannon was a mistake. His sail to the crimea was so ill-prepared that his horses arrived half starved and his men sick and hungry. Of the 600 who rode out, Cardigan included, only 200 returned, all wounded except for Cardigan who strode his horse in lordly style up the defile and back to return unscathed to his yacht in the harbor.Real history here? Likely mostly. Brudenell was a stupid martinet, much despised, bitterly ridiculed in the press. He was relieved of his command and the British policy of buying commands changed.

But I have serious reservations about this book that may be useful for you to be aware of. Let me be clear first of all - I think this is a good book, I recommend it, but with the following provisios.1. There is an over emphasis early on in the book on the lives and experiences of Lords Cardigan and Lucan, their private lives, childhood experience and record of marriages. As an Irish man I found Lucan's actions during the great potato famine to be of interest, but it was entirely off the point. The Irish Potato famine has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the Charge of the Light Brigade. A lot of this could be cut out.2. There is no good explanation of the tactics of troops and in particular of Cavalry in this period. The author fails to make it clear how cavalry should operate and how this differs from the way Raglan insisted upon the cavalry staying close to the troops.3. The book is light on statistics. There is a lot of commentary on the Cholera epidemic, but how serious was it? What percentage of troops died of Cholera? How many died in battle? This kind of information puts events in perspective.4. The book is written almost exclusively from the British Point of View. At times you can forget that the French were even there. It would be useful to have analysed the reasons for the Crimean conflict from the perspective of Britain, France, Russia and Turkey. Did the Sultan invite the English and French to act on his behalf???5. For me Raglan is the culpabale party. He was commander in the field. He allowed a brigade commander to believe he was independent of his divisional commander. He removed the divisional commander from his division. He interfered with the management of the command. He restricted the actions of cavalry to behaving like infantry. In battle he put himself in positions where he could not communicate with his troops. This was particularly acute in Alma, when he got onto the Russian side, over a mile from the main advance, and could not order supporting actions.6. The book stops after the charge, without fully explaining the final outcome of the campaign or its consequences.Overall I feel this is a book with too many holes in it. I am itching to have a go at improving upon it myself. Were I the authors teacher in school I would probably have written something like &quot;good effort, well written lots of hard work, but you need to stick to the point and draw clear conclusions.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Reason Why : The Story of the Fatal Charge of the Light Brigade","review":"In 1953, Cecil Woodham-Smith published what is probably the most thoroughly researched and most entertaining book on the Charge of the Light Brigade ever.

The author, coming from an Army family and relying heavily on the writings of officers, largely neglects the experience of the private soldier and concentrates on the main characters in the drama. The story is dominated by these extraordinary personalities, serving as a reminder that war is an inherently human drama. On a second level, it is a criticism of the privilege system of the British Army of the mid-nineteenth century. In retrospect, one is hard pressed to believe such a purchase system could have ever won a victory at Waterloo. Intolerant aristocrats with no experience in battle, paltry leadership skills, and maddening unconcern for the soldiers under their command, bought their commissions. The Charge of the Light Brigade illuminated all of the faults of the system and proved that bravery alone was insufficient for victory. While human blunders led to the debacle that was the Charge of the Light Brigade, the British military system was intrinsically to blame.The heart of this book concerns the relationship between society at large and the military. Military leaders feared nothing so much as public scrutiny, for widespread discontent could lead to political interference and, indeed, political control of the army. Whether in dealing with the incorrigible personalities of Lords Lucan and Cardigan or in covering up the series of blunders that resulted in the sacrificial ride of the Light Brigade, the military leadership acted with the overriding principle of preserving the Army from governmental control.The embarrassments of the Crimean campaign proved uncontainable. A great source of difficulty was the incompetence of the Army staff; rank and privilege were held to be superior to actual experience. When these difficulties led to humiliation and defeat, the commanders' concern was not with the men they had lost nor the future of the war effort; to the exclusion of these, their main concern was that bad publicity would appear in Britain, that the public would hear of the lack of success, that the House would begin to ask questions of the military leadership, that the press would begin to criticize the Army. This great fear of political interference was realized in the aftermath of the Crimean War. The author portrays this as the one positive effect engendered by the War effort. A new era of military reform was born in Britain, Europe, and America. Experience now became a prerequisite for command, and officers were trained in staff colleges. The author's final point is that, above all, the treatment of the private soldier changed as the military system was humanized to some degree. Her assertion that at the end of the Crimean War the private soldier was regarded as a hero seems rather bold, but it is clear that he was no longer seen as a nonhuman tool of his commanders' designs."},{"Title":"The Reason Why : The Story of the Fatal Charge of the Light Brigade","review":"Woodham-Smith presents, in minute detail, the wages of placing social rank over experience, and even competence. British military history follows a disturbing trend. War starts, Brits get trounced upon, influx of fresh talent and new ideas comes (along with, sometimes, timely intercession by allies), British return to triumph. Woodham-Smith attributes this pattern to the notion in the higher ranks of the army (a notion espoused by the Duke of Wellington himself, pip pip!), that nobility ensures, if not competence, at least loyalty.The price of this notion, is, of course, massive death, but because the massive death does not happen to the nobility, nobody important really minds. This is one reason the Charge of the Light Brigade, with which _the Reason Why_ primarily deals, was so different, and worthy of eulogizing in prose and song (Alfred, Lord Tennyson, by the way, appears absolutely nowhere in this text)--those dying, those paying the price for the Army's obsession with aristocracy, were aristocrats themselves.Woodham-Smith manages to trace the careers of two utterly unsympathetic characters--Cardigan and Lucan--in a fascinating manner. This is no small feat, considering the reader will probably want, by the end of _the Reason Why_ to reach back in time and shake both of them, and maybe smack them around a bit.Again, Cecil Woodham-Smith proves herself a master of the historian's craft, and produces a well-researched, thorough and driving account of what is probably the stupidest incident in modern military history.The Crimean War changed so much about how war is waged--the treatment of prisoners and wounded being tops on the list of reforms brought about in the wake of the debacle. _The Reason Why_ is an excellent account, and should be required reading for anybody with even a remote interest in military history, or European history in general."},{"Title":"The Reason Why : The Story of the Fatal Charge of the Light Brigade","review":"The Charge of the Light Brigade on the 25th October 1854 was one of the three famous engagements that formed the Battle of Balaklava. The Charge, the most famous of all military blunders, was barely over before the process of transforming it into myth began. Accusations, counter-accusations, legal actions and patriotic poetry created more obscuring smoke and dust than the infamous Russian guns. Cecil Woodham Smith traces the careers of two of the major players: Lords Lucan and Cardigan, the brothers-in-law from hell, whose vanity, arrogance and (at least in the case of Cardigan) incompetence, inexperience and crass stupidity, contributed to the fatal Charge. Almost 40 years of peace, and the reactionary influence of the Duke of Wellington, had left the British army in a parlous state of unreadiness and bureaucratic confusion when the call came to defend Turkey against the Russians. The choice of the aged, gentle, inexperienced and unassertive Raglan, as leader of the expeditionary army, only made a bad situation worse. (For a rather more sympathetic portrayal of Raglan, as victim of an inefficient military system, criminally disorganised commissariat and unreasonable government, see &quot;The Destruction of Lord Raglan&quot; by Christopher Hibbert.) A more recent study, &quot;The Charge&quot; by Mark Adkin, provides a detailed and well-illustrated account of the events leading to the Charge of the Light Brigade. Adkin challenges traditional views , including parts of Cecil Woodham Smith's account. Particular attention is given to the role played by Captain Nolan (the messenger). Adkin suggests that Nolan may have deliberately misled Lucan and Cardigan as to Raglan's real intention. Whatever the truth, which is of course unknowable, &quot;The Reason Why&quot; is a genuine classic and an excellent introduction to a fascinating subject."},{"Title":"The Reason Why : The Story of the Fatal Charge of the Light Brigade","review":"I have vivid memories of business-major friends spending hours memorizing The Art of War as a philosophical basis for their future careers. I suppose there's something to be said for that, but I always felt they'd have been better served by reading real military history. Without minimizing the ordeals of those who have been in battle, I think military history can very easilly be viewed as a study of management under extreme circumstances with extraordinarilly high stakes.The Reason Why is a perfect case in point. Probably no war was ever more mismanaged than the Crimean War, and here, we are able to view this in detail.The personalities described in this book, and their relationships amongst one another read like a case study from an advanced Human Resources textbook. The hideous communication gaps in the field, which ultimately led to the charge of the light brigade, were a result of volatile temperments, assumptions, and poorly worded instructions.When you read this book, do not fail to notice how the circumstances of the charge are similar to what you see in any workplace you've ever seen. Do not fail to learn the lessons of the charge when you go to work to manage your department."},{"Title":"The Reason Why : The Story of the Fatal Charge of the Light Brigade","review":"At the battle of Balaclava during the Crimean war, two incompetent, megalomaniacal aristocrats led a brigade of cavalry into a deadly gauntlet of Russian artillery. The charge of the Light Brigade has been immortalized by Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Cecil Woodham-Smith seeks to explain how such a tragedy occured.Lord Lucan and Lord Cardigan were brothers-in-law who detested each other. Each possessed deep character flaws. To make matters worse, neither had led as much as a single soldier in battle and were completely unfit for command. Yet, British army command was based on social rank, not experience, thus these two supercilious fools were to attain positions of power that inevitably led to slaughter.Lucan was appointed divisional command of calvary while Cardigan received command of the light brigade. Two people completely incapable of working together would comprise a superior/subordinate relationship. Woodham-Smith provides interwoven biographies of both which culminate on that fateful day of 1854.The Reason Why: The Story of the Fatal Charge of the Light Brigade is an excellent book. Swiftly-paced, well-written, and suspenseful, Woodham-Smith's effort contains that quintessential British literary charm found in historical works of mid-20th century and earlier. It's a charm which lends itself to extended and pleasurable reading. As a history buff, I can't get enough of it and appreciate the abundance I found here. 5+ stars."},{"Title":"The Reason Why : The Story of the Fatal Charge of the Light Brigade","review":"Cecil Woodham-Smith's story of the Charge of the Light Brigade is the biography of two men: Lords Lucan and Cardigan; brothers-in-law whose hatred for each other was surpassed only by arrogance and ineptitude as officers. Woodham-Smith's book is the story of two men cradled by an absurd system of rank and class, who came together as two of the highest-ranking officers in one of the worst-run campaigns in British military history, which resulted in one of the most legendary blunders in all of military history.In the lifetimes of Lucan and Cardigan (the late eighteenth and early nineteeth century), the best way to get ahead in the British Army was to purchase your rank. The purchase system, as it was called, was basically a way for England's wealthy classes to keep the most powerful positions in the army for themselves, and exclude those individuals who were not of the same social stratum. This system was supported by Britain's greatest military mind, the Duke of Wellington, who, it is explained, somehow managed to hide the deficiencies of the system behind his military brilliance. However, by the time Lucan and Cardigan came into a position of authority, Wellington had long since passed away, none of the high officers involved in the Crimean campaign had heard a shot fired in anger, and the only combat-experienced officers in the British Army (those who had served in India) were unwanted.The biography portion of the book gets a little bit cumbersome at times, especially for those of us who aren't entirely familiar with the British nobility system, but it provides an interesting backstory to the disaster in the Crimea. How two men so completely arrogant and inept came to a position of power in the British Army is shocking, especially when one considers that it was widely known that neither man was fit to command cavalry squadrons, let alone brigades and divisions.Ultimately, Woodham-Smith's argument is effective: the purchase system, coupled with the British class system, was ripe for a disaster. By allowing incompetency to buy its way up the ranks while more competent solders were bypassed and more experienced soldiers were shunned, it was only a matter of time until the British experienced a debacle such as Balaclava and the entire Crimean Campaign. Unfortunately for the British, it took two spectaculary arrogant and stupid men to breed such a disaster, and when it finally happened, it happened in spectacular fashion."},{"Title":"The Reason Why : The Story of the Fatal Charge of the Light Brigade","review":"Cecil Woodham-Smith has done a remarkable job of explaining the events that led up to one of military history's most celebrated bungles. The biggest culprit was Britain's &quot;purchase&quot; system of advancement, whereby, wealthy, inexperienced, and even incompetent men could rise to the head of a regiment ahead of seasoned, more qualified men. (The chief advocate of this system was the Duke of Wellington himself.) The reader will be introduced to two of the products of this system, Lord Lucan and Lord Cardigan (the man the sweater was named after), brothers-in-law that despised authority and each other, both of whom played significant roles on the fatal day. You will even learn some facts about the Irish potato famine of the 1840s.

I think this is her best book: by focussing on the people involved, their relationships, and how they found themselves in a situation they were pathetically incapable of dealing with, she's put together a thorough but lively account of what led up to the Light Brigade cataclysm. Not only is it an admirable piece of historical research and writing, but the book has considerable resonance today: stupidity, arrogance, and personal feuds in high places led to a disaster, and they could do so again -- but now the stakes are potentially much higher."},{"Title":"The Reason Why : The Story of the Fatal Charge of the Light Brigade","review":"Cecil Woodham-Smith's The Reason Why recounts the infamous Charge of the Light Brigade with unparalleled style. Not a truly objective history, Woodham-Smith's book is an eloquent, sweeping condemnation of the Victorian class system. Using two officers - Lords Cardigan and Lucan - as a prism on British society, she shows the combination of arrogance, bad judgment and miscommunication that led to the sacrifice of the \\"Noble 600.\\"James Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan proves singularly representative of aristocratic shortcomings. The only son in a family of daughters, he grew spoiled by parental dotage, generating an egotism mixed with dreams of military glory. By adulthood Cardigan was an almost caricature nobleman: handsome and gallant, but arrogant, snobbish and short-tempered. Woodham-Smith's claim that Cardigan's \\"glorious golden head had nothing in it\\" (15) is unfair; biographer Saul David shows that Cardigan was both intelligent and a good student. However, Cardigan certainly lacked in other areas: common sense, tact and especially temperance.Commanding first the 15th, and later the 11th Hussars, Cardigan proved harshly exacting. His stringent standards made the 11th Hussars England's premiere cavalry regiment, but they also engendered the loathing of his officers and men. He certainly kept England's press abuzz with sundry scandals. Minor breaches of etiquette sent him into apoplexy: he scandalized the Army by blackballing John Reynolds, a young captain who dared serve Moselle at a champagne dinner (the famous \\"black bottle\\" affair), and flogging a soldier on Easter Sunday. Cardigan himself violated societal mores through repeated duels and scandalous love affairs. He was publicly booed at theaters and public gatherings, becoming a perennial headache for his superiors. An exasperated Duke of Wellington proclaimed \\"he had never known the time of the staff... to be taken up in so useless a manner\\" (100).Profiled in parallel is George Bingham, 3rd Earl of Lucan. Lucan easily bested Cardigan in sheer bloody-minded nastiness. He gained infamy for cruelly managing his Mayo estates during the Irish potato famine. Consolidating land holdings and evicting tenants en mass, he caused untold suffering among his subjects and intense hatred: \\"it is doubtful if he considered the Irish as human beings at all\\" (113). Like Cardigan, he was also a martinet of the worst sort, a brutal taskmaster \\"perpetually entangled in trifles\\" (33) in commanding his troops and often contemptuous of superiors. Lucan found increasingly petty and bizarre ways of exerting authority: at one point, he ordered his cavalry drilled in antiquated Napoleonic tactics against Raglan's express orders.Not surprisingly, these men loathed each other. Lucan married Cardigan's sister and by all accounts mistreated her, igniting a personal feud. Naturally, when the Crimean War broke out Cardigan (heading the Light Brigade) found himself serving under division commander Lucan. Commanding general Lord Raglan exacerbated things by separating Cardigan from Lucan's main body, thus undermining Lucan's authority. Even in the field, the two men never missed an opportunity to spite or undermine each other, with disastrous results.Woodham-Smith forcefully attacks the British military that spawned them. The purchase system, by which officers could literally buy a higher rank, had its benefits. It forestalled the establishment of a powerful, Prussian-style military class, and forced officers to take personal responsibility for their regiment's upkeep. In practice however, it populated the Army with dilettantes and adventurers, seeing military service as a stepping stone to easy prestige. Nominally officers could advance by merit; in practice men without experience or qualification leapfrogged over seasoned career soldiers. Lord Palmerston proclaimed that \\"it was very desirable to connect the higher classes of Society with the Army\\" (30), whether or not they were fit to lead.The lack of a major war since 1815 ensured an antiquated senior staff. Commanding the Allied armies was Fitzroy Somerset, Baron Raglan. Wellington's longtime secretary, Raglan's bravery (he had lost an arm at Waterloo), amiability and organizational skills were unquestioned. His greatest achievement was ensuring smooth relations with his French and Turkish allies. Yet Raglan had never led troops in the field, and proved a spectacularly inept tactician. \\"Without the military trappings... one would never have guessed him to be a soldier,\\" Woodham-Smith says (161). He proved frustratingly absent-minded, constantly confusing his French allies with the Russian enemy. An exasperated junior officer complained that \\"everything [is] old at the top. This makes everything sluggish.\\"The Crimean disaster becomes tragically predictable. Horses crowded into transport ships died en route to the Crimea. Raglan botched the Allied attack at the Alma, forcing British troops to take and retake the same ground repeatedly. Over-caution and mis-communicaton prevented a complete victory when Raglan refuses Lucan's request to launch a follow-up attack. Raglan ill-advisedly shifted the Allied supply base to Balaclava, a tiny village ill-suited for supplying two massive armies. Finally, administrative muddle ensures inadequate supplies and medical treatment, causing thousands of troops to die of disease and exposure.In fairness, most officers shared many misfortunes with their men. Both Raglan and his French counterpart Marshall St. Arnaud ultimately succumbed to dysentery. Lucan was wounded at Balaclava and even his detractors granted him personal bravery. Cardigan however spent evenings on his yacht in Calamita Bay, entertaining civilian friends and distancing himself from his brigade's hardships. Lest this seem unduly extravagant, military buffs may remember American General George McClellan lunching while the Battle of Malvern Hill raged, Boer War commander Charles Warren stopping his division's advance for a bath, or Charles Townshend dining on plum duff at Kut while his troops starved. This mixture of sang froid and self-indulgence seems unfortunately prevalent.Woodham-Smith hits her rhetorical stride with Balaclava. She recounts the stirring stand of Colin Campbell's \\"Thin Red Line,\\" and the gallant Charge of the Heavy Brigade, where 300 cavalrymen under James Scarlett defeated 2,000 Cossacks in a wild uphill charge. Woodham-Smith captures the excitement and fleeting glory of these skirmishes. Against all odds, the British seemed poised to win a spectacular victory. Yet Cardigan stood by, using a discretionary order from Lucan as an excuse not to attack the routed Cossacks. Had Cardigan followed up on Scarlett's success, the third phase of the battle might never have occurred.Instead, a classic example of mismanagement follows. Raglan dictates an unclear order to quartermaster Richard Airey, instructing Lucan to attack Russian troops taking capture guns away from the Causeway Heights. Captain Louis Nolan, Raglan's impulsive aide, delivers the message to an agitated Lucan, emphatically pointing at the nearest guns. Neither man recognizes Nolan's fatal mistake: that Lucan cannot see the Heights from his position. Nolan instead gestures towards a mass of Russians supported by artillery in the valley ahead. Stung by accusations of \\"looking on\\" in earlier engagements, Lucan does not ask Nolan to clarify his order, and Cardigan protests halfheartedly. Before anyone realizes it, the Light Brigade initiates its fateful charge.Historians still dissect the Charge in hope of assigning blame, following the footsteps of Cardigan and Lucan's vicious postwar press feud. Woodham-Smith dodges the issue of individual guilt, viewing Balaclava instead as the logical conclusion of an entire system. For all their gallantry, the British cavalry could not achieve the impossible, and find themselves decimated by well-placed cannon and overwhelming numbers. With so many egotists and incompetents staffing the Army, the Light Brigade's fate seems inevitable. If the British Army was gradually reformed after Crimea, it came at great cost and only grudgingly. The purchase system was not abolished until the Cardwell reforms of 1868-1874, largely at the impetus of Crimean veteran Garnet Wolseley.If The Reason Why isn't definitive, it's because of its limited portrayal of the Crimea (the book mostly ends at Balaclava) and its editorial tone. More recent works (Terry Brighton'sHell Riders, Saul David'sThe Homicidal Earl) eschew Woodham-Smith's polemical approach for more balanced analysis. Still, Woodham-Smith's passionate anger and vivid prose make it the most readable account of the Light Brigade's sorry fate, and a classic account of military incompetence."},{"Title":"The Reason Why : The Story of the Fatal Charge of the Light Brigade","review":"Cecil Woodham-Smith's 1953 classic tells the story of the cavalry charge of the British army's Light Brigade in the Crimean War on 25th of October 1854.The chief protagonists in the military calamity were Lord Lucan and Lord Cardigan and the first half of the book tells their stories. Woodham-Smith researched these stories comprehensively and the book draws much of its magnetism from her descriptions of these men and their backgrounds.Cardigan was an insufferably arrogant and stupid man. He was openly contemptuous of the best officers in the British army because they had gained their experience in India yet he was indulged, often feted, by the class-revering British throughout his years of cruelty, prejudice, and incompetence. Lucan was a cold, ruthless and needlessly aggresive man who similarly prospered in the infected pool of Britain's titled classes.Having thoroughly and entertainingly told the stories of these two men, Woodham-Smith moves on to the preparations for the war and embarcation to the Crimea. Once again, her story-telling skills glue the reader to the page as she describes the politicking, the clashing personalities, and the incompetence of Britain's high command. Soon we are on the field of battle. Lord Raglan has sent his order down to Lucan and, with Cardigan at its head, the fatal charge unrolls. The final two chapters describe the aftermath of the disaster. Lucan took most of the blame and Cardigan, though celebrated at first, soon came to share it.Some of Woodham-Smith's judgements have been revised by modern scholarship. She describes Lord Raglan's written order to Lucan as 'vague, obscure, the work of an amateur, and an invitation to disaster' whereas the contributors to the recent BBC programme 'In Our Time' on the subject found nothing wrong with it.One curious aspect of the book's subject is the hold it has on the British imagination. A still famous poem by Tennyson, this book, two films (in 1936 and the 1968, the latter based on Woodham-Smith's book), a recent BBC documentary, and all for a cavalry charge which saw the loss of only 505 men, the sort of casualties that would pass unnoticed in the Battle of Stalingrad.But these points do not take away from the fact that Woodham-Smith's book is so thoroughly researched and the story so brilliantly told, that the reader will turn the last page with sorrow and despair of ever finding a book equal to it."},{"Title":"Star style: An astrological guide to beauty, sex, work, fashion, and romance","review":"StarStyle is a fun, informative astrology read.

I'm glad I thought of it. The Mating Season is, thus far, my favorite in the Jeeves series. These are the first person accounts of Bertram Wooster, a brain dead British aristocrat who can't tie his own shoes without the help of his butler, Jeeves. He and his friends get themselves into hilarious predicaments and Jeeves unfailingly bails them out.Wodehouse is a wonderful stylist and almost unbelievably funny. This is addictive stuff so take care."},{"Title":"The Mating Season","review":"Previous: Joy in the Morning (Jeeves in the Morning)This is the classic volume in which Bertie finds himself at a place called Deverill Hall pretending to be Gussie Fink-Nottle, and Gussie Fink-Nottle shows up pretending to be Bertie. Bertie must do all he can to keep the Fink-Nottle/Bassett romance intact (for we know the fate that awaits Bertram otherwise), and this, complete with two other rocky romances, keeps Bertie on his toes throughout this hilarious book. Jeeves is absent for much of this book, and thus it is short on the interaction between the two that makes the books so charming, but he shows up to save the day when the time is right. Notable in this story is the oppressed Esmond Haddock who cowers under his five aunts, the relationship between Bertie's old chum Catsmeat and a parlormaid named Queenie which nearly ends in very foreseeable disaster, and the presence of Jeeves's Uncle Charlie.I must add that this is the book I read on the plane when I had to fly home for a sudden funeral, and in the midst of the somberness of the occasion, this book was a tangible ray of sunlight. Although I will probably always remember it within that rather unfortunate context, perhaps that is not a bad thing. It worked its magic, and kept me laughing.Next: Bertie Wooser Sees it Through (Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit)"},{"Title":"The Mating Season","review":"Evelyn Waugh, a tight man with a compliment for his fellow authors, referred to P.G. Wodehouse as the Master, and nowhere are the reasons more apparent than in The Mating Season.There is never a dull moment as Bertie Wooster impersonates Gussie Fink-Nottle, Claude Cattermole (\\"Catsmeat\\") Pirbright impersonates the non-existent Meadowes, to appear at Deverill Hall as Gussie's personal gentleman (Bertie is impersonating Gussie at the time), Gussie impersonates Bertie, with Jeeves in tow, no fewer than four pairs of sundered hearts are re-united, as Bertie once again escapes the matrimonial trap, and Esmond Haddock, the landed proprietor of Deverill Hall, defies his five aunts to marry Claude's sister, the celebrated Hollywood actress Corky. With all this action and imposture, however, Wodehouse's writing is so skillful that the reader, with no effort, keeps the characters and action straight. There is, of course, time for Wodehouse's unexcelled magic with the English language. To put it more briefly, this novel provides one whale of a good time.Wodehouse wrote dozens of hilarious, wonderfully-written, and intricately-plotted novels. It is high praise indeed to note that The Mating Season would almost certainly rank in the top five in any poll of Wodehouse fans."},{"Title":"The Mating Season","review":"It is a novel characteristic of Wodehouse. The plot is very complicated and filled with unlikely events. The main characters are Bertie and Jeeves. Other characters: Gussie, Corky, Catsmeat, Madeline Bassett, Esmond Haddock and many-many aunts. The novel is very good and among the funniest that I've ever listened to. The vocabulary is tremendous and very funny."},{"Title":"The Mating Season","review":"P.G. Wodehouse's _The Mating Season_ is very entertaining. Wodehouse's wonderful, comic writing is sure to bring smiles and laughter. _The Mating Season_ is filled with hare-brained schemes plotted by the likes of Bertram Wooster and his chronies, disguises and impostors, and tales of weak-willed men, who quail in the presence of imposing Aunts and fall in love (in swoons) with precisely the wrong young women. And, of course, there is the resolute, unflappable man-servant Jeeves. Jeeves \\"shimmers\\" in and out of the book at just the right moments, devising ingenuis solutions to extricate Bertie and his friends from their troubles.As the other reviewers have noted, the story is intricate with four romantic plots and four characters--Berties, Jeeves, Gussie Fink-Nottle, and \\"Catsmeat\\" Pirbright--variously impersonating each other at Deverill Hall, an estate dominated by five Aunts. Bertie, the narrator, helps the reader keep track of the story by explaining to characters how things stand as the plot twists and turns. In the final chapter, Bertie gives the reader a final chart, hilariously assembled, of how Jeeves has managed to sort out \\"the great web.\\"There are many wonderful scenes, including one where Jeeves literally plays the \\"deus ex machina\\" with a \\"blunt instrument knowns as a cosh\\" and another where Bertie, mistaken as a burglar, is nearly shot. There are hilarious, laugh out loud sentences like this description of Rev. Sidney Pirbright: \\"A tall, drooping man, looking as if he had been stuffed in a hurry by an incompetent taxidermist.\\" Bertie's way of telling the story, peppered with latin phrases and exclamations of \\"Right Ho!,\\" is always funny.For readers unfamiliar with Wodehouse's Jeeves and Wooster characters, I would recommend as a starting point the anthology _The World of Jeeves_, a great collection of Jeeves short stories. These stories introduce all of the major and minor characters, including the unforgetable Aunt Agatha.About ten years ago, my uncle lent me his copy of the _World of Jeeves_ before a long summer trip abroad. Not only did I enjoy the stories immensely, but my friends loved them, too. Living without TV for a few months, these stories became like episodes of _Seinfeld_ to us. I'm still \\"borrowing\\" my uncle's book."},{"Title":"The Mating Season","review":"This is one of the lightest and brightest of the Jeeves and Bertie novels, from 1949, smack dab in the middle of Plum's acquaintanceship with the half wit and his gentleman's gentleman. Other reviewers have capsuled the insane plot admirably; let me add a few happy notes. The author limns a number of his ensemble cast quite handsomely in this book, but one who takes center stage, literally, and steals the show is Bertie's lifelong female friend, now a famous Hollywood star, the beautiful willful handful, Cora \\"Corky\\" Pirbright. I am madly in love with this character, and not just because she's a gorgeous celluloid ing&eacute;nue. Her ferocity of purpose is matched only by the nonchalance with which she pursues it. For instance, the way she gets Gussie to do her bidding would be cruel were it not carried off with such whimsy. Her honest friendship with Bertie, whom she clearly likes, is as refreshing as a spring breeze. Corky is actually kind. She tolerates an endless visit with a matronly fan, only later revealing to Bertie that the woman is the final and interminable authority on Hollywood. \\"She even knows how many times Artie Shaw has been married, which I bet he couldn't tell you himself. She asked if I had ever married Artie Shaw, and when I said No, seemed to think I was pulling her leg or must have done it without noticing. I tried to explain that when a girl goes to Hollywood she doesn't HAVE to marry Artie Shaw, it's optional...\\"As the story's climax approaches, Wodehouse takes the reader inside a small English village amateur show, a benefit for an extraordinarily tired church organ. The account is almost as long as the show; the master really takes his time. The funny thing is: every line. It's a tour de force, and exemplifies why we read PG Wodehouse. Not to rush to the finale, not to find out what happens, but to sit as one sits before a warm clear sunrise, to take in every word and phrase and let it slowly bring its own chuckling light into your heart.OK, I'll put a sock in it now. By the way, Plum uses that phase in this book just the way we use it today. I wonder if it's his creation."},{"Title":"The Mating Season","review":"If laughter is indeed the best medicine, then the collected works of Pelham Grenville Wodehouse should be prescribed by doctors as a matter of course. Like the proverbial pair of slippers or a warm cup of tea on a gray, rainy afternoon, the Jeeves & Wooster series is balm to any soul. One opens a Wodehouse like a bottle of something vintage: ready to be soothed and satiated. A snivelly critic once accused Wodehouse of publishing a book with all the \\"Wodehouse types\\" given new names. Wodehouse responded:\\"A certain critic-for such men, I regret to say, do exist-made the nasty remark about my last novel [Heavy Weather] that it contained \`all the old Wodehouse characters under different names'. He has probably by now been eaten by bears, like the children who made mock of the prophet Elisha; but if he still survives he will not be able to make a similar charge against Summer Lightning. With my superior intelligence, I have outgeneralled the man this time by putting in all the old Wodehouse characters under the same names. Pretty silly it will make him feel, I rather fancy.\\"How can you resist Wodehouse? So far as I'm concerned, he smote that critic's ruin on the mountainside. We don't read Wodehouse for his plots, though he does have a deft talent for keeping a story zipping along. Wodehouse is less concerned with what the story is about than with how he'll be about it. The Mating Season happens to find that classic duo, Wooster and Jeeves--the airheaded English aristocrat and his genius \\"gentleman's gentleman,\\" respectively--holed up for a spell in the foreboding Deverill Hall, seat of five formidable aunts. Wooster confesses:\\"On the cue \`five aunts' I had given at the knees a trifle, for the thought of being confronted with such a solid gaggle of five aunts, even if those of another, was an unnerving one. Reminding myself that in this life it is not the aunts that matter but the courage which one brings to them, I pulled myself together.\\"It may be difficult to write a gut-wrenchingly tragic book, but I dare say it's even more difficult to write a gut-bustingly funny one. No doubt that is why (to the great consternation of his contemporaries) Hillaire Belloc proclaimed Wodehouse the finest prose stylist of his epoch. Writers like Dostoevsky mirror the human heart. Writers like Wodehouse make the human heart rejoice. They are different but equal geniuses."},{"Title":"The Mating Season","review":"You can guess from the title this is about men and women!

P.G always delivers!! If you haven't read him don't wait!"},{"Title":"The Mating Season","review":"If there is a master of the feel-good book - one of those novels that elevates your mood every time you read a page - it must be P.G. Wodehouse. Yes, his stories may not be deep, but they are always delightfully entertaining. And nowhere is Wodehouse better than with his incomparable Jeeves and Wooster tales.These stories are typically narrated by Bertie Wooster, a well-meaning but not-too-bright fellow who tries to enjoy the life of the idle rich. Since he isn't all that sharp, he constantly gets into trouble, which is where his valet Jeeves steps in. In any crisis, the omniscient Jeeves is unflappable.The Mating Season again puts Bertie in the soup. This time, he is coerced by his fearsome Aunt Agatha into visiting Deverill Hall, a mansion filled with a bunch of elderly aunts; they aren't Bertie's aunts, but Agatha has given him a phobia about all such relations. Bertie's friend, Gussie Fink-Nottle, is also supposed to attend, but an unexpected incarceration spoils that. This threatens Gussie's engagement to Madeline Bassett, and Madeline has made clear that she intends to marry Bertie if ever Gussie doesn't work out. For Bertie, there is only one choice: he goes to Deverill Hall impersonating Gussie.Complications, of course, ensue. First of all, Gussie gets out of jail early and goes to Deverill Hall impersonating Bertie. Meanwhile, there is a tangle of romances that could still well-endanger Bertie's beloved bachelorhood. Corky Pirbright wants to be with Esmond Haddock, who in turn is wooing his cousin Gertrude (to make Corky jealous) who in turn is in love with Corky's brother, Catsmeat. Gussie falls for Corky, Catsmeat gets mixed up with the maid Queenie who is on the outs with the police constable Dobbs.This comic soap opera plays out perfectly with Wodehouse's adept plotting and even more adept use of language. The only bad part is it eventually must end. But until that conclusion is reached, there are few reading pleasures quite like a Wodehouse book."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the African American Soul: Celebrating and Sharing Our Culture, One Story at a Time (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"I am a person who really loves books.

From its opening story until the final chapter, the reader is standing in triumph of how wonderful we are as African Americans. CHICKEN SOUP FOR THE AFRICAN AMERICAN SOUL engages the readers with stories that inspire, empower and strengthen African-Americans.The stories are placed into categories that best suit the feelings that are trying to be invoked. The chapters include: From Strong Roots, Celebrating Family, Triumph and Resilience, Accepting Me Loving You, Praise, Worship and Prayer, Lessons Learned and Making A Difference. There are stories written by unknown authors and authors such as Maya Angelou, Leslie Banks, Tracy Price-Thompson, Dr. Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela. All the stories were wonderfully written and felt so timely in that they convey feelings of strength that one would garner from stories that relish in our beauty and strength as African Americans. Although I enjoyed all the stories presented, there were a few that really embraced me with their warmth they include: Fried Chicken and Collard Greens, More Alike Than Different, Cold Hands, Warm Heart, A Magical Moment With Ali and Life After Death.CHICKEN SOUP FOR THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN SOUL builds upon the foundation of strong, resilient and purposeful people. It illustrates that our strong groundwork has helped to make us the people that we are today. Through slavery, discrimination, poverty and statistics that have killed many of our dreams, we still persevere and this book reinforces the realness of the culture.

How touching and inspiring! I laughed and cried all of the way through. This is a book I would give as gifts and share with family for years to come. How wonderful to share the triumphs and heartaches we face as not just African Americans, but as people. These touching stories are enough to encourage even the lowest of spirits!"},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the African American Soul: Celebrating and Sharing Our Culture, One Story at a Time (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"I was literally brought to tears when I read the short story \\"Confessions of an Ex-Con\\". This was a very moving story. The title caught my eye. I was not expecting for this to effect me the way that it did. I was so moved that I let a friend of mine see this story. I made my 10 year old son and my 13 year old nephew read the article. They are trying to follow the crowd and this story was right on time. I am constantly showing this particular article to someone. Thank you so much for this story written by Dennis Mitchell. This story is so great because you know that it is true. You can feel the emotions as they come forth. It is good to know that other people experience the same things that you are sometimes exposed to, yet they can make a change in their life without fear of man but knowing that they must do this for themselves. I see that there is a turning point in everyones life, sometimes you just have to find it or it has to be reached in different ways. May God continue to bless you. You are truly an inspiration in my life and you are touching others life by sharing your story with us. Thank you and God Bless You!!!!!!!!!p.s. please write something else soon."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the African American Soul: Celebrating and Sharing Our Culture, One Story at a Time (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"I am a contributor to \\"Chicken Soup for the African American Soul\\" (\\"What Black History Means to Me\\").

The task seems daunting, but they soon discover there's some intricate, powerful magic in the family crest..Subsequently the treasure hunt hurtles along at breathtaking pace. The magic includes frequent trips into the turbulent (and dangerous) times of England's feudal past to discover the exact time and place where the treasure was hidden..This book and it's sequel (or prequel?!) &quot;Harding's Luck&quot; can't be recommended enough. They are children's classics of the nicest kind - not the least bit sirupy - but full of adventure and magic"},{"Title":"The House of Arden, (Children's illustrated classics)","review":"I got this and \\"Hardings Luck\\" one christmas about twentyfive years ago. These stories have stayed with me throughout my adult life and I have never forgotten how I was swept away by the stories. These books are educational while being simply spellbinding...my imagination went wild, back then. Absolutely a must!"},{"Title":"The House of Arden, (Children's illustrated classics)","review":"One of the delightful things about this book is that it treats children as thinking beings, yet still manages to contain all of the magic and adventure of childhood. As in all of her work, E. Nesbit tells an exciting story while encouraging the reader to consider the meaning of things. One of the best books written by one of the best children's writers of all time."},{"Title":"The House of Arden, (Children's illustrated classics)","review":"I was hoping to read this book to my 7 year old boy. It was heavy for him and somewhat slow. The book requires maturity and sophisticated vocabulary, somehow it does not fit the pace at which our kids live now.It certainly can be appreciated by an older, more mature kid, who loves the English language. It is beautifully written."},{"Title":"The House of Arden, (Children's illustrated classics)","review":"We now own three books published by the New York Review Children's Collection including The House of Arden. Our 10-year old daughter adores the fantasy and fun she finds inside its pages. Edred and Elfrida and their adventures in their time and place, the English countryside in the early 1800s, as well as their visits to their family's past as far back as James I sparked her imagination and her interest in history. I also highly recommend The Midnight Folk and The Box of Delights by John Masefield from the same publisher."},{"Title":"The House of Arden, (Children's illustrated classics)","review":"Here's the thing - most time travel adventures for younger readers are either really simple minded, (pick up the magic coin; walk through the magic mirror), or frustratingly complex, (bend the quanta fabric of time in an interdimensional black hole by tapping the alpha waves of your previous consciousness). It's hard to find a satisfying, understandable, exciting and plausible tale, much less find one with engaging characters, suspense, and a compelling framing story. Much less find all that with good writing and without any annoying cute add-ons, (talking monkey or funny alien companion).Well, as the reviews and comments attest, this may very well be the book you are looking for. Old, but not dated, sweet but not saccharine, well written but not overwritten, historical but not obscure, this is a solid addition to any library."},{"Title":"The House of Arden, (Children's illustrated classics)","review":"E. Nesbit is usually such a satisfying read--but not this one. There are too many lose ends, and did I mention a bad ending? Give this one a skip and stick to her more famous works."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"What a great book! I'm a big fan of Devin Alexander's recipes so I picked up this book and I'm totally loving it. Mostly healthy and fast (and yummy) recipes in this cookbook.I have a couple of quibbles that forced me to give the book 4 stars instead of 5. As another reviewer said, a grocery list would have been nice. But my biggest issue is that the recipes are not broken down into the Biggest Loser 4-3-2-1 pyramid that is mentioned in the front part of the book. I have to break the recipes down myself, which is a real pain!Also, a little too much info about the Biggest Loser contestants in the cookbook....I've never even seen the US version of the show, so it was neither helpful nor inspiring to me to read that a specific recipe was a contestant's favorite. However, I understand that this is in fact a \\"Biggest Loser\\" cookbook, so I can't complain about it all that much!But still, great recipes and I look forward to more of Devin's books!"},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"I absolutely loved this book. There are plenty of recipes that I will be cooking. The hints about cutting back and substituting certain items because of sodium or caleries was very helpful.The day I finished reading it my aunt looked through it and found many recipes that she liked. I gave her my book and ordered another one."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"Some of the recipes are really good - of the dozen or so that my husband and I have tried, there was only one that we said we wouldn't make again - I was really surprised that a \\"healthy\\" eating cookbook would offer so many options that taste good and easy to make. I also liked that they included the nutrition information on every page, and most have pictures with them. Overall, I am pretty pleased with this recipe book."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"This is honestly the BEST cookbook that I have ever owned. Most cookbooks I will use one or 2 recipes out of and thats it, but this one.. EVERY recipe that I have made so far (10 or so) has turned out PERFECT! Its so nice to have some healthy alternatives for my favorite foods AND some new things Ive never tasted before and have become an instant family favorite!I would recommend this cookbook to ANYONE.. whether you need to lose weight or not. Its just great food! :O)"},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"As a huge fan of The Biggest Loser and a fledgling at a new weight loss regime, I found this book a most helpful part of beginning my journey.The recipes are easy, great tasting and are not time consuming like other recipe books I have tried in the past. Be sure and check out Brian's Banana Split breakfast recipe - it is one of my staple meals! Thanks so much, Devin. Keep 'em coming!"},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"i think what i love most about this cookbook is that you are using real, everyday foods for a lot of the recipes. i believe the best diet is \\"everything in moderation\\" and that's exactly what this book gives you. you still can have foods you may love and there are other ways to make things you might have made before. i think the beginning is inspirational and i like the variety of recipes in here. great buy for an excellent price!"},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"The recipes in the book sound really good and many seem easy, however, not all of the recipes are simple. Also, there are a lot of fish recipes and I am not a big fan of fish."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"I've been using this cookbook for the last 4 days, and nearly EVERYTHING I've tried out of this book is SO good. Except for the grilled chicken pita (that dish is alright). The pancakes tasted different up front, but nevertheless, I cleaned the plate! Instead of blueberries, I used lingonberries. The meatball sandwich with the marinara sauce? HEAVEN!!!! I kept moaning with every bite like on TV! (Mmmmm!) The mushrooms stuffed with feta cheese? GREAT! Plus, I've lost like 1.5 pounds since New Year's Day! Even when you don't get the portion exactly right (four meatballs instead of three in the meatball sandwich recipe), it doesn't make your weight skyrocket because the food is not loaded with fat. So glad I bought this book!"},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"We approached the Biggest Loser Cookbooks in a backwards direction. We reviewed two others before getting to the initial The Biggest Loser Cookbook entry. We'd started with the Flavors of the World and the Quick & Easy cookbooks. Both were immensely disappointing. So I admit we have quite low expectations when we began testing this one.We were pleasantly surprised. There's a small amount of background, and character bios, before you get into the meat of the recipes, but not too much. I find it fairly silly that every recipe seems to have a photo of the CREATOR but not of the FOOD! I don't care what Wylie looks like. I want to see what his turkey goulash looks like.We tested out Mark's Southwest Omelet. It's 122 calories / 8g per serving with egg whites as well as a bunch of minced veggies. It's fairly quick, easy, and tasty. We were impressed by the egg white method and have begun to convert over to it now. It saves an impressive number of calories.Next was the Cocktail-Hour Tuna Tartare which does actually have a photo. This requires a TON of mincing plus quite expensive sashimi tuna. It ends up being at least $10/serving - and you also end up with lots of leftover mango and other items that you now have to find other uses for. Not that extra mango is bad, of course, but it means your actual shopping bill is far higher than $10/person.That being said, it was tasty :). But was it $10 tasty?The Spinach Skinny-Dip was not a hit for me, and I generally love spinach. The flavor was just off. Maybe it was the combination of sour cream and yogurt and mustard. I'm not quite sure.The easiest recipe in the set was the Hazelnut and Lemon Green Beans. Boil fresh green beans. Toast some hazelnuts, toss in a few other items. Done. This was tasty and we've made it since then. What gets me on this one is the snarky comment made about it. \\"I was hired by a well-known producer ... they offered me 300 dollars per person [to cater] ... I still can't look at [this dish] without seeing dollar signs.\\" What?? This is so opposite my own attitude in life that it is hard to even wrap my mind around it. Food should be about nourishing and helping people, not about \\"Ooooo I made $300 off of those people!!\\"Some recipes are fairly silly. A roast beef sandwich. Some are questionable. Pour nacho cheese sauce over nachos (and of course add in Jennie-O Turkey). But I suppose they want something for everyone. The people who are just learning to cook will have something they can try.Definitely this is FAR better than the other two Biggest Loser cookbooks we tested out. So that is a plus. But in terms of healthy eating, and actually \\"cooking\\" something, there is a mixed bag here. Some recipes are barely recipes. Some involve 30 minutes of mincing. I still don't understand why, if they were going to have a photo-book anyway, that they wasted all the space on the peoples' photos and not on dish photos. But in the end if you're someone who wants a real, physical book in your hands rather than googling the millions of healthy recipes that exist free on the web, then this does offer some good options.I purchased this book with my own money in order to write this review."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"I am seriously loving this book, I was skeptical at first because I considered it \\"diet food\\". Honestly though I can't tell a difference. I have made a few of the recipes and it is definitely helping me quick start my healthier eating journey."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"6/23/2008THE BIGGEST LOSER COOKBOOKMore than 125 Healthy, Delicious RecipesAdapted from NBC'S Hit ShowBy Chef Devin Alexander, et al(picture jacket here)A review by Marty MartindaleThe whole Biggest Loser concept is good, it seems, for these times, in that they have dealt with not only the food and its recipes, but a pyramid, general instruction for good sense and several graded workouts with Bob Harper and students on CD. This is a good program for these times when weight seems a problem for too many.The Biggest Loser Diet is \\"calorie-controlled, carbohydrate-modified, fat-reduced and high in protein (which controls hunger.)\\" They want you to eat three meals and two snacks each day. \\"The 4-3-2-1 Biggest Loser Pyramid\\" is four tiers, the base, or largest is fresh fruits and vegetables, the next level is protein foods, seafood, cheese, beans, fish and yogurt. The second from the top level is whole grains, your breads, cereals and wheat pasta. The top level, or \\"The Extras\\" are sweets with a 200 calorie daily limit. They have an equation for your calorie quota: if you weigh between 150 and 300, multiply your weight by seven, and this is the number of calories you should keep your maximum to. Some simple pointers: No white potatoes, limit amount of starchy vegetables such as pumpkin, winter squash, sweet potatoes and yams. Avoid dry fruits. Choose whole fruits over juices. Vary your proteins and limit red meat servings to two a week. Avoid processed cold cuts. There's a few more guidelines, but nothing too restrictive, really common sense.They divide the recipe section into Breakfasts, Hearty Snacks, Sandwiches-Soups-Stews, Sides & Salads, Main Courses and Sweet Snacks. Here's some examples:MANGO STRAWBERRY BREAKFAST SUNDAE: Calls for orange juice, ice cubes, honey and high-fiber, low-sugar cerealSUNRISE OATMEAL: Orange juice, oats, blueberries, water and orange extractBRIAN'S BREAKFAST SCRAMBLE: Green bell pepper, onion, tomato, egg whites, and Cheddar cheeseCOCKTAIL-HOUR TUNA TARTARE: Mango, cucumber, lime juice, cilantro, green onions and sesame oilJESSICA'S \\"THE RANCH\\" BLT WRAP: Turkey bacon, wheat tortilla, Galeo's Miso Caesar Dressing, lettuce and tomatoPB & J SPIRALS: Wheat flour tortilla, peanut butter and strawberry all-fruit spreadPAM'S COTTAGE CHEESE MARINARA: Cottage cheese, mozzarella cheese and spaghetti sauceJEN'S ASPARAGUS GUACAMOLE: Add sour cream, guacamole seasoning mix and tomato.INDIAN CHICKEN SALAD POCKETS: Mayonnaise, lime juice, curry paste, cucumber, red onion, wheat pita and lettuceMATT'S GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH: Rye bread, Cheddar cheese and oil sprayPARMESAN-PEPPER SWEET POTATO FRIES: Olive oil, garlic powder, paprika, cayenne and ketchup, if desired.DANA'S SPINACH AND FETA BROWN RICE: Onion, garlic and feta cheese.PARMESAN-ROASTED CAULIFLOWER: Parsley, garlic powder and olive oilFRESH AND COLORFUL JICAMA SLAW: Cucumber, carrots, cilantro, lime juice, olive oil and red pepper flakesBROCCOLI SALAD WITH SWEET VINAIGRETTE: Orange juice, plain yogurt, mustard, orange marmalade and red onionHOT AND COLD BROWN-RICE SALAD: Chicken, broccoli florets, bell pepper, red onion, Italian dressing, and balsamic vinegarDARI'S PICANTE CHICKEN: Picante sauce, cream cheese and Cheddar cheeseHEATHER'S MEXICAN ROLLUP: Ground turkey, extra-lean, wheat tortilla, sour cream, romaine, tomato and salsaANGEL HAIR WITH ROCKIN' RED CLAM SAUCE: Onion, garlic, baby clams, tomatoes, oregano, olive oil, red-pepper flakes and Parmesan cheeseICED BUFFED MOCHA: Powdered coffee, chocolate soy milk, vanilla yogurt, Splenda, fat-free whipped topping and cocoa powderRASAH AND EDWIN'S WARM GRAPEFRUIT DESSERT: Add ground cinnamon and bake.TIFFANY'S CANDIED ALMONDS: Butter spray, almonds, cinnamon and SplendaIn a world where too many are jeopardizing their health by carrying too much weight, the whole Biggest Loser program, the exercises, advice and recipies are well worth considering.You can reach Marty Martindale at Food Site of the Day.Special interests: Healthy Living"},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"I really hated to cook. My idea of cooking was grabbing my laminated folder of takeout menus and ordering a variety of fast food and Chinese takeout. But after doing that for the past five years I am three sizes larger and my stretch pants are about to split the seams. Even worse, the money I spent on meals out I could have saved and taken a trip to Paris.A friend suggested I find a cookbook that was easy, healthy (no missing food groups) and had single serving portions. After sitting on the floor in my bookstore and perusing tons of diet cookbooks, I decided to give this one a try.The recipes are for one or two servings. I can eat one and save the other to reheat or take for lunch. It's also the first book I have found that has simple recipes (not twenty hard to find ingredients) and makes healthier versions of fast food favorites.I love that I can make my own version of an egg muffin sandwich (instead of the one at Starbucks), BBQ chicken pizza (I was always ordering that one from a local pizza joint), a grilled cheese sandwich (my favorite with tomato soup) and more.I am a chocolate freak so the frozen hot chocolate idea was new to me, and I love the chocolate mousse parfait.The author Devlin Alexander lost 55 pounds and has kept them off for over a decade. This book is so good and easy to use that I am going to buy all her other books and keep adding one or two recipes to my meal plan each week. Instead of planning my takeout orders each day, I now make a meal plan on Sunday, then cook up and freeze meals in single portions ahead of time.I never thought I would use anything other than my microwave to nuke leftover takeout food. Now my stove is getting a real workout. And I am saving for a trip to Paris at the end of the year to buy me a slinky designer black dress."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"Although the recipes are easy and delicious, having a family of four, who all could benefit from this book, I found it geared to the individual. Most of the recipies are for a single serving. I was hoping to get some family friendly recipes to incorporate into my everyday life. It's probably not going to be my \\"go to\\" cookbook on a regular basis, because I will have to adapt most recipies for the family."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"I just received this book for Christmas and couldnt wait to sit and read through it. The beginning part of this book is very informational about the biggest loser diet and how they acutally lose the weight on the show. It truly is about eating healthier and it will tell you what to avoid and what is good. But the one thing I love the most about this is the serving sizes. Most of the recipes are for 1 serving. This is so helpful to me because with most other weight loss books I struggle with trying to figure out the correct serving size without over eating. This is a great book and highly recommended for anyone who is wanting to just eat healthier!"},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"I found the Biggest Loser Cookbook at my local library. I watch the Biggest Loser on TV, but this book was a disappointment. I thought it would be healthier.First off, they recommend fat free and/or low fat mayo. Has anyone actually read the list of ingredients on some fat free products? Yuck, not for me!And in the beginning of the book, it's recommended to stay away from artificial sugars, but the first recipe included reduced fat peanut butter and artificially sweetened yogurt. The breakfast recipes are full of artificial sweeteners!I don't agree with their advice to stay away from white potatoes and limit other starch veggies like yams, pumpkin, squash. And I really didn't agree with the formula for calculating your daily calorie intake: Multiply weight x 7. If you only have 10 pounds to lose, that's way too low!I still gave the book 3 stars, because I did find a few of their recipes to be interesting. I was happy to find all the recipes I liked online - just google and you'll find them!I don't really recommend this book, unless you are into all that fat free artificial stuff! I suppose Hungry Girl fans would like it, but admittedly, I like to eat \\"clean.\\""},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"Okay, this is a cute, fun, easy cookbook and some of the things are definitely yummy. However, I wouldn't live by it. It's okay to use if you are severely overweight if it will help you drop a few.But if you're looking to maintain for life or just have a bunch of go to healthy recipes, a good portion of this book should be avoided.For example, the banana creme breakfast thingy calls for artificially sweetened boston cream yogurt. We all know that aspartame is really bad for you and that splenda with its sugar alcohols can really upset your tummy. (If you have an onset of inexplicable gas -- I'd point to sucralose or maltitol as the culprits -- seriously, not fun) Second of all, it calls for low fat peanut butter. Peanuts are a high fat food..and peanut butter should contain...well...peanuts, right? So, if the fat is getting cut out..something else is getting put in - most likely chemicals or trans-fats like CORN SYRUP SOLIDS, FULLY HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE OILS (RAPESEED AND SOYBEAN), MONO- AND DIGLYCERIDES (I pulled that directly from the label of low fat JIF). Mono/diglycerides are animal derived and are used to emulsify and frankly, have too many syllables to be a chemical I want to consume frequently."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"I've watched a few episodes of the Biggest Loser and was curious about what the show offered as sample recipes. However, I would not recommend any from this book as they are very high in sodium. I was surprised to see this as I thought they would be healthier. I suggest that you buy a lot of vegetables and broil your meats if you are interested in losing weight. Keep it simple. Make salads and measure all of the ingredients you use, especially salad dressing (lots of calories and sodium in most of those). Even better, make your own dressing or just use olive oil and vinegar. I recommend the Harvard School of Public Health Healthy Eating Pyramid:[...]It's easier to understand and more accurate than the USDA food pyramid, which makes no sense at all since they changed it.I ended up checking out this book from the library and I suggest you should too, if you can stomach the salt. Otherwise, save your money for food."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"I am an incredibly picky eater and usually if I get 1 or 2 recipes out of a cookbook that I buy I'm pretty lucky. I'm pretty \\"plain jane\\" when it comes to food. The Biggest Loser Cookbook is the perfect book for me because it takes a lot of those basic meals that I love and makes them healthier. I've even learned enough from the book that I can make adaptions and play around with the recipes to create even more great meals for myself and my family.Some of our favorite recipes from the book are the Open Faced Burritos, the Almost Fast Food Burger, the Picante Chicken, the roast beef sandwich, the breakfast sausages, and the turkey roll-ups. We haven't gotten through them all yet but we're working our way through the book.I would DEFINITELY recommend this book if you're a picky eater or you're one of those people who doesn't like a lot of extra stuff in their food.

I was a little hesitant about buying the book. I have a ton of cookbooks at home and only get one or two recipes out of them. So far I have enjoyed many of the recipes out of this book. The pictures are wonderful, and the recipes are easy to follow. I like the fact that my 9 year old daughter enjoys the food out of this cookbook as well. She even likes picking out recipes for me to cook for her! There is nothing \\"Bland\\" in this cookbook. I can't believe that these foods are low fat and healthy. I made the meatloaf recipe the other day. I gave a portion to my mother. She called back after she had it for dinner and told me that it was the best meatloaf she ever had. It does take some planning and time to get these recipes together. Most of the ingredients are easy to find. I think this book would be good for anyone who just wants to eat healthier. I don't have a lot of weight to lose, about 30 lbs, and since I've been cooking all my meals from this book, about 3 weeks, I have already lost 7 lbs.

I was a little weary of ordering a \\"healthy\\" cookbook. I use quotations because the recipes do not taste \\"healthy\\" for you at all!

I was VERY impressed with this book. I have found a few \\"new favorites\\" and a few that I may never try (not much on sorbet or frozen drinks- that's right, desserts too).This cookbook also has a lot of healthy tips that I have been able to use with other recipes.

I didn't want to go on any dramatic diet and miss out on anything. However, this book is not a typical diet book. I don't have to restrict myself for weeks, I don't have to follow a good or bad food list. Its just about making minor swaps. I can enjoy a blt, turkey sandwiches, french fries, spicy meatballs with half the calories. I love this book! I'm losing weight and eat good food! My fav recipes....blt, turkey rollups, and the southwestern omelette."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"this book had a lot of good recipes that work in the real world.

Every one of them has been easy to make and tastes delicious. The servings sizes are for 1-2 servings on most of the recipes (some 4-6), which is great for single people that do not want to have leftovers for a week. One of the desserts is so good that my entire family is hooked. I have eaten foods that I normally stayed away from but now I'm addicted to.

According to my husband I have a slight addiction to cookbooks but this cookbook I would not have looked at since I'm not looking to be the Biggest Loser. My coworker (who is a fitness attict) brought it in to work and I started to look at it. I was hooked and had to purchase it myself. I have made 3 meals so far and they are healthy, SIMPLE, and small portion sizes so you don't always have to cook a meal for 8. This cookbook is for anyone who wants to cook a nutritious meal that they do not have to feel guilty about in the morning. Then I also have the Paula Deen collection for the other days!!"},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"I'm not a great cooker to be honest!! I found this book really easy to follow ,well explained, I gave it 4 stars becaus i thnk that all the participants stories should go in a different book and not in a cook book ,it could have saved more pages to add more recipes but It's highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"Had this book for about a month. 3 or 4 nights a week we eat from this book.

Top notch in my mind!"},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"I never watched the TV show but I've been teaching myself to cook this year. I bought the book after reading so many wonderful online reviews and I have to say, I really love it. I've tried eight recipes so far and have five others marked off to try. The food is weirdly filling for a diet cookbook. :) Try the breakfast sausages, the Thin-N-Crispy BBQ Chicken Pizza Snack Wedges (substantial enough for lunch) and the Indian Chicken Salad Pockets. I also liked how the recipes were for one, and how some snacks were really easy throw-togethers for when I don't feel like actually turning on an appliance. Please come out with a Biggest Loser Cookbook 2 and I'll be first in line."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"Today we had Individual Sausage Rigatoni Bake, which despite the name, easily serves 2 hungry people. Homemade sausage, whole wheat pasta, low fat and calorie and highly delicious!We've also made Dari's Picante Chicken (also great), Biggest Winner Breakfast Sausage (good) and Parmesan Roasted Cauliflower (good). Can't wait to try some new ones!This book fits in very well with the Weight Watchers program my husband and I are following. All the nutritional information we need to calculate our points is right there on each recipe page. I just mark the points right in the book so we won't have to do any calculations the next time. In the last 9 weeks we've lost 19 and 18 pounds respectively. Go US!"},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"The majority of the recipes in this cookbook are single servings so if you are by yourself you won't over eat, but it is also easy to multiply the recipe to serve many others. It didn't forget the flavor in this healthy cookbook either, like so many other do!"},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"The recipes seem to repeat themselves and don't have a great variety among them. When eating healthy, I try to find a variety of tastes in recipes and this book didn't seem to have them. Great on desert ideas though. And the recipes are simple enough. I do prefer the Light and Tasty recipes or Quick and Easy recipes better."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"This cookbook is great! It actually has stuff in it that you'd eat and the number of servings are small. Nothing worse than having a recipe for 6 or 8 servings, when no one in the house will eat the same things you do, even if you weren't on a diet!!! The recipes are low calorie, low fat & high in fiber. Works well with the Weight Watchers program too."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"Love this book, the recipes are easy, realistic, and taste great. The only complaint is that I wish there were more of them - while there are many sections (breakfast, snacks, dinners), I wish there were even more options so I could use it like the old gingham Betty Crocker cookbook with its hundreds of recipes that can go on and on for months."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"This book is sorely lacking in good \\"normal\\" recipes. It seems to reinvent wraps and omelets in a ton of different ways, but nothing really interesting or the recipes contain ingredients that I wouldn't have on hand.

This is a great book for those beginning on a healthy journey...very attainable. I prefer a more all natural way of eating the majority of the time, so I wouldn't suggest that this is the beat-all, end-all healthy eating resource as it has a lot of unnatural products with un-pronounceable ingredients, etc...also, some that have sugar and gluten, etc...so if one has a specific diet, substitutions will need to be made.BUT,again, for a beginning, or even for someone like me who normally does eat really well, but falls off the wagon during the holidays, etc, this is a great way to get back to realistic portions an goals, in a way that is fairly easily attainable product wise and time wise for our society."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"I have made most of the recipes in this cookbook without any trouble. I am not an experienced cook, but I have successfully created these dishes with ingredients that are easy to find at almost any grocery store. For low-calorie food, it is really tasty.

I encourage you to get this book...it will change your life!!The only thing I didn't appreciate, had nothing to do with the book, itself. When I received the book, the inside of the box was wet, and it damaged my book. Apparently, someone had spilled their coffee into the box, and never bothered to replace it with a clean, dry one, before shipping it to me. I can't do much about replacing this, however, because these are in limited supply...get one, while you can!!!"},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"I was very happy with my purchase.

I really enjoy the show, and there are several really good recipes, but that are many that were a disappointment. You also need to be careful with calories and fat content on several of the recipes. My recommendation is to purchase Chris Carmichael's book \\"5 Essentials for a Winning Life\\". It has some challenging recipes, but they are very good and you can feel the difference when you eat correctly.I guess the main thing to remember is that everyone is different, so what works for me may not work for you.

The recipes are simple to prepare and easy on the budget. I lost 40+ pounds using this book and the weight loss book. The food is delicious compared to other diets I've tried and don't take hours or weird ingredients to prepare. I was a college student when I first began using this book and found it could fit any lifestyle which is definitely necessary when attempting long-term, sustainable weight loss.I did the weight loss program with my mother who is about 30 years older than I am and she achieved average sucess (she does have metabolism issues) so if you're a special case in terms of weight loss, you may want to look for something more tailored to your specific needs.

I am eating healthier and feeling better. The food is really good. I love all the extra tips that Bob Harper and Kim Lyons give through out the book.

I was surprised at how excellent all the recipes were and how much weight I lost just sticking to the ideas in the book.

However, I am lactose intolerant and most of the recipies involve dairy products. So I only gave a three star rating. I do recommend this cookbook for anyone that wants to loose weight and is not lactose intolerant."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"The recipes used in this book are above and beyond how I usually cook. I'm definitely a down-home type cook and these are definitely fancier than my husband and I every eat. We're willing to try some of these recipes, but I was hoping for some recipes that aren't as \\"high-class\\" as what the majority of these recipes are. If you enjoy experimenting and trying a lot of new, more exotic recipes, these would be great!! Unfortunately, I'm not that experimental and I will probably just use the Biggesst Loser calorie counter book and keep track of my calories that way."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"I was expecting more recipes from the dietitians and other experts. But it mostly had recipes from contestants."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"Wow!! So far I've made at least 10 dishes from this cookbook and I am really impressed!! The ingredients are usually very easy to find and for the most part each recipe only requires a few ingredients. The recipes are mostly made for 1-4 servings which is convenient if you are single or if you are just cooking healthy for yourself and not for your whole family. I have been scaling the recipes up (if necessary) to make enough for my whole family and they are just as impressed by the meals even though they aren't trying to lose weight!! Since eating more wholesome meals I feel more full, more energetic and and just better overall."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"This is a great book.

It has great recipes. I like the fact that most are for one serving as opposed to having 6 to 8 servings and then having to divide everything into one portion sizes. It will tell you just how their diet works and how to incorporate for yourself. I have been following it with much success!!"},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"This is a great Cookbook! I use it all the time. The only problem is the servings. Most recipes are portioned for only one or two servings. I cook for a family of 5.

So many have recipes that take too much time or require special ingredients. When I had renewed this book the maximum allowed times, I knew I should buy it! The recipes in here are mostly quick and easy. The photos are great (I wish there were more!). Plus, I love that these recipes, on the whole, make enough food for 1-2 people. Since I'm only cooking for two, it's nice not to have mountains of leftovers. If you're looking for a great, health-conscious cookbook for real people, this is a great choice!"},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"This has great recipes!

As far as I'm concerned, though, the recipes in this \\"cookbook\\" have more in common with Sandra Lee's semi-homemade concoctions than they do with actual edible food. Plus, Sandra Lee at least gets drunk and is fairly amusing.Avoid. Really want to learn how to cook a delicious, healthy meal? Get a copy of How to Cook Everything by Mark Bittman, learn how to season properly, and recognize the value of real healthy food versus shortcuts used with Nacho Cheez you can buy at Walgreens."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"The cookbook had too many recipes with sugar subsitutes, sugar free and other foods you might not eat.

This book wasn't for me. I was really excited to finally own a healthy cookbook but when I went through all the recipes I was actually disappointed. And no I am NOT a picky eater. The only thing I found appetizing was some spinach and cheese dish by Mo. I guess it is my fault for thinking I had the time or money to cook. Hopefully I can return this book and get The Biggest Loser's Quick and Easy one...or search the internet for an endless supply of recipes."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"This is a fantastic cookbook. I really don't read any of the stories or weight loss tips in the book. I buy it simply to get more of Devin Alexander's recipes. (However, having said that, many of these recipes are repeated in other Biggest Loser cookbooks and/or are past contestant recipes.)BIG HUGE GIGANTIC DISAGREEMENT with the daily calories that they suggest you use. Page 2 under the section \\"Calories Really Do Count\\" (why, yes they do!) it states that \\"If you weigh between 150 and 300 pounds, multiply your present weight by 7. That number is your caloric goal for each day on the Biggest Loser Diet.\\" Perhaps if I was on the ranch and was monitored by doctors and personal trainers 24/7, but that is not going to work out here in the real world. As a woman who weighs 156 lbs, that means I get a whopping 1092 calories a day. You need to currently weight 172 lbs to even break 1200 calories a day (the generally accepted recommended daily caloric limit.) Please, please, please do not try to live on less than 1200 calories a day. It's unnecessary and dangerous."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"I ordered this book after checking it out from the local library. I liked how many of the recipes are single servings. As someone who is only cooking for one, it is nice to be able to not have to eat left-overs for every meal. I am not sure how \\"healthy\\" the recipes are, but they are easy to make, many only have a few ingredients and some spices."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"I received this cook book promptly and the recipes are fantastic. I love having pictures along with the recipes."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"Based on the NBC hit show \\"The Biggest Loser,\\" this colorful cookbook is a plus to anybody's library that is trying to lose weight or even just eat healthy. The promise of the book is that eating healthy can be quick and delicious AND it doesn't have to mean bland, tasteless food- and the book delivers.Readers will find a short review of the Biggest Loser's way to lose weight- which is sensible- you eat right and exercise. Then comes the heart of the book- over 100 recipes for the various meals like breakfast, snacks, etc. And unlike a lot of cookbooks, each recipe shows you exactly how many calories, fat grams, protein grams, carb grams, fiber grams, sodium, and cholesterol it contains- which is nice for a wide variety of other populations such as those with diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease.A sensible and practical cookbook, a lot of people will probably get their money's worth.

I've spent a LOT of time and money researching ways to lose weight healthily and tastily. I'm not a big cook and most of the cookbooks I have bought recently left my mouth-watering but not satisfied.Not so with this cookbook! The recipes are the simplest things I've ever made. I made the Not Really Fried Rice this last weekend, and it was so simple and tasty! Tonight, we are eating the Jerk Salmon. My favorite things to snack on to satisfy my sweet tooth are the graham-wiches. They are so tasty and so low in calories I don't have to worry about it!I've never counted calories before so the first week was a little hard for me to get used to - that and being careful about what I eat. But now, I feel like a pro and have total confidence on what I put into my body! Plus, the recipes have really added some 'spice' to our otherwise boring and mundane meal-plan.I have both the Biggest Loser Weight Loss Program and now the cookbook. I have lost four pounds in the last two weeks. I highly recommend this cookbook for anyone wanting to lose weight and do it healthily! This is a great investment in your health!"},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"Last year I weighed 530 pounds. After being inspired by the TV show The Biggest Loser, I have lost 140 pounds so far. I still have about 200 more pounds to go. I KNOW that with recipes and meals like the ones featured in this book, that I will be able to reach my weight loss goals. The thing that I appreciate most about this cookbook is that the recipes are simple and easy to follow. I am a bachelor and am not an experienced cook but this book makes me look like a pro. I have been asked by so many people how I've lost the amount of weight that I have. The answer is simple...eat less (make healthier food choices and portion control), move more (daily exercise) and drink lots of water. The Biggest Loser has shown me how to lose my weight - The Biggest Loser Cookbook is helping to keep me going!! PS The Blueberry Pancakes are out of this world! Yumm!!"},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"I was disappointed in this book, though the other reviews should have served as a warning. This book contains a lot of information about the \\"plan\\" - diet and exercise - and the show - trainers and contestants - before it gets to the recipes. Once you get to the recipes, quite a few of them show the influence of the author's other cookbook seeming almost fast-food like, while still others, coming from the contestants themselves show their own styles and preferences. For that reason, there were fewer recipes that really excited me than I had hoped. Still, there are some definite \\"keepers\\" and if you are a fan of the show, you will like this book."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"at how much I like this book. It has recipes in it that are good and good for you, even if you are not struggling (too much) with weight.The book includes over 125 recipes developed by a chef who was well known as a celebrity chef for her good tasting but still good for you recipes.I gave this 4 stars because there is a section in the beginning that profiles all the people who have been on The Biggest Loser, which was not my favorite part of the book, but for the TV show fans, they might like it. And, there is another chapter that is listed as the Biggest Loser exercise plan, but it really does not go into any depth at all, and just mentions how good exercise is for you.However, then you get to the other chapters, beginning with the 4-3-2-1 food pyramid, which guides you to how many servings of each food group are suggested if you want to plan a menu. That makes it pretty easy to plan. The rest of the chapters are Breakfasts; Hearty Snacks; Sandwiches, Soups and Stews; Sides and Salads; Main Courses; and Sweet Snacks. This is the real \\"meat\\" of the book (pun intended). Some recipes were not to my taste, but some, like the Breakfast Sausage or the Ground Turkey Nachos, or especially the Chicken Lettuce Wraps, are quite good tasting.There are photos of some, but not all of the foods, but each offering does have calorie and nutrition counts included.This could be a good addition to your cookbook shelf(ves), if you are looking for a calorie minded, but real food cookbook."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"I don't cook, but I have found Ms. Alexander's recipe's to be easy to follow and very tasty too!

I didn't have a lot to lose, but for me, it helps me maintain and stay healthy. There is not one recipe I have made that I didn't like. There is so much variety with breakfast, snacks, lunch and dinner recipes that you really can't go wrong.

I got this book because I'm a college student and I don't have time to play around when it comes to making my meals. I refuse to eat out anymore. Not only for my weight, but more so because ppl are nasty when it comes to handling your food.I started off by making the PB and J wrap...it was very good. I eat them all the time. Then i started making the Sausage patties. I tried pork, then i starts turkey meat instead, taste much better. The California Bacon Burger is great. and the Spinach and Feta Rice is nice. I like that they urge you to throw some flavors in there without too much fat. That Breakfast Section with the Biggest Winner Sausage is the best. I eat the Breakfast sandwich every morning, and when i run out of english muffins i eat it open faced with wheat bread."},{"Title":"The Biggest Loser Cookbook: More Than 125 Healthy, Delicious Recipes Adapted from NBC's Hit Show","review":"There were a few interesting recipes in it.

The truth of the matter is that the book's purpose is to reinvent favorite flavors and dishes...not create new ones. I use the book quite often, and modify the dishes as I see fit which is great because there are times where I get the caloric values even lower while improving the flavor. The results are fantastic. Since mid-December of 2007, I've lost 87lbs!!! I keep my calories around 1200 a day and use the Biggest Loser Workout DVDs daily. I've gone from 420lbs. to 333lbs.

Rockwell Kent tells of us of another type of adventure, the day to day living on remote Fox Island off Seward, in Alaska. The small pleasures, the difficult trips in an open boat to get supplies, the child's sweetness in his friendship with a magpie, all these and more stories are told in a daily journal. And illustrated as Kent always does, with insight and style. Kent as a writer is equal to Kent as an artist, intellectual and candid in his telling a story and sharing impressions. If this is your first reading of a Kent book, you have a long list of other books ahead for this was his first book done as a &quot;first person&quot; storyteller. His desire for remote and wild landscapes to paint took him, and then takes us, through his work, to many other places over many decades. But none are any more delightful and majestic than this trip to Alaska. To check out the validity of this remote place, I took a trip to Fox Island several years ago, and though I didn't see it in the winter as Rockwell and his son did, it was dramatic, beautiful and matched the feeling I'd gotten when I first read the book years ago. The nice touch of this edition is that the editor, Doug Capra, has a very fine introduction to the book and Capra knows his subject. He has been researching Kent for years, but more than that, he has something to say and says it well. Few Kent editors do. But the book--it makes a wonderful Christmas gift because it has a really fine description of what a meaningful Christmas celebration can be in a remote place, shared with a hermit on the island, the father and little boy. There are some delightful details in this story: the food taken for the trip; the books for father and son; the rigerous baths when the bay freezes and the ice cold waters no longer are available. Kent is no ordinary artist, writer or father. And this is no ordinary adventure. It makes you wish, even yearn, for that place, that time, those people. I knew Rockwell Kent in the final few years of his life and he still carried that energtic view of life, that love of beauty and nature that comes alive in this small work. And three cheers to Doug Capra for bringing this new edition to life for it is of the quality for which Kent was famous in his published books. (A wretched edition of this treasure of a story was published a few years before and this edition puts to rest a Kent lover's dispair about having a bad edition of a Kent work on the shelves, any shelves. I almost never throw books away but this earlier paperback with bad design from cover to cover merits polluting a garbage pail.) So, invest in some good reading, some laughs and some wistful thoughts about what a wilderness adventure could be. And for those who have courage, still can be."},{"Title":"Wilderness;: A journal of quiet adventure in Alaska","review":"You can pick this book off your library shelf any time, open it to any page, start at any paragraph and begin to feel a mantle of peace settle over your jangled nerves. &quot;Wilderness&quot; is the record of artist Rockwell Kent and his 9-year-old son spending a winter in Alaska on Fox Island in Resurrection Bay, near Seward, with only one elderly Swede as a neighbor.

Except for the occasion, unknowing, encounters with Kent's illustrations--for Moby Dick, for Shakespeare, for Random House--I was completely unaware of Rockwell Kent or his work until the Portland (ME) Art Museum had a summer retrospective of his work--including paintings from the Pushkin Museum--a couple years ago. The immediately seized my imagination. They work much like the symphonies of Sibelius work, vast expanses of barren landscape, as intimidating as they are compelling. It was with such a background that I purchased Wilderness. What an intriguing story: a father goes to Alaska to paint (and create a set of illustrations for Nietsche's Zarathustra) and, with his wife's permission, takes their 9 year old son (also named Rockwell) along for the company and the sheer adventure of it. How amazing is that? How envious of the young Rockwell I am. What hay would I have made of such an opportunity to escape the world with my father for seven months on the verge of puberty and participate in an adventure I'd wonder at the rest of my life. No wonder the book was a best seller upon its publication (1920). No wonder the book was compared, hyperbolically I'll admit, to Whitman's Leaves of Grass in terms of its potential influence on American literature. The 1996 edition by Wesleyan University Press includes many additional illustrations, including some of young Rockwell's drawings and letters. Altogether, a very satisfying experience. It does exactly what it set out to do."},{"Title":"Wilderness;: A journal of quiet adventure in Alaska","review":"Make sure this is the last of the Rockwell Kent books you read....It is nothing in comparison to his others (I have not yet read Salamina). Self-exiled (somewhat) to an island south of Seward, AK with his 9-year-old son and an old Scandinavian down a piece, we see how this fellow slowly develops a case of apparent \\"cabin fever\\" (who wouldn't -- except his neighbor -- who has his goats to keep him company) His illustrations are so-so,and he seems to be increasingly fascinated with his son's nakedness, which he likes to sketch and load this book up with. We are told by him that he is constantly stretching canvases and painting, but we see only one painting on the cover of the book.Rockwell Kent, for sure was a strange fellow, and I presume his interest in his son's anatomy is really an artistic one, but it does seem to become a bit of a fixation as the sojourn draws near and they make ready to return to wife and mother back in the lower 48. The book may be of interest to a psychologist studying human isolation and miserable weather, but for the rest, unless you are a devotee of naked children, it is not really worth the candle.."},{"Title":"Wilderness;: A journal of quiet adventure in Alaska","review":"I found this book to be very informative about the land and extream weather of Alaska but it ran a little dry quickly. This is a journal of around 9 months of Rockwell kents life while in Alaska. I have read other books that were written from journals and Kents does fair better then most. I can understand that a journal in Alsaka can run out of new and interesting things to write about and this book seemed to try to fill in the gaps with Kents thoughts and many philosophies. All in all I do recomend this book to anyone who really want a real veiw of what Alaska is actually like."},{"Title":"ENEMY OF GOD","review":"When Father Frank Redmond plunges from the roof of a four-story building in the toughest part of New York City, his closest friends do not believe that his death is suicide. Gabe Driscoll, Chief of Internal Affairs for the New York Police Department, and Andrew Troy, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, decide to conduct their own investigation. They, along with Earl Finley, an assistant district attorney, were on a championship swimming team with Frank Redmond when they were in high school, and though thirty years have passed, the four friends have stayed in New York and kept in touch.Recreating the early lives of the four men, Robert Daley shows how each has developed into the adult he has become, emphasizing their early idealism, their dreams for the future, their belief in the purity of romantic love, and their commitment to the teachings of the Catholic Church. As they have matured, they have all been forced to deal with life's complex realities, and all but Father Frank have left the church. All have discovered that idealistic dreams do not often come true, that compromises must be made, and that love, marriage, and sex do not always happen in that order or lead to eternal happiness.As the narrative switches from present to past and back again, the reader, like Driscoll and Troy, searches for clues which would explain the death of the priest, who served three tours of duty in Vietnam and then ten years as a missionary in Africa. Troy, too, was in Vietnam, writing for his newspaper, and he worked in Africa at the same time as Father Frank. Earl Finley, meanwhile, has brought down a corrupt Congressman and has recently challenged a Mafia capo. The priest, who loved Finley's wife when they were college students, has personally removed a violent gun dealer from his neighborhood, and in recent months has had several unexplained bank deposits and withdrawals. Who might have wanted the priest dead, and why, are the questions which generate the suspense here.With the emphasis on characters, rather than plot, the mystery wanders a bit, and the reader is not always sure why so much background is provided for the four friends and whether it contains clues to Father Frank's death. The conclusion ties up the loose ends and explains the novel's ironic title, but the resolution comes about through sudden, unexpected twists of fate, rather than as a natural outgrowth of the characters' backgrounds. Still, the novel is an intriguing look at the complex life of a contemporary priest, an entertaining summer read. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"ENEMY OF GOD","review":"Perhaps the Publisher's Weekly reviewer missed the significance of the title of Daley's book, The Enemy of God. There were complaints about its being cliche-ridden, characters who did not come to life and a lack of charting of their relationships over the years. Probably the most important part of this book was its suggestion that these characters had been stultified by their being raised in such a conservation, rigid Catholic faith that they were unable to develop later in life and kept all manner of intimacies from each other in fear. The improbably extreme, for today anyhow, priest-in-charge was more unbelievable than those of the DAs, politicians and mobsters. However, if one reads the book as a struggle with the Catholic faith, these other issues pale as symbols beside a much more powerful moral struggle for all the characters' hearts, souls and minds."},{"Title":"ENEMY OF GOD","review":"This novel, by Robert Daley, is outstanding.

City Priest who shared a moment of glory in the 1950's with four other boys at a Jesuit High School. As adults, the other boys turned out to be a policeman, an assistant D.A. and a newspaper reporter. When Father Redmond falls to his death off a N.Y. rooftop, his surviving friends try to determine if it was suicide or murder, given Father Redmond's controversial priesthood. We see the story pieced together by way of chapter-long flashbacks. While intriguing, the ending of the book left me feeling like I had been cheated."},{"Title":"ENEMY OF GOD","review":"Gabe Driscoll, Earl Finley, Andrew Troy and Frank Redmond are the crux of an award-winning swim team at Fordham Prep in New York, bonded by their athletic victories, Catholic religion and easy friendship. These boys will grow up to be Chief of Internal Affairs, a prosecutor with an eye on public office, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and a priest. But on a cold day in Harlem, Father Redmond plunges to his death in his parish, leaving Gabe Driscoll and Andy Troy to determine the cause of death, suicide or murder. Father Frank's demise awakens the past for the now middle-aged men, the sweet memories of their years together still fresh, making the death all the more painful and suspicious.The quest for resolution takes on a life of its own, as Driscoll mines his police sources for an investigation of anyone who might have wanted Redmond out of the way, drug dealers or gang members, perhaps. Regardless of their efforts, the cop and the journalist are hard-pressed to learn anything helpful about their friend, who is a cipher, his monastic life devoid of clues. The truth of the matter is revealed in flashbacks to the earlier years of these men, from their youth to their adult lives, the more private aspects of each, the disappointments and moral dilemmas that define them.Although this is a tough story, years of friendship shared from Catholic school through careers and marriages, there is great energy in the telling, the school years, the Vietnam experience, generational changes that affect the kind of men they become. Shifting from past to present, it is easy to identify with their history of youthful dreams and the lessons learned along the way. Daley writes as if he knows this territory intimately, and for that reason, the characters and plot are entirely believable.Daley's story is particularly affecting, as these four men are so like their generation, although they are not as familiar with the women in their lives. This, perhaps, is the fatal flaw in the investigation: Driscoll and Troy have looked at Frank's world through their own eyes, a prism that is distorted by its very maleness. It is the women who are most intuitive, who have watched Father Redmond in all his flawed humanity, felt compassion for his struggles as a man and a priest. From the Bronx to Harlem, from Vietnam to Africa, the novel follows friendship in all its permutations; but it is those unexpected moments of loss, inexplicable events that question how well one man really knows another and just how much of this road is tread irrevocably alone. Luan Gaines/2005."},{"Title":"ENEMY OF GOD","review":"The Publisher's Weekly comment that the twist at the end of this novel is not credible is understated. (Poorly written sentence, I know; but I received no huge advance for this one.) This rather mundane work is flawed. Simply put, the reader should get his/her money back on this one.I give it one star because i had to.i felt cheated."},{"Title":"ENEMY OF GOD","review":"I don't know what to make of this book. I won't recap the story, as that's done elsewhere. I've really enjoyed a lot of Daley's previous work (Year of the Dragon, Prince of the City). I anticipated another captivating work full of telling glimpses into the world of law enforcement, and interesting and memorable characters.Sadly, it was not to be.Instead, Daley has focused on the histories of his lead characters in the most mundane fashion. I suppose he was trying to capture the era in which they matured (the late 50's to the 80's), but his characters are so boring that, quite frankly, I couldn't care less about them. This is one of those books in which the characters participate in major events (such as the Vietnam War) on the periphery. Generally, I like books that span eras or generations, with the caveat that they have to be well done. It can be a powerful storytelling tool. Think \\"True Confessions\\", Ellroy's LA Quartet, Mitchener's \\"Hawaii\\", or many other examples. This book fails miserably; frankly (speaking as one who grew up just a few years behind his lead characters) he doesn't even delineate the era very well. There's no sense of place in his narrative, and he doesn't capture the times. It's very sterile.The lead characters are two-dimensional at best. The priest-to-be is driven to the seminary over guilt for having impregnated his college girlfriend and transporting her to her abortion. That's the biggest issue in any of these character's lives. The journalist is ambitious, the cop is honest, the DA dogged. Not very compelling characters.Save your money. If you must check it out for yourself, get it from your local library."},{"Title":"ENEMY OF GOD","review":"This is in an odd way a police procedural, but among the richest such i have ever read. A priest is dead. Frank Redmond, a Catholic priest, fell into the street from a New York rooftop. Was it murder or, as the detectives at the scene believe, a suicide?Deputy Chief Gabe Driscoll wants to know and pushes the precinct to investigate. Driscoll is perilously close to stepping on the toes of other police officers. He is the head of Internal Affairs and has no right to be involving himself in the investigation of a declared suicide which might be a murder.But it doesn't matter to Driscoll: Father Redmond, you see, was a friend of his since high school. He enlists the help of Andrew Troy, a Pulitzer-prize winning journalist and also a friend since high school of Driscoll and the late Father Redmond, to investigate the death.Thus begins the unraveling of seven lives. It is an absorbing and sad tale beginning with these four young men and their achievements as a swim team and the quarter-century after. I have rarely read anything so sad. These men are all ordinary, though each of them was brave in their own ways. Driscdll has risen through the New York Police Department to two-star rank as an honest cop who solved homicides. Troy is a globe-hopping journalist who has won a sterling reputation for the honesty of his writing. Earl Finley, another member of the quartet, strives diligently as a prosecutor to seek truth in the criminal courts of a city overrun by crime. And Frank Redmond becomes a priest who serves with the military in VietNam, spends years in Africa tending to the poorest of the poor and comes home to serve the poor again in Harlem.Redmond is dead: a priest dead perhaps by his own hand - or possibly by the hand of one of the bad people he has kept from preying on his flock.Driscoll and Troy search for the truth. Intrinsic to the story is the Roman Catholic Church and a woman, the teenage love of the late Father Redmond.There are no Wagnerian heroics in this novel, but heroic acts abound just in the daily lives of the main characters. Daley has created characters unique and powerful in their ordinariness. We all know people like those Daley writes abou, for they are to one degeee or another ourselves.This is not a happy book. The calvary do not come riding over the hill in the nick of time. Rather the investigation of Driscoll and Troy exposes a love story and in that love story is tragedy.I highly recommend \\"The Enemy Of God.\\" But save it for a day you feel able to cope with the sadness of life.Jerry"},{"Title":"ENEMY OF GOD","review":"Gabe Driscoll, Andrew Troy, Frank Redmond, and Earl Finley met as fourteen year olds in the 1950s trying out for the Fordham Prep swim team in the Bronx. Over the next three decades as they each went into different professions their friendship remained strong. Gabe became a cop; Andrew a reporter; Frank a priest, and Earl an assistant district attorney. All are successful at their chosen vocation.Earl is the first of the quartet to die having been murdered. However, now fifty-three years old, Father Frank apparently leaps to his death from approximately four floors in Harem. The coroner Dr. Levin rules suicide as the evidence points to Frank jumping. The Catholic Church refuse to bury him as a Catholic since suicide is a sin to the chagrin of Gabe and Andy. They cannot believe their activist pal filled with enthusiasm to help the downtrodden would suddenly be so despondent that he would become a jumper. Though Gabe knows better as the chief of NYPD Internal Affairs, he and Andy begin investigating what happened to their friend.The deep look at changing group dynamics and the glimpse into church and police politics add depth to a fine investigative tale that is at its best when the surviving pair struggle to understand what happened and why. When the story line takes a dramatic spin (no giveaways) it loses some of the insightfulness as it turns more into a thriller; which in turn bleeds away what made the foursome especially Gabe and Andy full blooded characters as the two survivors morph into two dimensional superheroes. Still overall this is a solid relationship investigation that falls short of Robert Daley's YEAR OF THE DRAGON.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"ENEMY OF GOD","review":"I read a few of Daley's novel and all were better than this one. The only thing I will remember from this sorry tale is of a political nature. How come that in the United State of America there is not a credible system of care for all citizens paid out of the common taxes. Father Redmond, the ultimate good guy, has to steal and create debts that he can't ever expect to reimburse all that to make sure that the love of his life can received proper treatment and care. And this is 2005 when all the civilised nations of the world have such a system. That Frank plounges to his death from some rooftop because of that may be quite over the top since it prooves a deficit in his character, and for letting the man down that way after having build him up over all those pages, we can't but be a little resentful of the author."},{"Title":"ENEMY OF GOD","review":"Great premise, a roaring start with vibrant people and believable conflict.

What parts I enjoyed (like the scene where Earl \\"confronts\\" the mafia boss in the restaurant), I enjoyed despite the narration.The story was depressing and the reading was disengaging.In short, I skipped about 1/2 of the book but I still know most of what happened and I don't care about what I missed.

Briefly the story chronicles the lives of four main characters who met at Fordham Prep when they were on the swim team. They all went on to live eventful,accomplished professional lives. One as chief of internal affairs for the NYPD, another became a candidate for District Attorney,the third was a top newspaper columnist and the fourth a priest in Harlem.

The author does not get bogged down in covering every feature of JSP but rather focuses on the ones that are either essential in practice or that help establish a conceptual foundation. The author is not only an expert in the subject, but understands the newcomer too. This makes the presentation highly effective. (My favorite example of this is his gentle JFK-esque warning in the introduction to Java Beans: &quot;don't ask yourself why you may or may not need [JavaBeans]... Instead, ask yourself how can you integrate these ... into the way you think about solving programming problems&quot;.)One more point-- if you're an experience Java programmer, don't be put off by the fact that he explains elementary Java along the way. Those parts are easily skimmed over. This is the fastest way to get into the essence of JSP that you'll find."},{"Title":"JSP: JavaServer Pages","review":"The book provides an excellent basis for someone wanting to get into JSP coding, without the usual dribble that one gets from a 5000 page book. A really good buy."},{"Title":"JSP: JavaServer Pages","review":"I bought this book based on the stellar reviews it has been given here. But alas, I have ended up disappointed. The book does have it's good points: a well-compiled CD, an easy to grasp and friendly style among the main ones. But what disappointed me is that though Mr. Burd assured me that I could do 90% of JSP without knowing a lick of Java (haven't tackled that one yet), I found myself lost most of the time; and now am left with the 10% rather than the 90. The reason that I found myself so frustrated is that as a professional web designer/programmer, I'm not content to simply copy code from a CD and let it at that - I'm the type that likes to write it from scratch, and you need thorough and complete explanations for that; something I didn't find in this book.Though the book seems to be directed at those with no previous knowledge of the field, I found it assumed much, and while I can't say I learned nothing about JSP and the Java language, I didn't come away from this book with much more than a handfull of features of either, and a few vague ideas and definitions. Put differently, he skips much crucial information for those who really haven't had any exposure to JSP or Java.Perhaps after I learn Java this book will have more meaning for me - as such, I can't recommend it to anyone setting out to learn JSP. Though for those with a bit more background - go ahead, give it a whirl, it could be just what you're looking for."},{"Title":"JSP: JavaServer Pages","review":"I liked this book, very well written in simple english.

The book contains short stories by various New Woman writers and a play about the New Woman, but I enjoyed the articles of the time more.

It is not a bad book, and it is one of the better textbooks that I have been forced to read."},{"Title":"Pictures of Personality : Guide to the Four Human Natures (TYPOLOGY)","review":"Robert Pirsig, in &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,&quot; describes a motorcycle as a pattern of logical relationships worked out in steel. &quot;Pictures of Personality,&quot; by John Lopker, may be said to describe psychological type in much the same way: as a pattern of archetypal relationships worked out in human nature.In order to introduce a reader to this particular understanding of type, the author treats personality theory less as cognitive science than as hermeneutic art, offering a highly visual and wholistic approach to the psyche's underlying architecture.The author's foundational standpoint is unmistakably temperament-oriented, influenced by the work of David Keirsey. However, by coming at his subject the way he does, Lopker serves to illuminate aspects of personality theory that are more usually associated with Jung's understanding of psychological types.For example, the book shows graphically how each functional standpoint carries implications of its opposite. The fourfold nature of the theory emerges as kin to the elder statesmen of the world's enduring philosophies: all those quaternities of forces, directions, seasons in which the universal aspects of human nature are mirrored.The book, for this reason, is a challenging one. Rather than engage the intellect in a linear manner, it asks the reader to grasp its meaning by way of iconography and the gradual illumination afforded by associative experience. Lopker clearly means, in this respect, to guide individuation rather than to describe type as such. To that end, the medium is very literally the message.For example, Lopker has created a series of iconographic maps to the sixteen types, exploring them from many different angles. And the book culminates in a highly inventive deck of Tarot-like cards, rich with the symbols he's gleaned from many world traditions to illustrate his premises.Even where Lopker develops his themes conceptually, he uses a vocabulary that emphasizes the collective character of his subject, speaking, for example, about Magicians and Rulers rather than Perceivers and Judgers. This permits him to devote his attention to the way these types experience and exercise free will -- in what he calls global or local terms. The book is thus accessible to readers new to the subject, but it also invites seasoned type practitioners to see the theory afresh, from an unaccustomed vantage point.In summary, this is an artistically exuberant book that seeks to immerse a reader in the underlying structural arrangement that links human nature to Nature writ large. It's not for the casual reader, but will reward those who surrender to the highly original lens the author has trained on a process shared by all of us."},{"Title":"Pictures of Personality : Guide to the Four Human Natures (TYPOLOGY)","review":"Finally, somebody put a face on type!

Pictures of Personality: Guide to the Four Human Natures, by John Lopker, provides scholars and students of personality type an exquisite reference and study tool. The heart of the book is sixteen pages, in color, that provide a complete summary in words and images for each of the sixteen personality types, which correspond to the Myers-Briggs types. The four temperaments are given the colors of blue, green, red and yellow, and the four variations of each temperament are given specific symbols.The book is extremely helpful. With one set of symbols, the reader can identify numerous personality tendencies. The symbols must be studied carefully, but once they are understood, the symbol pictures paint a thousand words. I enjoy the extremely lean descriptions for each of the symbols. The meanings are presented almost as puzzles, and the responsibility for grasping the meanings rest with the reader's willingness to contemplate the ramifications of each. In other words, the author does not impose his beliefs on the readers; instead he provides a clean, intelligent and extremely well developed picture of the personality types.This book belongs in the same category as the masterpieces of Jung, Myers-Briggs, and Keirsey in exposing the meaning and application of personality type theory."},{"Title":"Pictures of Personality : Guide to the Four Human Natures (TYPOLOGY)","review":"As a professional, I have studied and taught Jung/MBTI personality type for many years. By far, this is my favorite book on the subject. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand the 16 Jung/MBTI personality types and the four temperaments.The images capture the essence of Carl Jung's eight psychological functions, the 16 MBTI types, and the four temperaments as told by David Keirsey in &quot;Please Understand Me.&quot; The book presents two complete sets of very well-designed images for the 16 personality types. The &quot;16 Icons&quot; are based on the human body and look similar to the pictograms on international road signs and on the doors of public restrooms. The Icon eyes indicate the four perceiving functions, and the arms indicate the four judging functions. The second set, the &quot;16 Symbols,&quot; uses four basic shapes with simple patterns drawn inside and outside to indicate the four psychological functions and the attitude of each: introverted or extraverted.The two sets of images present a clear picture of each of the 16 personality types and four temperaments. The graphics are supported by very precise and balanced definitions that carefully explain the personality difference (the polar opposite quality) illustrated by each image.It is not a book to flip through in a hurry, and the previous reviewer from Hong Kong should have a closer look. &quot;Pictures of Personality&quot; is an extraordinary graphical guide to the 16 Jung/MBTI personality types and the four temperaments.

The book has been written in such a way that it is insightful yet easy to understand. Using one set of symbols, the reader can identify numerous personality tendencies and come to a deeper understanding of themselves and those around. Once the symbols are understood they reveal a great depth of information that is expressed in an easy to understand system. In some way, the meaning of each symbol must be decoded, they are like Zen Koans, brief, intense and brimming with meaning, but they must be contemplated and used to be fully appreciated. This approach is especially useful as it avoids putting meaning or beliefs onto the system and allows the user to find his or her own application and level of comprehension.The book itself centres on sixteen pages in color, that provide a complete summary in words and images for each of the sixteen types, these correspond to the Myers-Briggs types.

It took me under 1 hour to read this entire book and it left me disgusted. First the information about the personality types and modes of perception are so lacking that you will get more information on the results page of an online personality test. There is absolutely no information on how the different personality types interact or originate. Every statement made in this book is too vague to even bother reading.Secondly, the amount of writing in this book amounts to a ten page pamphlet. The book is literally a collection of simplistic drawings which the author claims are visual representations of the modes of perception. 10 pages of this could be very interesting, but over 100 pages is excessive. As if that was not enough, most of the pages are repetitive, containing drawings from previous pages, usually with only one added element.The author's discussion of the modes of perception were shamelessly ripped off from the Myers-Briggs scale. This would not have bothered me, it was what I was looking for. However, I was expecting an in depth analysis of the different modes of perception that make up personality. Instead I got 100 pages of stick drawing and 10 pages covering the actual modes of perception in an incomplete and often misleading manner. The book contains the equivalent of 50 pages of writing across the pictures, however the information is largely repetitive. The author assumes that the reader will have forgotten what was read several pages ago and will fill up an entire page repeating himself just to introduce one new paragraph. This style of writing is insulting to the readers' intelligence.I was looking for a book on psychology, there is no way that the author has ever progressed beyond taking a psych 101 course and attending new-age self help seminars.If I were ever to actually meet this author, I would beat him over the head with his book.

I believe that all nine works must be spoken of here, or the mood that the author creates will have been lost.From the first sentence in \\"Berlin Match\\" to the last paragraph of \\"Charity\\", Len Deighton has created a masterpiece of intrigue, double-dealing and the cloak and dagger mentality that is peculiar to the British Secret Service. Looking at Bernard Samson and his family, friends, enemies and detractors has made for an extremely interesting read: I believe that I read all nine in about a month and a half.In a style similar to John LeCarre, Deighton takes the reader on a roller-coaster ride that starts out with trepidation, builds to a almost certain climax, only to finish with an entirely different ending than anticipated. I disagreed with the author's statement that each novel can stand alone and be read in any sequence.

It connects private life with historical occurence in a way that will resonant with any sensitive American living today. I don't want to repeat what other's have said; just wanted to day I loved this book."},{"Title":"The Fox's Walk","review":"Annabel Davis-Goff chooses a unique point of view for this novel set in Ireland during World War I, a time in which The Troubles, Ireland's grassroots rebellion against England, are also taking place. Her speaker, Alice Moore, is eight years old when she journeys from England to Ireland and spends a year living with her grandmother and great aunt at Ballydavid, an Anglo-Irish estate near Waterford. Bright and unusually perceptive, she experiences, first-hand, their refined and mannered Edwardian life, while also observing and commenting on the events taking place as the Irish rebellion begins in distant Dublin. Her family, like so many others, knows that changes are coming, but they behave as though &quot;the world as [they] knew it would continue if enough of [them] pretended nothing irreparable had taken place.&quot;Describing the life of the Anglo-Irish with sympathy, understanding, and no apologies, the author is as polite, polished, and distanced from the action as Alice's family is. When the rebellion begins, its impact is enhanced by the innocence of Alice, through whose eyes the ironies are observed. The plot may seem to lack excitement, at first, as Alice and her family, concerned with domestic conflicts and personal tragedies, pay little heed to the incipient revolution, but this quietude is misleading. When the family hosts a large, tennis party at the end of the summer of 1916, only a few weeks after the leaders of the Easter Rising have faced the firing squad, all facets of society-gentry, servants, British soldiers stationed in Ireland, local residents, and revolutionaries-come together in one tumultuous afternoon which changes the lives of all participants.Clever and subtle in its structure, this is a novel in which the most significant action-the end of this way of life-takes place offstage, after the novel has concluded. The author, having recreated this genteel, lost lifestyle in all its details-even including the strictures which govern the eating of a tea sandwich and the difference between dresses of full mourning and &quot;half-mourning,&quot;-brings the family just to the moment of its own climactic awakening and no further. Wisely, she lets the reader fill in the blanks, guided at the end by Alice, many years later, reminiscing about her early life and &quot;the course of history [that] swept away the very foundations of the way we lived.&quot; Restrained and understated, this story of the Irish rebellion may be unique in its quiet acceptance of the rightness of change. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The Fox's Walk","review":"I enjoyed this book about the decline of Anglo-Irish society in Ireland during World War I although there was little dialogue and the author has a fondness for long run-on sentences using semicolons and dashes. These long sentences sometimes made the original thought hard to follow. I liked the main character, a little girl named Alice (narrating as a grown-up) who's left in the care of her genteel grandmother and great-aunt. Unsure of why she's been left, lonely, isolated, and given to sleep-walking, she still has a strong, observant character and develops a love for her new home. She worries about her future. It's made known that little Alice eventually marries a wild and rebellious local boy. I liked how that part of the story foreshadows Ireland's eventual revolution. After reading this book, I'd like to go on and read a history book about Ireland."},{"Title":"The Fox's Walk","review":"This is a book that demands a little time. The narrator's voice, recalling an arid, lonely childhood during World War I, seems at first more plaintive than engaging, her circumstances more pitiable than interesting. But wait. Alice Moore is a curious, winsome child with awakening sensibilities. She soon draws you into a world so small and self-assured and complete its inhabitants cannot see the precipitous brink before them.After a factual exposition of the case of Roger Casement, a protestant who tried to raise an army to drive the British from Ireland (these asides into the wider world occur throughout the narrative), Alice's story opens in 1912 Ballydavid, Ireland, at the estate of Alice's maternal grandmother, a woman of deep Anglo-Irish principles and conventions. \\"The entertaining of children was not, either in my family or in society at large, given the importance that it now has,\\" Alice recalls, 50 years later. Hours of boredom and starched discomfort were punctuated by meals and sleep, with the occasional excitement of adult visitors. Alice would strive for invisibility, so as to hear their conversation.After an interlude at their home in London, Alice and her mother return to Ballydavid the summer after the war begins. Her father, a frugal, unpretentious New Zealander, has never been completely accepted by her mother's family and seldom stayed long at Ballydavid. \\"When Mother was with her family, she was in the position of silently defending him from their silent criticisms, these unspoken thoughts batting around the room like shuttlecocks, inhibiting and coloring even the occasional remarks of day to day family life.\\"Much communication remains unspoken, from what is served at tea for visitors (or if tea is served), to articles of dress, deportment, and table manners. Much more communication is between the lines, the sort of bland, pointed remarks the British excel at, in novels, at least. And as the war drags on and signs of Irish unrest increase, culminating in the 1916 Easter Rising, more subjects become off limits.But by then Alice has begun to note the contradictions in the world. Her mother, almost unhinged by a favorite brother's death in the war, has left Alice behind on her return to London. This abandonment in a grieving house of rigid, but largely unknown (to Alice) rules, leaves her desperate for love and stimulation. She is captivated by the unusual and the kind - the colorful Jewish wife of a neighbor, a down-on-her-luck refugee posing as a psychic countess, the noisy, brash son of a prominent Catholic, the kindly, superstitious servants.Out of loneliness, Alice learns to love Ireland and question the order of her grandmother's life. A quiet pond in the midst of a raging storm, its surface cannot stay unruffled forever. And when that calm is shattered, Alice has a dilemma.Davis-Goff (\\"The Dower House,\\" \\"This Cold Country\\") creates this world in exquisite, telling detail. A captivating novel of manners and change, written with subtlety, wit, and deep understanding."},{"Title":"The Fox's Walk","review":"I agree with the other reader who reluctantly gave this book only two stars. I think that a strong editor could have turned this into a fine and memorable book, but the combination of interminable, irrelevant historical detail and an apparent policy of \\"tell, don't show\\" makes this book very frustrating to read.Alice, the narrator (however one may sympathize with her repressed childhood) is a colorless woman who seems to think in textbook paragraphs and throws everything she can think of into her narrative. Does she sleepwalk? Who cares? It has no bearing on the story.If I were the editor, I would have recommended- that this book be written in third person rather than first person, unless the narrator can be given some personality.- that the background information about politics be separated from the general text, perhaps in italics or in a clearly delineated preface to each section.- that every incident and observation be fleshed out with details and substantiated by some evidence (however subjective), instead of being summarized. (For example, why does Alice consider O'Neill, her grandmother's manager, to be overbearing to his wife? Could the reader be shown an example of this?)Too much of this book reads like an initial sketch or summary of a story, with pages of a history book inserted, instead of a finished work."},{"Title":"The Fox's Walk","review":"I hate to give this book only 2 stars, because I thought the characters were so interesting. In particular, the little girl who is the main character was very intruiging. I really wanted to find out what was going to happen to her next as the book unfolded. Unfortunately, I had to slog through some pretty dull stuff! I appreciated the author's attempt to describe a very important time in Irish history, but the chapters on the historical stuff were not intertwined well with the rest of the plot. It was as if you got a taste of a good story, then all the sudden you had to tramp through a chapter of &quot;Irish History 101.&quot; Very clunky.Can't recommend buying this book. If you are still curious to read it, I suggest checking it out at the library. (If this were a movie, I'd say &quot;wait for the video.&quot;)"},{"Title":"The Fox's Walk","review":"Annabel Davis-Goff has written an absolutely gorgeous novel describing the intricacies and delicacies of a bygone era. Narrated in the first person, almost sixty years after the events depicted, Alice Moore recounts her life as an eight year old at Ballydavid, her ancestral home in Ireland. David-Goff expertly infuses Alice's narrative with minutiae of a quietly peaceful domestic life with the background of the 1916 Easter uprising and the wider turmoil of the Great War. The result is a story that is intimate and personal, yet sweeping and broadly historical in tone. Much is made of the Irish Nationalist heroes, particularly Roger Casement who is actively working for the cause for Irish Independence. We never meet Casement, but his life and struggles, as with the other figures of the time, are seen through Alice's intelligent, thoughtful eyes. Although life seems to continue as usual at Ballydavid, the Troubles, and the War in Europe are not far away, and reminders are always constant.Fox's Walk is really a tale of reminiscence and loss. The great Anglo-Irish families of Ireland stuck in their stuffy Edwardian mentalities are gradually disappearing as the world changes, and embraces twentieth century modernism. And Alice's Grandmother and Aunt Kate with their rigid, austere, morally strict and socially conscious ways are as much a part of the disappearing world as the house itself. This was a time when children should be seen and not heard and when manners, good grammar and the right party invitations were of utmost importance. Davis-Goff recreates this world in such beautifully descriptive, and \\"clipped\\" prose: the tennis party, the fox hunt, the luncheons, and the dinner preparations of a privileged existence are all brought vividly to life. The author captures the simple mood of a scene - the blustery rain showers coming off the ocean; the starched blouses and dour clothes of Grandmother and Aunt Kate; the descriptions of Ballydavid - the old and slightly shabby house and farm; the blooming hedgerows surrounding the estate; the mists that descend over the house in Autumn, and tea with cucumber sandwiches, a light sponge cake and barley water tea.Although the plot in Fox's Walk is secondary, the real strength of the novel is this enormous capacity that Goff has for recreating the particulars of time and place. There's also an overwhelming sense of melancholy pervading this book, as Alice looks back with so much sadness at a life she obviously loved. Towards the end of the story she comments on a particular moment, which marks the beginning of loss, \\"an hour or two on a sunny afternoon of pure happiness of a kind we would never again find.\\" The Fox's Walk is quite a profound piece of literature - tender, delicate and astutely observed - it is a terrific read.Michael"},{"Title":"The Fox's Walk","review":"\\"The Fox's Walk\\" is a slow, reflective tale, filled more with observance and description than events. The events that do occur mostly happen elsewhere and are reported. Alice Moore is 8 years old and staying at the Ballydavid estate with her maternal grandmother. Her mother married below her station to a man from New Zealand who treats her brusquely and results in the mother's apparent nervous breakdown. This effects Alice being left with Grandmother, her Aunt Katie, and her Uncle William, who repeatedly drops by for tea.Not too unlike \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" this Alice is constantly trying to understand what is going on around her. The Irish maid Bridie, the teacher Miss Kingley and the stable manager O'Neill have the more Catholic opinion, while playmate Clodagh & family and Alice's family represent the more Protestant viewpoint. As this is interpreted by Alice, it is a strange mix of stately decorum and revolutionary chaos, seemingly from a distance, but closing in. All of this is kept in abeyance until the ending arrives like a lightning bolt.The subplots swirl about Alice who grasps as much as she can. Uncle Sainthill is killed in the war, sending her family into depression. Uncle Hubert is stationed in the East and may or may not have a fiance, the flirtatious Rosamund Gwynne. Houseguest Sonia appears to have assumed an identity as a countess and was Mara in London, although Alice is never quite clear. Added to this are fox hunts, croquet and the sinking of Lusitania.Author Annabel Davis-Goff gives lots of description to the society of manners as it existed in pre-independent Ireland from 1912-1916. The strength of the novel is its exquisite sense of place, combined with the manners of the social structure as seen through the eyes of a child. The novel reads as a slow-paced methodical march towards Irish independence. It is a tale lovingly told, worth the trip! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Fox's Walk","review":"Wow, you think this book is about family in the war as it starts, but it is really about the nuances of human interaction, and it is thoroughly enjoyable, quietly fascinating. Truth lies behind this \\"fiction,\\" human truth: in relationships, reactions, thoughts, and the seemingly mundane daily routine that is really just a backdrop for the inner thoughts of a woman making sense of her past and her life. Their daily life in their home, rather unremarkable at the surface, explodes with the depths of a human heart, as you turn each page. Each character is unfailingly believable. So much quiet wisdom went into this beautiful tale."},{"Title":"The Fox's Walk","review":"This book is well-written; the style is elegant but accessible and the book is not a chore to read, despite the heavy emphasis on historical information. I truly came to care about the narrator and be interested in the characters that surrounded her life. It does move a little slowly; this did not bother me, but if you like your books action-packed, I wouldn't recommend it. I also wasn't thrilled by the ending. It felt a little abrupt to me, and I would have liked the book to continue past that point in the narrator's life. However, I still enjoyed the book a lot over all."},{"Title":"The Fox's Walk","review":"As a quick synopsis, a young girl is left behind by her parents in Southern Ireland during World War One, under the care of an autocratic Grandmother and an inconsistent, kind Grand Aunt. The current of the book is of a child's discovery of family and of an Anglo-Irish way of life, just as that way of life spirals down into the Rising, the Troubles, and the end of Edwardian norms.This is a book about language and culture, not description of natural beauty or of compelling, fast-paced conflict and action. First, the voice of the child is far too nuanced and the language too subtle - rather it is a voice of a sixty year old woman looking back at her childhood through the imprint of her life, and of her class. Children are actually much more physical, and visceral than this little girl. But, the point the author brings us is not child-like verisimilitude, but is the narration, and the grace of the words that the child / woman uses to tell us of her life. Second, this book is about discovery. The principle vocation of the girl is to deduce how things work in this adult world, not to be a child - and so this book is less of a coming-of-age than it is an implication of an era.Some minor problems - the interwoven history of Ireland is less compellingly portrayed than the movement of the family towards its destiny. In fact, the first painting of Irish context for the book occurs shortly into the first chapter and is a jarring right turn. Second, the book peaks with a scene of action, well prepared and even expected, but the book has so little description of movement and action in it that the culminating moment doesn't have as much force and drama as it could.Why should you read this book? - because it is about a time we will never see again, because it is true in what it says about human beings, and because it speaks to us in an elegant stately voice that is a pleasure to hear.Characterization: BPlot: BDialogue: ACraft: ALanguage: AAll rights reserved, Scott Jones, posted also on our personal website"},{"Title":"The Fox's Walk","review":"The personal story in this book, the little girl Alice and the difficult familial situation she finds herself in--the eccentrics that come and go --the timid, kind, but neglectful mother--the self-absorbed and self-congratulatory Anglo-Irish society of the early 20th century before the Troubles--all are beautifully rendered. The embedded story of Casement and the other historical figures is less artfully handled. Rather, these pieces of history are clumsily and irritatingly peppered into the narrative in a disturbingly unconnected and distracting way. Perhaps this effect is deliberate in order to show how the historical events register in the consciousness of a child, but Alice is so sophisticated in parsing the various strata and relationships I would have expected her to do a better job with those outside her own small arena. Nonetheless, this book is worth a read if only for the very nuanced understanding of social interaction of a bygone era with the best kind of ending, one that is both organic and surprising."},{"Title":"Flint's Honor","review":"If anyone were to gather names for the top five western writers of all time, Richard S. Wheeler would undoubtedly be among them. His tale spinning genius and esteemed talent with language unfolds again in FLINT'S HONOR, Wheeler's third book detailing the adventures of warring journalist, Sam Flint. Flint arrives in Silver City Colorado-a town wedged between the walls of a rocky gulch-to defend the honor of a prostitute, whose death had been treated smugly in the Silver City Democrat. Searching the boomtown for a place to set up his press, Flint finds no vacancies, and against his better judgment has to settle for a room in a house of ill repute. Rather than recognizing Flint's new Silver City Sentinel as a worthy competitor, Digby Westminster, the editor of the Democrat plays Flint's positioning for all it's worth, and dubs the new paper The Bawdyhouse Bugle. Flint soon learns that the licentious editor has another foe, Achilles Balthazar, a powerful and despicable mine owner known for his ill treatment of workers and ability to read peoples minds-especially idealists like Flint. Flint finds himself amidst the politics and greedy maneuvers of both men, having only the power of words as his defense. Ready to sum up his losses at any moment, Flint is joined by a gypsy printer, Jude Napoleon, who not only adds spice to Flint's conflict, but provides him with the extra energy and wit needed to help bring down the two men, who like the mammoth walls that parallel the city, hold the whole town captive."},{"Title":"Flint's Honor","review":"Richard Wheeler is one of the best western writers out there.

Each major faith group was explained in regards to origins, faith practices and philosophies. Denominations and factions of each faith were also explained, giving reasons behind the different belief groups within each faith.The color illustrations throughout the book were not only pretty, but accurate. I was also impressed with the last chapters that covered primative faiths, newer faiths and cult movements. The author gave simple advice to avoiding destructive cults and a large bibliography for further research.Over all, I think this book is a must have for home schoolers who are teaching world cultures and/or social studies. The book explains how each religion has influenced thier region and shaped modern culture. It would be good for multifaith situations and interfaith schooling too."},{"Title":"With Wolfe in Canada, or, The winning of a continent","review":"\\"With Wolfe in Canada\\" or \\"The Winning of a Continent\\" by G.A. Henty.First of all, historical fiction is probably my favorite genre of writing. So far I have not found anyone like G.A. Henty with the ability to tell a tale like he does. I have read as many of his books that I could get my hands on. They are just plain hard to put down once you get started; that is if you are a fan of historical fiction like I am. Henty's stories typically revolve around a central \\"boy hero\\" character during a pivotal period in history. This \\"boy hero\\" character usually ends of accomplishing some pretty amazing (though not unrealistic) feats by the end of the story.Henty lived during Queen Victoria's reign and literary critic Kathryn Castle put it well when she said: \\"Henty...exemplified the ethos of the new imperialism, and glorified in its successes\\". He was a very strong supporter of the British Empire all of his life. Henty had some pretty amazing adventures of his own during his life, such as the Crimean War, the opening of the Suez Canal and the California gold fields to name a few.\\"With Wolfe in Canada\\" is a story that is centered on the French and Indian War of 1754 - 1763. This war was really the American theater of the Seven Years War. The \\"Wolfe\\" in the title refers to General James Wolfe the commander of the British expedition to take Quebec.The tale begins where \\"James Walsham\\", the main character, began his life; in Sidmouth, England, born the son of a country doctor who died when he was quite young. It tells of his growing up here in some detail, and of the surroundings that made up the life of a common fisherman in that day.James's mother, a school teacher, had wanted him to follow the profession of his father and become a doctor, but this was not meant to be. As James had deep love for the sea ever since he was a young boy, he naturally was around fisherman and the sea in general quite a bit. This may seem rather obvious as Sidmouth is a coastal town.It turns out that he becomes involved in a smuggling operation and is pressed into the service a British warship. Don't take this as a clue that James had turned \\"sour\\". In those days smuggling in that region of the world was not really looked on as major crime by the locals, and most of the people were in sympathy with the smugglers. The British government certainly did not think so and the law was strictly enforced by the \\"revenue men\\". James time of service on the warship is what brought him to America, and on his discharge there he decides to join General Edward Braddock in an expedition against the French. The main bulk of the story involves his adventures during his time as a scout in America, but also involves a fascinating tie with circumstances back home in Sidmouth involving some competition for his \\"girl\\" Aggie, someone that he had grown up with. Also woven throughout is the treachery of a Richard, the nephew of a friend of James's back home who was jealous of James accomplishments.Overall, \\"With Wolfe in Canada\\" is a very compelling novel that is very historically accurate and provides the perfect balance between a fictional story and the true events of the French and Indian war. It is well worth your read.G.A Henty, Blackie & Son, 1886Preston/Speed Publications, 1999[Wikipedia.org/G.A.

This is an amazing legacy and a clear model upon which to base missions efforts.A great deal of this occurred because since before WWII the C&MA; took the strategy of rejecting colonial evangelism and sought instead for the missionary to plant the church and then rather than directing it indefinitely to raise up indigent leadership and then step aside and allow the Church to form.The fruits of this approach has been many countries closed to other missions movements, open to the Alliance because they do not threaten their culture or sense of independence. When war, famine or political upheaval have thrown missionaries out of countries, where other Churches have foundered without missionary presence and leadership, Alliance works have thrived because the missionary was just an outside consultant, not the key to the movement.This book is rife with wonderful stories of faith and martyrdom. It presents a legacy that is amazing.This work, more than any other, makes me proud to have been a part of the C&MA.; Whatever other flaws there are, and they are there, the bottom line is that God has used the C&MA; to reach many areas of the world and ours is a model that many other look to in hopes for the same success. That is a legacy and and hope for the future. Whatever issues remain to work out, this type of impact is worth working to continue!An important book for the C&MA; but also one for evangelical Christendom to look to, to rejoice in and to emulate in outreach."},{"Title":"The Earthsea Trilogy: A Wizard of Earthsea; The Tombs of Atuan; The Farthest Shore","review":"I got into the whole fantasy world with Lord of the Rings and since then I have been looking for books with and alternate world theme.

I am using the word \\"magical\\" in its precise sense. This is a story that illustrates the results of the actual use of ritual magic and what is needed to create healing from its mis-use. The magic of Earthsea is all about the correct use of names; and it is exactly this use (and mis-use) that causes Ged to run away as fast as he can. In the end the healing comes when he realises he needs running's opposite and correctly names his nemesis.The trilogy stands on its own, however the later stories (\\"Tehanu\\" etc)are worthy additions."},{"Title":"The Earthsea Trilogy: A Wizard of Earthsea; The Tombs of Atuan; The Farthest Shore","review":"I enjoy fantasy literature quite a bit. Some of my favorite series are Lord of the Rings, Redwall, and Harry Potter.

The series is near and dear to my heart and its very unique.

Now add to that a sprinkle of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. This is my reaction to Ursula K Le Guin's The Earthsea Trilogy. It is familiar throughout, but I couldn't tell you what happens on the next page, let alone the end of each book.And this is not a complaint!I must have read these books at some time in the distant past (they were written in 1968-1972), but I could never have admitted that I read them. Indeed, I picked this copy up from a book swap, thinking I needed to read at least one of the famous Earthsea books. This volume was ideal, since it contains the first three books in this series (Le Guin started adding to the original trilogy in 1990). These books are:- A Wizard of Earthsea- The Tombs of Atuan- The Farthest ShoreAll three books follow the tale of Sparrowhawk (Ged is his real, secret name), who went from very humble beginnings to become a Dragonlord (speaking to dragons) and Archmage (the Warder or leader of Roke, THE school for wizards).I sense elements of this story in other fantasy tales.

There are two points I want to briefly mention before my review...First, I can never understand why her books, when made into films, are done so hokey, like ... conan the barbarian. She touches on wonderful mystical ideas , he books are well developed, her narrative anddescriptive writing are captivating and inspiring. I feel like I have been in that little boat 'lookfar' and need to go wash the salt water out of my hair every time I read Earthsea. She makes me want to imagine how to learn to summon and weave a pattern. And I guess she must have inspired R. Rowlands, because she wanted to so badly she just wrote another book with all of Le Giuns ideas.There are writers who work in genres that adult fiction poo poos, some of whom are just wonderful writers whatevers, and like musicians, there is a sound they have that, when they do that particular thing, trascneds the rest of the genre. . While fantasy genre often contains questionable writing, it also contains wonderful imaginations that feed our imaginations as well as our emotions.Le Guin is just one of those jewels.The Harry Potter phenomenon by JK Rowling must be addressed here, because so much of each of Rowlings stories is taken from this Earthsea Triology. . The details Rowlings comes up for her teen wizardly crew are sometimes inspired, and other times silly, awkward.. I suggest that any part of Rowlings you find inspired is probably directly taken from Le Guin, and the talking candy and flying car, like Bewitched meets Steven Speilberg, are Rowlings own imagination. The body and soul of her books, a school of wizardry, types of magic taught, an orphan boy who seems to have an unnatural prediliction for having to deal with magical evil, the genesis that a young boy becomes a wizard, then embarks on a journey chasing an evil that turns out to be of, or within, himself, is entirely Ursula Le Guins story line. Rowlings ripped off from Ursula LeGuins Earthsea Triology in so many directions its no wonder no one discusses it. In the days of rewriting history, somehow Rowlings will claim that in spite of her book coming out 30 years after Le Guins, that it is Le Guin who has taken other peoples work. You know how that goes he? Inspired, that would be Tolkien, he inspired most everyone who mentions a dragon or a rune.. ripped oof, that woudl be Le guin, by Rowlings. too many unique details show up in both books.This is my second point. How is it possibly that Rowling, another female, the Scottish writer of this childrens fantasy epic, was, is, able to intellectually plagerize so many particularities and peculiararities of the Le Guin literary cycle, and no one mentions it at all? Perhaps next to the braod strokes of Rowlings, Le Guin seems fragile and modest. Prose and crafted lore, a morality for any age. Up against a non commital story fluffed up with sudden magic without basis, this part of course has no cmparison to Le Guin. Its just the details taht are the same. If, say, Billy Joel borrows the sound of any other band to write his songs, McCartney, the Stones, the four seasons, because he has no sound of his own, really, its ok. If Sheryl Crow has lifted most of her hits from some part of Rickie Lee Jones' 'thing' , thats another. If no one notices or pretends not to notice, as long as its a good song,a good book, who cares, right? Generating money, thats all that matters. And yes, as long as he or she does not take all the credit for the book, or the sound, for the uniqueness of a creation. If you like my song, sheryl could write, check out rickie lee jones. people can decide if they like RLJ, and if you point it out, its like you were inspired. But in Rowlings case, she took so much from the other book that, while little kids might like the Rowlings writing better, any one who likes to read will know that this book has been basically stolen from another, better writer.Here is a brief list of similarities... From the details of the wizard school, from the Wizard school itself, ( the headmaster, sitting by the fountain, different headmasters who teach different magics..) , the student antagonist being a haughty blond from a social caste higher than Geds, I mean Harrys.. the changing into animals, fighting dragons, and finally the basis of her whole book - that the evil Harry pursues turns out to be inside of himself is outrageously taken from Le Guin, whose character pursues a shadow of terrifiing propotion only to find out the shadows true name is his own. Oh yeah, in Rowlands book, the evil guy puts the evil in harry. in le guins, the good guy puts himself in the evil. oh. And furthermore, the abusive home he comes from, yes same thing, the1 harry and ged come from abusive, motherless homes.2 there is a school of wizardry3 in the school , which is on an island protected by magic,there is a fountain in a garden where the headmaster sitsthere are headmasters who each teach a kind of magic... ( in earthsea, the master summoner, the master patterner, on potterland, professor against the dark arts, professor for magical creatures...4 the antagonist is a haughty, blond boy from a social caste whom Ged ( and Harry) feels inimidated by.5 wizards are able to change into the animals.6 there is good magic and bad magic, a book of evil dark lore, the lore of Paln, which awakens the dead, creates Gibbeths ( bodys of people inhabited by evil which animates the person. hmm, that showedup in the old ladies house in potterland...)7 there is a young witch whose power is very strong. in harry she is good. in earthsea she is not, though tries to be at the last minute.8 Ged has a best friend from a different island...whose home is filled with family and kindness that ged has never known. and who has a little sister whom Ged becomes quite fond of and tells her his true name.9 wizards are able to go to the stone wall ( or white room) that divides death and life and return. this is what Ged must do, and as it turns out, Harry too.10 to mend the terrible wrong, Ged must discover that the evil bears his own name. He must touch, embrace, name the evil as himself in order to mend the tear that has occured.sound familiar? Harry must, too, discover that the evil lord is inside of him and has always been.11 the boy wizard must undertake a long long journey through terrible trouble and tribulation, finally led to a showdown with evil power and a discovery that the evil is him, or is in him, or he is in it.12 Both boys lose his magic pet in a battle fighting a gebbeth. ged looses his pet in a battle, fighting a wizard. the gebbethhas a different name by rowlings, and he loses his wand to it.13 each person has their own animal that hey become, that rules them...14 Ged is a goatherd, and goatherds now show up in Rowlings later books about Harry Potter. I mean, really.psTroll, a small plagerism, which would not be significant if it were not up against all the other...If I am not the first, I want to be the loudest to say that the millions and millions of dollars this woman has generated have been extracted entirefly from the work of another woman. Even the name Harry POtterJunior is taken from a movie called Troll, in which a wizard who loved a witch gets turned into a troll and tries to take over the world by entering our dimension through an apartment building in san fransisco.The name of the 12 year old boy who must become a wizard to stop him? Harry potter jr.so thats that part.The redmption after so much hardship, the chasing of a shadow that turns out to be your own self loosened by your vanity, the beautiful sea and the discipline of learning when to use your power and when to let the worlds wind carry you, as well as the sanctitiy and safety of the school, all of this I loved. The floating grove, hat always seems to be moving, whose trees roots run to the foundation of the earthand have been hear since Segoy first raised the islands, these things all ring other bells, much deeper and sweeter than any other fanstasy book I have read. It is good for any age, and I mean any age,60 or 10. Danger and darkness, yes, but joy and devotion. A great book."},{"Title":"The Earthsea Trilogy: A Wizard of Earthsea; The Tombs of Atuan; The Farthest Shore","review":"I have no strong feelings about the Earthsea Trilogy.Possibly that should tell me something. These stories are interesting, not fascinating or compelling, but interesting. They are not interesting enough to hold my interest if there's something good on T.V, but if I had a power outage or something I'm sure they would provide adequate entertainment.Basically, these stories are nothing special. This isn't great fantasy, it's almost written like old fairy tales, only with less dialog and character development. People do things for no apparent reason and I sure as hell didn't understand the religions of the Islands at all. In fact, sometimes I couldn't even figure out what happened at the end because it was written so strangely.Reading this wasn't a waste of time, but it didn't enrich my life either.

She has a deft hand at science fiction and fantasy, but she also layers her work with adult themes of self-discovery and personal evolution, relationship to self and to others, isolation vs. connection, and cross-cultural communication and understanding. In the most thoughtful, interesting, and entertaining ways, she plays with race, gender, age, etc. as social constructs, creating critiques of real-world countries and cultures in the process. But none of this comes off as pedantic or condescending - just fascinating, and sometimes heartbreaking and tragic. In these ways, Ms. LeGuin transcends the genres she writes in.If the Chronicles of Narnia is the quintessential children's fantasy series, the Lord of the Rings the quintessential contemporary heroic fantasy series, and Harry Potter the quintessential populist fantasy series, then the Earthsea Trilogy is the quintessential *adult* fantasy series. For maximum enjoyment, you will have to work a bit as you read - moreso than with LOTR. Enjoy the spare, concise language, the atmospheres packed with meaning both explicit and ethereal, the things she *doesn't* say. Savor the books slowly. Jump backwards and re-read parts that gain more portent the more you progress.The Earthsea Trilogy isn't beyond the young adult reader, but older readers will appreciate it too - and glean more from it. When you are done with Earthsea, don't stop.

LeGuin creates a compelling, mythic world that is richly layered with wisdom and significance. These are books that you can reread again and again, getting more out of them each time and enjoying them anew. And as if the wonderful storytelling on multiple levels for the first three books wasn't enough, LeGuin comes back to Earthsea and provides an even more intelligent (and a deeper, more feminist & humanist) interpretation of her world in the next three books with only increasing skill as a writer and storyteller."},{"Title":"The Earthsea Trilogy: A Wizard of Earthsea; The Tombs of Atuan; The Farthest Shore","review":"This is some of the greatest fiction of all time, let alone science fiction or fantasy.

Being a huge fan, I decided to sit down and read her works before watching the movie (which is a totally different story). The Earthsea Trilogy is easily one of the best fantasy works out there. I've personally never been much of a fantasy fan, but this book intrigues me like no other. I loved the way that LeGuin went through the story and it was not your typical \\"good guys fight bad guys\\" theme. It took it some time to pick up really, but at half way through the book I could not stop reading. She really had me thinking throughout the entirety of the book. Overall, I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of fantasy, it's a nice break from the usual stuff."},{"Title":"The Earthsea Trilogy: A Wizard of Earthsea; The Tombs of Atuan; The Farthest Shore","review":"The Earthsea story is something unique. Fans of more modern fantasy/wizardry stories (see: Harry Potter) may see similarities and brush it off as being over-simplistic or unoriginal, but don't be fooled. LeGuin is a pioneer in this field, and she offers deep underlying themes in her stories, something I believe all fantasy fans can appreciate. You'll have to read it for yourself, but in my opinion the world of Earthsea which she created stands out so well among the rest. Her system of magic and the way the world is governed through it is something different and refreshing altogether.As far as the review of this physical trilogy set goes, it is a more than adequate copy for fans of the Earthsea series.

Maybe because Earthsea is more intended for a younger audience, none of the writing seemed nearly as heavy and dense as Left Hand of Darkness. I once again did find the story and ideas to be well-crafted, however this time the language and style conveyed a magical quality to the story and I found all three volumes included within this omnibus to be unique and enjoyable in all aspects.This was a fun trilogy to read and I will continue the series with the final volume and the short story collection that Le Guin has also written."},{"Title":"The Earthsea Trilogy: A Wizard of Earthsea; The Tombs of Atuan; The Farthest Shore","review":"This novel is a good classic fantasy novel.

For example, few authors treat the issue of averageing mass transfer coefficients (local, arithmetic mean, log-mean) with such care - in fact most authors simply ignore this issue altogether. I find this degree of detail more conducive to understanding than the tacit omissions in other books.

I couldn't understand why- because it encouraged and inspired me. I realized she felt overwhelmed by it, as if she didn't measure up, and also felt some of Nancy's views to be \\"extreme\\".This book is not a measuring stick to tell you if you fall short- it's a mountain-top view of all the implications of your role as a mother, inspiring you to take your mothering more seriously and more excitedly. It is a visionary book by a visionary woman- helping paint a beautiful and often counter-cultural picture of all your motherhood can be, through grace.Some of Nancy's views on things like family planning and breastfeeding may seem extreme, but perhaps this is only because we let our culture set the norm. Consider whether this would have seemed extreme 100 or 1000 years ago, or when God created the world. We might become more well-rounded mothers to consider the history, traditions, and beliefs of mothering over the ages.I encourage all readers to live in accordance with the measure of faith God has given to them personally. To follow someone else's ideas without being at peace that God has called you to live \\"their way\\" is self-imposed legalism. Nancy is not trying to create a standard for motherhood that everyone must follow. She is just trying to inspire us with all the possibilities of how important and magnificent our roles as moms can be, and to confirm the Bible's support of motherhood as a role to be embraced and cherished. I think she did an excellent job. Whenever I put this book down, I want to run to my toddler and hug him!I strongly encourage you to let this book encourage you."},{"Title":"The Power of Motherhood: What the Bible Says About Mothers","review":"[...].This book has changed my view of mothering.

There is also a magazine you can subscribe to written by her, her daughters, and many readers (no ads!). My one-year old is always so calm when I play a Nancy tape or DVD - Nancy has a really soothing voice.

This is history from a personal viewpoint, his own of course, and it was totally skewed and off-balance. At first, I didn't know what to make of his style, and then I caught on; his wit was as dry a mouthful of cotton! I had to re-read the first few chapters, and the second time I was delighted. This is a one-of-a-kind book!"},{"Title":"The Mauve Decade","review":"Granted that it's always more fun to make fun than to praise, I can't recommend this book enough. It's without question criticism as performance, an inspired ridicule of an era's desires, its beliefs and its confusions.I don't have enough experience with literary and/or cultural history as a genre to know if this performance was exceptional or ordinary for its time, but I sure wish I could find more of its kind now. Beer relishes presenting famous figures of the time as immoral or incompetent buffoons. He frames heros in their mundane, unflattering, moments. Few escape the sarcastic insult or elegant putdown: only those apparently bulletproof idealist slash humanitarians like WD Howells, or Frank Norris.A key to understanding Beer's bleak and pessimistic tone may depend on the following choice. You can assume that it was artificial, based on the book's premise. That is, if a writer looks back into history, and chooses a decade in which he/she thinks everything fell apart, such an attitude is a natural accompaniment. Or, you can attribute the sour tone to real circumstances, such as those surrounding the year of this book's publication, 1926. In short, a post Great War cynicism, a disgust with and disbelief in mankind, would likely prejudice anyone against optimism of any kind, much less the material optimism of the 1890s (and 1920s). Beer seems on intimate terms with the pathos of two of the decade's great poems that have since been held up as both symbolic of the period and as standards of Modernism: Eliot's \\"The Wasteland\\" and Yeats \\"The Second Coming.\\"Beer's style is difficult but brilliant: dense, concise, vivid, allusive, sly, and subtle. The points slide in and out of view like popup targets in a shooting gallery. The thread is often lost because the subject - the he, she, they, or it - is not restated. Certain conjunctions that we can't function without are left out consistently. Sentences are laden with meaning, allusion and irony, some autonomous and conceptually complete, some only clues that make sense when coupled with a partner. Arguments proceed by wild leaps of association. The breadth of reference has no boundaries. It's often formal, but it can't be called academic, not the way we use the term. The modern reader is so used to passive voice and \\"to be\\" verbs that writing like Beer's, which travels swiftly on action verbs, poses a major challenge.Books like this are what happen when writing is immediate, fresh, full of compressed anecdote, full of real detail. There is no clear judgment, no dogma, no agenda, no leading the witness, no unmistakeable expectation, no condescension or cheerleading, no plain morality to which you must subscribe. The narrator is a cipher, and in achieving that non-identity, the author becomes an artist. That modern readers might feel a little lost without a clear narrative position to guide them is too bad.I like to think that one read isn't enough for any great book. The Mauve Decade is one."},{"Title":"The Mauve Decade","review":"Every once in a while one comes across a gem of book and is not quite sure what to do with it. That is the case with this gossip-laden, satirically biting literary book, \\"Mauve Decade\\", that deals with the highs and lows of American culture in the last decade of the 19th century. You, know the time of the well-known \\"robber barons who until recently were the main villains in the on-going American saga. And they were! And their descendants, literally or not, still are!As a matter of course I should explain that I picked this book up for the purpose, I thought, of taking a look at the period of the emergence of the American imperial presence that we continue to live with. I also was looking to round out the milieu in which the American labor movement was beginning to feel its oats. The period of the great trade union, and later Socialist Party leader, Eugene V. Debs-led Pullman Strike and other bloody labor battles that should have told even the most nave militant that the struggle ahead was going to be long and arduous. Those 'robber barons\\" meant to keep their profits. That is the book I bargained for but I got something quite different.What I got was one of the most obscure, but intrinsically interesting, takes on the American literary scene, the so-called \\"Republic of Letters\\" movement that was being pushed at the time in order to create a separate and distinct American cultural haven. The author, writing in 1926 (at least that is when the book was published) is taking a broad look back at the 1890's based on his own observations, the recollections of literary friends and those with some kind of ax to grind. Thomas Beer is not a name that I am familiar with either in my various reviews of American literary history or in any other capacity. I have not, at this point when this review is being written, taken the time to find out exactly who he was. That, I do not believe is necessary, in order appreciate what a little gem he has produced.Most of the names that Beer drops, and there is a great deal of name-dropping in the book,, are very familiar to readers of this space-Mark Twain, William Cullen Bryant (these were the days when every other Brahmin used three names to beef up his or her resume), William Dean Howells, Charles Godkin, The James brothers-in short, the literary establishment, make that the Brahmin establishment, that coalesced after the Civil War and was entering, according to Beer, its decline. I will not argue that point here but merely point out that his style is to be droll and venomous as he lists the roll call of the famous that get recognition at the expense of his own favored authors.Needless to say this book centers on the Boston/New York literary scene with a few passing remarks about the Westerners who would go on to create a very different type of literature. There are also many, many dry comments on the \\"Irish\\" problem, which is the fact that this \`race' has started to come into its own politically. Along the way Beer comments on the then new obscure and now long forgotten political scandals of the day, the literary sexual censorship that was being enforced by public officials and magazine/newspaper editors alike (I can only imagine what Beer would have made of the current wide open sexual references.), the fashions and watering holes of the rich and famous and their pet peeves. Wonderful stuff, all done in a rather arcane style that would not pass today's rapid repartee standards. This guy knows how to skewer even from long distance. We can always appreciate a little of that no matter what generation we are in. Nice work, Thomas Beer."},{"Title":"The Mauve Decade","review":"The author's free-flowing narrative style makes this book a strange read, with very few paragraphs and no notes of any kind. His highly opinionated tone almost causes the reader to quit early on, but interest is maintained. His myriad references without full identification has the reader scrambling to use Wikipedia. This is alright, but time-consuming. Mr. Beers should have taken the time to further explain his statements."},{"Title":"The Mauve Decade","review":"Researching the overall 1890's culture has been a pretty lackluster endeavor -- books have been mostly political (The Reckless Decade) or Astor-Society centric (a Season of Splendor), but this book is not. Indeed it is hard to find the center of this book, as it were. It's style is certainly impressionistic, it is certainly detailed, it is certainly literary, it is certainly written by a writer not interested in being popular, and it must be said that sometimes it is certainly easy to occasionally lose Beer's direction or understand exactly what/who he is writing about. Still, it is wonderfully well-written, and actually fun to read, if you go with the flow -- which is sometimes, it seems, at cross currents. I really liked this book, almost loved it, but I can't guarantee you will."},{"Title":"The Mauve Decade","review":"Is it possible that this paperback published in 1997 is a completely different book than the one I just took out of my local library? *That* book was also called &quot;The Mauve Decade&quot; and was also by Thomas Beer, but it was originally published in 1926 and might as well be written in a foreign tongue, for all its incomprehensibility to my modern mind. It's not that the language didn't make sense: yep, subjects, predicates, familiar words in English... But overall, the book was written in some abstract style that I just didn't &quot;get&quot; at all. I am terribly interested in this historical period, and I was looking forward to reading this book full of witty anecdotes. Sigh.

McCammon did not make this book as interesting and terrifying as &quot;Mine&quot;, however the characters were very multifaceted and interwoven into the story as &quot;Mine&quot; was. All in all, a good read."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"Lately I've been working my way through McCammon's books. Back in Horror's heyday, I kind of ignored him, since I felt at the time he was following, a bit too closely, in the footsteps of King. That's probably unfair. \\"Swan Song\\" is a really good read, and stands up well to King's \\"The Stand.\\" And \\"Stinger\\" is a wild ride that goes places King only wishes the terrible \\"Tommyknockers\\" had of gone. In other words, McCammon is a considerable cut above your average horror writer. And he possesses in equal measure King's greatest strength: the ability to develop believable small town characters. \\"Mystery Walk\\" is no exception. The Creekmore family is a likable, if haunted, bunch. The flawed, but good, husband and father John, his Choctaw wife (and mystic) Ramona, and their gifted (cursed?) son, Billy. Further, McCammon's character sketches are deft enough to capture within the \\"bad\\" characters (most of them anyway) their humanity, and thus make them sympathetic. You may not like them, but you understand them. Where McCammon falls down - at least in \\"Mystery Walk,\\" is in the area of plotting. \\"Mystery Walk\\" rambles all over the place, with its social commentary on a rapidly changing South in the sixties, and two brothers separated at birth who are sort of Yin & Yang when it comes to their supernatural gifts. Oh, there's some very interesting stops along the way. For example, Billy's stay with a carnival ghost show - which at first seemed to me to be a clunky insertion, but that then turned into quite a good (and pulpy) story within the story. Less so was his dramatically pale visit to Chicago- and a parapsychology clinic. Wayne Falconer, the other major figure, is sort of shortchanged in the storytelling. Still, his descent, in McCammon's hands, is believable - and sad.Whatever the reason, at 400 pages, which really isn't that long for a horror epic, \\"Mystery Walk\\" seems to take a long time to get where it wants to go. That doesn't have to be a bad thing, since the novel is in many ways a coming of age story for both boys - which is as American as it gets. No, what sucks the tension right out of the novel is that the supernatural force of Evil, a thing/force named the Shape Changer (which shows up in a much more terrifying way in the later \\"Swan Song\\"), just isn't believable - and I say that as a fan of the genre who is willing to suspend belief for all kinds of things that go bump in the night. You just never feel that McCammon himself has bought into the Beast himself --which leaves a rather large hole in the center of the novel. On the other hand the author seems far more comfortable, in this novel at least, when Evil wears a human face."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"This is truely on of the best books iI have ever read.

The story unfolds in epic fashion, tracing the path of life of Billy Creekmore as we find out along with him about his special powers, and the history behind those powers. Like King's epic \\"The Stand,\\" 'Mystery Walk' is about good vs. evil, and we have protagonists and antagonists galore to cheer for and root against. There is magic, mysticism, religious philosophy, and a compelling narrative that kept me turning pages (can anyone really 'turn a page' on a Kindle?) long after bedtime was supposed to start.I have no idea why I waited so long to read this book, but along with \\"Wolf's Hour\\" and \\"Boy's Life\\" this book cements McCammon's place in my literary Hall of Fame."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"Really good story.

It chronicles a boy, Billy, who inherits his mother's ability to lay souls to rest and tendency for premonition.

This would be many authors' best effort, but then again, this is McCammon we are talking about.You should read this book for the same reasons you should read any McCammon book: He sizzles as a storyteller. He is one of the best prose writers in modern fiction. You will really lose yourself in this book, which I can only describe as wildly imaginative and captivating. Some of the book's sections will blow you away. The part where Billy confronts a saw that screams like a man really chilled my blood.The book weakens a bit toward the end. McCammon introduces some entirely new characters pretty late into the book. It's hard to care about them when you're so drawn into the characters he's been developing for 350 pages already: namely, Billy, Wayne and Ramona. The book's journey is ultimately a good one, though (even though it wraps up a little too neatly for my tastes), and it will make you contemplate whether you are on a mystery walk of your own.If you are a fan of modern horror or suspense, you need to start reading McCammon's works, even if you decide that you aren't going to read this book. He's still a pretty well-kept secret, I think..."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"McCammon never fails to deliver a good read. McCammon has a way of drawing the reader into the story, enfolding the reader in the world he creates.

During his &quot;Mystery Walk&quot; he has to face evil, tests of his strength, and old family secrets.

However, he is surrounded by ignorant and racist redneck in his southern town. They treat him and his mother with xenophobia and fear. The townsfolk are not the only ones with a grudge against young Billy Creekmore. There is a genuine religious boy-healer and his crazed father trying to scourge the land from impurities. Their paranoia towards Billy grows and grows until they decide he must be destroyed. The two magic boys have different agendas but their baths are destined to meet on their respective mystery walks. The evil shapeshifter spirit also stalks Billy, craving to kill him - just as it has stalked his ancestors.A great tale, told with wonderful prose makes Mystery Walk a journey worth going on...Relic113"},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"I agree with another reader who said they found this book interesting from cover to cover. This is the fifth McCammon novel I've read, and I've enjoyed them all thoroughly.I was submersed in the story from the get-go, and as I read on, I had no idea what page I was on until I looked up and saw that there was only about a fourth of an inch of pages remaining. I thought, &quot;Oh no, its going to end soon!&quot;Though this is a work of fiction, fantasy and imagination, you feel as though the characters are real. The emotional highs and the lows, the sometimes twisting and turning path of life and the uncertainty and confusion and joys and rewards that go along with it, are described so well you can relate to it.Mr. McCammon's work is heads and shoulders above most other authors I've tried to read, and definately a lot more rewarding than anything offered by the television."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"This book has been around for ages, I know because I've glanced over the cover probably a thousand times. Always the same cover, a dark sky with a strange feline-esque face shrieking out of it. Having never heard of McCammon until recently I'd glance at the cover and shake my head assuming the book was more over-hyped badly written horror. Magically this book, whose cover had turned me off for so many years, appeared on my shelf, so out of morbid curiosity I began to read. By the following evening the book was finished and I decided that this book was worthy of a review. I was impressed with the writer's skill, even when discussing mundane details or goings on, it felt important and the writing style was brilliant, artistic, and simplistic. McCammon was genius without trying to jam down the reader's throat that he was genius.The story follows two boys, starting at a young age: Billy, the son of a Choctaw mother and her fervently Christian husband, and Wayne, the son of an evangelical minister. At young ages their mysterious gifts become apparent. Billy can see the dead, and help to send them on to their final resting place. Wayne can heal wounds and save the dying. The book takes place from the 1950's through the 1970's and there is much going on in the world during those times. The two boys are soon pitted against each other by the evil Shape Shifter... perhaps Satan himself who leads his pray down the wrong path by exploiting their weaknesses and by evil trickery of the mind. There are some who might say that the ending is a bit to clean, but to be honest, it is so skillfully written that when you are done reading your mind tells you that it couldn't have ended any other way.I honestly can't recommend this book enough; I imagine that even those who don't read horror will find much to appreciate in this story. Needless to say, after having read it there are now several other McCammon books in my inventory that have been bumped up on the reading list. If his writing skill holds true, then he could write about grass growing for 400 pages and readers will thank him for it. Ignore the cheesy looking cover and pick this up, it's a wonderful read."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"I was present at a book conference where Mr. McCammon spoke at a panel. One question was put to him about which of his books he'd recommend a reader new to his works try first. He said Mystery Walk.I also find Mystery Walk a great introduction to McCammon's talents perhaps at their finest, most honed perfection. Characters are compelling, emotionally involving, and real; plot tension keeps you turning the pages; the flow of the narritive is cinematically rich in detail as well as action and movement; the ending very satisfying."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"I didn't want to give this books 1 star because it is a great book. So I gave it 5 stars, but this review is going to be of this printing from Pocket Books.1) This is a POD or Print on Demand edition which I guess means they didn't put a lot of work into its release.2) It's WAY over-priced As of this review: $18.71 List price: $25.993) The font and layout is an exact duplicate of the original Mass market book released about 2 decades ago.- The font is very small, and does not fill up the larger pages like a standard trade paperback edition.4) Nothing was updated or improved to give it the $25.99 asking price. It is literally the same book re-released with a higher asking price The pages in the back have a list of \\"available books\\" by McCammon via Pocket Books: only 3 of the 9 listed are still in print.I explain this not as a petty complaint, but to inform the buyer of what to expect. This book is still the original read, so if you do not have this great novel and are looking to purchase it, then by all means go ahead - I did the same. But if you're conscious of your wallet and are going to spend the $19 price expecting to get more than just a standard mass market paper back, be aware that the only difference is that there is more blank paper to each page - which apparently knocks the asking price up by $20.However, Pocket Books was nice enough to actually make this novel along with Usher's Passing available for those readers that were not aware of Robert McCammon's great works over 2 decades ago. So thank you to them for the opportunity to purchase a new book instead of a beat up used edition, but I'm quite disappointing on the high price and small cheap font."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"I loved the characters good or bad and read this book with out a break to a great end. This book made me laugh and cry i was not at any time bored what a good read."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"I enjoyed reading Robert McCammon's supernatural thriller, Mystery Walk. This book is a wild ride with a Native American, Billy who can see ghosts and send them on their way, if need be. There are a lot of spooky things going on. Along with being able to help spirits, he is also being chased by a very scary shapeshifter that has been after his family for generations.Billy's mother has the special gift Billy has and she teaches Billy what she can. Since the family is different and a little spooky, the townspeople would rather they not live in the small house they inhabit on the very outskirts of town. So, not only does this family have to deal with things others can't see, they have the burden of worrying about the ignorant town folk as well.In the Bible belt, where this takes place, there is a healer among them. He is torn between good and evil and has dreams that Billy and his family need to die because for one thing, they can see him for what he really is.This is a very atmospherical story with a lot happening. If you have read Robert McCammon before, then you know what you are getting when you crack open this book. If you haven't read Mr. McCammon, then you will be surprised with his talent and his great ability to tell a tale. R. McCammon is a master at spinning an engaging, atmospherical thriller."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"This is another well written story by McCammon.. This is not my favorite book of his, but is worth the download. Don't waste your time and money on the trash these new authors have been putting out. This book was wrote when talent meant something."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"It was ok, except for the \\"trash\\" the Indian story line. Otherwise it was entertaining. Kind of a reverse ghost wisperer type story line, the seer's weren't liked in the book"},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"I liked that even though a faith healer played a prominent role in the story and there was much talk of the after life and good versus evil that the author minimized the religious aspects of the story and focused more on the characters and their adventure. There was plenty of opportunity for the author to preach to us, but he didn't.In the end, it turned out to be a pretty good ghost story."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"I was in the mood for something different. This book is very engaging with good character development. There are a few type-os but they are not too irritating. The story is mainly about a boy/young man who has inherited supernatural gifts from his mother's family. He lives in the deep south and he experiences a lot of small town racism and resentment. It is really well done."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"a wonderful book.Told by a great gifted story teller,the story of two men with two wonderful gifts.One can talk to the dead the other can heal the living is a very satisfying read through and through.Pick this one up.You wont be disapointed"},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"Entertaining read. You come to care for the main characters as if they were your friends. The book is 'King' like, but for a new author not a bad story. Boys life and Gone South show a more mature, skilled McCammom."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"Robert R. McCammon does a fine job at making the reader feel for the characters, Romona and Billy Creekmore. The realization of prejudice in the 1960's and today is brought out in Mystery Walk. The suspense and in depth storyline make the reader to want to keep reading and to not want to put the book down. McCammon gives a unique personality to each of his characters. There are characters that you will follow, and those that you will hate. The descriptions are so thorough that the reader will feel as if they know the characters. This book will be good for readers who like horror and mystery stories. It twists horror and mystery together to create a story of suspense and a tale of hardship of a woman and her son through life. Mystery Walk deals with the battles between life and death, God and evil, and the people that life has chosen to be the go-betweens."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"I have to respectfully disagree with the near five stars the book has gotten. I give it four, because after reading the let down that was Swan Song, Mystery Walk was refreshing. It redeemed my belief in McCammon was a talented writer, rather than a imitator. Unlike the near paper standups in Swan Song, the characters in Mystery Walk were lively, imaginative, and most importantly, real, a little more 3-dimensional. Mystery Walk is not only a tale of good vs. evil, but the journey from childhood to adulthood. Learning right from wrong. All in all, it was beautifully written.But it suffered from elements that made me scream \\"why Mac?! You were doing so well!\\" D.H., the shape changer reappears. God knows why McCammon choose to revive that useless character. D.H. should've been left in Swan Song. His purpose and being is still unexplained, and as I read, I felt like I was reading a prequel to Swan Song. This wouldn't have hurt me so much if King hadn't developed a similar continuum already. It felt like I was reading a straight rip off of the King's Randall Flagg character, who is known for reappearing in King's work. D.H. is pretty much doing the same thing. I said it once before...Flagg can drop kick D.H.!The religious aspect of the books went no where. It is laced throughout like butter on bread, but it just ended up being stale backdrop. Neither of the main protagonists, mainly Billy Creekmore and Wayne Falconer, ever really go soul searching (despite the title). There could've been more questioning of purpose, faith, the afterlife, or their own abilities. And why was Wayne given short blurbs or three whole chapters as oppose to Billy who dominates the book with his woeful adventures? I would have preferred equal insight into both boy's development, especially since we are handed the shocking development in the third leg of the story that even I didn't see coming. We deserved to see Wayne struggle into adolescene, make friends, even struggling with his own fledging gift. We didn't get that.At best, Mystery Walk is four stars. Very solid piece of work. McCammon holds true to his prose action and style. The part where Billy challenges a demonic saw was memorable, and I was awed by Billy at the school dance. If any scene could come close to Carrie's (King) mental breakdown at her prom, it would be Billy struggling to warn people at the school dance of their death.I suggest you read this and completely avoid Swan Song. You can thank me later."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"Mystery Walk while not one of Robert McCammon's greatest works is still a great read for a lazy afternoon. If you want to read a great McCammon book try Usher's Passing or Swan Song."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"I have been reading this book since i was 15! the book was in excellent condition. i would recommend you guys to anyone who likes to read. thanks for giving me peace of mind by finding a book i have looked for for 2 years"},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"This is an exciting story that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Being a Choctaw it was great to see their hertitage as part of the story. My great grandma could move tables and each generation since has special \\"gifts\\". My daughter and I have seen ghosts in passing from this world to the next and maybe this book has more truth than you know."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"The only true rival to Stephen King and what an exceptional writer he is. I enjoyed \\"Mystery Walk\\" it works on many different levels. As in all McCammon's books the many layered characters are fully fleshed out, warts and all, they leap off the page. The suspense mounts to the breaking point, an intelligent, witty, well written thriller and McCammon is one in a handful of authors that can actually scare me with words, which is very rare. Read anything by this man he delivers when others don't or can't."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"This one kept my interest piqued all the way through. McCammon has drawn some wonderful characters and put them in an interesting story. The only thing I didn't like was the introduction of important new characters in the last quarter of the book. The characters (or rather the situations with which they were involved) were hinted at earlier in the book, but I think the hints could have been a little stronger. Still, I found it to be exciting reading and would recommend it to anyone who likes horror with a good story line and well-developed characters."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"I'm reading this book on my iPad and it seems pretty good so far. However, has this publisher never heard of spellcheck?!! Seriously, someone has run a spell check and replace the word \\"die \\"with the word \\"the.\\" The typos are a amazing."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"This was great from the start and I had difficulty putting it down at night. I would certainly read more of this author's work."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"I love everything by Robert McCammon, and this book is no different. I recently downloaded all 10 of the newly posted McCammon books on Amazon for the Kindle. Two down and 8 to go."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"This was the second McCammon novel I've read and wasn't dissapointed. RM makes his money on creating characters that jump out of the page. The story is believable (always liked Indian folklore). There are some truly creepy parts in this book. One in particular involves a table saw. The ending of this book faded just a bit from the intensity of the story but still a great book."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"This book once again demonstrates McCammon's multi-faceted talent in this great tale which tells of a special boy with a cursed ability to talk to the end, about his dreams, hopes and struggles through life, and the final confrontation with the greatest evil. Absolutely superb writing which again proves how good McCammon is."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"I have just read the novel the second time, because I am going to read it with my literature class. McCammon at his best! Only Boy's Life is better. The novel's rich imagery, its delicately developed characters, its fine plot and its description of the Southern society are simply excellent. All these elements make it a masterpiece. The only little flaw could be found in the ending, which turns out to be a little bit clumsy when you compare it with the rest of the book. But it is still good enough for five stars. When will hear from you again, Robert?"},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"This is the sixth McCammon book I read, and although people say theres an evident King influence to his writing in this particular work, I might even say, yes, there is, but it still bears his cinematic writing style and his bizarre characters. It makes for tense reading and is well worth recommending for all fans."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"I have been a fan of Robert Mc Cammon, for a long period of time. I was tremendously disappointed, in this book. It seem to me that he was not really in the mood to write, when he penned this story. I will not give up on him, as I know that he has written many good books!"},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"This is my second book that I have read from the author Robert McCammon , and I loved both books. The one that got me hook on his books was Boy's Life . I now have another book coming from the same author , and can't wait to start reading it. The Mystery Walk was an exciting book that was hard to put down , as it seems with all McCammons books ."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"McCammon once again delivers a fast-paced, attention-holding plot with well-developed characters. The basic plot involves two young men -- one who one who talks to the dead, the other who heals the living. In years to come they are haunted by the same dream, they grapple with restless spirits, and they become deadly rivals on this earthly plane -- and beyond. The first half of the book and the last chapter or two were 'unputdownable.\\" I found myself glued to my seat anxious to see what was to happen next. However, the second half dragged on too much during several passages. Overall, this book would have been better if it was 50-75 pages shorter. Nonetheless, if you are a fan of horror stories, Mystery Walk is a book I think you will enjoy"},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"I'm currently reading all of Mccammon's books in chronological order. Right now I've just finished Mystery Walk and I'd have to agree with other reviewers that the last 70 or so pages (and the introduction of characters that appear to add little to the book) is a bit of a let down-to such a degree that I was not particularly enthused to finish the book. I think Robert blew it! Nevertheless, it's an enjoyable book and I do recommend it. However, so far nothing comes close to They Thirst (the best so far) and Night Boat , which is great fun to read. Next up is Swan Song!"},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"Robert McCammon takes you on a journey unlike any you've taken before in this riveting story of two opposite people finding their own paths in life. The pace is great and the characters so engaging that it is very hard to put down this wonderfully written book. There are a feww surprises in this book that make it even more appealing and a fun read."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"this makes the third book i have read by robert mccammon. i absolutely loved \\"the wolf's hour\\", and really enjoyed \\"swan song\\".this book, \\"mystery walk\\", includes the same deep insights into characters, with riveting scenes of emotion, action, and fascinating interplay between those characters. there is a paranormal slant to this book, as there was with the other two novels i read by this author. the story, which takes place in the deep south, starting in president kennedy's time period, is again a theme of good versus evil, a theme of the other two books. in this case and \\"swan song\\", the evil is literal.in \\"swan song\\", i felt the influence of stephen king's \\"the stand\\". here in \\"mystery walk\\" i feel a little influence from king's \\"carrie\\". this isn't a bad thing....there is no copying going on here, just a ghostly afterimage of the ideas. mccammon is a very good writer, who takes the time to really flesh out the people and environments in his books. it's not a short book either. lots of events happen, over many years, and we see the development of the characters over time. this is not an easy thing to do well. and it is done well, here."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"I am a HUGE Robert McCammon fan. Since his older works are all becoming available as ebooks now, I'm trying to re-read everything of McCammon's that I read as a teenager. Lucky for me, these stories stand the test of time.Mystery Walk is the story of two boys. One of Choctaw blood that can see and speak to the dead. The other, the son of a famous evangelist, can heal the sick. The stories of these boys on their way to manhood is fascinating. How they discover the gifts which they harbor within, and how they learn how to deal with said gifts was the most interesting part of the book to me.I didn't wholeheartedly embrace the ending, though I did think it was ok. The characters grew throughout the book, so I enjoyed the character development. I have always admired Robert McCammon's prose. The man knows how to weave words together to form a complete fabric for the story. All in all, I would recommend this book and I would give it, if allowed, a 4.5 rating.Lastly, I did want to mention a couple of issues with the Kindle version. In a number of places the word 'die' was replaced by the word 'the'. It tripped me up every time I came across it. Also, I believe the antagonist's name was supposed to be Krespin-and it was for 1 chapter of the book. For the rest of the book, he was referred to as Krepsin. Not a big thing, but I was irritated by it, at times."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"This is a marvelous book. I was hooked within the first few pages of the book. I couldn't put it down until I reached the end. It's a wild roller-coaster ride of emotions. I found it to be one of those books that when I finished reading it, I still wanted to read more about the characters and continue the adventure of the Mystery Walk. Robert McCammon's writing and storytelling are amazing. You can read his work and never have to realize that you are reading. You can just totally lose yourself in the fiction. I also very much enjoyed Robert McCammon's Swan Song and Boy's Life and I will surely be reading more of his work."},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"Mystery Walk introduced me to this terrific author and while I read it first years ago, I recently finished reading it again and I'm eager to move on to the other books of his on my keeper shelf.Living with Billy as the true nature of his abilities takes him through one tragic encounter after another, the pain he becomes a part of, and then later, the strength he has, made me feel an exhausted satisfaction with him at the end--as if I had been on a real journey myself.Of course, not being able to put it down and staying up late probably helped :) But I would highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone!"},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"I was introduced to Robert McCammon by a friend who had picked up Boy's Life knowing nothing about it and who highly reccommended it. I borrowed her copy and loved it so much I went out and bought my own which is now battered and bent from re-reading. Having loved Boys Life so much (it has since been my all time favourite book) I was hesitant to read another McCammon as I didnt want to have too high an expectation. Although Mystery Walk is no Boy's Life, I was well rewarded for beginning it to read it for what it is.Mystery Walk is the tale of Billy and Ramona Creekmore, who have the gift of communication with the dead. We follow Billy as he grows up and struggles with his gift, and he unwillingly becomes an outsider in his town and enters the wide world in search of answers. The story is fast moving with great characters and is ultimatley the fight of good vs evil. This is a well written horror/suspense novel and I think anyone who enjoys reading Stephen King will love McCammon. I am so amazed at how little known he is when he is so far above other well known authors.Robert - if your out there please give us more! Your talents are needed!"},{"Title":"Mystery Walk","review":"Book arrived today but was a hardback not the mass market paperback as described.

Novel-Writing Kit","review":"Length:: 3:54 Mins****This is a fun and funky kit for participants in the National Novel Writing Month experience (NaNoWriMo), which takes place every November. Note that although it includes a short (44 page) book, it is not the same as the author's full-length book of the same title. I view \\"No Plot? No Problem\\" (the full length book) as an important asset to NaNoWriMo. This kit, however, is strictly for those who want to have fun with stickers, buttons, a rolled-up contract, and more. It is for those who want to go all out for NaNoWriMo, and who want some \\"toys\\" to help them have an even better time. If money is tight, spend it elsewhere, as you can make most of these things yourself. If you don't mind the cost, and know that it's all just for fun, then buy and enjoy it as I did.In this video I open the kit and show you everything inside. The video is just under 4 minutes.****"},{"Title":"The No Plot? No Problem! Novel-Writing Kit","review":"Let me start by saying that I liked the original No Plot No Problem. Not brilliant, by any stretch, but fun and motivational. And I also understand that this kit is meant to play off of the concept detailed on the author's nanowrimo website (the challenge is to write a novel in a month). The goal is to produce material, rather than worrying about whether or not the material is any good. I have no problem with that.HOWEVER, the act of writing a novel in a month is free. Buying this \\"kit\\" is not. That being the case, I wanted to share exactly what you get for your money.Personally, I was disappointed at how...useless this stuff is. If you're really a writer (or aspire to be one) ask yourself if the following items will make a difference in achieving your goals:1) Four \\"Ask Me about My Novel\\" stickers2) A wall chart upon which you fill in your progress over the course of one month (personally, I think the time you spend filling in this chart would be better spent actually writing your novel)3) Little gold star stickers, like you got in grade school4) A tin pin that says \\"novelist\\"5) 16 fake coupons that YOU have to fill in (again, you're better off spending the time writing your novel than filling out coupons)6) A rolled up \\"affidavit\\" which you fill out as a promise to write your novel in a month7) An \\"I Quit\\" envelope to be opened upon the moment you decide to stop writing. I won't giveaway what the message is.8) 31 cards - read one a day until you finish your novel9) A 48 page instructional bookletLet's take a closer look at the instructional booklet:First off, it's 44 pages, not 48. The first 16 pages include an introduction from the author and 7 pages of instruction on how to use your affidavit, your gold stars, your fake coupons, your pin, etc. I'm not kidding. The next chapter (\\"Preparing to Write\\") is divided into five steps. STEP 1: Pick Your Month (In other words, decide which month you want to write your novel). STEP 2: Pick Your Players. (I quote the author here: \\"Novel writing is a fantastic one-player game. But it's also an ideal opportunity to spend time with friends.\\" Uhh...what?) STEP 3) Spread the Word. (Tell friends and family that you're writing a novel so that they can help you stay on track.) STEP 4) Fill Out the Affidavit. (YES! I'm glad we made sure to include an entire step about that.) STEP 5) Think About Your Book. (Another excellent idea.) By now, we are at page 30 of this 48, no wait, 44 page book. Pages 31 through 33 detail the rules for the nanowrimo novel competition. Then on page 34, we begin a chapter entitled \\"Writing!\\" This is nine pages. It is a Q&A; session, covering such things as Q: \\"Can I have aliens come down and eat my characters?\\" A: \\"It's your novel - you can do anything you want. If you're not so into aliens, wormholes are also a convenient option. As are tigers, for that matter.\\" (I am not kidding - this is what you're paying for.)Bottom line: this is a gift set - probably something a friend or relative will get you for Christmas. I can't imagine that any serious (or even marginally serious) writer will find this package worthwhile. But who knows - motivation is a weird thing."},{"Title":"The No Plot? No Problem! Novel-Writing Kit","review":"I was reading some of the negative reviews and can't believe how people are. Basically, it's a cute little kit to motivate you to write your 50,000 page book in 30 days or less. The people who gave it the negative reviews are taking it's purpose way too seriously.This is more of a \\"gifty\\" type of item for someone who is really into writing. In fact, if you have a writer in your life, especially one who is having a hard time getting motivated, you probably should get this writing kit and the original No Plot? No Problem! book to go along with it. The gift will be received with raving reviews from your writer friend, spouse, associate, etc.When I opened the kit, it motivated me to want to write my book. Isn't that the purpose?Some of these people are just ridiculous. If the kit doesn't write the book for them then they feel ripped off! Come on, people! Get a life!"},{"Title":"The No Plot?

It's one thing to read a book on the subject of cranking out a novel in 30 days, and another one to actually have support in charting it.As for those who feel that the kit was too expensive - I got a lot more out of this $25 product (paid full-price at the local bookstore) than I did in 6 much more expensive hours with a writing coach (who expressed surprise that I had actually completed a draft - which made me wonder, is it that unusual?)I intend to use this system again and again."},{"Title":"The No Plot?

Here are the top 10 reasons it worked for me.1. The second I opened the kit, I knew that I could do it.2. The handbook gives lots of helpful advice and is a great abbreviated version of the book \\"No Plot? No Problem!\\"3. With a little ingenunity, you can use it over and over again.4. The 31 cards give you little pats on the back and advice every day of your novel writing adventure.5. I am a sucker for gold foil stars.6.

I love the idea of writing a novel in thirty days, and I've made some great writer friends through my involvement with Nano. I read Chris Baty's book, No Plot, No Problem, which is where this kit originates, so I thought I'd give the kit a try. This kit is only useful to people who are new to the Nanowrimo process, and I honestly believe that the book does a better job of promoting Nano as well as encouraging each of us in finding that writer within."},{"Title":"The No Plot? No Problem! Novel-Writing Kit","review":"I agree with the prior reviewer. I mistakenly was under the impression this included the original novel (which I highly enjoyed) along with the kit extras. That was my own mistake of course. However, once realizing that, the kit seemed fairy empty, with charts, coupons, and scrolls that you can only use once. The cards are reusable, but that's the main item with content. Other objects seem to serve more as a distraction than helping you write.I do think the presentation of the kit and design is rather nice. But overall, it feels fairly empty for someone looking for solid, reusable helping content. Subjectively, I felt it more worth a price under $10."},{"Title":"The No Plot? No Problem! Novel-Writing Kit","review":"This kit is a whole lotta look, but not much else.The booklet, flash cards, and progress log are kind of cool, though not entirely useful; I think they might be better as electronic resources.The booklet contains a lot of statements like the one above, but no real advice for the daily practice of writing. Baty swings to the extreme opposite of most writing guides by offering all pep and no substance. The actual advice being issued really only scrapes the surface of how one goes about writing a manuscript in a month.I also ordered Chris Baty's original guide to NaNoWriMo, \\"No Plot? No Problem!,\\" but after a month of waiting I marked it as lost in the mail. Perhaps I will try again with another seller in a few weeks, but after surveying this kit, I have to admit that my hopes for anything more substantial from Baty are low.The kit's contents are snarky and fun if you need a pick-me-up, but you shouldn't expect any life-changing advice. Baty attempts to prepare you for a month-long writing endeavor with equal parts humor and advice, but the whole thing feels corny.After seeing what he thinks will be useful in a month-long writing free-for-all (I mean, coupons promising that I will do things for other people if I miss my goals?! No, thanks. I'm already trying to write a freaking novel, I don't need Tinker breathing down my neck about a long walk in the woods, too!), I wonder if NaNoWriMo isn't actually just a cruel joke that Baty dreamed up one day and decided to entice a group of would-be novelists off the cliff with him.But then I look at the warm, vibrant, optimistic crowd on Twitter, and I realize that NaNoWriMo-ers have all the support, advice, and inspiration they need in their own online community. My advice, after perusing this packet? Stick to November, or get a crowd of friends to write with you some other month, and leave this kit on the shelf.For more of my thoughts on this book, check out my book review site, Melody & Words."},{"Title":"The No Plot?

I was a bit concerned when the description says it is only 45 pages, but the booklet is not all there is. There are stickers, coupons, a button, cards, an 'affidavit' all to help keep you motivated throughout the month of NANO.

Novel-Writing Kit","review":"This year I will be participating in my first National Novel Writing Month. I'm trying to convince my sister to be a writing buddy, and I think this kit should do the trick. If you, like my sister, are a kidult, if you've ever emptied a box of Cap'n Crunch prematurely to extract the toy, you will get a kick out of the candy-colored tools in this box. My favorite is a sealed envelope labeled, \\"I Quit,\\" not to be opened (of course) until you actually feel like giving up. Part of me hopes she won't participate so I can keep the toys for myself. Another good thing about this box is that it is not just an accessory for NaNoWriMo participants, or a marketing trick to attract them. I think in the 48-page booklet NaNoWriMo is mentioned about once, and the author does not assume that the user will be writing in November (he does hint, however, that February would make a bad month, due to its shortage of days). If you are a full-on stuffy grown-up sort of adult, you might think about skipping this one. But in that case, you probably would find the act of writing a novel in a month to be silly, beneath you."},{"Title":"The No Plot? No Problem!

The only real thing it suggests will help is writing more frequently, which I agree with. The kit is helping me complete my writing goals, but now that I have the kit, I could probably make everything in it myself. I would recommend the product but some may be very disappointed with how basic and \\"cute\\" it is."},{"Title":"The No Plot? No Problem!

I thought that the kit included the \\"No Plot, No Problem\\" book as well (so it seemed like a great deal) but the booklet with the very similar cover was just an intro to the kit. Besides that confusion, I am otherwise enjoying the kit.I'm mid-Nano right now and I'm using the cards, the pages in the booklet in which you write your \\"Magna Cartas\\" (the things you love and hate about novels) and the gold star chart. I love the idea of the gold stars, though these ones are a little cheap and sort of hard to peel off.

To me, it's a bit like a motivational introduction to a multi-level marketing business...the business being your novel. And hey, if that fires you up, great! I expected a book of some substance with some real direction. If this were a kit on sky-diving, I suspect it would be called \\"No Chute, No Problem\\" and the kit's instructions would boil down to a flyer that reads \\"JUMP!\\" (granted...getting started on anything is 90% the battle...but a plan will be needed at some point...and that time is preferably before you leave the plane!)"},{"Title":"The No Plot?

Assuming you actually complete your goal. No cheating, now!"},{"Title":"The No Plot? No Problem! Novel-Writing Kit","review":"This item is a bit of a joke item, meant to inspire some laughs or to give to a writer participating in NaNoWriMo to show your support. I would have been touched to receive it as a gift, though I bought my copy for myself.It's not so much that anything in the package would make or break your ability to complete the contest, or even give you epiphanies needed to become a successful writer. It's just a bit of a 'toy' to augment your experience doing something you'd be doing anyway in a way that brings some fun to it-- provided you're the sort of person who responds to the kind of humor it's peddling.For me, reading the daily advice card gets me in the mood to start each writing session. I also type it up and send it to my friend who's doing NaNo with me, which keeps us in contact and supporting each other. When the advice cards give just the right advice or validate your frustrations in a humorous way, it can help me to let go of stressing about things so I can just get back to writing. The goal sheet is also nice, as even before I got the kit, I was in the habit of tracking the number of words and hours I'd spent on my manuscript and posting them somewhere my family could see them. It helps me feel proud of what I've accomplished and also helps me impart the validity of my effort to friends or family that sometimes don't quite 'get' what I'm doing. The chart included in the kit is very sleek and sort of retro. It reminds me of something you'd see produced by Knock-Knock with a place for every little detail. It feels SUPER satisfying to see your hard work mapped out into a physical item that you can hold. I've never been published so I've never been able to hold a physical book as the product of all of my labor. Progress posters are that thing to me that I can hold in my hands and see that it's something I accomplished. Of course, one day I hope it'll be a physical book, but... you know &lt;3There are definitely people who think little gold stars are a waste of time and that's perfectly fine. There are those of us to whom a gold star might actually motivate to finish those extra few hundred words and that's fine too. Everyone has their own things that inspire or motivate them. In terms of what this kit offers, the products are quality and fun and it inspires in a playful way. It does what it advertises it will do. Whether or not you're the sort of writer (or shopping for a writer) who enjoys that sort of thing though should probably be the consideration you make before purchasing or gifting."},{"Title":"The No Plot?

This is nothing more than a gimmick; the book by the same title might have been slightly better. But at this point I wouldn't bet any money on it being so.

If you are interested in mass culture it is worth the effort."},{"Title":"The history of Puerto Rico,: From the Spanish discovery to the American occupation, (The expansion of the republic series)","review":"The book is often repetitive, but it gives a great overview of the history of Puerto Rico written circa 1900, shortly after it was ceded to the United States by Spain. The history is colored with what might be considered racism, but they really were just the prevailing attitudes of society as a whole when this book was written. I found it a little quaint and not offensive at all, but your mileage may vary.I learned a great deal from this book, and it provided a great short read prior to my first trip to Puerto Rico. I was able to appreciate the culture and the history of the island much more after reading this account."},{"Title":"The history of Puerto Rico,: From the Spanish discovery to the American occupation, (The expansion of the republic series)","review":"Published in the early 1900s, this book provides a glimpse of Puerto Rico before 1898 when it became a war prize of the Spanish American War.More accurate and dispassionate research since then in both Spanish and English portray a different reality than the one in this book. But it is good to have this record readily available and at a very reasonable price.The book has some historical allusions yet to be resolved. For instance, Spain's racist oft-repeated realities towards Puerto Rico are documented several times. On the other hand, some historians would say Spain's actions are really more of a reflection of the well-known colonial mentality.Perhaps the book should be read with a couple grains of salt, as one should any contemporary historical account written over 100 years old."},{"Title":"Bird Talk","review":"Polly, an Ojibway (Chippewa) Indian, has been teased at school for refusing to play cowboys and Indians.

I really enjoyed reading all three of these books, but I especially liked this one because of the vivid descriptions and the overall story of their hardships and how they overcome them. I would definitely suggest that you get your hands on a copy of The Settlers as soon as possible! This is absolutely a two thumbs up read!"},{"Title":"Settlers","review":"This is an epic work by its Swedish author, who is considered to be one of Sweden's greatest writers. Translated from Swedish into English, this beautifully written book of historical fiction was first published in 1956. It is the third part of a four part opus, the first two of which are &quot;The Emigrants&quot; and &quot;Unto a Good Land&quot;. The last book is aptly titled &quot;Last Letter Home&quot;.In the first volume, &quot;The Emigrants&quot;, the author detailed the emigration of a Swedish family to the New World, grounding it in the reasons for the exodus of so many Swedes from their mother country in the middle of the 19th century. The focus of the first book in this four part opus is on the family, relatives, and friends of Karl Oscar Nilsson, a peasant farmer who unceasingly worked his farm, only to find that, no matter what he did, he could not progress and would continue to live on the cusp of total poverty. The focus of the first book is on their life in Sweden. Gathering up family and friends of the family, the Nilssons decide to take the monumental step of making a fresh start by emigrating to the new world, specifically the United States of America.The second volume, &quot;Unto a Good Land&quot;, focuses on the arrival of the Nilsson family and friends in the United States of America. It details their journey from New York, a journey that was to take them across the Midwest by rail, steamer, and foot, to arrive in the wilds of what would one day be the State of Minnesota. It is in this wilderness that the Nilsson family and friends would homestead and struggle to make a new home. The author regales the reader with the travails this hardy group of settlers would encounter in their efforts to create by the sweat of their brow a new home in the wilderness. The early struggles of the Nilsson family to succeed in what was an unknown frontier is engagingly chronicled.In &quot;The Settlers&quot;, the author continues the story of the Nilsson family and friends. It is the story of a family who struggled to prevail in Minnesota, an alien land of harsh, inhospitable winters and scorching summers. The book continues to chronicle their lives and their adaptation to the adopted country that they would forever call home. It tells the story of the divided Nilsson brothers, each of whom would forge a path alien to the other. The author hones in on the fact that the early settlers were subject to being taken advantage of by the unscrupulous. He highlights the mass migration of disaffected Swedes to Minnesota and details their contribution to the prosperity of that part of the country. The author shows how these early Swedish settlers consolidated themselves into a thriving, bustling community, despite the obstacles and hardships that were to be their lot in the early years of their struggle to make the new land yield to their will.I have enjoyed the first, second, and third volumes so much that I look forward to continuing this journey with the Nilssons by reading the last remaining volume. Well-written and vibrant with period detail, this is a book that those who enjoy historical fiction will appreciate."},{"Title":"Settlers","review":"My mother's family is all Swedish.

The problems of Robert and Kristina in this volume seemed to drag out and reminded me more of a soap opera. Maybe it is that my ancestors settled in the Jamestown NY area so I had trouble identifying with the issues of the mid-west. The first two books in the series were helpful to me but I do think that I will stop now and not bother with the fourth in the series."},{"Title":"Settlers","review":"This is the last of the books of the four book series I have read. They all were wonderful and am looking forward to reading the 4th in the series. For anyone with Swedish ancestry they are a must read.

This book demonstrates again that hard work and not speculation was the way to success for the settlers as it is today."},{"Title":"Settlers","review":"This series has been just amazing to read. After beginning our genealogical history, I came across these books and ordered all of them. I can just feel like I'm right there with these characters and their journeys. I cannot imagine going through all the hardships they went through, and what they endured in our \\"roots\\" country of Sweden!

Midway through the third book, we find out about Robert and Arvid. They never reached California. Arvid died from drinking poisoned water after getting lost on the trail. Robert ended up in Nebraska with another Swede who came over on The Charlotta.After four years, Robert returns to Karl Oskar's and Kristina's farm. He has Arvid's watch and a large sum of money which he gives to his brother. Karl Oskar is suspicious. Did he find gold? Where is Arvid? Robert has changed. His health is gone, and he is disillusioned. He sees the folly of gold fever.As it happened, Robert was swindled. The Swede from the ship traded him wildcat money for gold given to him by a dying Mexican. When Karl Oskar finds the bills are worthless, he hits his brother in the face. Broken, Robert wanders into the forest and dies, free at last. The pessimism of this episode is disturbing. We feel the tenuous nature of life and the ease with which men can be led astray.The Settlers goes through 1860. Minnesota attains statehood. The book ends with Kristina resigning herself to life in America, just as her brother-in-law yielded to his inescapable fate."},{"Title":"Settlers","review":"Whether one is of Swedish extraction or not, if your ancestors came to America during the period of great migration from Europe, Moberg presents a wonderful picture of what it must have been like in \\"the old country\\" and the decision to start a new life in a new land. This is the third part of a four-part series. One would not get the full flavor of the book without reading the others in the series, but having the whole collection is a good plan, since it is a tale worth reading over and again."},{"Title":"Building Better Plots","review":"Robert Kernan's experience as an Emmy award-winning scriptwriter for film and television certainly qualifies him to write this book. It also explains a good deal of his theory as well as his outlook on writing fiction. That outlook is heavily influenced by Syd Field's classic theories of story development and script writing. At the moment, Kernan is developing projects for Web TV networks.It's always a pleasure to review a book by an author who clearly states his goals, then sets about methodically achieving them. In BUILDING BETTER PLOTS, Kernan makes three promises to his readers:First, he'll introduce \\"tried-and-true\\" elements that make good plots and examine them in depth.Second, he'll teach the reader to outline and how to \\"tinker\\" with a plot.Third, he'll offer questions and exercises to keep readers focused and to give them insight into how to determine the strengths and weaknesses of their projects. Kernan accomplishes these goals with finesse by covering all aspects of plot and illustrating their functions with examples from a wide variety of novels and movies.In fact, he has put together one of the most insightful, practical and useful books I've ever seen on constructing a story. He begins with how to choose a subject and writes, \\"A plot isn't merely a string of occurrences; it is a carefully orchestrated telling of events that might include breaking up their temporal order.\\" He takes the reader through developing the story arc from the inciting incident through conflict to climax and resolution, all the time showing how to unify the project through devices like subplots and setting.BUILDING BETTER PLOTS is far more than a basic treatise on story construction. It is a complete and careful analysis of each element of story, and provides a series of useful exercises designed to make each plot a page-turner. You'll find fill-in questions, timelines and quizzes aimed at clarifying the focus of your plot. At the end of the book there's a comprehensive plot tutorial. All of this adds up to teaching readers how to keep the focus of the plot and how to stimulate story progression through a variety of plot devices including nonlinear structure and framing.The book is divided into three major sections: The Building Materials of Plot (with chapters on narrative, on structure, on the inciting incident,on rising action and climax, and one on resolution); Building the Plot (chapters on archetypical plots, on creating characters and back story, on constructing an outline, on subplots, and also on deepening the story's resonance); ending with the aforementioned tutorial.Kernan is a great believer in using an outline and his explanation for why it's useful is most convincing. So, too, is his argument for using one. An outline \\"frees your mind and your intuition to work on the writing of your story, the characters, the dialogue, the language, etc., unconcerned about whether the construction is sound.\\" He convinced me; I tried his method, and it worked.My favorite quote (possibly because I've seen more book reviewer than writers forget it) is: \\"Every audience and author have an unspoken part. The reader agrees to suspend belief, to give the author a little flexibility with reality in return for good drama. The author accepts the audience's forbearance and promises not to abuse that suspension of belief.\\" His point here is that the author cannot afford to raise the story stakes too high but if you throw the reader a well-timed, well-aimed curve ball the reader will become more involved and more sympathetic.In a refreshing statement at the end, Kernan challenges his reader to master his techniques, then toss them aside. \\"Only your reader will be able to judge whether or not you've challenged them successfully or unsuccessfully,\\" he says. IF you work your way through this book, you'll find it time well spent and your stories as well as your readers will be well served."},{"Title":"Building Better Plots","review":"This is one of two writing guides I've found that are worth more than the purchase price. It is absolutely essential if you are looking to write a well-structured novel (or any other type of fiction), as the author explains the traditional plot structure better than any other book I've seen. He also outlines nine plot archetypes, including various characteristics of each, and makes great suggestions about how to change the dynamics and resonance of your plot. The index card outlining process he recommends seemed hokey at first, but when I tried it, my plot became much more defined and it was easier to plan. I also recommend &quot;Structuring Your Novel&quot; by Robert Meredith, which is an excellent companion for both plot and scene structure."},{"Title":"Building Better Plots","review":"Except for your own story idea, this book provides it all. I imagine anyone would be a better writer using only this one reference. Too bad it wasn't published before I bought the other 30 references in my library! It's imminently practical with plenty of illustrations--succinct and provocative. If you're an organizer, you'll love it. If you need organization, you have to have it!"},{"Title":"Building Better Plots","review":"This work is a masterpiece. It is a thoroughly practical guide on how to plot. Kernen teaches in detail and gives an overwhelming amount of top tips. He shows you how to avoid getting stuck, take control of the plotting process upfront and avoid getting lost in subplots and various other pitfalls. If your story idea is failing to make progress, especially somewhere in the middle, just get this book. It will give you a new perspective/approach."},{"Title":"Building Better Plots","review":"I really enjoyed his informative step by step guidelines on plot. I never fully understood the connections between the generic plots until now, and thanks to his wonderful examples I do. As a downside, I was dissapointed with the chapter on outlining, which I felt should have been covered better and more than it was. Overall, a book you should definitely invest in if you have trouble with plot structure. Although be warned: If you're looking for a book that helps you get inspiration for plots, this isn't really the one -- although learning more on the structure may jar a few ideas loose."},{"Title":"Building Better Plots","review":"The reviewers of my screenplays keep commenting that my dialog and characters are great, but my plot is weak. I made a pact with myself that I would absolutely follow every direction in this book to really give it a shot. I found the book to very readable and imminently \\"doable,\\" there were no busy exercises. The definitions of important events in screenplays \\"raising the stakes,\\" \\"point of no return\\" are more clearly defined than in other screen writing books. This book is only about plot building: it ends when you have drafted the index cards and have laid them out on your bed."},{"Title":"Building Better Plots","review":"Lots of very focused techniques for planning out your plot and story structure. Very hands on and a huge help for determining if your idea can even fly, which makes it useful for screenwriters, too, and not just fiction writers. This book is most helpful if you already have a story idea in mind, but you can't go wrong learning the concepts if you don't. (Note to previous reviewer: 'shooting your wad' is also a phrase related to the wadding used in early firearms.)"},{"Title":"Building Better Plots","review":"I've been through two decades of writing teachers and fiction guides but I've never found a lesson in plotting with this expertise, and depth."},{"Title":"Building Better Plots","review":"Thank you, Robert Kernan. You're a master. Your guidance in the use of archetypes (and your plot arc) greatly inform my start on the second novel of a quartet I am writing. The first book, which comes out in harcover by a royalty-paying house next month, took five years to write in a non-structured fashion. Following your excellent model for structuring, I'm betting my second book will be far better than my first and will be ready to print in less than four months."},{"Title":"Building Better Plots","review":"Another invaluable book for your screenplay friend: Robert Kernen's deceptively simple \\"Building Better Plots\\". It's the clearest, most helpful delineation of story development that I've encountered. I keep it close at hand for every story. Again, like McKee's Story there are immediately useful elements and some absolutely basic concepts that take years to grasp.The outline I build around each story has been derived from Kernan's suggestions. Story is my weakest point; I think it is for most writers. Kernan offers some hope; the book takes on astonishing resonance as the building blocks are slowly learned, year by year."},{"Title":"Building Better Plots","review":"Robert Kernen's methodical and extensive exploration of plot structure makes for a indispensable tool for the aspiring author. This book offers excellent analysis and examples, clear instruction, and a variety of concrete techniques that help authors' refine their ideas into a dramatic story arc. One such technique described is the use of 3x5 index cards to help structure the plot from a non-linear collection of ideas and scenes. This seemingly simple device is explained thoroughly and is quite effective. The book exceeds 200 pages with a minimum of filler. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in writing good drama."},{"Title":"Building Better Plots","review":"I recommend \\"Building Better Plots\\" by Robert Kernen on my blog for historical fiction writers.

It is an outstanding tool that can help you build a structure and outline while developing the plot of your novel."},{"Title":"Building Better Plots","review":"I was impressed with this book, but I came to a dead stop on page 72, when I read:\\"For a more direct approach to limiting the audience's frame of knowledge, try putting your story into first person.... First-person narrative has been used to great effect in many novels, particularly in the classic detective novels of the 1940's. Readers were thrilled by the adventures of Sam Spade, who spun hid detective yarns in the first-person. The reader travelled on the journey along with the character (rather than having the journey recounted in third person) and was drawn deeper into the plot by a sense of complicity with the protagonist. In these stories, whatever tension the character felt was felt simultaneously by the audience.\\"At this point, I re-read what he had written. I then stretched out an arm and drew out my Hammett. Yes, The Maltese Falcon was written in third-person objective, and not in first person. Yes, Sam Spade is not a writer, but is a character in the work. And so, I thought: does he know what he is talking about? Has he read the works he quotes?I think the jury is still out on this. The rest of the book seemed to jell fairly well.Wow!Rupert."},{"Title":"Building Better Plots","review":"In five sleepless nights I read this book, but not because it was gripping. Actually, on Page 43, when Kernan says, &quot;Some writers, concerned about shooting their wad too early...&quot; I woke up. My God, had I received an X-rated book by mistake? No, I realized, a few chapters later, just another of Kernan's incredibly misplaced and misstated metaphors. If a guy can't get his language straight, how much of his plot-building advice should I take? Not much, I decided."},{"Title":"Beyond the Ordinary: Ten Strengths of U.S. Congregations","review":"Cynthia Woolever (of Hartford Seminary) and Deborah Bruce (of the Presbyterian Church-USA) present in \\"Beyond the Ordinary\\" the results of a major, nation-wide survey of congregations and church-members. The survey is unique in that it is intended to focus on the strengths of the various American congregations. To that end, ten strengths of American congregations are identified and explained, the inter-relationship between these strengths is explored, and the relationship (or lack thereof) between the particular strength and other variables (average age of the worshiper, size of the congregation, etc.) is explored. Each of the ten strengths is separately analyzed in its own chapter and the book includes an introductory chapter, concluding chapter, and several appendixes. The ten identified strengths include:1. Growing Spiritually2. Meaningful Worship3. Participating in the Congregation4. Having a Sense of Belonging5. Caring for Children and Youth6. Focusing on the Community7. Sharing Faith8. Welcoming New People9. Empowering Leadership10. Looking to the FutureAfter examining each individual strength, Woolever and Bruce placed a special focus on the congregations who were in the top 20% of this strength to examine what the remaining 80% of congregations can learn from them.Overall, I enjoyed this book. I appreciated the focus on the positives and subsequent optimistic approach to the narrative. Speaking of the narrative, the writing style was easy and flowing, interspersed with charts, graphs, shaded boxes exploring \\"myths,\\" and even cartoons illustrating points. The fact that the authors did address myths was appreciated by this reader as myths often become \\"quick fix\\" solutions (\\"if we'd only change our worship style...\\") that have little basis in reality. Also appreciated was the interrelationship between the various strengths.The book does however leave me wondering about certain things. One problematic aspect is the methodology employed. Many of the questions appeared to be subjective in nature (\\"do you feel your spiritual needs are being met in your church\\"). While the authors did attempt to craft a question that tried to run the gamut from the large liturgical church to the small charismatic church, there are many avenues to \\"meet spiritual needs\\" that would have been helpful to me-quality of music, various aspects of preaching, length of worship service, etc. Furthermore, the manner in which the survey results were presented tended to confuse me. If a church that is strong in community involvement tends to lose members, why is it considered a strong-point? Why is it that congregations that place a strong emphasis on faith-sharing and evangelism tend to be shrinking congregations? Finally (and probably purposefully), few \\"answers\\" were provided in this book concerning the identification of a particular congregation's strengths and how best to capitalize on said strengths. Overall, I would recommend this book and also suggest the reading of \\"Surprising Insights from the Unchruced\\" by Thom Rainer to compliment \\"Beyond the Ordinary.\\""},{"Title":"The New Hamburger Cookbook","review":"It's a very old book with a lot of very good recipient that have to be modified to our evolving healthy lifestyles. Baking instead of frying or using extra virgin olive oil over lard are some examples."},{"Title":"The Magic Formula: It Works!","review":"In my opinion, most self-help books really don't work very well. They start out by telling you to love yourself as you are. Then, they switch up by saying \\"now let me help you change a few things.\\" In order to reach happiness, many require reading a paragraph once a day for a certain time, or reciting a specific quotation every morning, or writing down your thoughts every evening. This works for a few months, then you start to slip back into your old habits. What do you do then? You probably buy another self-help book, and begin the process all over again.\\"The Magic Formula\\" takes self-help from a different angle. No where in the book does it suggest that we have to change ourselves. In fact, the whole book revolves around the lives of men who appear to be strangers to us. Fresh out of high school, seven guys make a pact to meet at the same restaurant every ten years afterwards. With the accidental death of one, and the fatal heart attack of another, Gus, Steve, Mac and Pete began to talk about their problems at their third reunion. Their lives have changed, and Mike was the only one sincerely happy.An older gentleman, named Deliverance, sat tables away, and seemed to catch their attention. He approached their table, and offered his timely assistance. Deliverance begins with what he calls the unrecognized mission of human consciousness, \\"We should make ourselves more of what we are, and less of what we are not.\\" This could not be explained in one night, so they met again for the next five nights, while Deliverance fed their bodies and their souls.Michael Roads drives the back roads to indirectly speak to the reader through the lives of these men. You see, the five friends are not strangers to us. Most people are traveling a route similar to one of them. Mr. Roads uses Deliverance to send the message of self-realization through the lives of these fictional characters. We can read the book, be amused, and never think about it again. Or, the insight that the men receive, subtly becomes your insight and you will want to incorporate their personal growth techniques into your life. I recommend this book to those who truly want to love themselves, and transform to recognize their beauty from within."},{"Title":"The Magic Formula: It Works!","review":"Michael J. Roads' The Magic Formula is an impressive novel imbued with a deeper meaning than is offered by most simple works of fictional storytelling. Indeed, The Magic Formula offers readers everywhere an illustrated and exampled means to deal with their own personal difficulties. Following a group of childhood friends who meet every ten years, and learn that their lives are distressingly bleak, The Magic Formula narrates transformation when a mystical teacher comes and offers a way each person in the circle can greatly change his or her life. A profound moral parable of transformation, written and shared as a gift to all who read it, The Magical Formula is original and highly recommended reading."},{"Title":"Stagecoach Station 1: Dodge City","review":"Mr. Mitchum's book is entertaining, hence the title. It's hard to get into the plot but it is a book yuo read if not just to find out the ending. I would suggest this to older readers.

The main focus is on the fundamentals such as synthes and fabrication and covers as large range of toptics: nanoparticles, nanowires, nanorods, thin films, and carbon nanotubes as well as a diverse range of patterning techniques (AFM, self-assembly through conventional lithographic techniques). The last chapter of about 20 pages on applications is a bit short and only gives a general feel. The book should be suitable to both advanced undergrads or grad. students in chemistry, material science, physics, and EE. I myself found it quite accessible for self-study. I especially, liked the first ~50 pags explaining the fundamental such as surface chemistry and excellent explanation of surface tension."},{"Title":"Nanostructures and Nanomaterials: Synthesis, Properties & Applications","review":"Many books in this area are too concerned with the nano hype and less focused on the science behind it. Others present several chapters, each written by a specific set of authors, that are not necessarily correlated and seem more like a collection of review papers instead of a book. In this context, in my opinion, this book is one of the best books covering the subject (together with ozin's nano chemistry). It covers the real fundamentals and the science that drives the field together with current relevant advances and applications.

Harkort is a bit self serving, but he was observant. His encounters with Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, as well as other Mexican officers sheds light into their character and personality.

Fadhma Amrouche was born in 1882/1883 in an Algerian village. Never legitimized by her father, she was subject to endless ridicule by the villagers, prompting her mother to send her away to convent school for her own protection. It was at another convent where her future husband first noticed her, and where they were married, necessitating her conversion to Christianity. In the pages of this book, Amrouche describes her schooling, her marriage, and her children. Her personal and family struggles are the clear focus, while world wars, epidemics and the war of independence flicker through the background. She never had it easy, and she never felt at home, not in France, Tunisia, her husband's house, or even her own village. But when you consider the time period she lived through, how different was her experience, in the end, from those of her compatriots? This book is well worth reading for the wealth of information it contains about conditions in late Nineteenth Century Kabylia as well as for its story of simple endurance."},{"Title":"My Life Story: The Autobiography of a Berber Woman","review":"Fadhma Amrouche became a well known Berber poet and singer in Paris in the 1960's.

A bright and strong-spirited girl, she was educated in French an age when few women were educated. The book describes her constant worry to provide for her eight children, a fascinating look at traditional family dynamics in a polygamous household, and a passionate love for Berber culture. It ends with a collection of some of her poetry."},{"Title":"Becoming Human","review":"Dear potential buyers,Very simple but profound foundation.sincerely,AHTL (aka Alex)2009 Business & Finance Club at Harvard University -- Chief Human Resource Officer (summer interim)Prevent Alcohol Risk related Trauma injuries for Youth program speakerLaurence Decore Student Leadership AwardMount Royal College (University) Student Leadership certification (X2)Frances Caymre memorial AwardCanadian Red Cross Milestone AwardNCCP coaching certifiedUniversity of Calgary Student Success certificationUniversity of Calgary Student Advisory Council (2007-08)University of Calgary Team Leadership certification (X2)University of Calgary Personal Leadership certificationPublication in the Herald & National Post on June 7, 2010 bio of me:\\"A drunk and substance intoxicated driver hit Alex while he is riding his motorcycle years ago.

The Larch Society is a network of communities around the world where severly mentally and physically handicapped adults live together with other caring adults in small groups. Through his experiences living with these severly handicapped individuals, Vanier has asked and answered the question, what is the essence of being human. In this eloquently written, thoughtful and thought provoking book, Jean Vanier discussed what he feels truly determines humanity , what makes us more than just talking, intelligent animals. Although Vanier writes from a Christian perspective, this book is for anyone, of any religious or spiritual perspective or belief."},{"Title":"Becoming Human","review":"I came across this book after reading a footnote in one of Henri Nouwen's book. It first caught my attention in one of Neowen's passages. I was quite intrigued by Vanier's insight and remarks. Once reading Becoming Human I was again reminded of the sanctity of life. &quot;We are simply human beings, enfolded in weakness and in hope, called together to change our world one heart at a time.&quot; (p.163)Vanier's insight into the human heart brings a chilling reminder that we are not a society of the strong and intelligent, that is just part of being human. Understanding our weaknesses and brokeness brings us to a fullness that God originaly intended for us."},{"Title":"Becoming Human","review":"Originally a series of radio broadcasts on the CBC, this delightful little book is a refresher course in being human. In a deceptively simple, meditative style, Jean Vanier shares the wisdom he has gained from years of helping disabled people at the L'Arche communities he founded. Vanier gently explores human frailty and dignity, our need for individual affirmation and loving community, issues of freedom and forgiveness, and the nature of true maturity. Perhaps all disabled people, in the sense that includes everyone, can gain some insight and inspiration here."},{"Title":"Becoming Human","review":"I was profoundly moved by this book--it is far more insightful, better written, and more sincere than just about any other \\"spiritual\\" discourse. Vanier is not someone to promote himself and his ideas. Instead, this short book is straight from the heart of a brilliant man. If only more people read this instead of so much self-indulgent new age literature.I cannot recommend this strongly enough."},{"Title":"Becoming Human","review":"Jean Vanier is my favorite philosopher and spiritual thinker, and although he's a Christian, his teachings have tremendous appeal to people of all religious or non-religious perspectives. What a wonderful, wonderful human being. God bless him! Growing up, I used to eagerly watch Jean Vanier's TV program where he talks about the importance of love and relationship with others, what he calls communion and forming community. And in his sermons he always emphasizes how relationship with a person you care about is more important than material gain. He talks about how materialism satisfies the senses but it leaves an aching emptiness of the soul, which can only be filled by a spiritual relationship with God and an emotional relationship with other people, all based on love. What I love about Vanier's teachings is how he challenges us to open ourselves up to outsiders, especially to those that society sees as weak, different, or inferior, and that by opening up our hearts to them, we can help heal our own inner brokenness as well as theirs. Our world values strength and achievement, but by embracing weakness, we reach a higher inner level of personal compassion and understanding. It's all about learning to accept a person just as he is, rather than shutting oneself off from him simply because he isn't what you expect. It's about unconditional friendship through love, and love through friendship. The people in this world who understand this message and the few who actually live it are truly the blessed of God.David Rehakauthor of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;"},{"Title":"Becoming Human","review":"Vanier mixes timeless truth with a dash of storytelling in this quick read, reaching back into his earliest experiences with the mentally disabled for examples on \`becoming human.'He argues that manifestations of weakness should not be avoided out of ignorance: Now-vigorous people often shun those less fortunate than themselves in the mistaken belief their places will never be reversed. By accepting weakness, however, and by embracing it, such individuals come closer to understanding what it really means to be human.This work is based upon a series of talks Vanier gave through CBC radio, as well as several lectures he conducted at the University of Toronto. The resulting notes and transcripts were brought together in a single manuscript, which Vanier did little to edit. Instead, he merely added small blocks of text to ease the transition from one thought to another.As a consequence, the book is given to redundancy in areas where the lecture notes and CBC transcripts probably overlap. These raw text dumps are so distracting they detract from the book's message; and the material, though offered up in thematic chapters, doesn't have any real sense of order.The author would have done better to rewrite this book based upon his notes, rather than borrowing directly from them. In that way, he could have formed better links between each topic, while at the same time weeding out any glaring repetition."},{"Title":"Becoming Human","review":"Dear friends, In a country, and where, our thinking ought to be less self-indulgence and more communion with others, \\"Becoming Human\\" is a wondeerful and insightful gift on how to heal ourselves so we can see everyone else.

Vanier is the founder of \\"L'Arche,\\" which is an international network in more than 30 countries for people with intellectual disabilities.The author comments that the book springs from his experience of humanness and not directly from his life of faith. In this sense the book is more about anthropology than about spirituality. \\"This book is about the liberation of the human heart from the tentacles of chaos and loneliness,\\" writes its author, \\"and from those fears that provoke us to exclude and reject others. It is a liberation that opens us up and leads us to the discovery of our common humanity\\" (5). Among the subjects addressed in the chapters are the following: loneliness, belonging, inclusion, freedom and forgiveness. The author argues that by opening ourselves to outsiders we can achieve true personal and societal freedom, which includes the freedom to become truly human."},{"Title":"Becoming Human","review":"Jean Vanier is the founder of L'Arche, a international network of communities where people with developmental disabilities and those who assist them live together.. The son of one time Canadian Governor General was in the Royal and Canadian Navy and then studied philosophy and theology in Paris. In 1964 he founded the first L'Arche community in Trosly-Breuil, France, where he still lives. It was at the L'Arche-Daybreak community in Toronto, Canada where famed spiritual writer Henri Nouwen spent his last years as a member and chaplain.This book is an edited series of lectures given on CBC radio in 1998. As he notes in his introduction, Vanier does not talk about faith but rather his vision for creating a common good that radically changes our communities, our relationships and ourselves. Vanier, a Roman Catholic layman, has been widely honored by national, international and faith groups for his work. Some of his other works include: \\"Community and Growth\\", \\"From Brokenness to Community,\\" and a children's book, \\"I Meet Jesus\\".I find that reading this book a moving experience, quite capable of evoking reflections on life and the gospel that are inspiring and challenging. The book has five major divisions which have numerous subsections: Loneliness, Belonging, From Exclusion to Inclusion: a Path of Healing, the Path to Freedom and Forgiveness. These reflections explain the motivation for setting up and the characteristics of Vanier's L'Arche communities that are now spread about the world. They also reveal what measures can humanize communities of any size anywhere. I recommend the book highly."},{"Title":"Becoming Human","review":"Worth reading, short novel.

At first when I was choosing what book to read in my homeroom book shelf I would just pass it by, not caring about it, catching my eye from time to time, but not enough to make me read it. One day I had nothing to read just grabbed it off the shelf and decided it was good enough to satisfy me for the reading period and I enjoyed it much more than I have thought...This book showed how teens were back in the late 60's and most parts of the 70's. It was one of the first books I have read that has a very sad ending. It shows the real life tradgedies found in the real world instead of some old story of boy meets girl, boy gets girl, and happily ever afters...

It was not a corny or fake story. It seemed very realistic and it could happen to kids like us if we lived in a bigger city. The book taught me how drugs can affect your life in a bad way. Drugs don't just affect the person taking or selling them, if affected their loved ones. Bryon had a tough decision to make, but he didn't give it much thought.

It told you about how life in a rough neighborhood can be and what can happen to people like Bryon, Mark, and Charlie. I think the ending of the book really sucked. Bryon wouldn't just get over Cathy that fast and just not care about her anymore. Bryon was friends with Mark since they were almost babies. Why would he ruin their friendship if he knew that Mark would stop if he told him to? The book even said that. I just think that the ending was totally out of place. I don't think that it went with the rest of the story"},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"This story was sad and very wordy.

Sure Mark did alot of things that were wrong,so did Bryon[hence the dilemna] The story did have alot of interesting characters and many action packed adventures as the characters lives intertwined.I wont give away the ending and spoil it for those yet to read it but where I come from you just don't do that[what Bryon did]. I personally would not want Bryon for a \\"friend\\". What would happen when he didn't approve of what I did ? It seems according to the book that would be when he got up on his throne and judged me. With friends like that who needs enemies comes to mind. A very good book but with a twisted sense of morality. Instead of someone who had finally grown up and taken responsibilty for his actions I saw a hypocrite who developed a holier than thou attitude.Very realistic characters . All in all a very good book by S.E. Hinton who I thought for years was a man! Every book that she wrote was exceptionally good.If I am not mistaken most of her books were eventually made into movies.You can thank S.E.

There was a lot I liked about this book but this was the first one where I actually felt like I was reading a \\"teen\\" book. I really could have done without all the corny straight out of an old episode of Dragnet portrayals of hippies and drug use.

That is the idea behind That Was Then, This is Now by S.E. Hinton. Mark has lived with Bryon and his mother for five years. They have been best friends for as long as either one can remember. They are having a hard time making money and Mark and Bryon both have to get jobs. When someone needs money there's no telling how far they will go to get it.I would give this book four stars because I really liked it. I liked it because it really touches on some of the tougher decisions in life. This book is realistic fiction. The characters are very well developed and so is the plot. The author is very descriptive and interesting. This book keeps you on the edge of your seat, waiting for more. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good intense but dramatic book. S.E. Hinton doesn't fail to amaze me with another great book.-S.S."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"I have loved this book since I was a child and it remains one of my favorites today.The protagonist is a bright, articulate boy named Byron. He lives with his almost nonexistent mother and his adopted brother, Mark. An accomplished car thief (\\"nothing to hot wiring,\\" according to him) and lover of fights, Mark is bad news. Byron describes him in an almost feral way; Mark had leonine coloring and features and his most outstanding feature is his amber colored eyes. Being with Mark is like a roller-coaster ride. Byron enjoys the excitement that living on the edge with Mark can bring.The characters are sharp and richly drawn as is the Oklahoma town of the mid-1960s where the story takes place. One gets a strong, compelling sense of the characters and the dividing line in their immediate community. The \\"Greasers,\\" so called because of their love for Elvis and tendency to use hair grease are looked down upon because they live on the \\"wrong side of the tracks,\\" the east side of town. The Socs, (short for \\"Socialites\\") on the other hand are their affluent West Side counterparts. Byron falls hard for a socially mobile girl and takes her little brother, nicknamed M&M; under his wing. The girl later ends up dating Byron's friend, the weirdly named Ponyboy who is in Byron's social circle.The kids in this work, as in all of S. E. Hinton's works are highly independent. Adult characters are peripheral at best. The story is really about the young people in the Oklahoma community and their issues, confrontations and interactions. S. E. Hinton's books during this time period tend to be juvenocracies, that is ruled by youth.Guns, drugs and violence are all part of the story. The conflict between the Socs and the Greasers is like \\"West Side Story\\" with bite, punch and gritty attitude. I love it!S. E. Hinton is a highly gifted writer. She has a real gift for voice, place and character development. This work is very compelling and will leave you thinking about the characters and the various fates they meet long after you turn the last page."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"When I was in tenth grade, my English teacher read \\"The Outsiders\\" by S. E. Hinton to the class. I loved the book so much that I reread it one year later and consider it one of the best examples of fiction about teenagers. While this book isn't quite the caliber of \\"Outsiders\\" it is another excellent novel about teenagers experiencing troubles.Bryon and Mark are teenage boys who are juvenile delinquents. They live in the same house and call each other brothers, even though they are not. Mark's parents shot and killed each other in a confrontation over the fact that the man knew that he was not Mark's biological father. After their deaths, Mark moved in with Bryon and his mother.Although Bryon's mother is put forward as a good woman, she pays little attention to the boys. They stay out as late as they want, occasionally not coming home for days. They are in trouble a great deal although Mark is one of those people who always seems to be able to charm his way out of difficult situations.As the story unfolds, the boys get in fights, hustle pool, Bryon falls in love, one of their older friends gets killed in a gun battle defending them, Mark starts selling drugs and Bryon sees a young innocent boy ruin his life taking drugs.Bryon begins correcting his life, he gets a job, gets good grades and reports Mark over to the police. At the end, Bryon goes to visit Mark in the juvenile jail and he realizes that Mark hates him and would kill him if he had the chance. The jail time turns Mark into a hardened criminal, or more precisely causes those tendencies to come to the surface.There is no happy ending to this story, just an ending that could have been much sadder than it was. These are boys who have little chance to make something of their lives, although Bryon is on the path to some form of success. Hinton writes very well and is good at describing the near hopelessness of the lives of the people. While it is clear that some of the characters are very bright and could have a future, the circumstances make it unlikely to impossible. Note: Ponyboy Curtis, one of the main characters in \\"Outsiders\\" appears in this book."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"In the book, That was Than This is Now by S.E. Hinton, a young boy goes on his path to maturity while his best friend is still acting like a tough greaser. Like many of S.E. Hinton's books this takes place in a time of gangs and hippies. After the socs and the greasers' war, Bryon and his best friend Mark are enjoying life by being to able to do whatever they want. Mark was brought into Bryon's family after his parents killed each other. Their mother does not care what they do as long as they don't get themselves killed. Him and Bryon have been best friends since they were little kids mixed up in the greasers. They hang out in a bar, hustle complete strangers in pool and go to the drug store with M&amp;M, who is a hippie. Due to a turn in events these three, and M&amp;M's sister, Cathy, get into a dilemma where their decisions can determine the rest of their lives.This book that S.E. Hinton wrote is a lot like many others he wrote, such as Taming the Star Runner, Tex, and Rumble Fish. It takes place in the mind of a young boy going through tough times by living on the streets. This book's time period is probably two years after The Outsiders, but in this book, unlike The Outsiders, the characters are different. There is still Ponyboy Curtis, but that is the only character from The Outsiders. S.E. Hinton has written many good books for young readers and this book is no exception. I really enjoyed reading this book and recommend this book for all young readers."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"This is a powerful book that is excellently written. It tells of a teenager who is finding himself and must make decisions that ruin friendships and effect his life. Throughout this boy's maturing, many characters are introduced. The characters almost come alive, they are so real.Toward the end of the book, I found myself in tears as the boy makes a necesary decision that SEEMS right, that appears to be the moral decision, but the outcome doesn't seem fitting and it made me wonder whether he made the right choice, whether that was the right decision.This book is very life-like, very real. S.E. Hinton is my favorite author and she writes about what she knows; thus, the situations are easy to relate to. Infact, without even meaning to, I found myself relating to the story, comparing it to my life. The knowledge I received from this book will help me make decisions as I get older. If you are a young adult searching for who you are, or someone trying to make the right decisions in life, you need to read this book! It makes you think and ask yourself, &quot;What is the right choice? What did this boy do wrong?&quot; Apply it to your life and learn from the lesson, almost hidden, in this book"},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"I really enjoyed the book, That was then, This in now. The story was based on two boys that have been friends since they were kids. The plot was based on the lives of the teenagers, many who remind me of the teenagers at my school. The message the author was trying to convey was that people change as they grow up, specifically, children changing to adults. On was the author delivered the message, was through the plot. The main charachter Bryon had to decide whether or not to tell on his best friend for dealing drugs. They had been good friends, but lately had been fading away from eachother. Bryon explains his feelings for Mark in the quote, \\"I looked at him and suddenly it was like seeing someone across a deep pit, someone you couldn't ever reach.\\" The story is told from Bryons point of few, I think the author made the story more effective, by writing it that way. Throughout the story I couldn't tell what the other charachters were really thinking. The message seemed more effective since it was only conveyed through one main charachter. When I chose this book, I thought it would be good because it was about teenagers, and there struggles with drugs. The booked turned out to be really good, and I couldn't put it down. I would recomend this book to anyone, especially teenagers."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"&quot;That was Then, This is Now&quot; was an excellent book. S.E. Hinton did a wonderful job keeping me in suspense the whole time. I read it for a school assignment, but I finished it before my time limit was up because I just couldn't put it down. I felt like I really knew the characters and what they were going through, which was something I had never felt before. All in all, it was a wonderful book filled with laughter and tears, and was not the least bit disappointing."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"This book, a semi-sequel to SE Hinton's first novel, the Outsiders, proves to be one of the finest books I've ever read. I'm in my mid-teens now, so I'm not too far from the age of Mark and Bryon.Right now things have changed so much and now that I've read this book, I understand that these problems are normal and that things do change.The issues with Mark and Bryon are so complex that they will eat at your skin and hurt you deeply because this stuff is just normal and it can happen to anyone at any time.Aside from being a guide to reality, she reincorporates some of her older characters and they play nice roles in this story.All in all, it's one of my favorites. Completely recommended."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"The scare stories grownups tell kids to frighten them back onto the straight and narrow go back a long way. Here's one I had to read in school because I was in 8th grade the year it was published. This book is the probably the grimmest teen novel I have ever read, and I read through tons of 'em in the '70s, and there were quite a few grim ones. Senseless violence and mayhem galore. The author deserves credit for taking a tough look at racial problems. That \\"kill the honky\\" scene shocked me deeply as a kid. She fails on antidrug propaganda, though. M&M; is meant as a warning to kids to stay away from marjuana and LSD. He goes into a permanent bad trip and has to be institutionalized, complaining that giant spiders were holding him down and biting him. When kids do drop acid and find out that it isn't like that, and it doesn't cause drastic psychotic breaks, they feel resentment at being fed untruths by grownups, and this sows distrust. They grow up to use slogans like \\"Question authority.\\"S.E. Hinton wrote the gritty reality of Tulsa working-class teenage life in The Outsiders, and told the truth from her own experience. This made her first book such a powerful classic. TWTTIN is the product of her beginning adulthood and she mixed her narrative with propaganda which The Outsiders had been free of. Once she grew out of adolescence herself, her writing went from teen reality to teensploitation. Hinton gives a brief nod to her breakthrough success in this followup, by having Bryon recognize Ponyboy, but it's clear that they are not friends, so The Outsiders is only tangential to this book."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"What will Bryon do now that he's found out about Mark's secret, how will he handle this?\\"The name of this book is That Was Then, This Is Now and the author of the book is S.E. Hinton. This book takes place back in the 70's and 80's, back when there were socials and greasers. This book is about a boy named Bryon and his friend Mark who grew up together like brothers. Now Bryon and Mark are starting to grow apart from each other Bryon has a new girlfriend, which he spends more time with now, and does not really, spend as much time with Mark. Until one day, Bryon finds out a shocking secret about Mark, and faces difficult decisions that will change his life forever.That Was Then, This Is Now is one of the greatest books in the world, because it is so dramatic and intriguing. In this book, the author talks about real life incidents that happen to teenagers when they get in bad crowds. This book is very encouraging to many teenagers, because of its realistic features. The author includes different incidents that teenagers face once they grow up and go to high school; it has a good moral because it shows readers what they should not do. You should read this book because, once you read it, you will imagine that you are the protagonist, facing everything. In this book, a teenager faces very difficult decisions, which he does not really know how to solve."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"That Was Then, This Is Now is a fast-paced and exciting story of drugs, love, and what it's like to be the only one a person cares about. It isn't as coming-of-age as The Outsiders is but serves as kind of a semi-sequel, with a more detailed look at Tim and Curly Shepard and an introduction of their sister Angela. Ponyboy Curtis plays a minor role, this time a sixteen year old and hanging out with other people besides his gang. Bryon, the narrator, even tells the reader that The Dingo, a grease hangout, was bombed, causing the greasers to move to Soc hangouts and thus partially decreasing the Greaser/Soc conflict. Despite this breakthrough, the boys continue to get in any fight they can until the night when one of their friends gets shot because of something they did (may not seem clear, but read the book to find out what I mean). This event deeply affects Bryon, but doesn't even seem to touch Mark's happy, no-regrets outlook on life. When Bryon asks him why he's so unaffected, Mark answers angrily, &quot;Things happen the way they happen. You don't ask 'what if!' You shouldn't start questioning why things happen the way they do, because that's when you get old! You never used to act this way, Bryon...&quot; And near the end when Bryon discovers a tube of pills under the mattress, he is torn between doing what he knows is right or defending his best friend. In the end, there isn't really an exact answer as to what happens between Mark and Bryon and why, but instead we are left with Bryon's questioning; of himself and his life before he &quot;grew up&quot;. To me, it wasn't an annoying, what-did-I-even-read-this-for cliffhanger, but a powerful punch that will leave you breathless in it's ruthless portrayal of how drugs can effect you and the ones you care about as quick as the amount of time it takes to call the police.That shows you what a damn good book this is."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"That Was Then, This is NowFinding a book I like to read is very hard for me.

I never wanted to stop reading it was very indulging. You think this turns out to be a happy book like all the other books you may have read but this one throws you for a spin. I would buy this book and read it just for the ending at least. Everythin that happens is so riveting and real that you can't stop reading until its over. You'll love mark and hate mark and love him, byron and his relationship is surreal if youve never had a best friend or in his case, a real one.

They go through challanging phases and intersting scenes."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"This book is the most interesting book I have ever read. The characters were all surprislingly unique and strong in different ways. Bryon and Mark are two different people that in some way get along. Bryon thinks one way and Mark does in another.The plot of the story was confusing at first but fun. It was just a plain day (or night) for the two brothers and suddenly, there friend at the bar is dead. Things get even worse when their compaion kid, also known as a hippie disappeared. The frantic sister who also started dating Bryon looked everywhere for him.the ending was scary. Bryon and Mark's connection was lost and that made things worse. Mark hated Bryon now and the relationship was broken. It surprised me that such a close relationship with two guys could go down so fast and they end up hating each other.

They may offend some people so if you are young and immature and can't handle the truth, then you don't want to read this book. Even if I don't agree with what was happening some of the time, at my age I still need to learn how to deal with it.To break it down, all in all, this book is realistic.

Hinton&#65533;s book That was then, This is Now was an awful book. No one in there right mind would write about fighting, stealing, getting drunk, getting high, and getting killed and hope that kids would enjoy it. Yeah, it sounds really fun jumping people and running from the cops and using dirty language. HAH! No wonder this book is on all the banned book lists and the movie is rated &#65533;R.&#65533; I thought that this book was way too violent and had way too much drug abuse and swearing. It was incredibly sow-moving and it took forever to get to the climax. And what is with Bryon? In the last chapters he does something completely out of character. Dumps Cathy after saying how much he loves her and turns on Mark. Does this guy have mood swings or what? S.E. Hinton could have made the characters a little more real. I think she must have been tired of writing or something because she ended the book in about one paragraph.

The ending was very predictable and I knew what was going to happen through the whole thing. I also did not like the way Bryon told on his best friend who is also like a brother. If someone finds out that one of his brothers or sisters is selling drugs they should first confront the person about it not just sell them out. I don't think that this would really happen in real life. I just think that the story could have been more realistic in some of the situations. For example, one thing that is not realistic is that Kathy and Bryon break up. This also would not happen because a guy wouldn't do that in real life. The way Kathy and him were would not change so quickly. I don't think that the book expressed realistic decisions that would be made by the characters. Another thing I did not like was the way that Bryon's mom reacted to all the conflicts and trouble that her sons got into. I know for a fact that a mother would not act that way, she would not just turn her head when her children were getting into constant trouble including fights, witnesses to a murder, and smoking. all in all, I did not enjoy this book and I don't recommend it to anyone unless they like unrealistic conclusions."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"so i ordered this book exactly one month ago today. i still havent receieved it! i had the standard ground shipping, but i mean come on? 1 MONTH!! give me a break. $3.99 for shipping and it wasnt even shipped a month later!! ummm hello? i ordered the book because i want to read it! not wait a year for it to get here!"},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"It was a very boring, and meaning less book which shouldnt of even been published.

If you are a person looking for a book about cheating and getting into mischief, then this is a book for you. Right from the start of this book it caught my eye. There is two best friends named Bryon and Mark who always seemed to be getting into trouble. They thought of themselves as brothers because when were young Mark's parents shot and killed each other and Mark moved in with Bryon and his mother. Bryon was known as a player but he fell in love with his friend M&amp;M's sister. M&amp;M was a really smart kid who always read and babysat his little brothers and sisters he really liked it. But his father picked on him all the time so he ended up running away with a group of hippies and started taking LSD and he had a bad trip and lost himself. Cathy who was Bryon's girl friend and M&amp;M's sister took this really hard and so did Bryon because he cared for Cathy so much. Bryon later found out that his best friend Mark sold M&amp;M the LSD and Bryon had no choice but to call the police. The Police ended up taking Mark to jail where he ended up in a state prison. In the end Bryon forgot about Mark and he broke it off with Cathy and went on his own. \\"That Was Then, This Is Now\\". I recommend this to everyone. I really like this book because it is about this day in age. Most of the stuff that happens in this book really happens now, so if you have a crazy life style then this should be a book for you."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"That Was Then This Is NowBryon is a strong, 16 year old teenager in the book That Was Then This Is Now by S.E. Hinton. Bryon has a very special talent which is hustling people in pool. He has been doing this since he was 12 years old. Bryon lives with his mom in a little town in Oklahoma. His best friend Mark is living with him.There's a reason why Mark is living with him. That reason is that his parents died when he was nine. Mark's parents were drunk and they were arguing that night. His dad got mad at his mom. Then his dad shot his mom and she fell to the ground. Then his mom shot his dad back. They both bled to death. Then Mark went to live with Byron and his mom.Byron and Mark have been friends since they were very young. They grew up together in the same little town. Byron says there like brothers. Byron is big, tall, and strong. Mark is short and strong. They like to get in fights a lot. Mark hot wires cars to get around town. He has done that since he was twelve.But they also have a problem. As they grow up they are growing apart from each other. Bryon starts going out with Cathy. Mark starts to get jealous of Cathy because Bryon is spending more time with Cathy. Then Mark starts acting a little weird and Byron notices it. He starts to look a little different. Then his attitude was changing about everything. He starts to talk back to Bryon and he has never done that before. Then Byron figures out why he is acting strange. Mark has a big secret. But you have to read the book to find out what it is.If you like books about love, growing up, and a little action then this book is for you. This book is very interesting. I think it was very interesting when they protect their friend M&M; from the guys who jumped him. I think the author wrote this book so kids won't get in gangs. They won't get a bad life or future. If you read the back it makes you want to read it. I wanted to know what kept them apart so I read the book at home for an hour each day until I got to the end. I was amazed by the ending. The book has 159 pages in all. Its reading level is 4.6."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"I first read That was then, this is now in the sixth grade. It was after i read The Outsiders. And after i fell in love with the outsiders I'd figure i would give this book a try and I'm glad i did. I grew quite fond of this book. It wasn't as sad as the outsiders or as good but it was still satisfying. Then i read S.E Hinton's other novels and i became to know Hintons novels pretty well. I'm also pretty happy that i read her books."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"The book that I read was called That Was Then, This is Now, by S.E. Hinton. This is a story about two friends who are real close at a young age, but when they grow up they also grow apart. Marks parents died when he was eight years old. His friend Bryon down the street took him in. Bryon's mom would have had a lot more kids, but she could only afford two. Mark and Bryon were only a year apart. They did everything together, they went movies, lunch, the bowling alley, and even fought side by side in every fight they got into. One day Mark and Bryon's friend M&M; told them that his sister came home from boarding school. Bryon likes her and starts to go out. Mark gets jealous and starts to go out on his own. Bryon is worried and doesn't know how Mark is getting all his money from.My opinion on this book is that it teaches me to always stay close to your friends. I think if something is wrong with them you should ask them what the matter is. I also think if your friend starts to do things that you think are wrong you should either tell someone, tell them to stop, or not hang out with them.My recommendation on this book is for people who have good relationships with their friends. I say this is because if you don't want to lose your friendship with someone then you can tell them to stop doing things bad. You also can have a talk telling them to stop doing what is wrong and to start doing the right thing. This will keep your friendship going and most importantly keep you and your friends out of trouble."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"No sugar coating here. This is a straightforward novel that tells the story of two friends at a crossroads in their lives and friendship, and of the two distinct choices they make. While not up to the caliber of The Outsiders (I think more depth could have been given to some of the characters; they are not as well developed as those in The Outsiders), it is still, none the less, one of Hinton's greats. The inclusion of drug use, domestic violence and gun violence make it even edgier than The Outsiders. Because of that, there are likely some who would rather teenagers not read it. I would disagree with them. I read it for the first time in high school and at once saw it as an important read, as it makes the point you have to choose how you want your life to go, even if your friends, or those who say they are, don't support that choice. For readers who have enjoyed this book and are looking for other troubled teen novels to sink their teeth into, I would recommend The Catcher In The Rye, American Odyssey and The Amboy Dukes."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"I enjoyed this book because of how everything about the character changes and because of these changes his life and relationships change.Byron and Mark have been as close as brothers ever since Byron's mother took Mark in. As kids Mark and Byron always did things that were way beyond what any normal kid was doing, like smoking at the age of 12! As Byron grew older though his perception changed, which probably had something to do with Cathy. Unfortunately, Mark hasn't changed a bit and still has a crazy soul. As he's grown older his decisions have grown worse. As a result, the two of them are growing apart.This book is great for any teen because of how it has so many of the issues that they go through everyday, even though some of the issues have been extremely dramatized."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"I think the book made a good point of what teenagers went through in the 1960s. Back then, lots of teens my age were getting into fighting, using drugs and trying alcohol. Some spent time in jail. My favorite part of the book was learning about The Ribbon, because there were lots of fastfood places with different kinds of foods.My two favorite characters were Bryon and Mark. I liked it when Bryon went on a date with Cathy. He showed he could love someone other than himself. Mark treated Bryon like a brother; he was loyal and wanted to protect Bryon.This book has an important message for teens. It reminds us that if you choose to get in trouble, you will pay the consequences, like getting addicted to drugs, getting beaten up or even winding up in jail."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"I remember the feeling I had when reading this book. It was brimming with this isolation, the kind of isolation one can still feel when surrounded by people close to your heart. We all have friends that pull apart from us after a time. This book is unique in that the main character gives up on his friend, and in turn makes his friend hate him. Most of us who have drifted away from friends cannot say the same thing to such an extreme degree, but it still doesn't account for why we don't call them, why we don't try and get a hold of them, or see them, or ask how they are. All in all a very sound read. I love all of S.E. Hinton's books, but I believe this is my second favorite right behind Rumble Fish. This is definately the saddest of her books though, that I have read as of yet."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"Byron is a smart sophisticated boy, who wants a job. Bryon has dark brown hair and brown eyes. He is a tough guy, and his body language sure shows it. Mark is also a tough guy. He has golden hair, with gold rings around his eyes. He'll sell anything just for money, to help Bryon's mom out, who is in the hospital. Bryon and Mark both like to drink and go to parties. They hustle people for money by playing pool. They get a lot of money out of it. The way Bryon and Mark look and act changes through out the book. The reader can see a big change in both of their lives.Bryon and Mark are like brothers to each other. When they were younger they used to play cowboy games with each other. When they got older they drank alcohol, just to show that they were cool.One day Mark's parents died because they were drunk, and they picked up a gun and shot each other. From then on Mark has lived with Bryon and his mom.S.E. Hinton has written very successful books such as That Was Then This is Now. The reader gets a chance to see how it is from a character's point of view. The characters show ways to be educated, cool, and a good friend. Along the way the reader can see that even a tough guy, one who has done some crazy things in the past, can change right before your eyes.I would recommend this book for people who would like to see that people can change but still have their own ways of expressing themselves. Bryon shows readers how to do that."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"After reading the Outsiders by S. E. Hinton and absolutely loved it, I began to look into other books written by her. I happened to fall onto this book. It is really an amazing story it was hard for me to put it down, because every time I did all I wanted to do was to find out what was going to happen next. The only thing about this story is the ending it's really depressing, at lest in my opinion. I mean it hit me really hard; I was depressed for a couple days after completing it. Nonetheless it is a story worth reading."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"I downloaded this e-book from Amazon.com to my Kindle Fire. The Author S.E. Hinton did an excellent job writing this e-book. This e-book is written in the first person. The simple approach to the story was a good idea. The Author focused more on the character development and the characters emotions and feelings rather than creating and building scenes to get the story out. Good job on the first and second spark stating the main point of the story. The emotional connection with the characters is what drew me into the story. This is a simply written timeless story of the struggle for survival starting at a young age. The formatting of the e-book was good. I have and would recommend this book to a friend."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"I've always loved S. E. Hinton.

Unfortunately, it just didn't captivate them like The Outsiders. It takes too long to discover the conflict in the novel and didn't have the action to propel their interest forward. We gave it a \\"go\\" for two to three weeks, then decided to abandon it. Maybe knowing it was a sequel built up our expectations too much. Maybe we didn't give it enough time. Not sure. I know I'll have some students who choose to finish it on their own, but as a whole-class read, we decided to pass."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"Chris CooganHeather AyersEnglish 1 Honors19 May 2012That Was Then, This Is NowThat Was Then, This Is Now by S.E. Hinton is a suspenseful story filled with comedy, romance, and tragedy. It is about a young teenage boy named Bryon and his best friend and newly adopted younger brother Mark. They are always having fun getting into fights, hustling people at pool, and drinking. But as Bryon starts to grow older, everything is starting to change for them.It starts off with Bryon and Mark having fun hustling some strangers at pool in Charlie's bar. Everything is just plain old normal life for them until their friend M&M;'s sister, Cathy, moves back into town. Bryon starts hanging out with her and it gets way more serious between the two of them than Bryon had ever planned. With his time being consumed with his new girlfriend, Bryon has less and less time to spend with his brother Mark. After a while Bryon gets a job and basically starts growing up but starts to leave Mark behind even more. Without Bryon to be there as much and talk some sense into him, Mark starts getting into all kinds of trouble. All these things happening really start to wear down the inseparable relationship that these two young boys once had. This quote found on page 67 really shows how inseparable the boys were until all of this started happening; \\"We were always with a bunch of guys. Sometimes it was the same bunch for a year or two, then people would drift away-usually if anyone got a steady girl it cut down on a lot of goofing around with the guys- and different people would drift in. But Mark was always the hub of this circle of people, and I was always with Mark.\\"I would have to say that one main central theme to this book is that growing up is not as easy as you would think it would be. This story describes this theme chronically throughout every chapter. Bryon would always find something new that would become an obstacle in his life with Mark. Hw would always say how much easier everything had felt before and how he had thought he had all the answers. This quoted found on page 87 really shows how much Bryon's new life affected the relationship these buys had,\\"Mark was acting strange these days, too. He would stare at me for long periods of time when he thought I wasn't watching, like he was trying to find the old Bryon in this stranger, like he was trying to figure out who I was. One night he even almost lost his temper with me when I told him I was goofing around with Cathy instead of with him. It was as if he felt something slipping and was trying to hang on. I couldn't help him; I was trying to hang myself.\\"This really shows how both of them knew they were starting to separate, but alsohow Bryon had no idea how to stop or change it. He wished he could, but in his heart Bryon knew he was leaving his brother and best friend Mark behind him.The author of this book, S.E. Hinton, is famous for writing stories about young teenage boys who run into all sorts of struggles in their life such as gangs, girls, and most of them even result in losing a very near and dear friend. Two examples of the books she's written, and two of my personal favorite books of all time, are The Outsiders and Rumble Fish.I would probably recommend this story more towards teenagers because it really shows the struggles they have to deal with while getting older. But to be honest, I feel that if you like good stories with comedy, action, suspense, and romance, than you would love this book."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"I read the book in one sitting. Ipicked it up, started reading and found the story too good to putdown. S.E. Hinton makes her characters so life-like and real, you feel that you know them, or you are them in a sense. I love the way the whole world around them plays into the story. Not just a few events or friends, but their whole life. An entire year of their life. The conflicts between them all keep you interested. I have a best friend like Bryon, and I can relate to how it feels to have a friend that seems like a brother. You love them, you care about them. I have also been in love like Bryon, you would do anything in the world for them, and anything in the world to protect them from being hurt. I liked Bryons character, he was a sensible person. Caring and affectionate. Though his transformation at the end to some heartless and emotionless person made me wonder why someone would write such a great story to waste it with an ending like that. The most sensible person in the book, has no sense at all anymore. He betrays everyone he loves. You can't just abandon true love or friendship. In another review they quoted &quot;The ending will surprise readers, challenging them to puzzle over Bryon's dilemma in their own hearts.&quot;, Well it almost crushed my heart. As I also said earlier, S.E. Hinton makes you feel like you know those people, or are apart of them. And knowing Bryons metamorphasis to some heartless person hurt me. I recommend the book to everyone because its a great story of life, and it will make you think."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"Does growing up have to mean growing apart?I am a 14-year-old girl that recently read a slow non-exciting book called \\"That Was Then This Is Now\\". In my opinion I definetly recommend this book to 14-17 year old boys. The reason is because it is about a young, smart and honest 17-year-old boy called Bryon. He has an adopted brother called Mark. Mark is the kind of guy that goes to a bar and drinks, gambles and uses the money to buy cigarettes. Bryon, is always looking after him, they are really close friends. That's why the main topic of the book is friendshipBryon and Mark are really tough guys and they defend people by beating up some bullies. But they never do it without a reason. Like once a friend of there's called m&m; was coming out of the bowling alley and some big nasty boys came around and started to hit him and try to get his money but Mark and Bryon went and beat the heck out of the guys and m&m; was ok.The next day they went to see their mom at the hospital because she was old and sick. When they got there they saw this guy laying on one of the hospital beds. He was all bruised and bloody, so Mark and Bryon went to ask what was wrong so he said that some black bullies had beaten him up. Bryon and mark felt so bad for him.After some time a girl walled into both their lives. They both liked her and wanted her would this girl ruin the relationship between Mark and Bryon?But then Bryon finds out some thing so shocking about Mark, which he never thought he would do. So Bryon faces a terrible decision about this big discovery.

I liked how even though this book was written and takes place in a different time period it can still fit into society today. The issues that these boys go through happen very often and the dilemas that occur can be related to, to those who grow up in families who have an uncertain financial situation.Personally i cannot relate to these characters as much because I am not growing up in the same situation. However, I can also relate to this characters because these boys are very much like me and my friends based on their thoughts and similarity in actions.One of my favorite things is how this book can fit into many different time periods. The chracters deal with drug abuse and family seperation. These awful things occur today and many people reading this book will feel sympathy for the characters. It will also give you a deeper meaning to when your parents tell you, \\"Be thankful for what you have.\\""},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"This was on my son's wish list for X-mas.

Reading this book was a positive experience for me because it is very realistic, and the characters are interesting and believable.I liked all the scenes of the book, but my favorite scenes were in the beginning. The reason I like the scenes in the beginning seemed more interesting because the two main characters Bryon and Mark were always together running the streets and every time I stopped reading the book it left me wondering what was going to happen next. An example of this is when they get into a fight in the bar. Hinton's description is excellent: \\"Local police were amazed with Charlie bravery for giving his life to save Mark and Bryan's life.\\"If I had the chance to change any scenes in the novel I would change the scenes in the end because Bryan gets hooked up with some girl and starts to calm down. It really gets kind of boring because Bryon and Mark start doing their own thing and they don't run the streets anymore. I would change it by taking that girl out of the story.I learned a few things from this novel. One thing is that you should learn from your mistakes and never do them twice.

I am the type of person who likes happy endings, and the fact that Mark and Bryon didn't become friends again upset me.I think that S.E. Hinton is a very good writer. She always seems to have her books in a very good format and in the perfect wordings for our age group.I just think that with this kind of story with best friends (almost brothers) there should be a happy ending.

Especially because the author put alot of stuff that would happen in modern life, such as pulling pranks like when they cut angelas hair off.

There are a lot of quotes i can relate to and a lot of the emotions the characters go through i have gone through myself. SE Hinton is my absolute favorite young adult writer of all time. Its not quite as good as The Outsiders but i don't think any book could have topped that. I enjoyed reading the book and it gives you a new perspective on things.My only problem with it (the reason i didn't give it 5 stars) was i didn't understand the ending. I have a vague idea but i don't know why Bryan did what he did.I think it's a good short read obviously for young adults, but really for anyone who likes a good story."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"The main character in my story is a 16 year old boy named Bryon. The other main character in the story is 15 year old boy named Mark but there are other character such as M&M and Cathy. The setting takes place in the 70's. Mark's parents are dead they killed each other. Bryon dad left him and only his mom takes care of him and Mark. Bryon's mom has a thing for taking in strays but she dose not mind. The problem later on in the story is that Cathy's brother goes missing and their best friend gets shot and to top it off Byron mom dose not have enough money to pay her hospital medical bill. Later on Byron gets a job at the grocer y store to help and Mark dose something but he brings home to much money for one night. Later on they found M&M and he took a drug that mad him crazy. Towards the end of the story Byron found out that Mark was selling the same kind of drug that M&M took, and he called the police they took away Mark and the last words he uttered to Mark was \`why you doing this to me buddy'."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"This book was very good. We enjoyed reading about the fights, drugs, and real life situations. We could not predict what was going to happen next. It related to some people's everyday normal life. The characters were simlar to some of the kids who attend our school. Mark and Bryon go through several changes throughout the book, both in their relationship together as well as their individual personal lives. For example, Bryon gets a job while Mark pushes drugs. They begin to grow apart when Bryon starts dating Cathy. The climax is the ending when Mark tells Bryon that he hates him while Bryon is visiting him in prison. If we could rewrite the last couple of chapters, we would have Bryon talk to Mark and stop him from selling drugs, instead of him being a snitch. Bryon and Cathy would stay together and Mark would not go to jail. M & M would overdose but be okay afterwards. The sequel would have Mark get out of jail and Bryon and Cathy get back together. M & M would go to rehab. Overall, we really enjoyed this book and recommend it to all students."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"i loved this book it so really amazing! if you are a fan of S.E. hinton's books, you will not be disapointed this book deserves 5 stars!!!!"},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"This was by far the best book my 7th grade reading class read last year. It has everything a 13 year old could want: murder, drugs, racism, betrayal, and even romance. The first three may sound like negatives, but given the context and time period, it was done very tastefully. I don't understand why this book doesn't get more attention, it's my opinion that this is better than \\"The Outsiders\\", which is a classic. S.E Hinton outdid herself with this novel, and should be proud of this literary masterpiece. It also contains a number of memorable quotes."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"That was then this is now was an exceptional book. Anyine who like any of Hinton's previous works (ex. Rumble Fish, The Outsiders) would love this book. The plot about 2 inseperable brothers begining tho grw apart because of drugs. Eventhough the ending was very depressing I would still recomend this book to anyine who liked Hinton's previous works."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"First of all \\"That was Then This Is Now\\" truly makes you appreciate everything you have in life, especially a good home. Mark's parents killed each other in a vicious rage and he was left with nowhere to turn except his best friend Byron. Growing up Byron and Mark were best friends, always together causing mischief and having fun but as time passed their friendship would be tested. Byron and Mark lived with Byron's real mother and they had to work hard to support the family. So you see they didn't live in candy land which sets up a great storyline. The boys live on the street fighting and always on their guard, protecting themselves from the rest of the world. The fighting seems like a form of entertainment and a joke until finally, Charlie a local bar owner dies protecting them from a couple of rough guys. Byron and Mark knew a kid by the name of M & M who was a hippie with long hair and a peace necklace. His father constantly gave him trouble, which in the end causes him to runaway. M & M's sister, Cathy ends up going out with Byron. In this book Byron and Marks friendship is tested in many ways, maybe by Cathy or Marks friendship with Ponyboy Curtis. One of the reasons I truly enjoyed this book and I believe one of the reasons for this is I'm a teenager and this book truly relates to a teenage life. The drama and suspense in the last chapters when you find Mark and Byron against each other, not supporting each other set up wonderfully for a mind boggling ending. Byron's actions at the end of the book leave you wondering about the mental condition of the main character. I would recommend \\"that was then this is now\\" to anyone wishing to read a quality book."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"In this book a boy named Bryon and his brother, Mark, go with eachother to many places and have fun. They are in kind of a bad town where there are lots of drugs and fights. They have lots of friends. Bryon and Mark are bad kids too. They steal from places, hustle people in pool, and sell drugs. In the climax everything starts to fall apart. Some people die, get arrested, and become enemies. The theme of this book is betrayalI think this is a pretty alright book. It starts out good. Everything is going well for Bryon, he has many friends, and he feels that his life is pretty good. Then things fall apart. His friends died, or got boozed up too much, or betrayed him. The book starts out great like this is a great book, ist a good thing to read. But then is goes downhill.

Charlie the owner of the pool hall comes out and saves Mark and Bryon but something goes wrong when Charlie is dead. That was the beginning.I think That was Then, This is Now is a great book and it really touches you. I recommend this book for children twelve and up because of the slang, violence, and drug use.

So Bryon's mom took him in as her own.Bryon and Mark become \\"brothers\\". As they mature, they grow further away from each other. I would recommend reading this if you liked The Outsiders.

It was! In fact, in some ways I enjoy it more because I haven't seen the movie so my imagination is freer. The plot is also much more thought-provoking that that of most Young Adult Books. I would recommend it for any teenager and for adults who are willing to read with an open mind and remember what it was like to be young. These are not all golden days, it's not all sunshine."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"Byron and Mark are the best of friends.

It is very reality based and you can really put yourself in it. S.E. Hinton really did a great job on the book!! Not another like it. Hard to forget."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"This book is about two friends who experience a lot of things. They question their friendship all through the book. I really like this book becouse it keepps you on the edge oof your seat. You feel all these emotions about the the characters. The main chatacters are Mark and Byron. There are only a few thins wrong with this book. S.E.Hinton can not come up with new names such as the place they hang out at. They hang out at the Dingo. In The Outsiders that is were they hang out. One of the characters in this book is Tim and Curly Shepard.Tim Shepard is a character in The Outsiders. All and all this was a good book. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure novels."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"S.E.Hinton deffinitley did it again, with That was THen This is Now!

The book mentions Ponyboy Curtis, a greaser in the Outsiders, but focuses a lot more on the two of them. The rivalry between grease and Soc is dying out. The book also includes Bryon's girlfriend, Cathy, and her brother, M&amp;M, who is a hippie.The book shows the bonds between Mark and Bryon, but readers are in for a shocking ending. The ending was different from other S.E. Hinton books. A good book for anyone who is interested in the changes that happen in society after the Outsiders. Or if you're simply interested in another story altogether."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"Amazingly realistic characters are the glue to That Was Then, This Is Now, an unpredictable, complicated story about change. S. E. Hinton's main character, Bryon, is so vividly described that the reader begins to envision him as a real, live person. In the beginning of the book, Bryon is tough and hard. Girls are just possessions to him; he dates around and breaks hearts for fun. Bryon starts to come out of this shell as he falls in love and gains sensitivity. His girlfriend, Cathy, helps him to see how special life can be and how much he has been missing. Towards the end of the book, however, as close friends get involved with drugs and Bryon is faced with some difficult choices, his new love of life begins to slip away. Things used to be so simple, but that was then, this is now."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"The book I read was That was Then, This is Now by S.E. Hinton. What I liked about the book are mostly the characters, the crime, and the violence. One of the Characters is Mark and what I like about Mark is how he doesn't care about anything and just does what he wants to do. Like one time he hot wired a car just to see his probation officer because he had no ride and he also got arrested for it but they let him go because he had no way to get to his probation officer. I see that part amusing. Marks parents shot each other during a drunken argument. So Bryon's mom adopted him whom they live just across the street.Bryon is another character that makes the book so interesting. The author described him as a player meaning playing girls and pretending that you like them. quote: \\"I could get away with anything especially wit girls. Like telling them that I love them and junk, when I didn\`t. I had a rep of a lady-killer a hustler.\\" But he stopped being a player until he met this girl name Cathy because this time he knew that he really liked her.The theme in this book is growing up and making new and harder decisions. I agree with this because I saw what was actually going on in the book and its not always about fights. Bryon was the one that was moving on and getting a job, completing school, having a real relationship with a girl and start to forget about others sometimes. Mark was still acting the same, he still gets into fights steals cars and he also is a drug dealer and when Bryon met Cathy, Mark started to get jealous because Bryon wasn't spending as much time as they were before or that he couldnt accept Bryon changing. This relates to me a little by how I'm changing a lot and going through decisions that will affect my life.I recommend this book for only teenagers because it has a lot of violence, drugs, and fights and you can visualize that fights in your head and I don't think little kids under 13 should be reading it. But if they can take that kind of stuff and their parents allows them to then go right on ahead I cant stop you."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"this is one of the best books i have ever read in ym life. As a teen i can relate to this book and the things said in it. I would highly recomend this book to every teen. Because parents and adults just have no idea what we go through everyday and just how things change instantly"},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"I read this as a teenager years ago and I recall loving it. I spotted it in a bookstore recently and decided to re-read it, sort of for old time's sake.I didn't grow up in a city, let alone a rough neighborhood in a city, but the book gave me a vivid idea of what that would be like for a teenager. That part of the book probably is not outdated at all. I'm sure the same problems face kids now as they did then.The main characters came across vividly with a minimum of words. It was more their dialogue than the narrative that brought them to life.One part I have to admit made me laugh, though. A character recovers from a bad LSD trip and it's implied that not only will he never be the same (i.e., his personality has virtually been wiped out) but that it would be dangerous for him to ever have kids, due to his chromosomes breaking down from the LSD. Please. This sounds like one of those &quot;cautionary tales&quot; books, like Go Ask Alice, that are meant to scare kids into good behavior. If a bad acid trip could do this to you, then half the people who partied in the 60's would never have gone on to live normal lives.Other than that, the book is realistic and down to earth."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"The reason I chose this book is because I read the first book, The Outsider's. It was good so I figured that the sequel would be good as well. I liked this book because it had plenty of action. I liked how the two friends stuck together through all their battles. They really didn't let any thing get between them. The only reason I didn't like this book is because it wasn't really like the first one. I kind of thought it would have been. I guess between the two I like the outsiders a little more because there was a little more action. But I think this is a grate book too."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"wow!! could we say... groovy book? this book dealt with real problems and had a very realistic story. we had to read it for school at first i really didn't like it. but after the first chapter or so it was really good and i couldn't put it down. the book does have a tragic ending but, it shows readers that life doesn't always turn out the way you'd hoped or planned. i would reccomend this book to anyone... although the book does have some bad language its VERY good."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"This book really ranked up there with my favorites. When I looked at the cover I never thought I'd enjoy it so much, but as the saying says you can't judge a book by its cover. As a teenager, this book really touched me. After loosing his parents, Mark lives with his best friend Bryon. After an unfortunate chain of events, Bryon is forced to make a desicion that could destroy his friendship with Mark. That Was Then This Is Now is a good book for teenagers and adults. It helps teens cope with the problems of today and it could even help parents be more open minded to their kids.It also talks about drug awareness. READ THIS BOOK! IT'S NOT A WASTE OF TIME!!!!"},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"Imagine your girlfriend's brother, who also is your best friend, taking drugs. Imagine someone as close as your brother selling drugs. In the book That Was Then This Is Now all these things happen. It is up to one person to figure out what is happening. Why is everyone changing? Where is M&M;? Why is Mark acting so strange?Bryon and Mark are not brothers, but they are like brothers. Mark lives with Bryon's mom and Bryon. Mark's parents were drunk so they started to fight and they killed each other. Bryon's mom felt sorry for Mark and she took him to live with Bryon and her.Mark and Bryon always go to the bar to go see their friend Charlie. They go see him even if they are only sixteen years old. Charlie is around 22 years old. Charlie is a very nice friend. What Mark and Bryon don't know is that they are in huge trouble. When they got out the bar when they got in to the alley next to the bar some guys attacked them. What they weren't sure of was if those guys had guns. Then Charlie came out to help them. Then suddenly he fell to the floor. The guys ran away. When Mark and Bryon checked his head it had a bullet through his head. After that incident everything changed. Mark and Bryon went to go see their mom at the hospital because she got really sick. Anyway she told them that there was a 16 year old boy across the room like who was really hurt. He never has anyone visiting him. Bryon went to go eat something at the lobby first. When he got there, there was a girl who called his name. He didn't now who it was. To his surprise it was Cathy, M&M;'s sister. M&M; is one of Bryon's closest friends They talked a lot. So Bryon Thought she was really cute so he asked her to the school dance.When Bryon went to go see the kid the kid told him why he was in the hospital.He said it was because when he went the store these guys were bothering this black girl. He got really mad and then he told them to leave her alone. They let go of her and they just mugged him but they didn't fight him or anything. They just went back inside the store. Then after he asked the girl if she wanted a ride because she was waiting for the bus and it wasn't going to come till in a long time. Finally she said ok. When they were on their way she started crying so he tried to comfort her. When he got there a group of black people were there. This big guy saw that she was crying so he got mad and started asking the girl, \\"what did he do to you?\\" She didn't answer him.He was really scared. He said, \\"I didn't do anything I promise\\". Then the big guy came and said\\" what if we don't believe you\\". Then he said, \\"Ask her, just ask her.\\" The guy called from across the car, \\"Connie what you want me to do with this white cat?\\"She said \\"Kill the white bastard.\\" And sure enough they almost did.I think this book is one of the best books you could ever read. It makes you want to never stop reading it. And what I mostly like about this book is that these kind of stuff do happen anywhere in the worldThis is a really good book. If you keep on reading this book you will know were M&M; is. Why is Mark acting so weird? What is going to happen in the dance to Ponyboy Curtis and Mark? And what is wrong with Bryon? What will he do that will change both Marks and his lives forever?"},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"Another great book by Hinton, you really feel with the characters.

The same is true with The Outsiders, where the main character has problems coping with his enemies in the book. That Was Then This is Now shows how S.E. Hinton brings that explosive plot to a troubled teen that is not in trouble with his enemies but rather just figuring out his friends and who they really are.The book, That Was Then This is Now, starts out with giving an enjoyable introduction to who the characters are. The main two characters throughout the story are Bryon and Mark. Bryon is a bright boy, and also the protagonist of the book, who has been hanging around his adopted brother Mark. Mark on the other hand is the one that is rowdy and also likes to get into trouble but yet the two have stayed close friends through a lot of different conflicts. An intriguing aspect is that their friendship has been going on longer than that of being brothers. They have experienced some challenging points throughout the book. With the intro on how they are such close friends it draws you into the book by going into detail of how Bryon is feeling with the events that unfold in the plot.The plot of That Was Then This is Now can be related really closely to The Outsiders by how the protagonist Ponyboy goes through his own changes as his friends get into more trouble. Also in The Outsiders the book goes into detail about how Ponyboy feels the events in his life are changing, how he sees the friendship that he has with his brothers and friends. Also it brings out the enemies and shows how he feels about them and how they are not really helping the conflict that he is already experiencing. Another aspect that The Outsiders can relate to That Was Then This is Now is that Bryon, like Ponyboy, is given chances to change his life and his friends. In the end, the two books seem to show a different aspect of how friends can truly be great friends.What related this book to me was that I was not a troubled kid but rather a person that likes to read about how people coupe with their friends getting into trouble. It really makes me think about how people deal with different things in there life and also how if a friend gets in trouble, like Mark, how Bryon reacted. Another thing is that the ending is really unexpected in that much of it for me was surprising the way relationship of the two friends ends up to be. Whether the book be good or bad, I will not tell of the ending. You will just have to find out for yourself after you read the book."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"When I was in the 6th or 7th grade in Leesburg, Virginia, I had Reading class with a teacher by the name of Mrs. Arbogast. During the school year, she decided to read the S. E. Hinton book &quot;That Was Then, This Is Now&quot; aloud to the class. That first day, not a one student made a move when the bell sounded signaling the end of class. Every child in the room was hooked! We could hardly wait until the next day when we would be able to hear more. By the end of the book, I decided that if this one story was so good, I just had to give the library a second chance. We were very lucky to have such a great teacher. If I could ever tell her how much that one experience meant to me, I would. Because of this book and Mrs. Arbogast, I now am an avid reader!"},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"What I liked about the book is that it was very well expressed like when Bryon found out that Mark was selling these drug pills. He was really shocked and mad when he found out. He felt like he lost his best friend, his only brother. But what I didn't like about the book was that they put you in a real tough position. You seem like you got to choose between your best friend or your girlfriend, but at the end it will turn out bad anyways. I thought that this book was really good. This book(to me) seemed to be better than the Outsiders. They seem to have dramatic and action scenes up in it. They had a lot of choices they make. They also get into a lot of fights, not a lot but enough. The Outsiders seem to have a lot of action scenes only, but they do have some dramatic scenes. Yes, I would recommend this book to somebody else because I think other people might enjoy it as much as i did. This book will probably encourage other people to read more or read more S.E. Hinton books."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"I read this book for an 8th grade English report.I couldn't put it down and finished the book 22 times. This book is full of tough desitions. After reading this book I feel as though I could make any desision thrown at me. I always think back to a quote in chapter 11.&quot;You got even with Mark for Cathy, then you got even with Cathy for Mark. When are you going to start getting even with yourself?&quot; said to Brion from his mother. Bryon feels he made a big mastake. Do you agree? Will Bryon let his desision make his whole world crumble all around him?

In About two years i have read this book over 55 times (i lost count after that) i have forced over 10 people to read it and they all loved it. I read it to my brother and his friend. After i finishd it the first time i could stop thinking about the main caracters Mark and Bryon for mounths. S E Hintin pulled me into there world for ever. This book touches on so many different things. Not only does it tell a \\"real\\" story thruogh fictional caracters. To touches onto the topics of drugs and the realism of how much they can really mess things up for you and pri apart best friends no matter how close they think they are.

After the first page of, \\"That Was Then, This is Now,\\" I knew this book was for me. As I was reading I could picture the setting and characters in my head. There were many well-described segments in this book. I learned many lessons for the future. As Brian and Marc get older their lives are starting to change. They are getting involved with girls, drugs, police, and fights. They have to make many life long decisions on what path to take. The book taught me how two best friends could turn against each other so quickly. It has also taught me about selling drugs and what it can do to the people you sell them to and what trouble you can get in by the police.

I really enjoyed reading this book.By: Kayla L."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"I read the book \\"That Was Then, This Is Now\\". This was one of the best books I have ever read! One of the reasons I liked it is because the book had characters that were explained very well. My second reason is because it had events that showed if the characters were a brave person or a cowardly person. The third reason I liked this book is beacause it's very realistic. It'll have like \\"shutup\\" instead of \\"hey man, be quiet man\\". S.E. Hinton wrote this book very well. If I had to give this book a rating on a scale of one to ten I would have to give it an eleven. That's how good the book is.The best part of the book... well that would be tough because there are so many great parts of this book. It would have to be...Bryon and Mark go into their friend Charlie's bar to get a coke. Bryon and Mark then challenge two guys from Texas to a couple games of pool. Bryon and Mark then win like twenty-three dollars. Then the Texans leave. A little while later Bryon and Mark leave. The Texans call them into the alley and they threaten them with a gun. Then Charlie pops out with a shotgun and Bryon and Mark get out of the alley. Then the Texans fired a shot at Bryon. Charlie jumps on Bryon to dodge the bullet. Mark picks up the shotgun and shoots at the Texans. Bryon rolls out from under Charlie. Charlie had got shot in the head. That would be one of the best parts.S.E. Hinton did a great job on all of the things. She did an excellent job on the characters and the plot. She described the characters features plus their personalities. She described the plot well enough to get everything she was saying. This is the best book I have ever read."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"The plot of That was Then, This is Now, is the problems teenagers face as they grow up. In the story Mark and Bryon are best friends. They have been best friends ever since Mark had to move in with Bryon, because his family was destroyed. As Bryon starts to have a serious relationship with a girl named Cathy, Mark becomes more distant from Bryon. They both know it is happening and Mark is trying to stop it. Mark just wants it to be like it was with Bryon. Also Bryon's mother needs help paying the mortgage, so Bryon gets a job, but Mark is bringing money in and nobody knows how is doing it. Everybody likes Mark. He is wild, but he doesn't know right from wrong. He has been on probation a couple of times for hot wiring cars. He also can talk his way out of anything. Mark thinks before he acts, and also has a good head on his shoulders. He is always trying to look out for Mark, so he doesn't go to Jail. The setting takes place back in the early 60's. They live in a big city, but in the ruff part of town. The story is about what happens in Marks and Bryon's life over a year. During that time period they aren't as close as they use to be, because Mark just isn't growing up. Where they always go to hustle people in pool, the bartender is gets shot saving their lives. Their friend tries LSD and has a bad trip. In the end, Bryon finds Marks stash of acid and figures that is how Mark is bringing in the money. At the time he thought it was the right thing to do and calls the cops. Mark gets arrested and goes to jail for five years. I really like this book because I could really relate to a lot of the things that happened in the book. It showed how everybody splits up and goes their different ways. On thing I did not like was how Bryon called the cops on his best friend, the way I look at it is no matter what it you never rat out your friends. I hate to see the book end where Mark hates Bryon, but I could understand why he does. He never tried acid it was just a way to bring in money so they could keep the place they were living at. If he wasn't dealing it there is always going to be somebody else who will."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone that would like non-action, non-creative, and non-adventurous.

Many of my students are from Indian Reservations from outside the city, and their interest in this book is peaked. I am able to branch off into so many other areas of interest from this book, and it delights me to see so many of my students take it home at nights upon their own initiative.This book is a MUST READ for all middle years teachers and students.

It was a lot darker and more mature. The other books don't really talk about marijuana, and or LSD or any drug at all in them.

The aspect of the story I personally liked was that Mark and Bryon are in different situations, like Bryon has a girlfriend that mark and is constantly getting into street fights and mark is jealous of Bryon having a girlfriend. And at the same time mark seems to be coming up with money and can't control himself and won't seem to quit most of the time. The aspects that weren't so interesting to me were that Bryon gets into street fights the were caused by the stupidest things and doesn't want to resolve the problems he just wants to fight all the time and he gets tired of fighting already. I think that images that Hinton put out were very persuading to the person whose reading the book, because he said how Bryon sticks up for mark in a fight and how there on the streets dealing with the problems, I also thought that the main characters were believable because I would think the boys were just the typical best friends that get in to situations that the boys get into in the story.The story was an adventure that two best friends have in a lifetime."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"Bryon and Mark have been best friends.

It is about two boys that are close to each other likebrothers. Both of them are growing and changing. Things aren&iexcl;tthe same anymore. Bryon thinks this way and Mark thinks adifferent way. Some troubles come to them. But how do they solvethem?This is a very superb book, and one thing that makesthis book so good is because S.E Hinton really captures thecharacters voice. She does an amazing job capturing thecharacters voice. What she does is she tries to speak in ateenager&iexcl;s voice. She write &iexcl;woulda&iexcl; p.116 and &iexcl;outa&iexcl; p.116instead of &iexcl;would have&iexcl; and &iexcl;out of&iexcl;. She writes this waybecause usually teenagers speak that way. They shorten the wordslike that. This way it really helps to capture a young teenagersvoice.Another thing that S.E Hinton does to make this bookwork are her ideas. She has some magnificent ideas. She writesvery interesting sentences using some distinctive words (ideas).Here is one example: &iexcl; It was a rotten thing to do&iexcl; p.127. Theword &iexcl;rotten&iexcl; makes it more interesting then if she would onlywrite &iexcl;bad&iexcl; or &iexcl;wrong&iexcl; instead of &iexcl;rotten&iexcl;. You canactually make a good connection of why she wrote &iexcl;rotten&iexcl;.Because people say rotten eggs meaning like bad eggs and S.EHinton write &iexcl;rotten thing to do&iexcl; meaning like &iexcl;bad thing todo&iexcl;. There are many more sentences like these and they all havea different connection.The last thing that S.E Hinton does to make this bookwork is she uses word choice. If she is using an adjectivedescribing a noun she always uses a sparkling word. An examplewould be: &iexcl;classy place&iexcl; p.121. There is a sparkling wordbefore a noun. This really makes the book good because it makesit more exciting for the reader.All in all I think that this is a fabulous book for astudents to read. It has an interesting plot. And students maygain come ideas of how to write a good story. And they couldalso learn some new sparkling words. Go for it!..."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"Tragedy and violence, friendship and love inform her theme. The main character in this novel, Bryon, has real life problems to deal with. He is very smart but defiant. He is a hustler and a player. He thinks about things but has a hard time expressing his true feelings. Bryon changes in the course of this novel. He begins to grow up. He stops hustling and gets a job. He stops using girls and develops a relationship with his best girlfriend. He learnd to express his deepest feelings. But all that changes after he turns Mark, his best friend, into the police. This impulsive action destroys his best friend. This novel had real teenage problems that led to tragedy. The characters had problems that required decisions. Sometimes these decisions led to tragedy. As this novel was written by S.E. Hinton, there are many unique characters. Her charater development is always very interesting and different. I really like this novel because it deals with real problems that possibly bould occur in people's lives. It also shows the human behavior when people face problems. I would certainly recommend this novel to other people my age(14) because it is about real life and youth. Some people might not like this book as much as I do because of its unhappy ending and much violence. However, most of them will probably like it because the novel creates a world you might have not imagined.

The first half was full of rich characterizations and descriptions but in the second half, it seemed as if the author grew tired and just wanted to finish the book. A very important story link (namely Bryon,Cathy,and Mark's relationship)is summed up in two paragraphs.The main character, Bryon, ends the book by doing two things which are very out of character. He decides he doesn't like Cathy,after a big rigamarole about how much he loves her. He turns in Mark, which the character presented to the reader at the beginning would never have done. Of course, in every good book the main character changes, as in life, but the entire personality of a person would not change unless he suffered a major brain injury. In short, after reading The Outsiders, I was quite disappointed in this heavy-handed, poorly written book."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"As a 7th Grade Language Arts teacher in search of good book for my students, I hit a home run with this one.

I'd still recommend this book to any one from about 12-500. I think maybe the only reason I didn't like it was because I read &quot;The Outsiders&quot; S.E. Hinton's best (In my opinion) and this wasn't even close to as good as it. It wasn't bad though."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"this is one of the best books I have read.it makes you ask your self what would you do?it keeps you on the egde of your seat.if you like books about teens or books that could raely happen this is the book to buy."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"The book that I read was That Was Then, This Is Now. It's about a sixteen year old boy named Bryon. Bryon is having a hard time with the way things change so much. He and Mark, his brother, are going through hard times because they have been so close to each other. Now they are building a gap between themselves.Bryon met a girl named Cathy. They have become really close. Mark is kind of jealous because Bryon spends more time with Cathy than with him, and they have been together all their lives.Anyway, other than the very beginning, this is a good book."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"This book is about two friends, Bryon and Mark. Bryon is the smart one. Mark is a trouble maker. Both are sixteen years old. The reason I liked reading about them is because it seems like a real life problem. Bryon likes to go out with girls and Mark just likes to get in trouble. I could read this book over and over again."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"The book &quot;That was then this is now&quot; by S.E Hinton was a very good book, the reason i liked it so much was because the book dealt with problems that teens face, and the book had a very realistic and beliveable storyline i highly recommend this book and i also recommend Outsiders and Tex which were also written by S.E. hinton."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, but I didn't really like theending. It was unbelievable that Bryon would do such a thing to theclosest person in his life. I find this twist to be unrealistic especially since Bryon knew Mark would quit selling if he asked him to. Overall though it is a great book to read if you're on the road. It really makes you think of the people you care about most and what you would do in similar situations."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"I read this book in one night. It was so good. It made me think about how &quot;gangsters&quot; and druggies lived, and realized that they are people, too. They just lived tougher lives. Violence and crime were everyday things, and the boys who lived in it even got excited over it. It is like the author is kind of trying to say &quot;You think your life is tough?&quot; This book had a really cool plot right up until its end. I recommend this book to every teen."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"I loved this book and you would to. It is the second best book I have ever read but only because I read The Outsiders first, though you should read The Outsiders first because you would understand That Was Then, This Is Now much better. Ever since I read The Outsiders I knew I would LLOOVVEE all of S.E. Hintons books (and and so far after reading thoes two and Taming the Star Runner I do). In conclusion I reccmond this book (and The Outsiders) to ANY teen, and just about every teen can relate to them. :-) :-) :-)"},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"I like the book &quot;That Was Then, This Is Now&quot; because it was a good book.Some of the things that I like about it was the fighting, like when the Shepard gang kept beating up M+M. One of the things that I disliked about the book is when Charlie got shot in the eye. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"What I like about the book is that my favorite character Ponyboy was in it.This book also gave me a challenge in reading on the comprehension level.I dislike the book because of the conflict between Mike and Connie.I didn't think that was right for Connie to do that to someone who tried to help her.Yes i would recommend the &quot;Outsiders&quot; and &quot;That was then this is now&quot; to anyone because these two books were very challenging and enjoyable."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"This book, which has some of the same characters from The Outsiders, such as Ponyboy Curtis, is a great read. I read this book in practically one sitting it was so good. I don't think this book is as good as the first one, but it still is a great book. The main characters, such as Byron, Cathy, Mark, and M&M, really kept me captivated and kept me wanted to read on. This book deals woith some serious issues, such as drugs, fighting, and betrayal between friends. I honestly couldn't believe it when Byron told on his almost brother, Mark for what he did. In the end, Mark, Byron's former soul brother, ends up in jail. The books end is so sad, with Byron not really caring about anyone, and Mark hating him while he's in jail. It is for all these interesting plot twists, and captivating chracter conflicts that make this this book so interesting that you don't want to stop reading it. This book is a must-have, for anyone looking for a great read."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"Bryon and Mark were close friends, once considering each other as brothers. They gradually find each other drifting further and further apart. Mark didn't see the point in obeying laws and he was known to be able to get away with anything. Bryon used to at one time, but things were changing. Bryon was sick of hurting people and repeatedly seeing people he knew try to do good and it always backfiring on them. When Bryon found out that Mark was selling drugs, he lost it. Things spun out of control and Bryon stopped feeling. At the end of this novel you feel empty-that's the only word I can think of. This is a novel about the inner responsibilities people have and how it can dramatically change how you see the world you live in."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"\\"Like a friend once said to me, \`That was then, and this is now.'\\"S.E. Hinton's novel That was Then, This is Now, tells the story about the ups and downs of a friendship between two boys. Bryon and Mark have known each other ever since they were young kids. Mark moved in with Bryon and his mother when he was about ten years old because of Mark's family problems. Once Mark moved in, it made Bryon and Mark even closer than before. They became like brothers.This book takes place when Bryon and Mark are teenagers. Bryon is the main character, and he is telling the story. As the boys grow up they go through so much together. Soon, however, they each meet new people and change. Bryon gets a girlfriend, Cathy, and he spends much of his time with her. Bryon becomes determined to grow up and mature. Mark makes a new group of friends and his life changes fast, but these changes in his life may not be the good changes. Bryon and Mark quickly become new people, but they try to keep their friendship like it was before. Unfortunately, sometimes friendships have their own way of changing or ending no matter what you do.I think this book is fantastic. It's a fun book that teenagers and adults can relate to and enjoy. I think it's a wonderful story of love, friendship, growing up, and even growing apart. I loved this book so much. I think S.E Hinton has a great talent of writing a book that many people can learn from and enjoy. This book reminds me a little bit of Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret, by Judy Blume. They both teach life lessons and they both are about friendships and growing up. However, That was Then, This is Now, is a book more for all types of people, whereas Are You There God? Its me, Margaret is more for girls and women.I'd recommend this book, That was Then, This is Now to anyone who enjoys realistic fiction books. I'd recommend this book to teenage boys and girls, and even to adults. I think that everyone should read this story. It is a fantastic book, and I could read it over and over. It is fun and enjoyable, so I think everyone should definitely go and read this book now!"},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"That Was Then, This Is Now\` This book I would say is one of the best books I've ever read. From a scale of 1-10 I would definitely rate it a 10. It is touching and surprising in one. This book kept me hooked and reading. I felt like I was there with Mark and Bryon through the good and the bad. The author made them best friends, yet enemies in their own way. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy action, surprise, and sad endings. Both boys and girls will enjoy this adventure. I would have never guessed the end. It was sad, but good.

After reading this book, I just really felt like I had to think about it, and I like books that do that."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"I read this and the other S.E. Hinton staple books (\\"The Outsiders,\\" \\"Tex,\\" and \\"Rumble Fish\\") repeatably as a teenager. Even then they were dated in literal context (i.e. the hippy era and lifestyle), but they still captured the angsty spirit of being a teen and the changes that result from growing up. As always, the author has parentless boys virtually raising themselves, in this case Bryon and his friend Mark, who had taken in the orphaned Mark after his supposed father shot his mother - as it turns out because he realized that Mark was not his son. Bryon's mother does the best she can for both boys, but when she becomes hospitalized, everything begins falling apart.Sadly, Mark's decline is likely inevitable. He already shows signs at the beginning of the book of a lack of conscience, no doubt the result of seeing and hearing the argument regarding his parentage as a child followed by his 'father' shooting his mother. Without the stablizing force of Bryon's mother, as well as the boys' increasingly desparate need for money to survive, Mark descends into the world of selling drugs. The conclusion is typically Hinton, with the younger brother of Bryon's would-be-girlfriend, M&M; (Hinton cannot write a book without at least one weird moniker), ODing on drugs obtained via Mark. Forever gone is the sweet and brilliant M&M;, replaced by a dulled child. At the discovery of Mark's part in this, Bryon breaks their friendship and 'brotherhood.'Those sharp-eyed enough will be able to find out what happened to Mark in Hinton's other book, \\"Tex.\\"I intend to give this to my son soon, for its lessons of blood being thicker than water, the dangers of drugs, and the sometimes necessity of distancing oneself from those one loves."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"This is the best book I have read. This and THE OUTSIDERS are fabulos books. This book has things that would appeale to any reader. It is a life changeing book. It has suspense tragetys and thinds 13teen yearolds would love. It talks about gang, huslers, and drugs. Things at there age would be normal kids smoking drinking getting jobs and girls. This is one of the best books I've but it's intens.So if you want a lighter book pick THE OUTSIDERS."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"That Was Then, This Is Now by S.E. Hinton was about two boys who were so close, the could be considered brothers. Marks father was put in jail after murdering Mark's mother. He was able to live with his best friend Bryon and his mother. They grew up alike in many ways; as they got older they drifted apart. When the two were younger, they had many interesting encounters with hippies and gang members. They often got into fights, trying to help kid named \\"M&M;\\" from getting jumped by the gang called the \\"Shepards\\".In my life, I've experienced both sides of the story. I've been in a situation where I had to \\"rat\\" on a friend for what was right. I've also been on the other end, I've had friends betray me. Mark felt very sad and angry at the same time, I felt the same way in my experiences.I really liked the book; I like all of S.E. Hinton's books. It was a great and honest book, telling how all or most friendships can be ruined by the simplest of things. My favorite part in the book is when Mark and Bryon help M&M; get away from the Shepards, they also beat them up too. The only thing I would change would be that Mark and Bryon would have stayed close for a lot longer, or I wish that MArk and Bryon never met M&M;, because then none of the chains of events would have happened.I don't read that many books, but this one kept me interested, I would recommend it for anyone to read. If you are into the Outsiders and old gang stories then this is the story for you. My own mother read this book when she was my age, and she highly recommended it for me. I would do the same for anyone."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"In the book, \\"That was Then, This is Now\\", I do like the story but it skips a lot of information.

He sells them to the hippies and Brian find out. Brian turns Mark into the police and he has to go to juvey hall. Mark gets into trouble there and has to go to the State Prison.The two story elements that are most vivid are the characters and the setting.I feel the characters were easily matched with their discriptions and their personalities. The setting is a main part of the story and is set in the city. The city is probably the best place for these characters. It just wouldn't be the same if these characters were from like in a small town."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"The book, That Was Then...This Is Now, is a successful represenation of teenage life back in the 60s and 70s.Basically, the novel reflects on a boy and his step-brother whom, together, live a perfectly normal life.

I recommend you read this consuming tale of Bryon Douglas... and Mark, the golden-eyed jungle creature."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"when i first picked up this book i expected it to be another book like The Outsiders, but it isn't. it is about life and growing up in general, but for once it isn't suger-coated; like all those 'young adult' books. it doesn't have a happy ending, it doesn't really resolve, but it does let you know that life goes on, and that it allways will. so if you want a 'happily ever after' story don't get this, but if you want a real book about life then you will like this book."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"I almost cried when I read this book. Bryon and Mark have been best friends ever since they can remember. But then Bryon has to make the hardest descision of his life and turn Mark into the police (knowing full well that Mark will get 5 years or more in jail). I am 13 years old and I could definitely relate to all the characters. This book will definitely turn any kid away from drug experimenting. Or at least, it will make them more aware of the potential dangers. S.E. Hinton has once again successfully portrayed teenage life on the streets. This book shows you how a close-knit relationship can be affected from the outside world. It does not come up with answers to problems, but instead helps the reader understand how and why these problems arise. This is definitely a great book and I highly reccomend you to read it"},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"I didn't like this book especially. I didn't really like any of the characters (well, except for Ponyboy, but only because I liked him so much in THE OUTSIDERS). The plot is good though, one I'm sure comes up more than you'd think. The main idea of this book is there are two teenage boys, Bryon and Mark, living their lives. Bryon is trying to move on from the way he used to be, and is starting to get more serious about some things, like his girlfriend Cathy. Mark, however, still lives for the thrill of things, and seems to be trying not to grow up. The boys can both feel that something is changing between them, but they aren't sure what. Then one night, Bryon comes to a horrible realization about Mark and has to face a decision that could change their friendship forever.This is a good book. It was a page-turner, and it was very real, like S.E. Hinton always writes. The ending almost ruined it for me, though! But it was still good. 3 stars."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"The book \\"That Was Then, This Is Now\\" is about the two main characters Bryon and Mark. They like to play pool at their friend Charlie's bar. They also live together like real brothers but they aren't. Mark's parents died a long time ago and so he lives with Bryon. When Bryon and Mark come to see Bryon's mother at the hospital, Bryon meets Cathy. She is working there. Later, he asks her whether she wants to go to a dance with him. After the dance, Bryon and Cathy go outside and see that Mark was being beaten up in the parking lot. Bryon asks a friend to drive Cathy home so he can take care of Mark. Both boys are thinking of revenge.When their friend Charlie, gets shot by a gang and dies, Bryon starts thinking. He sees his friends Ponyboy and M+M getting involved with drugs and does not like to belong any more. He gets bored of the fighting and spends more time with Cathy. Mark does not want to grow up anymore so he stays the same. He still steals things. In the end, Mark ends up in prison. Bryon gets a job and does not like violence anymore.My favorite part of the book was when Bryon changed at the end. The reason I didn't like this book so much is because it has lots of fighting and too much drug use. My two favorite characters are Bryon and M+M. Bryon is a very caring person. M+M is a nice boy who does not like to fight.In this book, I learned that it is always possible to change your life. It does not matter how hard your past experiences were.

Mark does not change and ends up in prison."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"This book was almost as awesome as The Outsiders! I loved M&M and everyone else.

Bryon and Mark are such good friends that they think of each other as brothers. When Mark was nine, his parents shot each other and they died. Now Mark lives with Bryon and his mom. They raised him as one of the family members. Mark always stole items but never got caught. Bryon and Mark would always hangout until Bryon started going out with Cathy. Bryon found something under Mark's bed, which answered a lot of questions. Bryon wondered on and on if he did the right thing by calling the cops on him.There is so much action in this book. S.E Hinton did an amazing job describing all the characters. She described them in ways where the reader can picture them as if you met them in real life. She started off the first chapter with more action than any book would have throughout the whole story. The fact that she was six-teen when she wrote it is even more amazing.I would recommend this book to everybody. If you like action throughout a book then this book is right for you. For someone that doesn't like reading this book you would enjoy. This book is definitely a page-turner and you will not want to put the book down.-RyanDes Plaines, Il"},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"This is one of the best books that i have read in a long time. I got to the end and i just starrted sobbing and shaking. I really like the style that SE Hintion writes in and I defiently think that That Was Then, This is Now, has way more feeling then the Outsiders, it is a more mature book. The book stung because of the way that Byron stopped caring, the way that he became so hard, and so cold. You get to the end and you wish that the book had ended better.

Mark and Bryon who onced loved each other hate each other in the end. The book That Was Then This Is Now is a realistic fiction story. I would recommend this book to anyone who has read The Outsiders. It's a spin off of this wonderful novel. This book however, is slow moving. It has excitement, but it is slow to reaching its climax.

Cathy totally changes Bryon into a different person as Mark changes his life as well. Bryon starts seeing a future ahead of him. As for Mark, he just takes life like it's no big deal. The two are growing apart but holding on until Bryon makes a shocking discovery about Mark. Bryon faces a hard decision that will change their lives.I'd give this book 5 stars.

When Mark was younger, his parents were shot and killed in a drunken argument. Bryon and his mom took Mark in as one of the family. They grew up in a rundown part of the city, which explains why they steal, drink, and jump black people for money.That Was Then, This Is Now starts off in the local bar where Bryon is hustling a game of pool. Mark and Bryon are very sneaky in the things they do. When their good buddy, M&M;, has his sister, Cathy comes to visit, Bryon falls in love with her right away. They face many problems including M&M; running away. He is found at a hippy house thanks to Mark, and he is found high. Bryon later goes home and finds pills under Mark's bed; now he has to face a decision that will change his life. Now I don't know about you, but that got me hooked.That Was Then, This Is Now is an action-packed book. I like how the author describes each event with much detail. I think she did an outstanding job explaining how life was for people who were less fortunate than others. What I also enjoy about this book is that there are many fights, and I like books like that. This book shows respect to other people in the neighborhood and Mark shows bravery by defending Bryon and they stood up for each other. I strongly recommend That Was Then, This Is Now to readers who love reading action-packed, thrilling adventure books. This book will make the reader read more and never put the book down.

It talks about some of the same things that the more famous The Outsiders(also by S.E.Hinton)does, such as the hardships of dealing with street life and life as a teen. Other than that, That Was Then, This Is Now talks about different things than The Outsiders. The Outsiders talks about the differences between the rich and the poor. This book talks about the diffences between the past and the present.Brian and Mark were tighter than brothers from day one. They hustled people together, fought side by side, and stood up for each other in times of need. Then Brian got a girlfriend named Cathy, and for the first time in his life, the word love actually meant something.

This message was that every tiem you think about fightign or takeing drunks think about the conciquences, you may never fully get back what you lose. For example M&amp;M took LSD and he never will recover fully. And if you want to go cut soem girls hair off when your drunk be prepared for a good beating because one day it will backfire at you weather its her big brother after you or the whole school after you.

In the story Mark and Bryon are best friends. They have been best friends ever since Mark had to move in with Bryon, because his family was destroyed. As Bryon starts to have a serious relationship with a girl named Cathy, Mark becomes more distant from Bryon. They both know it is happening and Mark is trying to stop it. Mark just wants it to be like it was with Bryon. Also Bryon's mother needs help paying the mortgage, so Bryon gets a job, but Mark is bringing money in and nobody knows how is doing it. Everybody likes Mark. He is wild, but he doesn't know right from wrong. He has been on probation a couple of times for hot wiring cars. He also can talk his way out of anything. Mark thinks before he acts, and also has a good head on his shoulders. He is always trying to look out for Mark, so he doesn't go to Jail. The setting takes place back in the early 60's. They live in a big city, but in the ruff part of town. The story is about what happens in Marks and Bryon's life over a year. During that time period they aren't as close as they use to be, because Mark just isn't growing up. Where they always go to hustle people in pool, the bartender is gets shot saving their lives. Their friend tries LSD and has a bad trip. In the end, Bryon finds Marks stash of acid and figures that is how Mark is bringing in the money. At the time he thought it was the right thing to do and calls the cops. Mark gets arrested and goes to jail for five years. I really like this book because I could really relate to a lot of the things that happened in the book. It showed how everybody splits up and goes their different ways. On thing I did not like was how Bryon called the cops on his best friend, the way I look at it is no matter what it you never rat out your friends. I hate to see the book end where Mark hates Bryon, but I could understand why he does. He never tried acid it was just a way to bring in money so they could keep the place they were living at. If he wasn't dealing it there is always going to be somebody else who will."},{"Title":"That Was Then, This Is Now","review":"&quot;~The book that I read was That Was Then, This Is Now.

It was obvious to me that Bryon's abandonment of Mark began long before the police arrived at their house.At the story's end Bryon Douglas claims to be 'worn out with caring about people'. Caring about who? The girlfriend he didn't hesitate to toss out like yesterday's garbage? The friend who's life he's just destroyed? I'd have liked to have seen some soul-searching or some evidence of real grief on the part of the main character who instead spends the last half of the last chapter feeling sorry for himself.

I would only recommend this to the people that have the time to sit down and listen to the whole story."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Blood Meridian is a didactic novel somewhat reminiscent of the Middle Ages. The style requires careful reading which is not comfortable for many. The writing is sometimes excellent, but too often obscure. The endless descriptions of violent actions and the results of violence (a man who crawling who has had the soles of his feet cut off, babies hanging from trees, etc.) are sickening but necessary to maintain the reader's revulsion. The same observation is true of the tireless wandering in the desert and mountains - it never stops. The judge is Mars or Ares - he is overpowering; he will never die; he can do excellently all things connected with war; he studies everything; he considers everything subject to his will; he expresses himself philosophically far above the level of his recruits to understand; he is to a degree omniscient; he has setbacks, but they are only temporary; and, he remains joyous and dancing at the end. All who follow him die, he agrees with biblical scripture that he who lives by the sword will die by the sword. The judge is white without a hair on his huge body. White equals purity in European literature of the Middle Ages. (Consider the heroine whose feet were so white the lilies were black by comparison.) He is huge and superhumanly powerful. The Kid is Everyman, he isn't named, and can't be named. He is everyone touched by war - noncombatants especially included. The Kid must die at the end. Some have praised the writing as lyrical. In my opinion a poet of high order, such as Goethe, could express the essence of Blood Meridian in a lyrical poem. The author has not come close to achieving that level of excellence. I like the book, but it isn't great."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Not a literature classic and not even a genre classic, Blood Meridian starts out on an interesting note discussing the Kid and his origins. Unfortunately it quickly slides into repetitious descriptions of barren landscapes, burnt out villages and murdered villagers, and gory confrontations with indians.The writing isn't bad, if not a bit campy, but it just never changes. No characters develop, save The Judge - by far the best part of this book - the plot doesn't stray far from a bleak sense of nihilism. Just not an interesting book in the end. Might have made a good, atmospheric video game or painting maybe. As a book however it just doesn't really work.I'd recommend against this one unless you are a diehard western fan."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"The theme of this book is the necessity of violence as a purgative force, an escape valve into which humanity falls when its rationality becomes paradoxical. While the book communicates in lush and sensual prose this concept, beyond that it has no direction or content, creating a literary world that is slightly more involved than particularly vivid wallpaper. The narrative is well paced and the character symbolic, but beyond that, nothing attracts within this book. It communicates its theme, and then repeats it. While this joins other literary works, from _The Sun Also Rises_ onward, in celebrating the slow death of Western society, it's unclear that there is any triumph here or anything more than a foreboding discharge of violence."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I first saw this book in a list for 100 greatest novels or something and when I wikipediaed it, I was interested in the Judge character. I decided I would give it a try. No Country for Old Men was an awesome movie, so this should be an awesome book right? Wrong! First the story. It takes place in some hellish version of the Old West. There's a kid called The Kid imaginatively enough who runs away from home and ends up joining a gang of killers sanctioned by the Mexican government to kill Indians. So that's basically the entire story really. The good things about this novel are not many. Cormac McCarthy possesses an almost otherworldly ability in writing descriptively, especially when describing the landscape. I was completely enthralled from pages 1 through about 3, but after that my interest came and went, mostly went. Another thing good about Blood Meridian is when he's describing the 1st entrance of the killers and also this Indian battle. The killers did not seem like anything human and the Indians were worse. You will be shocked when reading that battle scene. Or at least I was. Now to the bad and where to begin? The story is atrocious to me. It's basically this: Kid meets killers, killers ride to town and either murder everyone or get drunk, then they drive to another town. That's all that happens pretty much. Another thing is the characters. There is not one single character that I cared about as a person. I was even hard-pressed to think of them as people at all. This is the most violent book I've ever read. At first I was kind of surprised by it, but then I just became numb to it all. Especially heinous was the violence against children. Even babies. I wondered why that was necessary and it felt like some kind of cheap tactic to shock even as I knew what McCarthy was trying to accomplish. As I said earlier there is a character called the Judge. He is a 7 foot tall completely hairless individual possessing extreme intelligence in all areas. He is supposed to be the incarnation of war or some other symbol which I didn't really get. Anyways, I was drawn to him at times because he was interesting simply because how strange he was, but he does some of the most repulsive acts in the entire novel. He is the only one who stands out in a band of murderous thugs, which isn't saying much. You also learn nothing about the main character which didn't make me feel too bad because I'm sure there wasn't much too know about him anyway. He is simply a killing machine like all the others which leads him to his fate at the end. And that's the final nail in the coffin, the ending is one of the worst I've ever encountered. It's completely open to speculation and I hate that kind of thing. All in all this seemed to me to be a case of a guy trying too hard to create some kind of masterpiece but failing. It reminds me of some kind of Frankenstein's monster where he gets the shell right, but cannot supply a soul. It left a bad taste in my mouth and I cannot really even recommend it, but to each his own."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Unfortunately, this was the first Cormac McCarthy book I read...meaning, it will probably be the last. Meandering to non-existent plot. Cormac should hire David Mitchell to teach him how to write. Here's a quick summary of the entire book (without the obscure vocabulary): \\"We rode into a small, dusty town. We rode into another small, dusty town. We rode into yet another small, dusty town. At each town we partied really hard. This one guy peed on some clay stuff to create a bomb like thing. The end.\\""},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Blood Meridian has been called one of the best books of the twentieth century. Critics of no less stature than James Wood and Harold Bloom have lavish exceptional praise upon it - HB in his typical fashion compares the judge to the terrible Iago (for him literary characters are only footnotes to those of the Bard: no villain is not an Iago, no madman not a Richard III, no clown not a Falstaff, no savage not a Caliban, no contemplative not a Hamlet). I certainly admire and respect these two critics, which is why I found their enthusiasm for BM exceptionally puzzling. For I have never suffered so much as a reader than when I had it in my hands.Let's begin with Cormac McCarthy's control of the English language. It is abominable: for there are times when it even seems as though English were not McCarthy's first language (\\"It had narrowly missed the carotid artery yet he could not make the blood to stop.\\" \\"The hanged men at their rope-ends looked like effigies for to frighten birds.\\" \\"Nor did the judge lose the opportunity to ventilate himself upon the ferric nature of heavenly bodies and their powers and claims.\\") and others when CM not only staggers but positively crashes into his own hyper-inflamed eloquence (\\"The earth fell away on every side equally in its arcature and by these limits were they circumscribed and of them were they locus.\\"\\"[The horsemen were] like beings provoked out of the absolute rock and set nameless and at no remove from their own loomings to wander ravenous and doomed and mute as gorgons shambling the brutal wastes of Gondawanaland in a time before nomenclature was and each was all.\\") . And I hardly have to remind the reader of CM's almost perverse affection for the word \\"and\\" (J.M. Myers has rightly entitled these long, snaking sentences made up of short declaratives repetitively chained together by the word \\"and\\" the \\"andelope\\"). The most famous of this sort of sentence in BM is the extended monstrosity that occurs at the end of chapter four, where the Comanches attack the kid and his posse. What utterly astounds me is that the admirers of BM list its incredibly vivid descriptions of violence as among the novel's exceptional qualities (\\"A classic American novel of regeneration through violence,\\" says Micheal Herr) and cite the above passage as one of the greatest achievements of this sort. But I cannot fathom how a writer of any talent could have failed to perceive that this unimaginably gory description of gunfire, disembowelment, scalping and sodomy had already spun out of his control before it was even underway, that spraying such dense clouds of horrors so unrelentingly at the reader would not only fail to produce shock but cause everything to degenerate into unintentional farce. And that is always the way it is throughout BM: every page, every paragraph, every sentence strives for such intensity, the sum effect of which is to cause the prose collapse on itself and become insipid and unbearably tedious. With CM everything is driven to the highest possible pitch: a man dancing wildly is a \\"wild thaumaturge out of an atavistic drama\\"; and one does not listen to a heartbeat but to the \\"systole of the rubymeated hearts that hung within them.\\" If CM is indeed the disciple of Faulkner then he surely inherits Alfred Kazin's criticism of that same author: that \\"no writer ever seemed so ambitious and so purposeless; so overwhelming in imagination and so thwarted in his application of it.\\" He is the worst embodiment of the stylistic excesses which are all-too ubiquitous in contemporary American fiction.The judge, however, is undoubtedly an achievement. Without him BM couldn't stand on its own. He is a thrilling character: one of those who forever elude us but who nonetheless still produces a terrifying resonance. He is much bigger and deeper than Blicero: Blicero is a mere depravity, a perversion of advanced civilization, but the judge straddles the entire span between high culture and animal bestiality. We see him one moment in the man of the world's professional attire and the next in a hat of mud and a suit of flesh. Yet he is no mere lunatic or murderer, he is beyond simple savagery: he is pure annihilation, pure Night. This is how he talks: \\"That man who sets himself the task of singling out the thread of order from the tapestry will by the decision alone have taken charge of the world and it is only by such taking charge that he will effect a way to dictate the terms of his own fate.\\" \\"Only that man who has offered himself up entirely to the blood of war, who has been to the floor of the pit and seen horror in the round and learned at last that it speaks to his inmost heart, only that man can dance.\\" Here CM seems to transform: he is not trying to dazzle or overwhelm; he knows exactly what he wants to say and how to say it and he lets the meaning reveal itself through the language. There are several other passages of such calm, striking beauty scattered throughout which so stand out from the panting descriptions of violence and desolate landscapes that it seems as though the hands of two different authors can be recognized. I wish the man who created the judge had also written the rest of the book."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I would have rated this poor at best.

A western novel at it's core, it fulfills, and then some, all the requisites of the genre. There's bloody action, conflict, violence, gunplay, the wide open spaces of the land of the American Southwest, and just as important, the Mexican Northwest. A masterpiece that hits all the dots; Blood Meridian has lyricism, poetry, narrative, and musings philosophic, intertwined with sheer horror, populated by monstrous characters that are still utterly believable in all their over the top evil. Oh, let's not forget sheer absurdity that comes through as just the facts; just the way it is. The banality of this hell world perhaps is its most disturbing undercurrent...Published in 1986, \\"Blood Meridian\\" is inherently timeless. It is historical. There was a John Glanton and a gang of scalp hunters under contract to the Mexican Governor of Chihuahua. John Glanton was a Texan originally from South Texas by way of Tennessee, like so many other Texans. He had a very \\"colorful\\" background like so many other Texan pioneers. \\"Blood Meridian is also a cautionary tale on the perils of privatization of military and law enforcement. The outsourcing of the war in Chihuahua against the Apaches ended in disaster. Shades of todays Blackwater and private mercenary groups in the Middle East and now more and more here in the United States.The historical threads, good, evil; the mythology and fact. Set against the tripartite of the Mexican, Anglo, and Native American back drop...Perhaps the most amazing thing about this novel is that while nothing good really ever happens, Mcarthy trains you not to expect it.

I have nothing more to say since reading what I have just written makes me sad, since I am so ineloquent in describing such great writing."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I find it interesting that one reviewer entitled their review with a Slayer song and a Misfits song. Most people who've read this book would miss that referrence completely and I find it interesting because these bands are both giants of their industry who don't deserve the massive praise they get, so its ironic they're linked with this book. But that's music and this is a book. While Im not a real big fan of this book - it tends to plod along like a half dead horse staggering under the burden of an equally half dead man across the mexican desert - there is a quality about it that made me want to read more and left me feeling as if I'd learned something about life once I'd finished. If you like suffering you'll like this book. If you're one of those people who think reading great authors will make you a better person, you might be pleasantly surprised that this book might just enlighten you a little.On a side note, No Country For Old Men will make you sad. The Road will touch you deeply and leave you terrified."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"You just gotta like how the man writes. What a command of the language! Brilliant. I was many times awed. This was my first book of his and at first I thought that I was taking a chance by ordering it. I'll be checking him out again. Just goes to show, once again, that truth is stranger than fiction. Hanged by their heel tendons with their heads just above the burning coals, their brains bubbling up through their noses with the smell... OUCH! It doesn't get much worse than that though, thankfully."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"We all knew that the old west was a wild, dangerous time and place.

The book is also a statement of the evil that will always follow men..."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Having reread this book , I am awestruck by its prosaic beauty. The descriptions of landscape and offhand brutality confirm to me that the written word is not dying. McCarthy is a master.Read it now ! Read it aloud ! Read it often !"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Perhaps the intent of the author is to avoid preachiness, but the level of objectivity reached in this novel strips the prose of any passion or life. Throughout, I failed to connect to any of the characters or situations and felt that, despite the graphic nature of the events described, I was being fed a cold, bureaucratic account rather than an emotional, heartfelt journey. It is important to have literary demystifications of the West, but in the attempt to strip that era of romance, I wonder: is it necessary to give us nothing of interest? Must all the characters be aloof and untouchable? Moreover, I found the writing to be blunt and uninspired, more like a bad imitation of Hemingway than a vibrant new writer on the scene. I purchased this book solely because it came with a high recommendation from Harold Bloom and quite frankly, I cannot understand what the excitement is all about. Again, the non-judgmental tone is refreshing (it could have easily been yet another anti-American novel from the School of Resentment), but novels must first and foremost be (and Bloom would agree with this) full of joy and life; not &quot;positive&quot; or &quot;uplifting&quot; necessarily, but a joy to read. Instead, I was left with no feeling at all; alienated by the author's inability to make me care."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"The experience of reading this novel was something like watchingmy first IMAX movie. McCarthy's ability to describe a scene vastly surpases everything else I've read. At another level, the sound of the language and the construction of the sentences themselves is beautiful and often poetic. Through this story you will witness some of the most depraved facets of humanity; it will be unpleasant but you won't be able to put the book down. McCarthy is hard to read and you will not be able to move through it quickly at first: like most really great things you have to work for it."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Not for the faint of heart, this book not only takes the reader into the violence of the Wild West, but bares the human soul when it is unfettered by law and social restraints."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"It's hard to say why I'm giving this book five stars. It's definitely not an average murder mystery or thriller. The plot is rarely explained, if ever, and you're basically along for the ride as a few characters mow through Mexico and the SW USA during the post-civil war era. You spend a lot of time wondering what is going on and simply watching events unfold with little explanation or introduction. And the very end was just baffling to me.Yes, there's a basic plot. Our band of characters is riding around collecting Indian scalps for a bounty. But I got that by reading the back of the book. I think there's maybe two sentences where the reason behind their bloodshed is hinted at. And even then the gold they receive seems to be only a means to an end as it simply sparks a drunken riot which leads to yet more violence.But in spite of all that I loved this book. I'll fully admit that I have a predilection for McCarthy already, so I wasn't going to hate this book or stop reading it. However, I've also read the entire border trilogy by the same author and flat-out did not enjoy the third book in that series, so I like to think that I have some objectivity here.And, again, I'm a little confused as to why this book rates five stars for me.Part of it is that McCarthy's writing has never been crisper, cleaner, more \\"puts your right in the middle of the desert\\" perfect. Part of it is that even though it's challenging as anything I was, sort of, able to follow along without having to go looking up some cheat-sheet guide online. And part of it is the violence. Which seems weird to say. I don't love violence, that's for certain, but this book is easily the most violent thing I have read in recent memory and somehow that made it all work. Just the sheer knife edge of horror hanging over the entire thing puts it all in perspective.That plus the end section. I said that the very end was utterly baffling to me, and I stand by that, but the ending section has a strange calming effect, like the book has sobered up and is trying to make sense of itself. That really worked for me.I don't know, maybe this review sounds like madness but I really don't think this book warrants an average, \\"I really liked character X,\\" sort of write-up.So I'll just leave it at that.5-stars...just don't ask me exactly why."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This is a novel which cannot be read fast.The vocabulary is often arcane,requiring frquent trips to the dictionary-I always thought my vocabulary was pretty good until I read this book-it also helps to be fluent in Spanish,as i am.That said,the effort is worth it-I can only compare this novel to some of the paintings of Hieronymus Bosch or the engravings of Albrecht Durer for the images evoked.It makes \\"The Wild Bunch\\" look like Dr.Seuss.I realize that all these comparisons are to visual media and that is no coincidence because the novel is a very descriptive narrative-it's an examination of evil unleashed when humans operate outside any framework of laws.the Judge is a figure very hard to describe-he may be allegorical,but representing what?I'm not sure,but he is an unforgettable literary presence.This is definitely not a book for everyone,but I think it is excellent for anyone willing to get through it."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I never knew the devil ran around naked with just a cowboy hat on.

Can someone answer the following: Who is the &quot;I&quot; in paragraph two of chapter one? The sentence is: &quot;I looked for blackness, holes in the heavens&quot;Unlike the rest of the book, the first eleven paragraphs of chapter one are written by an observer. So who is it?My guess is the Judge, but the tone is wrong for him."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Blood Meridian will redefine how you judge other novels and yourself as a reader, in the way that it sets expectations to a new level. When tackling the enormity that is Blood Meridian, a reader can expect a denseness and seriousness not attained by many novels. Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian is a humbling experience that I suggest to anyone with patients and a hunger for a truly challenging negotiation of the bloody history that shaped our \\"civilized\\" present. I cannot say that with the conclusion of this novel that I can look with patriotic feelings as to how Americans in the 1850's attained territories now a part of the United States. The unbridled violence and lack of conscience in the utter destruction of native peoples is disheartening, repulsive, and embarrassing. This novel questions the manipulation of entire groups of people by those capable of that manipulation. Not only Mexican and Native Americans are controlled and conquered, but also those unable to exercise thought and morality when someone (the Judge, concepts like Manifest Destiny) does it for them. Helpless are those who can not see beyond their own position to think abstractly. Although I am in awe of the exaltation of language, actually several languages, employed by this novel, I find that I admire more the implication of this novel's themes on today's America the beautiful. Have we really overcome the animalistic drives and notions that fueled the rampage of the fire across the Old West? I think we would like to distance ourselves and read this novel as an unfortunate but true glimpse into what life was during this time, but can we? Do we or do we not find evidence of this barbaric behavior and manipulation of people today? I think we would like to think of this as fiction or an abstraction of the past, a time in which none of us has lived. However, when the specifics of today's world prove just as or nearly as horrifying, it scares us into identification with McCarthy's world. Who wants to be held accountable for the violence and manipulation of the past or present? If you are interested in exploring these complex questions or many others raised by this novel, then please do so. I have included my own questions only to implicate the complexity of this novel, but there are many more. I don't want to give too much away though. I suggest that while reading this novel you allow yourself to be swept away with the beauty of its landscapes and the gruesome battle scenes. This book allows for new discoveries with each consecutive turn of the page or each consecutive read. Its subtleties and subversions and the way it feels like a code rather than English makes you want to read it repeatedly. However, I cannot imagine anyone not needing a break from it. Afterward, it may be wise to read some \\"Dick and Jane\\" for reassurance to understand a book. Now, in all seriousness, I think that reading this novel is an accomplishment. I may never feel like I have unlocked all of its secrets and wisdom, and for that, I will always respect it."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I loved this book but lost it at the epilogue, with the man drilling holes in the earth.

Nevertheless I can't abide the literary vision here. I think its a waste of my time to read something that tells me what I already know and pounds in the pointlessness of life, as the authour sees it, till I am sick to death of it, I know there's more to life than this, and I quit the book. I couldn't read anymore after less than a hundred pages. I knew the whole thing would be just more of the same so why bother?I don't think McCarthys a great writer, he dwells too much on the irredeemably demonic in man. He's an interesting writer, his style, his antique knowledge, his ornate vocabulary, but it takes more than this to make a writer with a response to life that is worthy rather than an indulgence in the depths of horror humanity is capable of. If you want the classic depiction of this, but also with reflection and thoughtfulness about man's plight than all you have to do is read, \\"Heart of Darkness\\" by Joseph Conrad."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I think Mr. McCarthy is a very gifted writer, but I would advise firsthand that he writes with a lot of weird or unusual words, and also in an unusual way, that sometimes leave you to end up having to re-read whole paragraphs just to get them right."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"apart from whether mccarthy has a true literary talent, or just strings together estoteric verbage in neo-biblical prose in an attempt to be deep (something i highly doubt), it might be interesting to view the actually message of the novel in the context of the vicissitudes of our 2004 world and the increasingly widening rift between our perceptions of what the \\"right\\" course is. a letter to the editor in todays times lamented kerry's use of the word \\"kill\\" in the debates to describe his response to terrorists. apparently she felt 300,000 years after Yuma scalpings mccarthy refrences and a few days after beheadings in iraq the civilized world had progressed beyond such barbarity.so i was wondering what does the judge mean that there is a flaw in the boy's heart when he cannot dry gulch him?in a world exempt from a moral compass, is it actually a flaw or weakness to have one?and yes he has literary talent."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Don't read this book unless you're prepared for it: otherwise you won't finish. The book is truly shocking, and often disturbing. The imagery and the message will stay with you long after you put it down.However, it is also and incredible read, and completely worth the time and effort it takes. McCarthy's beautiful writing adds to the extreme horror that he is often describing in the novel, and creates a one-of-a-kind experience. The examination of the role of violence in human existence is truly eye opening, and is presented in a style that only McCarthy could achieve.As I said, don't start this book unless you're willing to do it justice, but everyone should consider reading this masterpiece of modern literature."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I recognize that not everyone appreciates Cormac McCarthy's unique prose style, but I find it compelling and, for a story like this, unforgettable.The tale is almost Biblical, with fantastic characters, historical settings, several dramatic set pieces (including the end sequence) and lots and lots of blood.The Judge is a sui generis literary character that emerges fully-formed and jumps straight off the page and sears himself right into your brain.Like The Kid in the novel, The Judge is not someone you will soon forget -- and neither is this remarkable book."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Maybe you didn't like the movie No Country For Old Men as much as I did but I was entranced. Best Cohen bros movie ever. While the rest of the theatre was stymied by the ending, I thought it was pure genius.The author of the original book also wrote a novel called Blood Meridian. His name is Cormac McCarthy.In some ways it is a western, in some ways it is a collection of beautiful poetic descriptions, and in some ways it is a bloody tale of extreme gore and violence.If you understand that it is also fundamentally a horror novel, you have a better mindset for appreciating the sudden and terrible events involving the completely amoral band of violent mercenaries, and the nearly satanic majesty of the leader of these deranged and debased men.Most people miss the horror aspect due to the western setting, and find it hard to understand where the book is coming from as a result. They analyze it in literary terms, but forget they are analyzing horror fiction, not just a historical poetic western. Many of the \\"why's\\" disappear when you accept the premise of horror.It may be a bit heavy for a summer read (certainly not candy! more like a bloody steak!) but if you like twisted adventures, you'll dig it.I'm giving it 4 stars but have to admit by around page 200 I was skipping some of the landscape descriptions. They were the greatest at first, but enough is enough. However, I also skipped most of the Lord of the Rings because of this, too. I can only take so much landscape before I require some action! When the action does hit in this book, though, it's killer. Literally."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Blood Meridian is worth reading if nothing else than for McCarthy's multi-dimensional portrayal of Judge Holden. The judge becomes the nexus where the powerful forces which created the American character, the impulse to control, to dominate, to wage genocidal war in the West, to mirror the refinement and accomplishments of Europe, meet, and the results are mesmerizing. There is a part where the judge, a hefty man, lifts a meteorite used as a blacksmith's anvil and his men wager how far he can hurl it. What McCarthy is saying is clear and disturbing. Here is our American god. Here is the embodiment of our national, historical woes. As the central pivot of this violent, nearly obscene novel, the judge is a perfect creation."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Around 1850, a gang of Americans roamed the U.S.-Mexico border. The Mexican government had contracted them to hunt down the Apaches and bring scalps back as proof, but the \\"Glangton gang\\" ended up ravishing innocent villages, robbing the inhabitants and scalping them instead. This episode forms the basis of Cormac McCarthy's 1985 novel BLOOD MERIDIAN: Or the Evening Redness in the West, which reminds the modern world that American expansion into the West was violent indeed, and it makes the further point that this era was only one outbreak of a perennial human disposition to violence.The protagonist of BLOOD MERIDIAN is a 14 year-old young known only as \\"The Kid\\", a runaway from Tennessee who arrives in Texas and immediately becomes familiar with senseless murder and mayhem. I've encountered few protagonists in literature like McCarthy's, for the Kid observes everything around him in great detail, including piercing insight into the hearts of the men he rides us, yet we get little idea of what the Kid himself is thinking. The novel's antagonist is the mysterious Judge Holden. In accounts of the Glanton gang, the Judge was a pale man with some education behind him, Glanton's right hand man. In McCarthy's novel, however, he becomes a demonic figure, albino and ageless, discoursing at great length about Man and his place in the world while engaging in the basest brutality, and seemingly much more in charge of things than the crazed Glanton.Some earlier reviewers have taken exception with McCarthy's diction and punctuation. Certainly the success of his recent two novels (NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN and THE ROAD), which are written in a lighter vein, have brought to BLOOD MERIDIAN many readers which are not familiar with more arty prose stylings. However, the lack of punctuation marks should pose no challenge, especially if you have read novels in other languages where dialogue is minimally marked. Some of his sentences are contorted run-ons, this was no doubt carefully calculated to give the book a folksy tone, appropriate for a book whose protagonist can't read and the culture he inhabits is still very much an oral one. Finally, I really can't understand the claim that BLOOD MERIDIAN forces one to pick up a dictionary and look up hundreds of new words. McCarthy's language is poetical, but far from obscurantist.If you decide to get BLOOD MERIDIAN, I recommend the Modern Library edition, which is in hardback and has much better paper than the Vintage paperback. It only goes for a couple of bucks more, too."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"What a kick. It is easy to be intimated by greatness, so when I read that Harold Bloom, the venerable literary scholar, had named this one of the greats, I assumed I'd have trouble getting through it. Low and behold, this thing is a good read, like novels by Stephen King and Mario Puzo. It's a page-turner. What distinguishes it from the pop fiction school of entertainment is the use of language which is dead-on accurate to its period, circa 1860, and poetic. All the westerns you've watched since childhood play through your mind as you read, testing the accuracy of the marvelous dialog spun by McCarthy. He is a word smith, like Philip Roth, and a few others, but this is a very small elite group. Sustained over 300 pages, this 19th century western lingo functions like music, alternatively lulling and stimulating the reader, taking the reader into harrowing pitched battles between lunatic whites and cruel, savage natives. AS with his more accessible and gentler novel \\"All the Pretty Horses,\\" the author sends a young man on a trip into adulthood, where he learns the cruelty of the adult world. It is a macho, desperately violent world but one ruled finally by the voice of the author whose descriptions have a gentle, feminine ring. The subtleties are worthy of the attentions of Jane Austen but the subject matter is pure Sam Peckinpaw. \\"Blood Meridian\\" is a little masterpiece of controlled fury observed by a man with an eye for beauty."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Probably not for the weak of heart. I remember when I was a kid and saw the movie \\"Rio Bravo\\". This book gave me the same feeling. In your face, the way it may have been, rough and tough, blood and guts, sweat and pain 1800's western.McCarthy paints a vivid picture in a book that is hard to put down. At times it is more information than you need to know buy like seeing a car wreck, you have to look.You like hard core, no quarter given reading. This book is for you. You like, feel good \\"Black Beauty\\" lovey dovey reading, run away from this book."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Simply Cormac McCarthy at his darkest and best. This master wordsmith tells a tale of Apache hunters in 19th century American West that will likely haunt you for a long time. I find myself thinking of this book often, forcing myself to resist re-reading it so I can forget just enough detail to enjoy it again. Only rarely does fiction pass this close to what must have been. Read it."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"You might find this novel a bit too gorey but there is one thing everyone has to agree with: it's written damn well. I guess all the Faulkner parallels originate from here: one might write a violent tale about murder and massacres in the far west but if he lacks the style, he'll just earn comparisons to a Tarantino film! There is a lot more here: brilliant writing, mesmerizing descriptions of the places and landscapes and a kind of \\"atmosphere\\" that reverberates though the book and that I can't justly put in words..."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"The most grotesque novel ever written in modern literature, Cormac McCarthy should have earned the Pulitzer Prize for a novel so splashed with blood and massacre, it outranks all the horrific books published by Stephen King or Jews who have written about their concentration camp experiences during World War II. To read this book is like memorizing detailed instructions on how to butcher a cow in a meat plant. The novel could easily take the place of Caulfield's Catcher in the Rye as the number one book the FBI would find in a serial killer's home. The story is not about murder, although one see's it in each gripping chapter of Indian massacres, merciless bar fights, child killings, and simple I don't like seeing your face, so I'm going to chop your head off scenarios. Instead, the story gives us an understanding that world peace can never be obtained in a society ruled by competition and war-making genes flourishing in all of us. The novel is brilliantly executed and keeps the reader \\"with a strong stomach\\" reading until the climatic end. Cormac writes with a poetic style, distorting descriptions with brilliant metaphors, so one receives an exciting view of the landscape like only Melville and Faulkner can do. The highlight of the book is its haunting albino character, Judge Holden, a Moby Dick or Satan in human form who exploits the shortfalls of humanity. One could imagine Marlon Brando of Apocalypse Now in the character Judge Holden, but with white skin and a vocabulary as prolific as a Harvard graduate. The Judge kills with relish and gives creditable excuses for all his murders. If you have read Stephen King's The Stand, you will find many similarities between Holden and Randall Flagg, they are the same demonic entity, but the Judge is more brilliantly done up. In the end, the Judge is neither evil nor sympathetic to the human cause, but is a reminder to our mortality and how useless self-gain, entertainment, and love means in the end when all that invites us is death."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This novel is filled with the most exquisite sentences I've ever read: laser-accurate diction, uncompromising truthfulness, evocative far beyond Faulkner, perfect structure. The content, the theme, the movement, the freshness on every level are staggering. Brutal beyond anything else I've read, but worth more than anything else I've read, too."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"A thought provoking yet entertaining read; definitely one of the best books I've ever read. McCarrthy's imagery is always vivid and often disturbing, and he has produced an epic, oddly twisted and almost mystical journey of death, redemption, and discovery for his character and the reader. I can't recommend this book enough."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Like great poetry, Cormac McCarthy's books must be read twice to be fully appreciated. Of McCarthy's two main subject areas (Tennessee and the American Southwest/Mexico) Blood Meridian is the darkest of his novels set in the Southwest. Akin in horror to Outer Dark, Blood Meridian is a sentence-by sentence feast of fabulously woven prose by one of the few modern masters of the American novel. Rife with symbolism, Blood Meridian presents an often surreal picture of horror, augmented by McCarthy's uncanny ability to place the reader in the atmosphere and environment of a &quot;wild west&quot; of undescribable beauty, fear, and pure evil."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"As remarkable as it may seem, BLOOD MERIDIAN was a novel that carefully follows actual historic events. Though the relatively innocent observer (The Kid) and the satanic dark power (The Judge)are surely fictional creations, Glanton was an actual leader of a band of scalphunters. History hints that he was every bit as murderous as McCarthy portrays him, and he justly met his end at Yuma Crossing much as he did in the book. For a nonfiction historical account of the career of a scalphunter, try SAVAGE SCENE; THE LIFE OF JAMES KIRKER. You will see that, no matter how horrific the portrayal in BLOOD MERIDIAN, truth remains stranger (and scarier) than fiction."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Blood Meridian is an amazing book, but it is also a challenging book on a number of levels. The writing is beautiful, gorgeous actually, but very complex. Cormac McCarthy totally eschews the modern, direct, and minimalist style. That means the reader is often forced to read the same sentence, or paragraph, over a few times if they really want to distill its meaning. Readers should know that going in. Some people do not like to make that kind of effort when reading a novel, and I can respect that, but I think in the case of Blood Meridian the payoff is more than worth the effort.The book is also challenging due to its relentless violence. Blood Meridian has a well deserved reputation for being one of the most violent novels ever written. The violence in the book is never-ending, and pervades every scene in the book. Every scene in the book, even when things are relatively peaceful, bears within it the ever-present possibility of an eruption of extreme violence. As a literary technique this is quite effective since Cormac McCarthy is able to create in the reader the same feeling of tension that the characters in the book are feeling. You never know when an innocent conversation is going to turn, on a dime, into an orgy of bloodshed. It can, however, be an unpleasant experience at times, and when the tension breaks, and violence does erupt, as it often does, the results are often horrifying, and difficult for the sensitive reader to stomach.Despite these challenges, the book is a masterpiece, and well worth reading. Before I summarize the book, and offer a short summary of its themes, I would like to take the time to recommend a couple of essays that I think do an excellent job unlocking some of the riches that are hidden within Cormac McCarthy's novel. I was so moved by the book that I decided to try and read every essay on the book I could find. I have not quite finished that task yet, I have five or six more essays to read at least, but of the essays that I have read so far, there are two which definitely stand out, and which I would recommend to anyone who is interested in going a little bit deeper into this amazing novel. The first essay is called, \\"The Very Life of the Darkness: A Reading of Blood Meridian\\" by Steven Shaviro. The second essays is called, \\"Gravers False and True: Blood Meridian as Gnostic Tragedy\\" by Leo Daugherty. Both essays are excellent, they both analyze what I will call for simplicity's sake the \\"metaphysics\\" behind the novel, and they can both be found in a volume of collected essays entitledPerspectives on Cormac McCarthy (Southern Quarterly Series)edited by Edwin T. Arnold And Dianne C. Luce.Before I provide my summary of the novel, and analyze its themes, I want to present my SPOILER ALERT. I give away parts of the novel in my analysis, including the ending, so if you have not already read the book, do not read past this sentence!So why do I think this novel is worth reading despite the challenges it presents to the reader? Well, I should say upfront that I am a graduate student in philosophy, and though I have no proof, I am convinced that Cormac McCarthy has spent a great deal of time studying philosophy, particularly Nietzsche and Heidegger, and he puts a lot of that philosophy into his novels (I found the same evidence of Heidegger inThe Road (Oprah's Book Club)). There is a ton of philosophy in this book for those who have ears to hear. As a philosophy student I have a tendency, at times, to read novels as if they were philosophical treatises, so before I try to analyze a few of what I consider to be the more interesting philosophical ideas contained in the novel, I would like to try to explain why the book is worth reading even if one decides to ignore most, or all, of the philosophy.The language, as I already mentioned, is beautiful, and has a hypnotic power which I have only encountered in a handful of writers (William Faulkner, Virginia Woolf, to some extent, and perhaps a few places in James Joyce and Samuel Beckett). The story is also gripping. The novel is essentially the story of a kid who leaves home as a young teenager and eventually falls in with a group of Americans hired by the governor of a town in Mexico, Chihuahua, to hunt Native Americans. The hunters are paid for each Native American they kill (including women and children) and in order to prove how many Native Americans they kill they are required to bring back their scalps. The novel follows this group of adventurers and murderers as they travel through Mexico, at times hunting, and at times being hunted. The story is actually so gripping that I wound up reading the last 260 pages of the book (about three-fourths of the whole book) in a single sitting. I almost never read a fiction book that grips me in that way, and while it is certainly a cliche, this book definitely becomes \\"hard to put down\\" particularly in the last 60 pages or so. The landscape in the novel is also breathtaking. The book also contains one of the most interesting, and complex, characters ever to appear in print, namely, Judge Holden (more on him later). For all these reasons, Blood Meridian is eminently worth reading, even if the reader decides to ignore entirely the philosophy contained within its pages.There is, however, a lot of philosophy in this book, so anyone who is interested in philosophy will not be disappointed. I believe that Cormac McCarthy is operating with a fully developed metaphysics in this novel. Actually, it would be more accurate to say that the judge is operating with a fully developed metaphysics. It is not clear to me whether Cormac McCarthy endorses that metaphysics or not. The clearest statement of the judge's metaphysics comes late in the novel, \\"This man holding this particular arrangement of cards in his hand is thereby removed from existence. This is the nature of war...It is the testing of one's will and the will of another within that larger will which because it binds them is therefore forced to select. War is the ultimate game because war is at last a forcing of the unity of existence. War is god\\" (249).The statement \\"war is god\\" immediately reminds one of Heraclitus' saying, \\"war is the father of all things\\". The judge is claiming that reality is fundamentally a unity and a plurality; a unity of opposites, or conflicting wills, which makes reality essentially war and annihilation. The only way that two opposites, or opposing wills, can be united is by having the stronger will annihilate the weaker; so if reality is, at its core, made up of singular and conflicting wills, the unity of existence requires a constant state of war. The judge, of course, uses this metaphysic to justify his own violence and the violence of the \\"gang\\". The reason I am not certain that Cormac McCarthy endorses this metaphysic is because I believe that the book is not simply the depiction of violence, I believe it is also, at the same time, a critique of that violence.But if that is correct, if McCarthy is offering a critique of violence, then the question arises: where, within that general ontology of conflicting wills, is there any possibility for surveying the whole, and offering a critique? If human beings are, like all other beings, simply singular wills out to express their own power (Nietzsche's will to power), how is it possible for human beings to abstract themselves from that violence and to take up a critical stance towards it (to pass judgment on existence as a whole)? It is clear that Cormac McCarthy does believe that human beings are on the same ontological plane as other beings. There is a passage late in the novel that reminds one a great deal of the French philosopher Gilles Deleuze, and his notions of immanence and the univocity of being: \\"In the neuter austerity of that terrain all phenomena were bequeathed a strange equality and no one thing nor spider nor stone nor blade of grass could put forth claim to precedence...in the optical democracy of such landscapes all preference is made whimsical and a man and a rock become endowed with unguessed kinships\\" (247). Also, despite the fact that the novel takes place in 1849, ten years before the publication of Darwin'sThe Origin Of Species: 150th Anniversary Edition, Cormac McCarthy repeatedly, throughout the novel, compares human beings to apes. I actually found that comparison to be so frequent that I started underlining all the times when a human being (or a human being's bones) was compared to an ape. I did not count the total but it occurs enough not to be a simple coincidence; Cormac McCarthy is making a point.So Cormac McCarthy seems to deny human beings any kind of ontological precedence within being, and that raises an important question, namely, how is it possible for human beings to reject the violence that seems to lie at the core of being, if they are a being just like any other being? This is why I think Leo Daugherty's article, which I mentioned above, is so interesting. Leo Daugherty compares Cormac McCarthy's novel to the Gnostics, and the Gnostics, according to Daugherty, had a peculiar way of posing the question of evil, \\"Whereas most thoughtful people have looked at the world they lived in and asked, How did evil get into it?, the Gnostics looked at the world and asked, How did good get into it?\\" (162). I am convinced that this is the central question of the whole novel.The Gnostics, of course, created a whole mythology about how the divine soul, or spark, fell into matter, and was attempting to escape. The goal of the Gnostics was to induce alienation. Human beings, possessing the divine spark, should not feel at home in the world, and if they do feel at home it can only be because the divine spark in them is sleeping. The Gnostics, therefore, attempted to wake people up, and waking up induced a feeling of alienation. The reason I disagree with critics who consider the violence in Cormac McCarthy's novel to be gratuitous and without purpose, is because I am convinced the novel is essentially a means for alienating the reader from the world. We should not feel at home in this world, which is ruled by the judge, and we should not feel at home with our own genocidal history (in the U.S.). I believe that the neutral way that the violence in the novel is described is meant to alienate the reader. The purely factual description of the violence heightens the feeling of not being at home in a purely factual world without values. The question is, How did this come about? Why are human beings not at home in a purely factual world? The Gnostic notion of the divine spark is, of course, just a mythological image, which does not really explain why human beings are alienated from the world to begin with, and I do not think that Cormac McCarthy offers any positive answers to that question either. Neither the Gnostics, nor Cormac McCarthy, are capable of offering any positive, or conclusive, answer to the question, How did good get into the world?, but I am convinced that Cormac McCarthy does believe that, however it happened, good did get into the world, which is why I disagree with the nihilistic charge that is often leveled at Cormac McCarthy.The kid, to me, is suffering from the beginnings of that alienation from the world of war, and the judge recognizes that in him. Unfortunately the kid does not have any positive answers, or any positive response to the judge's metaphysics. The kid begins, eventually, to carry around a Bible, despite the fact that he cannot read it. The kid carrying around a Bible he cannot read is, in my opinion, one of the most potent symbols in the whole book. I am convinced that some quotations from C.G. Jung can help clarify this image.InSymbols of Transformation (Collected Works of C.G. Jung Vol.5)Jung writes, \\"Through the shifting of interest from the inner to the outer world our knowledge of nature was increased...but knowledge and experience of the inner world were correspondingly reduced...and the great figures of dogma dwindled to strange and incomprehensible vestiges, a prey to every sort of criticism\\" (77). InPsychology and Alchemy (Collected Works of C.G. Jung Vol.12)Jung writes, \\"It may easily happen...that a Christian who believes in all the sacred figures is still undeveloped and unchanged in his inmost soul because he has 'all God outside' and does not experience him in the soul. His deciding motives, his ruling interests and impulses, do not spring from the sphere of Christianity but from the unconscious and undeveloped psyche, which is as pagan and archaic as ever...The great events of our world as planned and executed by man do not breathe the spirit of Christianity but rather of unadorned paganism. These things originate in a psychic conditioned that has remained archaic and has not been even remotely touched by Christianity\\" (11). And finally, later in the same book, Jung writes, \\"theologians fail to see that it is not a matter of proving the existence of the light, but of blind people who do not know that their eyes could see. It is high time we realized that it is pointless to praise the light and preach it if nobody can see it...For it is obvious that far too many people are incapable of establishing a connection between the sacred figures and their own psyche\\" (13)These three quotes from Jung provide a number of possible ways of reading the kid's decision to carry around a Bible he cannot read. If we focus on the first quote, we could argue that the scientific spirit, represented in the book by the judge, has gained ascendancy, and so the symbols of Christianity no longer have meaning for the modern psyche. The kid, then, would be clinging to a dead mythology whose time has come, because he has nothing else positive to offer in its place. If, on the other hand, we bring in the later quotations, we could argue that the present state of the psyche, or the soul, is not yet capable of grasping the symbols contained in the book. This reading is more optimistic. Perhaps, once the kid learns to read (i.e. is able to establish a connection between the symbols in the book he carries and his own psyche) personal transformation may become possible, and, perhaps, the violence that has ruled within human history so far would be replaced with a spirit of love. Of course (SPOILER ALERT) the judge winds up killing the kid before he ever gets a chance to learn to read, and this seems to me to represent the fact that the spirit of science has triumphed (the judge represents science at a number of places in the book, where he provides geological analyses, and he is constantly recording what he sees in his notebook, in order to rob the world of its autonomy).Cormac McCarthy's pessimism, which is expressed by the judge murdering the kid, seems to me to be the same as Heidegger's pessimism about the modern technological age. In fact, the metaphysics that Cormac McCarthy puts in the mouth of the judge is essentially the same metaphysics that Heidegger puts in the mouth of Nietzsche in his lectures on Nietzsche (Nietzsche: Volumes One and Two (Nietzsche, Vols. I & II)andNietzsche: Vols. 3 and 4 (Vol. 3: The Will to Power as Knowledge and as Metaphysics; Vol. 4: Nihilism)) and which Heidegger believes is the secret metaphysics of the modern age. The judge himself claims that \\"Only nature can enslave man and only when the existence of each last entity is routed out and made to stand naked before him will he be properly suzerain of the earth\\" (198). It would be hard to imagine a better, or more succinct, summary of Heidegger's notion of enframing. Cormac McCarthy appears to many to be a nihilist precisely because he does not buy into our triumphalist notion of human progress. Our meridian leads immediately to our decline, and I think the decline of Western civilization is definitely one of the themes of the book.Of course, there are many aspects of the book that do not fit neatly into my interpretation. For example, the judge also seems to me to be a representation of the Hindu god Shiva, at least in Shiva's destructive aspect (he is a dancer). I think another reason that calling Cormac McCarthy a nihilist is inaccurate is, I am convinced that the work constitutes a kind of negative theology. The judge, as a representative of the immanent transformations of matter-energy, represents prakriti, but there is also purusha, consciousness, or, the witness. The kid, I believe, begins to awaken to this consciousness. There is a scene in the novel where the kid becomes separated from the \\"gang\\" and he finds himself on a mountain overlooking a battle that is taking place, \\"He watched all this pass below him mute and ordered and senseless\\" (213). This expresses symbolically the kids growing alienation from the violence that surrounds him. The kid is awakening to purusha. In Advaita Vedanta Brahman is described as \\"neti, neti\\" (not this, not this) which expresses Brahman's transcendence from the world. Another way of expressing that would be to say that God is radically absent from the world. The world that Cormac McCarthy describes in Blood Meridian is a God-forsaken world, but, a God-forsaken world is a world in which God's absence is felt. There is a great deal of modern theology built around this notion of the absence of God, and I am convinced that Cormac McCarthy's novel could almost be considered an exmaple of \\"death of God\\" theology. In this respect, I differ to some degree from Steven Shaviro's analysis, whose essay I mentioned above, since Steven Shaviro views Blood Meridian as a novel of radical immanence (Shaviro interprets the novel in Deleuzean terms). It is true that Cormac McCarthy presents a novel of radical immanence, but, that immanence points, in my opinion, to God's absence, and, therefore, to the radical transcendence of Brahman (neti, neti). Either that, or, we are left affirming, along with the judge, that \\"war is god\\". Like any good novelist, McCarthy does not answer the question for us."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Blood Meridian challenged me on various levels. For those attracted by reviews touting the novel's violence and depravity: you will not be disappointed. McCarthy describes massacres and scalpings and hangings and rapes with painstaking attention to detail. At other times, he lets the words \\"scalp\\" and \\"hang\\" and \\"rape\\" simply speak for themselves. After you've traveled halfway through this novel, believe me: you will read these words as you've never read them before.Lexically, BM both frustrates and rewards (often simultaneously) and there have been few times when I was so hard-pressed to use a dictionary. I do not consider myself an amateur reader. For me, reading is a job that I love and take seriously. Books are not passing entertainment but the records of the best we have dreamt and thought (which I believe is Matthew Arnold), and for the reader to comprehend such intricate emotional states and philosophical concepts he must immerse himself in the words of his language. I have undergone my baptism and now ritually subject myself to the intermittent sprinklings of different works. And yet nothing in my experience prepared me for the difficult vocabulary of this book. Many of these foreign words are context-specific--that is, McCarthy uses the names of actual parts of wagons or clothing or what not. Oftentimes, the words are regionally significant to the Southwest United States and therefore help set the atmosphere of the book. The vocabulary also pulls from different scientific fields such as geology and paleontology. Sometimes these usages seemed gratuitous:\\"The seep lay high up among the ledges, vadose water dripping down the slick black rock . . . .\\"For those who do not know the meaning of the word \\"vadose\\" (and I was just recently among your number), it means that the water is located above the water table. This strikes me as unnecessary to the telling of the story (calm yourselves, McCarthy fanatics); we only need to know that the Kid is struggling through a parched, mountainous area and that he's come upon a bit of trickling water. Does the origin of the water truly matter enough to use this word? I refuse to admit that anything is completely pointless about this book--such was its power--and I would much prefer a writer who used his vocabulary as opposed to one who allowed it to molder with disuse because his readers were either too lazy or stupid to appreciate it. However, the vocabulary checked me at times. McCarthy has a tendency to intersperse powerful scenes of violence with alien adjectives or nouns or verbs--instant tension breaker because I suddenly have no idea what the hell has happened. However, I do not completely blame him for this--at times I was annoyed by what I perceived to be my own limited vocabulary. The words do enrich his language and the descriptive quality of his scenes, but one must know these words to appreciate their power on a first reading. This book challenges any serious reader to reevaluate the depth of his or her own word-hoard.But as it frustrates so it rewards, and in equal if not greater measure. First of all, there is the beauty of McCarthy's style:\\"They watched storms out there so distant they could not be heard, the silent lightning flaring sheetwise and the thin black spine of the mountain chain fluttering and sucked away again in the dark. They saw wild horses racing on the plain, pounding their shadows down the night and leaving in the moonlight a vaporous dust like the palest stain of their passing.\\"It has been said before but it bears repeating: McCarthy's style is enviable. The sheer lyricality of his prose both belies and augments the horrific acts of violence it conveys. At times one does not know whether to marvel at the beauty of some especially vivid killing or to be physically ill from the richly evocative prose.And now for the unconventional structure of BM. I have mentioned in several reviews that I particularly admire and enjoy the character-driven novel. BM, more often than not, is not character-driven. Most of the characters are nothing more than sketches and I only found the Kid to gel for me as a real person towards the end of the story. There is precious little plot and no internalized dialogue to convey the psychology of the characters. Everything exists on the surface and must be interpreted for what it is worth--much like real life. Some of these things irked me at first, but I respected McCarthy's vision. And then I met the Judge. I will not spoil any of his delicious monologues in this review but he is a character that could only have been conceived in hell amidst the howling of Iago and Edmund and Milton's Satan. While the characters of BM are virtually all distasteful and violent and the very landscapes seem aching to tear men apart, the Judge stands alone as the book's enigmatic center. He is a creature of nightmare--and not the silly nightmares we awake from and chuckle at but the ones we awake from screaming, soaked in sweat and then meditate on for hours after. If ever a character from literature will resonate with you, it will be this man.I have refrained from quoting my favorite passages from this book because everyone deserves to experience them as I did--unprepared for both their horror and their beauty. The magnitude of what McCarthy has accomplished troubles me in the sweetest way and in his language I hear (as many have heard) the iron and sand of the Old Testament. American prose cannot be the same after this book."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Occasionally an author comes along, marching to his own heartbeat, defying rules because, quite simply, he knows he can. Cormac McCarthy, a sporadic, reclusive writer, forging his own unforgiving and exclusive vision, is this author. Critics have called \\"Blood Meridian: Or the Evening Redness in the West\\" his masterpiece, and I cannot argue. It's unlike any work I've read before. This is my second book of McCarthy's, the first being his recent apocalyptic classicThe Road. A similarity, besides his unusual writing style defying conventions, is I had great difficulty putting the books down, racing through them intensely in two day's time. It's unusual for me to read books so quickly and yet, I became so immersed in McCarthy's passages I did not wish to leave the worlds he created.I find this odd since these are not inviting places, hideous territories of stinking carcasses, impulsive murder, rape, cannibalism and darkness. Characters seem to be on a quest, and as they exhaustively move forward we hope for a glimmer of light. \\"Blood Meridian\\" is disturbing because, unlike \\"The Road,\\" there is so little reassurance, where rare acts of kindness are not rewarded. I suspect one of the motivations for McCarthy's \\"Blood Meridian\\" was to cut through the romance of the American west, the great historical mythology living in imaginations of people across the globe. While McCarthy's novel takes place on a western landscape, essentially the Texas/Mexican border of 1849, it's no more a western thanMoby Dick (Oxford World's Classics)is a sea-faring adventure. The Glanton Gang, a criminal group of scalp-hunters who cut a lawless swath during these pre-Civil War years, is based on fact (My Confession). But the trail McCarthy travels is ultimately an alien land of mysticism and nightmares having existed since infant times of stone clubs and magic fire.Death is a part of the daily existence, and none escape its talons. McCarthy follows the travels of \\"the kid,\\" a Tennessee youth who eventually ends up in Texas. He's recruited by the Glanton Gang, seedy murderers adorned in dried body parts hired by the local Mexican government to kill marauding Apaches, with bounties paid for each scalp. They kill Apaches and each other and eventually, unable to find warriors, innocent tribes and defenseless Mexican residents in isolated corners of memory. Women, children and infants do not escape this endless warfare, hung from trees like trophies, dead faces \\"mottled\\" by bird droppings.A member of this gang, a spiritual leader in many ways, is the unforgettable Judge Holden. One of the great villains in literature history, this hairless, 7-foot monster enjoys singing and dancing in the nude, spouting philosophy and writing and drawing in mysterious journals while sitting before ancient Indian pictographs. He laughs at the ultimate fallacy of their existence, an immortal presence whose most simple definition is that of a demon or the Devil. He smiles, winks and taps his temple, and where he treads, children disappear with nothing to remain but ominous pools of blood. The kid has great difficulty avoiding Holden's child-like hands, but eventually darkness meets him in the most unlikely of places.There is nothing romantic about McCarthy's west, and yet his greatest skill is finding glimmers of life's spark within the most unexpected moments - the killing of a defenseless goat or bear, the mounting of Indian heads on spikes, hiding within the bones of sheep, an imbecile residing in a cage eating feces. All of these descriptions are indeed vile, and yet there's a rare beauty McCarthy is able to pull from this gloom. His unique writing style continually flames into brilliance, but reading it takes practice. I was reminded of reading Shakespeare's Olde English in college (Macbeth (Modern Library Classics)). The going was initially rough, but once one adapts, there are rewards to be discovered.After reading \\"Blood Meridian,\\" I found myself depressed. Not because of anything that happened in McCarthy's scalding glimpse of the western world. Because I realized how much of my life had been wasted reading trash, watching poor films, sitting in front of the television entranced by sports. There's an incredible universe before us, trials, tribulations, history, journeys through mysterious and angry dimensions, Melville, Faulkner, Dostoevsky, Joyce. Through years of hard and dedicated efforts, we've been culturally dumbed down and drugged, preserving democracy, imbeciles trapped by contemporary fate.I have read many attempting to compare this book to Larry McMurty'sLonesome Dove: A Novel, an eventually foolish endeavor. It's like comparing Hemingway to Steinbeck, Kerouac to Salinger. I've read both, and all I can say is \\"Lonesome Dove\\" could only have been written by a man born in Texas. \\"Blood Meridian\\" could only have been written by a man not. And this is not a criticism for either."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"One of the objectively most skilled artists alive at the top of his game penning one of the most polished and relentlessly creative pieces ever made.

If you have seen this before, recall the first time you saw this video; that's what the book is like.Of course the prose is beautiful, and the story is insane and intense. Yes it's a lot like Moby Dick. Yes, it bothered me that there was no punctuation. I'm pretty sure Bruce Dickenson didn't use any in his Iron Maiden song either. There's probably a reason for the lack of punctuation; something maybe about an old whiskery fellow telling you this story over a campfire in the desert, but I'm still trying to find my adrenal glands after reading this book, so it's hard to be certain. I'll leave the details up to someone trying to write their Ph.D. dissertation in English literature. Yes, Satan and various obscure philosophies factor heavily in the symbolism. I've been shot at, had 6000 lb objects rain down on me, and have otherwise come close to being made into 190lbs of meat in the course of my life adventures. Reading Blood Meridian has a similar effect on the endocrine system."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"If author Cormac McCarthy's skill with words is a standard for writing, few in the world can attain it. Although the book is full of arcane words and seemingly awkward phrasings, it still leaves sparkling images in the mind. Also, as I found with McCarthy's The Road, despite (or because of) a lack of things like punctuation and quotation marks, the writing is very easy to follow.The key subject here, as in The Road and McCarthy's No Country for Old Men, is evil. In The Road, the major characters (man and boy) are good, but they are surrounded by malevolent anarchy. In No Country, many of the figures are good, but not the dominant Chigurh, who is evil incarnate.Chigurh's equivalent in Blood Meridian is \\"the judge.\\" The judge is seven feet tall, soulless, agile, incredibly strong, vicious, adroit, and very light on his feet: a graceful dancer! Today, one could imagine him in the NBA, the WWE, or, perhaps, on Dancing with the Stars. Or given his erudition and ability to wax eloquent, he could even be a judge, but not one you would want to face.The judge is one of the leaders of a pack of men who savage the Mexico-U.S. border and the area of Chihuahua and Sonora in northern Mexico. This band hunts scalps for bounties granted by Mexican officials who seek to rid the region of Indian raiders. The judge's band is good at scalping, plundering, and a wide variety of incredibly cruel acts. They often use their superior firepower (they have large caliber pistols at their disposal) and discipline to slaughter all before them. They take no prisoners, sparing no women, children, or elders.The whole gang usually needs a prolonged blast from a fire hose to wash the blood, gore, and filth from off their bodies. They also often need a square meal and a long drink of clean water. They could probably use a good twelve-step program, and most likely, extensive dental work. Much of the book is about them wandering across a forbidding region of mountains and deserts, which McCarthy brilliantly describes, either pursued by or pursuing bands of equally brutal Indians, or as McCarthy writes, \\"indians.\\" Occasionally they loot a village, killing all the people, and then drink themselves into a stupor.Another key character is \\"the kid.\\" He's fourteen when he falls in with the gang around 1847. For the next few years he participates in the slaughters. He's a dead shot with his pistol and very tough. Eventually he displays a certain sense of compassion, certainly in contrast to the judge who is utterly devoid of human warmth. The latter part of the book focuses on the kid's adventures.The reason I gave the book a five is the powerful writing. The subject matter is often enough to make the reader wince with disgust. But, of course, real evil is much worse (and real good is much better) than any human writer can project on paper. Which is precisely why the Bible remains so popular."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This novel doesn't have the same bare-knuckled emotional wallop of The Road, but it still qualifies as a modern masterpiece.Blood Meridian or the Evening Redness in the West is an old West cowboy novel, full of strange-yet-authentic language and characters. Like good concrete poetry, McCarthy's work reflects the world he creates. A long ride across the hot desert, feels like a long, hot ride across the desert. Unfortunately, sometimes trudging through McCarthy's dense prose can seem like an equally arduous task.This book has been criticized for being ultra-violent, but the violence just seems extra harsh because it appears so suddenly out of McCarthy's calm, lazy, sun-bleached landscape.Judge Holden is unquestionably one of the most brilliantly rendered villains in all of literature. His observation of the world, his uncanny knowledge, and his seeming mastery of all things on earth, make him terrifyingly god-like. It's The Judge's world, we just live in it. And not for very long.

I will say that had I been going into Blood Meridan expecting to read such an amazing work, my experience may have been different.I knew it was supposed to be good, and I had read Outer Dark already so I was familiar with McCarthy's voice. But Blood Meridan reads like an epic poem. It is so lyrical that it can be difficult to comprehend at first. It took me a while to get into the groove of reading Blood Meridan, where I could read a passage and not have to go back over it knowing I missed something there. However, once you acclimate to the language, it becomes so worth the effort you put into it.When I finished it (took about three weeks for me), I set it down and was just stunned for a long time. It made me feel like everything I had ever read up to that point was a waste of time.

I want to talk about the Epilogue, what the heck it means, etc. It seems so far removed from the story, and yet so central -- why else would it be there? Every time I re-read the book, I come to a new understanding, and right now I'm leaning toward this: that the Epilogue is a metaphor representing the Oil Industry, that the Man in the Epilogue is drilling wells, that the fire is the product of the struck/discovered oil, that the Oil Industry is what \\"replaced\\" Glanton's Marauders in our westward expansion, that it too rapes and otherwise plunders and destroys (in this case the earth), and that the people following the Man are representative of those of us left to pick up the pieces, or not. How's that for McCarthy's grabbing hold of a reader's imagination and not letting go? I highly recommend this book, especially to students of the English language. I think it stands head and shoulders above any novel written in the past 80 years.

It helps to know going in that it is based on historical events in the southwest and Mexico in the 1840s and was deeply researched in the first-hand accounts of the era. The main character, the kid, tends to disappear in the middle portions of the novel, absorbed into John Glanton's murderous filibustering gang, but as you read, keep in mind the effects on him that are always implied.Blood Meridian is a brilliant critique of American imperialism and Manifest Destiny (personified in the horrific Judge Holden) both in the past and by implication in the Vietnam era when it was written and the present as well.

It was very difficult to get through, and I had to take it in short spurts. McCarthy's beautiful poetic language contrasted with the unspeakable horrors wonderfully, but why? When I finished the book I didn't like it, but felt like I had missed something. I kept thinking about it though, which is probably McCarthy's intention.The extreme violence in Blood Meridian is a real slap in the face. Is its purpose to make the reader numb and desensitized to it after a while, much like the violence on our local news and shows like CSI, Bones and the lot? Possibly - after a while, just to get through Blood Meridian I had to let the violence and gore \\"flow over me,\\" much like watching these shows. We ask ourselves, \\"How can anyone read Blood Meridian? How could that level of brutality and violence in the Mexico/Texas borderlands of the mid-1800's even have existed, much less be believable?\\" Now look around with fresh eyes. What are we desensitized to now? Brutal murders and autopsies come into in our living rooms night after night, and no one blinks an eye.Maybe the purpose of the violence in Blood Meridian is to remind us of what \\"Survival of the Fittest\\" really means. It does not mean what is \\"just\\" or what is \\"fair.\\" It means that the fittest for a particular situation survives, however brutal or unjust the circumstances. Turn on any nature show. It might not be pleasant to watch prey being eaten by wolves, but that's what happens. It is a brutal business, but that is how nature works. That is how life goes on. Nature is not concerned with developing characters for a story (McCarthy doesn't here, with the possible exceptions of The Judge and The Kid). Nature is concerned that life goes on. That's it. Morality does not figure into it.Everyone essentially has absolute freedom and could run roughshod doing anything they want, like the Glanton gang in the book. The downside to this behavior of course is that the more people they kill the more enemies they make and the sooner they die themselves in the story. A social contract (Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, et al.), in essence saying \\"I will give up some of my absolute freedoms for security - I won't harm you if you won't harm me,\\" is one of the ways society attempts to overcome the violence. But, as McCarthy reminds us, the underlying and uncaring Nature and its unrelenting themes are always there and always will be.These difficult realities are easy to forget about in today's society. McCarthy's slap in the face reminds us of our social contract and that nature just doesn't care. Survival of the fittest is how we got here. We are the children of survivors, and this fact is something we forget at our own peril.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"As to be expected, McCarthy's command of language is a little over the top in some instances, but always fits the occasion. This is not a book for the tender hearted. There is no \\"romantic West\\", just the brutal reality of the men that peopled the area at the time."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Great book overall. The middle 90% was pretty dense, but like the border trilogy, the last few chapters were ample reward for slogging through. My main reason for this review, though, is to warn potential readers to NOT READ THE INTRODUCTION. It's inexcusable that the second paragraph of the intro blows one of the most important developments of the book. Whoever signed off on this at Random House should consider a different vocation."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"While it's incredibly well written, this is an incredibly grim and bleak novel that isn't for the faint of heart. Cormac McCarthy isn't known for pulling punches. In this novel, people are about as amoral and unsympathetic as it comes. Rape, murder, scalping and more - all in the same paragraph, thank you very much. I read this for a book club book, and liked it better after talking about it with friends, but it was incredibly painful during the grueling slog through the book. I can't actually recommend this book, no matter how well written it may be."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"There is magic in Cormac McCarthy's writing that is not easily defined. It is not character development; we don't even know the name of \\"Blood Meridian's\\" main character, known only as \\"the kid\\". And it is certainly not the plot, as \\"Blood\\" rampages aimlessly though a few decades of the kid's life, most in the few years he rode the Texas-Mexico border with \\"Captain\\" John Joel Glanton's band of scalp hunters as they terrorized both sides of the border around 1850. But McCarthy's prose - veering without warning from succinct couplets worth a thousand pictures to rambling 200 word sentences that fill an entire paragraph - is simply unparalleled. More epic poetry than a novel, McCormac's writing is a blunt instrument delivering blows with precision, stark exposition without apology or analysis, allowing the reader to fill in the blanks and absorb the shock unprotected but also unencumbered. And you may want to keep a dictionary handy - unabridged - as McCarthy's verbiage will challenge even the most accomplished linguist.If you harbor any delusions of a \\"romantic\\" western expansion of the US, you may want to think twice before allowing \\"Blood Meridian\\" to shatter these illusions. McCarthy's west has absolutely no similarity to Bonanza, Clint Eastwood, Dee Brown or Larry McCurtry. Talk about an apocalyptic image of the old west - picture Glanton's band of misfits riding into a frontier town, covered in weeks of prairie dust and blood decorated both horse and rider in human skins and various severed body parts. Don't expect political correctness in McCarthy's work: depravity and blood lust was a sport enjoyed by both the American aboriginal tribes and those that pursue them, as McCarthy without emotion unveils unspeakable acts of barbarism and torture on both sides. Critically acclaimed as a expose that plumbs the depths of the darkness of mans' soul, McCarthy burns phantom images in the brain that while perhaps not immediately absorbed will return to haunt the reader long after the pages have turned. In short, a true American classic, a powerful if perverse window into a little-told period of American history, told through allegory and poetry evoking emotions not easily shaken."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"The book takes place in the early 1800s and follows the exploits of a nearly silent Tennessee youth referred to only as \\"the kid,\\" who leaves his home and seeks a future out west. After falling in with a belicose captain that entertains delusions of conquering Mexico, the kid barely surives a savage attack by Apaches upon their company. Shorty thereafter, he joins the Glanton Gang--a rabble of men who make their living from the flourishing scalp trade. It is in the company of these killers that the kid makes the acquaintance of the Judge--one of the most fascinating and horrific characters I have ever encountered in the entire cannon of the written word.The book is violent in the extreme, yet McCarthy's command of language is so superb, his story telling so sublime, that the reader never feels a scene is cheap or gratuitous. It this duality between the incredible beauty of the language and the stark brutality of its subject that gives the book its power. Critic Steven Shaviro comments, \\"the scariest thing about Blood Meridian is that it is a euphoric and exhilarating book, rather than a tragically alienated one, or a gloomy, depressing one.\\"McCarthy also researched his book heavily, so that descriptions of landscape, fauna, and life in that period ring true. Apparently the characters of Glanton and the Judge are based on real people. Chamberlain, who rode with the real Glanton, gives an icy account of the fun had on their bloody conquest in his memoirs, entitled \\"My Confession.\\" And the scalp trade is faithfully depicted and historically accurate, though some may have a hard time envisioning when such a time in America could ever have existed. But the book isn't merely about America or the acts of violence of any one period in human history; it really is a meditation on the human animal, our limitations, and our collective character. McCarthy opens his book with this telling passage:\\"Clark, who lead last year's expedition to the Afar region of northern Ethiopia, and UC Berkley colleague Tim D. White, also said that a re-examination of a 300,000-year-old fossil skull found in the same region earlier shows evidence of having been scalped.\\"--The Yuma Daily Sun, June 13th, 1982.Lastly, I cannot stress how rich this book is. Yes, it is a difficult read--McCarthy dislikes punctuation and has an enormous vocabulary, I recommend keeping a dictionary handy--but the rewards are immense. The best literature to me has always included not only soaring language, but ideas worthy of such language. Blood Meridian is perhaps the purest example of this I have ever found. I'll leave with this passage, taken shortly after the kid arrives in a rough desert outpost and is drawn toward the light of saloon:\\"Then he pushed open the door and entered. A dimly seething rabble had coagulated within. As if the raw board structure erected for their containment occupied some ultimate sink into which they had gravitated from off the surrounding flatlands.\\"Comparing men to objects affected by gravity also ties into one of the book's main themes, yet I hope you all will attempt to discover that on your own. (Yes, I'm ending my review with a cheesy \\"If you want to find out more, please read the book.\\" ) A++"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"McCormack's unique style of writing once again captivates in Blood Meridian, with sculpted landscapes, mesmerising dialogues, and portrayals of violence that are disturbingly perceptive. Spinning a web between two disparate characters, the youthful Kid and the diabolical Judge, one is swept away on a most disturbing journey of the deepest senses. As several of his books, the mythology of the wild west is given a twist, unravelling the spin that has formed our perception of this part of American history, exposing it as it really was. The savage events that dominated the growth of the new nation are bared in chilling detail, uncomfortably lyrical in a language as of song. But it strikes an even deeper core, timeless beyond the historical context of the westward expansion in America, equally relevant today as in any other time, relevant far beyond the geography of America's west. The elements of human nature are exposed as the quest for power and its abomination into brutality culminates in the peaks of violence - the meridians of blood. McCormack's writing, singular and unique, as full of emotion as it is sparse in punctuation, stimulating and illuminating in clarity of thought, effortlessly breaking the mould of conventional form and grammar, and ultimately striking a chord deep within, that normally is touched only through poetry. And what most would not dare admit, a chord as relevant today as it was in the days of the wild west. My admiration for McCormack's writing, driven both by emotion and intellect, is complete - the man is a true master, this book a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Having read the spectrum of the World's great classic novels, I typically have shied away from fiction altogether. Books like War and Peace, and Les Miserables seldom have an equal in the present-day fiction realm. This book though, by Cormac McCarthy, is one of those that can satisfy even the harshest critic. I first learned of Blood Meridian while reading How to Read and Why, by Harold Bloom. His essay was suchthat I had to see for myself if this McCarthy fellow was all that Mr. Bloom proclaimed him to be. By the time I was half way through, I was in complete agreement. Blood Meridian is a fascinating book whose prose is mesmerizingly captivating, grabbing ahold of the soul and not letting go. It is rare that I find myself in need of a good dictionary while reading present day literature, but I advise having one handy should you undertake this effort. Regrettably, many in our schools today will never know the joy of reading a work like this. I am grateful to Harold Bloom for sharing it with me."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Unless you are a particularly squeamish reader, do not be deterred by the truly horrible violence in this masterpiece of American letters. 'Blood Meridian' is must-reading for anyone interested in tracking down the best writing in these days of literary famine. This brave and ambitious novel stares evil itself dead in the face and does not look away. Cormac McCarthy has staked his claim as a legitimate heir to masters such as Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor, the former of whose work he has often been criticized of imitating. Yet even a novice Faulkner reader such as myself can discern that his novels had neither the scope or the brutality of McCarthy's work. As for building his style upon a Faulknerian foundation, McCarthy himself has unashamedly observed that the ugly fact is that books are built out of books. He is right, of course. It is the deep moral theme of this western novel that distinguishes 'Blood Meridian'. In his examination of the plauge of violence which characterized America's western expansion, McCarthy marries historical events with majestic prose poetry to create an apocalyptic epic with terror and beauty. The novel becomes nothing short of a treatise on the nature of evil. In the character of the Judge, McCarthy has created one of the most chilling and unforgettable figures in the history of literature. As he rides undaunted through the barren landscapes, he is by turns erudite and vicious, lyrical and downright mean. The final scene in which he confronts the Kid and the immediate aftermath of this meeting is probably the most profoundly terrifying and riveting conclusion I have ever come across in a novel. It's not light-hearted, it's not fun, but 'Blood Meridian' is an awesome display of creative writing at its most potent and its most sublime."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Without being forced to read this McCarthy work for a Literature class, I probably never would have. I've never been a fan of the classic American 'Western,' whether it be the print or film variety, and McCarthy's tale of America's Manifest Destiny push into the Mexican north in the 1850's would have definitely stayed on the shelf. This work was one of the most challenging tales I have ever read, yet the critical reader is rewarded for his/her efforts with a beautiful, gripping, packed tale that is worthy of praise the likes of Moby Dick and The Odyssey.McCarthy's tale follows the exploits of the orphaned Kid in something of his own Odyssey towards manhood through experience. The reader witnesses firsthand the violent, savage nature that ruled the Old West and McCarthy has no problem in presenting these scenarios in graphic, unforgiving detail. Initially I thought the violence was terribly interesting; this fresh presentation of such revolting gore was striking and unlike anything else I have read, but the violence would not end. This simple fact helped me to realize McCarthy's dark, realistic view of the world that is not all fair and just, or even happy. The author's other chief character, the Judge, a seven-foot tall hairless albino further exemplifies the juxtaposition of good and evil in the world around us. The Judge values life so that he might control it, he is gentle and caring yet vicious and violent at the same time. He leads the Kid's group into the desert as a Christ-like figure yet succumbs to relentless temptations of the devil as well. Though the Kid is our focus, McCarthy's inclusion of numerous dynamic personalities within the group makes it easy to invest our attention with these characters as well, creating more outlets for the reader to draw from and relate to. As the reader develops a bond or interest in the Kid, so does he/she develop an interest in these other characters and their stories and adventures, thus there is nary a lulling moment in the text as the action and development are far too compelling.Immediately I noticed how well McCarthy's prose style lent itself to the telling of the tale. His rustic exposition melds perfectly with the desolate landscapes that he paints for both the reader and his characters. It's very easy to get lost in the author's dynamic world, which makes it even more challenging to catch the thematic details that are woven into every word, details that McCarthy selects with the purposefulness of a poet. Yet when read aloud his lines read like crafted poetry as well, wonderful rhythmic verses that pull the reader further into the world of the Kid and Judge Holden. McCarthy's dense, loaded style can be a chore for the lazy reader, but the diligent eye will be delighted by the author's challenge, and rewarded, though thoroughly beaten, by the book's end.This book is beautiful in its writing, composition, and themes, yet it's challenging in these three aspects as well. The realism evident in McCarthy's work is striking, but definitely appreciated and refreshing in a world of muddled happy endings. Don't be scared off by the genre or challenging prose. Step up to the challenge and grab this book from the shelf-don't make the mistake I almost did; you'll be missing one of the more powerful works you have ever read."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This is an exceptional and disturbing work of fiction, my favorite kind. There were exceptional aspects to this work; the development of the character of Judge Holden, the vast journey and adventure into meaningless chaos, and the superb writing skills of McCarthy.First, the character of Judge Holden is a fascinating riddle. Judge Holden fiddles and dances nude. Is he Shiva, who dances on the skulls of mankind? Judge Holden appears to be a demi-god among lowly men, much like Hercules among the Argonauts (Harold Bloom's observation). He appears to be ageless and sleepless. When he speaks of war and mankind's tie to this blood ritual, he appears to be Ares, the Greek god of war. At other times he appears to be a dark avenging angel of God and at others the dark agent of the Devil. He is a dark anti-heroic character that speaks of mankind's need to fill the existential void of meaninglessness with a blood ritual, to flirt with the power of death, to bargain with death by sarifice of another victim. The Judge adopts a brain damaged idiot as his ape-like pet yet we feel that all ape-like mankind is the Judge's playground. There are few characters in literature that are as mysteriously and frighfully drawn as McCarthy develops the character of Judge Holden. He appears to be a human being but gradually as the story progresses he is revealed as something else, something very evil and yet something that exists in the hearts of men. Other characters are also well developed through their actions. Glanton, Brown, and Toadvine are born killers and they die by the sword. Jackson the Black is totally accepted into the group because he too is beyond remorse or compassion. There are two scenes where prejudicial statements are made about Jackson and the bigots are destroyed like bugs. Prejudice, bigotry, and sterotyping are more bound to social norms than is blood lust in this work and thus the murderers smash the bigot with the same glee that they would crush the country parson.Second, this is the classic journey novel, much like the Odessey or Jason and the Argonauts or Conrad's Heart of Darkness. A group of terrible killers work as scalp hunters, killing Indians of all tribes, genders, ages, and conditions in a blood-lust horror. Yet as they move from violent killing spree to horrid massacre, they dwindle in number and the protagonist, the Kid, reflects on the nature of this wild evil let loose on the world. The killing Glanton Gang is contrasted with village lowlife, very similar scum but with less imagination. Common villagers and settlers are no match for this senseless violence, primarily because they don't understand that it lacks both logic and compassion, therefore the plea for mercy is a joke, not a strategy for survival.As the Glanton's move to victimize village after village, tribe after tribe, I became very disturbed by the missing children (both boys and girls) in each settlement. Then it begins to dawn on you who is killing these children. Finally, Judge Holden becomes totally blatant about keeping a 12 year old Mexican girl as a sex slave with a dog collar around her neck and food scraps in her food bowl. Judge Blanton calls the Kid his son on several occassions, however the Kid has grown to know the evil he now faces and he knows that to be the Judge's son is to be his rape and murder victim.Third, this novel is beautifully written. The language ranges from poetic and archaic imagery to stark and economic descriptions of horror. The novel is full of words, rarely used in common language, that give the novel double meanings, mystery, and linkage to a mythological past. Whereas some critics link the novel to Melville and Faulkner, I found a common theme with Pat Barker's World War I Trilogy. This is especially true of the third book in the trilogy, The Ghost Road. In this novel the violence of World War I is seen as a blood ritual similar to the blood rituals of headhunters in New Guinea. Both Barker and McCarthy would seem to have us see war as blood ritual so that we can begin to understand the dark gods within ourselves whom we appease with sacrificial death.Dark novels are good teachers."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Those who have a difficult time getting through this book typically fail to grasp the meaning of the Judge's character and significant parts of the subtext. I found it helpful to come across an interpretation that the Judge is mankind-eternal, from humans' existence to its end. The Judge symbolizes man's determination to educate himself, categorize and control his surroundings, learn languages, history, art, philosophy etc etc. On the other hand the Judge symbolizes the absolute, basal violence that man is molded from, and is ever reverting to when confronted with even remote intimidation. McCarthy equates or describes his characters at least 7 or 8 times as ape-like. Man, no matter how evolved will always be a chest-pounding ape.A lot of people also have problems with the vocabulary and assert it is pedantic. I have to disagree. The vocabulary, while difficult, flows perfectly and is perfectly suited to balance out the reoccuring stories of violence. Furthermore, many of the obscure or antiquated words McCarthy uses have double meanings which make the text thicker and more interesting to delve into.This is my favorite book, ever. But don't turn to it to get inspired about the future of mankind."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Cormac McCarthy's &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; is one of the finest novels of the last twenty years. On the surface it is a perfect picture painted of the American south, set in the heart of the territory that the war with Mexico was fought over in the 1840s. At that time the population consisted of a volatile mixture of Native Americans, Mexicans, amd Americans, whose common mistrust and hatred led to a grotesque amount of bloodshed and sadness. The kid, the main character of McCarthy's novel, is born in 1833 and travels to Texas during the heat of the conflict. With no direction in life, and an attraction to violence and excitement, the kid falls in with the other most significant character, the judge, who's leading a ragged pack of Americans on an unofficial campaign against indians, paid by Mexican villages per scalp. McCarthy follows the warriors through silent travels and wild parties, blinding heat and blizzard snow, war and campfires. Behind the character of the judge lie Mcarthy's chief thematic concerns, the significance of &quot;Blood Meridian,&quot; beyond the beautifully terrifying surface story. The judge is at heart a characterization of manifest destiny. He is a concentration of the American push to expand, control, and take on, and mindset that was so prevalent during the era described in the novel, of which remnants remain today. The judge is a collector, saving everything of worthy consideration, destorying all evidence. He also kills without mercy and may participate in even darker activities. The judge is truly a frightening presense, one guaranteed to haunt the reader long after finishing the novel, especially in the the way he mirrors and epitomizes much of what has been and in some ways still is morally wrong with our society. McCarthy deals with thematic material besides manifest destiny, such as the notion of abstract thought. All the characters of &quot;Blood Meridian,&quot; from mules to the kid, fit into a hierarchy of the ability to use abstract thought. The animals, at one end, have very little control, the highest ranking animal being wolves, who men refuse to kill. Normal guys like the kid have some control over their destinies, but are at the mercy of those at the top of the hierarchy, like the judge. He dominates all those below him on the scale, which includes everybody. Other continums come into play besides that of thinking abstractly, such as nature vs. nurture, literal vs. abstract, good vs. evil, and black vs. white. Another vital thematic concern of McCarthy's that is revealed dramtically is the triangular relationship of action, witness, and victim. These three forces often rear their heads in congruency. The reader is made to feel like a fourth party in some scenes, most of which are violent, provided some insight into the thoughts of each party. &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; is such a dense book that one reading seems to merely skim the surface, and entire battles are won and lost in short paragraphs. It contains moments of violence so brutal one tries to wish it away, and descriptions of sunsets so clear that one feels as if they are trailing behind the men on the last horse as they wind through the endless desert. McCarthy has succeeded impressively with this work of literature, as it pulls the reader into an utterly gripping story, all the while warning them of a dangerous evil, one dramatized through the judge. I recommend &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; for its 337 pages of poetry, and the valueable lessons it holds. I only warn that the end result will be closer to revulsion and fright than happiness or pleasure."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Blood Meridianby Cormac McCarthyBlood Meridian, by Cormac McCarthy, is the most overwhelming novel I've read for years. I came late to it in two senses. It's almost 20 years since it was published in 1985, and it is late in my own reading life, because I'm 63. I read it on holiday. Not a comfortable choice, and certainly not the best thing to relax with on a sunlounger, while supping a drink with a hat on. But Blood Meridian is, at the risk of sounding pretentious, on a par with Faulkner's 'As I Lay Dying' or Beckett's 'Waiting For Godot' or even that most astounding work of all, 'King Lear'. High claims, but give it a try.You might well have to try it more than once, because it is very strong, and at times even rancid, meat. But a lot of people, after they've closed the book, might find they can't read another novel for a while.I finished the book, and picked up another. But the pages were slipping by and all my head could think on was Blood Meridian. So I did something I very rarely do. I put the other novel down and turned back to Blood Meridian, and read it again. It's a hell of a book. And I'm not speaking particularly metaphorically. It tells us more about the human condition than most other respectable works we laud so much. Blood Meridian is original, disturbing, heretical, challenging, difficult, and awe inspiring. Just like King Lear.Here endeth my rant."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I've read all of Cormac McCarthy's earlier books set in Tennessee, such as \\"The Orchard Keeper\\" and \\"The Outer Dark\\" and I've read his \\"Border Trilogy\\" which contained the wonderful, \\"All the Pretty Horses.\\" Nothing, however, that this wonderful author has written can prepare the reader for the sheer brutality and the sheer lyricism of \\"Blood Meridian.\\"The Old West portrayed in \\"Blood Meridian\\" is not the Old West of Zane Grey or even of Larry McMurtry. Images of the most horrific abound in \\"Blood Meridian,\\" (charred human bones, blood-soaked scalps, a tree hung with the bodies of dead infants), all rendered in McCarthy's gorgeously lyrical writing.As far as I'm concerned, \\"Blood Meridian\\" is McCarthy's best book, by far. It doesn't have the \\"feel good\\" qualities sometimes found in \\"All the Pretty Horses\\" but I didn't expect it to. \\"Blood Meridian\\" is the book in which McCarthy makes crystal clear the one theme that runs through all of his writing: the undeniable presence of evil in the world. The fact that he writes about this evil in language so lyrical and so elaborately beautiful only intensifies the horror of it all. We feel as though we have left the real world behind and entered into some surreal place from which no escape is possible.\\"Blood Meridian,\\" which takes place in 1847, is loosely based on actual events and is the story of a fourteen boy, known only as \\"the Kid.\\" Drifting through the American Southwest, the Kid joins a disparate and bloodthirsty band of Indian-hunters-for-hire led by a mysterious and learned man called, Judge Holden.It is after the Kid joins Judge Holden and his band that McCarthy really hits his stride. Juxtaposed next to descriptions of the most horrific and grotesque are images of the most sublime beauty. Consider this description of a group of Indians, \\"...wardrobed out of a fevered dream with the skins of animals and silk finery...one in a stovepipe hat and one with an umbrella and one in white stockings and a blood stained weddingveil.\\" That's prose most authors would kill for.McCarthy, unlike most writers who portray horror, concentrates not on the horrific images themselves, but on his characters' reactions to them. I'm not at all surprised at this, for McCarthy is not a horror writer; he is a writer of literature of the very highest order.Although many people would have expected McCarthy to keep his emphasis on the Kid, he chooses to concentrate on the character of Judge Holden instead. Anyone who has read this book knows it was a good choice for the Judge is the dominant personality in \\"Blood Meridian\\" and all the other characters in this book are defined only in relation to the Judge. It is also the Judge who exemplifies McCarthy's major themes and it is he (the Judge) who becomes a metaphorical and spiritual father to all of McCarthy's later characters.This is not a typical \\"Western novel,\\" not even a very, very good \\"Western novel.\\" In this book, the line between the victims the perpetrators of evil is subtlely drawn...if it is drawn at all. McCarthy seems to be telling us that all men are villains, all men are perpetrators, all men are bloodthirsty...if only the reward is high enough. And for some, evil, itself is its own reward.I am giving nothing away by saying that the ending of this book is a sophisticated and stylistic masterpiece involving both the Judge and the Kid. The last image we have of the Judge is one that epitomizes the sheer lunacy of the man. In a saloon where a trained bear dances on the stage, we see the Judge, \\"...naked, dancing...He says that he will never die.\\" In a beautiful and enigmatic epilogue, however, McCarthy skillfully denies the Judge the last word in the novel.This is a sophisticated and complex book, far more complex that it would appear on the surface or even after one reading. It is filled with the Faulknerian prose that has become a McCarthy trademark (though McCarthy employed it less in \\"The Border Trilogy\\"). These convoluted sentences, (in my opinion, far better than anything Faulkner ever wrote), can be difficult, since they contain within them the seed of all of McCarthy's writing.This brilliant novel is more than just a book; it is an experience. It is an experience of horror, of beauty, of the insanity of man. Set in a time when man attempted to sanctify himself in the blood of other men, this is, without a doubt the rawest exposition of horror I have ever read, yet, at the same time, it is probably the most beautiful book I have ever read as well. It is something that simply defies description. Read it for yourself and see."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I recently saw Harold Bloom, the famous literary scholar from Yale, on a television show where he stated that Blood Meridian was the greatest work of any contemporary American author. I agree. First, you have the prose style, which is so controlled and crafted and at the same time flows so naturally that it must have taken years to develop. It reminded me of the bible: hypnotic, enigmatic, ancient and at the same time, familiar. I kept thinking of the ocean when I was reading it because of the vastness of the landscape he describes. It seems as if the characters are on a journey, but they're not, unless they're circling further and further down into hell.I think the familiarity of the novel comes from it's relation to violence from a Christian standpoint. There's no doubt that McCarthy intends to have us react to this book from a moral perspective and yet at the same time be fascinated with it's violence. The setting, the wild wicked west, is a part of the American psyche that still takes forms today in our action films and tv shows that feed our hunger for blood and murder. By taking us back to our roots, stripping away the restraints of our Judeo-Christian values, MCCarthy steeps the story of death and evil in biblical prose and washes it with blood so that we see our dark selves reflected in all our ugliness.I compare this work to the works of the great Russian novelists ,Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, who always went for the big questions, What is life?, Who is God?, What is morality? and the American Moby Dick which encapsulated a universe. When you read books like these a lot of what appears on the bestseller lists seems so meaningless.This is a book you simply stand in awe of if you're a writer or ever thought of being one."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"his was one of those things where I'd heard about the book, in bits and pieces, for years: namechecked by William Gibson in Virtual Light and by Garth Ennis in Preacher, yapped about by online friends, and requested every so often by customers at the bookstore where I once worked.

So that's how I came to Blood Meridian - knowing the book by its notorious reputation alone and little else. Having finally finished it, I can say that its notoriety is richly deserved, but that's hardly the whole story.The premise could be described for the ADD among you as Huckleberry Finn meets Natural Born Killers, which hardly sounds flattering, I'm sure, but bear with me. The story opens on the peregrinations of the Kid, a vicious, knife-fighting fourteen-year-old runaway from Tennessee who in 1848 drifts down the Mississippi first to New Orleans and thence to Texas, where he falls in with a rogue Army unit making a piratical raid into Mexico. After Apaches wipe out the unit in the Sonora desert, the Kid lands in a Mexican jail, where he meets and is recruited by a group of bounty hunters retained by the government to collect Indian scalps as retaliation for a string of Apache massacres in remote border villages.Here is where the story really begins. The Kid is absorbed into the gang, a collection of opportunists, outlaws, drifters and psychopaths presided over by two domineering personalities: the nominal leader of the group, Ike Glanton, a mercenary ex-soldier with a nasty temper and a deep vein of sadism, and Glanton's advisor, the fat, hairless, urbane, and utterly mercurial Judge Holden. The gang finds an Indian tribe - not the marauders but a peaceful fishing village - and slaughters it utterly. But unable to catch the ever-elusive Apaches, the company elects to pursue easier prey; namely, the defenseless villages and mining camps littering the arid wastes of the Southwest. As their bounty hunt turns into a genocidal murder spree, the gang, and even Glanton, forget their simple mercenary aspirations and become increasingly captivated by the magnetism of the Judge, who tells them they are agents of a pitiless natural law, high priests sacrificing the undeserving to a blood-soaked pagan god.The Kid, his ego subsumed by the group organism, essentially disappears from the book as Glanton and the Judge assume center stage. Occasional chapters deal with other members of the gang - an apostate priest, a runaway slave - but their individuality is eventually consumed too. The narrative becomes increasingly distant and godlike - rather than seeing their surroundings through the eyes of the gang, we see the gang from the point of view of, for instance, the wind passsing through their camp. They go beyond a place where most readers could follow, so like elusive elementary particles, we have to look for understanding in the marks left by their passage.The book is a fantasia of luridly-described, Hammer-horror violence set against a landscape whose harsh geography is, like the wildernesses of the Bible or the open seas of Melvile, spiritual in nature as well as temporal, a place where men come to commune with higher or lower powers. In fact, as a quick glance at Amazon shows, it's nigh-on impossible to review this book without invoking Melville or the Bible. McCarthy's prose seems to have rumbled out of the hollow places of the earth itself; even his descriptions of innocuities like tumbleweeds and roadrunners can sound like passages from \\"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God.\\"Let me be clear: this book is not a \\"revisionist western.\\" It is not an apologia. McCarthy is not tut-tutting and bewailing the fate of the proud, noble Indian; in point of fact, many of the Indians in this book are as messed-up and psychopathic as the whites. His vision is bigger than that. He's talking about the nature of violence - the little stain of destructive insanity in all of us that is not adequately explained by genetics or psychology or class theory. Original sin, if you like. The problem, as McCarthy sees it, is not that white people are bad. It is not even that civilization is bad - the natives, as McCarthy reminds us, had a civilization too. The problem is that people have evil inside of them at a fundamental level, and when they're cut loose from their moorings and isolated in an unforgiving environment, that mindless, all-consuming blackness is free to bubble up to the surface.So yeah. The book is as dense and heavy-duty as it sounds - indeed, even at a slim 350 pages it's tough going. I had to take a couple of long breaks to cleanse my literary palate with lighter fare. But even so, I predict I will be coming back to Blood Meridian often in the future - like a pile of bloodsoaked treasure, there are ample rewards here for people willing to get their hands dirty, and like murder, it can only get easier with practice."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"BLOOD MERIDIAN is the story of &quot;The Kid&quot;, born in Tennessee in 1833, who decamps from the home of his drunken widower father and heads south. Illiterate and, at 14, already containing within him a taste for mindless violence,The Kid begins a journey reminiscent of Dante's descent into hell. This journey begins with a flatboat ride on the Mississippi -shades of Huck Finn - shades of the Styx river where Phlegyas ferries souls into a swamp and forces them overboard into the fifth circle of hell of the WRATHFUL. On the flatboat The Kid is shot in the back and the front and survives. His journey takes him to New Orleans, Texas and Mexico. He is a soldier, then a bountyhunting marauder led by one Glanton. Wolves, dogs, bats inhabit the McCarthy landscape but the greatest horror of all, is man. There seems no limit to the savagery men are capable of and there are many scenes to attest to that: &quot; The way narrowed through rocks and by and by they came to a bush that was hung with dead babies. They stopped side by side, reeling in the heat. These small victims, seven, eight of them, had holes punched in their underjaws and were hung so by their throats from the broken stubs of a mesquite to stare eyeless at the naked sky.&quot; (p57) The shock of this is helped by the contrast of the innocuous &quot;by and by&quot; with &quot;dead babies&quot;. One has to read it over because it seems unbelievable. One major theme of BLOOD MERIDIAN may be that &quot;moral law is an invention of mankind for the disenfranchisement of the powerful in favour of the weak&quot; (p250) and that man's purpose on earth is eventually to have domain over every living thing on it - man as wrathful destroyer. Towering over the novel is the figure of &quot;the judge&quot; - God or Devil - who in the end is still towering over all, who is dancing, dancing, and who says he will never die. A Western, and not a horror story, but a Western like none I have ever read. BLOOD MERIDIAN is filled with powerful and vivid images -&quot; far to the south beyond the black volcanic hills lay a lone albino ridge, sand or gypsum, like the black of some pale seabeast surfaced among the dark archipelego&quot; (p259) Because of this, it may be helpful to describe its &quot;mis en scene&quot; with reference to the cinema. An iconic Western film that represents a mythical West is SHANE with its noble hero, simple but decent homesteaders and postcard setting. UNFORGIVEN by Clint Eastwood is an alternative and revisionist view of that West where savagery and cruelty and stupidity prevail among the people. EL TOPO adds to the savagery with surreal Biblical references. BLOOD MERIDIAN reminds one in part of EL TOPO out of UNFORGIVEN except that its savagery and power goes way beyond either. We are in the realm of imaginative literature of a high order. McCarthy's style is self consciously literary from the opening words &quot; See the child.&quot; The Biblical poetic style is reinforced with an ironic reference on the opening page to the philosophy of poet William Wordsworth - the child is father of the man - where in Wordsworth the &quot;natural&quot; man was innocent and pure uncorrupted by urban development in the form of the Industrial Revolution. McCarthy turns this on its head where the &quot;natural child&quot; who could not read or write was like a savage beast. McCarthy's point might be that man NEEDS education, urban life, what we call &quot;civilisation&quot; to become truly human. What then are McCarthy's progenitors? The Bible. Swift. Dante. Neither uplifting nor enlightening, BLOOD MERIDIAN is an unrelenting descent into the darkest side of man. A fitting work to find its place in the 20th century, the century which gave full rein to the destructive possibilities of humans."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Other reviewers admonish to adapt Blood Meridian to film. This simply could not, and should not be adapted because this book's characters drool blood , and the violence here could not be aptly and fairly depicted on screen. If readers are not satisfied with the imagery ,and therefore crave to actually see this brutality on a screen before them, then McCarthy's vision of man as beast indeed can be verified. Blood Meridian is a partly historical account of the 19th-century westward movement and destruction of America's native people in America and Mexico by the bloodthirsty and goldthirsty and nihilistic Glanton Gang. The depiction of killing has scarcely been so graphic, and yet so alluring: you find yourself reading the horrifying scenes over and over again for their sublime description and almost dreamlike imagery. You have never seen nor imagined true Comanche Indian garb, and here it is. You have never read of a more evil character, and here you may, in Judge Holden. You have never read a novel whose main protagonist you almost forget exists, because of the book's other enticing components. And you have never imagined a sky this blood red, but remember: it was. Blood Meridian is McCarthy's masterpiece, and truly sets him apart as the late 20th Century's master of apocalyptic prose."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"While this book contains some of the most powerful writing of the 20th century, the book isn't for everyone. I've steered several of my 'frail' friends away from it, not everyone should be exposed to some of the scenes in here. But for those with the nerve to read it, this is as good as it gets. One of my 2 favorite books of all time (the other being 'Blood Sport' by Robert F. Jones). I won't try to add much to the details and descriptions other reviewers have listed here, but I will point you to the source material. Look for 'My Confession:Memoirs of a Rogue' by Samuel Chamberlain. Until I read 'My Confession', I didn't think there could be anything like 'Blood Meridian' anywhere in literature. There's no comparing the writing, McCarthy is simply the master in top form when he wrote Blood Meridian. On the other hand, Chamberlain lived thru the actual events described in both books, and adds some true to life details that fans of McCarthy's work may want to sift thru. I was shocked to find that The Judge is not a fictional character. In fact, McCarthy didn't take many liberties describing him. How could such a beast have escaped the scrutiny of history? Where did he go, what became of him? Is he still out there, drawing artifacts and then tossing both the drawing and artifact into the flames, dancing the fandango or playing the violin, roasting innocent passersby over a small fire?"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Reading Cormac McCarthy at his best isn't really entertainment or pleasure or any other description one would normally apply to a novel, it is more like an experience. Like a dream or a hallucination, it becomes part of your subconscious; it resides in you. Unlike other novels, even very good ones, it is not something that you can simply pick up and set down at your leisure, it is something that takes control of you: it moves you, it alters you in some way, it makes your mind reel. Blood Meridian is McCarthy at his best.The story is about a character known only as the kid. It takes place on the North American continent and begins in 1849, when the kid is sixteen years old, and the United States of America not much older. He runs away from his barren Tennessee home, and fights his way to New Orleans and then to Texas where he hooks up with a gang of Yankee marauders. Before they have a chance to maraud anything, they are slaughtered by the Comanches. The kid somehow escapes, and eventually joins a band of scalp-hunters. The bulk of the novel is comprised of his adventure with these brutal men, who make their living by killing and scalping Apache Indians in northern Mexico.In the hands of a less-skilled author, the subject matter alone would make this novel hugely compelling, but McCarthy's skill is such that you feel like you're part of it. His style is the spare, observant style similar to Hemingway: you see, you feel, you smell, and you hear, but beyond that, you are an observer: nothing more.But McCarthy doesn't simply lead the proverbial horse to the proverbial water, oh no. His descriptive power, almost poetic in its eloquence, is such that you are shoved into the water, kicked into the water, almost drowned in the water. The men are marching, on horseback, single-file, along the side of a mountain. To their right is sheer rock, to their left, a sheer drop: \\" . . . they lost one of the mules. It went skittering off down the canyon wall with the contents of the panniers exploding soundlessly in the hot dry air and it fell through sunlight and through shade, turning in that lonely void until it fell from sight into a sink of cold blue space that absolved it forever in the mind of any living thing that was.\\" Note that this description--though of a relatively minor event--is so finely, carefully, even poignantly observed, it becomes truly, emotionally wrenching. There are examples of this kind of thing on practically every page.The Comanche attack on the kid's company early in the novel is so vividly and horrifically portrayed it is beyond the stuff of nightmare, with, \\"the horseman's faces gaudy and grotesque with daubings like a company of mounted clowns, death hilarious, all howling in a barbarous tongue and riding down upon them like a horde from hell . . .\\" There's a lot more, before and after, and it goes on for pages. Prepare to feel your heart pound and your hands tingle, and while you're at it, throw away everything you ever thought you knew about cowboys and Indians. It turns out you don't know a thing.Interestingly, the scalp-hunter story is based on truth. Their leader really was a fellow named Glanton, they really were paid by the Mexicans to kill Apaches, they really did become killers of anything with black hair that moved, and they really were ambushed by Yuma Indians and butchered. All is recounted here.The dehumanizing effect of this on the men, though, is all McCarthy, and as his is wont, he takes it a little too far. For there is another character--a purely fictional character-- who accompanies the men on their rampages and who is called the Judge. Through him, McCarthy gives himself the opportunity to philosophize rather baldly on the beastly, warlike nature of man and other Important Themes. This kind of thing put a dent in Pretty Horses, sank The Crossing, and is completely unnecessary: we get it.Here, though, it is only a minor irritant. This is a splendid, hugely imaginative, gripping novel. Do not miss it."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Cormac McCarthy is our most talented fiction writer and this is his best work. From his initial effort, The Orchard Keeper, which justifiably won the Faulkner Award, through his Border Trilogy (also justifiable honored with the National Book Award), McCarthy has practiced his craft with literary genius and a painful, searing perspective of the American soul. We have a violent past, the product of a violent streak in our character, and McCarthy explodes that violence on the landscape of the Mexican-U.S. border of the 1850's. The reader delves into the lower reaches of human desolation, hoping to eventually see the light reaching back towards the surface but always turning into a chamber that leads further down into renewed horror and degeneracy, each level a new incarnation of this Western Inferno. The fact that McCarthy can evoke beauty and nuance even amidst this unrestrained human carnage is supreme testament to his skills as an artist. This read is a challenge to the willing - as any approach to great art must be. However, it is well worth the effort with its reward of fantastic panoramas of man's descent into a chaotic state, evil outside the metering bounds of civilization, horrifying in its stark portrayal of the dark side of our national character."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I was directed to Blood Meridian quite by accident, and opened the novel with no idea of its contents. What I found was an unforgiving and towering vision of human cruelty. Cormac McCarthy's text is thoroughly unsentimental, laying out the harsh landscape and times of the 1850's U.S./Mexican border wars with a cascading series of unfogettable images. At no time does the book allow the reader into the minds and hearts of its characters- we are forced to live as they do: mystified and terrorized by the scale of unending destruction and carnage the novel describes.But the book is much more a than historical novel. Blood Meridian is the story of an innocence lost- an innocence not of single character in the book (none there would admit to naivete), but lost by the whole of mankind. In the character of Judge Holden, Cormac McCarthy gives us the final outcome of man's thirst for knowledge and experience: the elegant sadist. All things are known unto him, and (once known) may not exist without his consent. The judge gathers the facts of his world coolly and precisely- but he does not store them to create. He gathers them simply to show the ownership and stewardship of his world, of himself and all creation. As all things are known, so are they destroyed- as lightly and as simply as their weight and measure has been taken. His knowledge is the deepest knowledge of all: the hollowness of his own heart. In this way he is the horrible (and logical) product of Adam's first taste of the Tree of Knowledge.The language of this novel is a delight, both exacting and all encompassing, and the details of its descriptions are shared with a carnal glee. The amazing work of McCarthy's text is that it calls to be devoured, and eaten whole. It's no accident that the reader feels a partipant in the predatory cycles of the world of novel- and it is only after he has eaten that he realizes what it is he is digesting."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"If you are new to McCarthy, then this is not the place to start - read The Road or No Country for Old Men first to see if you like his style and storytelling. If you are familiar with McCarthy, however, and enjoy his dark side, then this is definitely for you.It took me two attempts to finish Blood Meridian. I had previously read No Country for Old Men and The Road and McCarthy quickly caught my attention as a writer with almost limitless virtuosity and imagination. Unlike the former two, however, Blood Meridian has no moral compass, but the first third of the book had so much going on that I didn't notice. After that section, the moral emptiness became too apparent and I couldn't keep a foothold. It wasn't that I needed a \\"good guy\\" to vicariously experience the story through; rather, it was so contrary to the modern world that I find myself in and so different than any other book that I've read, that my attention and suspended imagination began to wane and the book found itself back on the shelf marked halfway.Over a year went by, however, and I picked it back up. I was determined to finish it this time - fully aware of my failed first attempt. This time I tried to read it for what it was - what it had to be. When I broke through the divide, I discovered so much more than I had ever expected to find. It was like a veil had been lifted from my eyes and I was able to stare into nature's eclipse - raw, naked, indifferent. There was no redemption, but this book was important for me. It brought me to the edge of a lucid nightmare and back. The kind of nightmare where you know it isn't real, but this knowledge can't alleviate or detach you from the horror and the only way for it to stop is to see it through to the end. It changed my worldview and from that point onward I doubt I'll ever be able to think of it as merely a book on a shelf again - it was an experience, a journey, a perpetual realization of man and nature in their ancient forms. Needless to say, it was a hell of a lot to take in and as is typical with McCarthy, certainly open to numerous interpretations. In the end, I'm glad I made the journey.This book is bound to offend many and others will dismiss it even if they acknowledge its literary achievement. On the other hand, there will be many, like me, who it will violently strike in the stomach with a clenched fist, but as they gasp for air, it will smell sweeter and pure and they will be stronger for it."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Going into Blood Meridian, Cormac McCarthy's 1985 novel, I was well aware of its notorious reputation for extreme violent content; having, in recent months, already experienced the sometimes disturbing imagery of the stark modern western No Country For Old Men (2005), the post-apocalyptic The Road (2006), and the gritty \\"Border Trilogy\\" (1992's All The Pretty Horses, 1994's The Crossing, and 1998's Cities Of The Plain), I thought I could just prepare myself for anything.The bulk of the story is set along the Texas-Mexico border circa 1850, and it concerns a teenage runaway from Tennessee -- known simply as \\"the kid\\" -- who takes up with a company of scalp-collectors led by Captain John Joel Glanton and the mysterious, hulking albino Judge Holden. This rather thin and meandering plot almost gets lost in thick tangles of relentlessly and almost oppressively ugly description -- I often found myself re-reading passages multiple times just to figure out what had just happened or who was saying what (as McCarthy tends not to set off his usually spare dialogue with quotation marks). Plus, there are no particularly sympathetic characters for us to root for throughout: Though we see the majority of the action through the kid's eyes, he is basically a cipher; and while the judge is probably the most interesting and fully developed character here, he only becomes more frightening and repulsive as more aspects of his personality are revealed.On the surface, this would be merely a depressing symphony of bloodletting, brain matter, bones, bodily wastes, nudity, corpses, filth, scalpings and other mutilations, and (so help me) cruelty to animals. But there seems to be more going on here that makes this strangely compelling... For one thing, especially in the later chapters, every single time I felt myself growing numb to the violence and ugliness, and I thought McCarthy had gone as far as he could possibly go, something else even more brutal and gruesome would always come along to shock and shake me. Plus, as unbearable as that could've been, I think it helps that McCarthy's idiosyncratic prose style is so matter-of-fact and yet so poetic throughout, his narrative seems devoid of moral judgment and emotional excess -- it simply paints pictures in your head for you to interpret and feel about however you see fit.More importantly, I don't think there would be much point in subjecting yourself to all this stuff if it weren't meant to open your eyes to some often-ignored historical events (specifically in America's westward expansion); and indeed, I wonder if McCarthy had just grown disenchanted with the romance and mythology of the western genre, and thus decided to strip them away and say, \\"Folks, this is how it really was in that time and place, and it wasn't pretty.\\" And furthermore, I wonder if McCarthy was trying to provoke people with this material -- deliberately pushing the envelope with it just to pose the question, \\"What's more obscene, my graphic language or the fact that stuff like this actually happened in history?\\"Bottom line: Though widely acknowledged as a modern classic, this is not the first Cormac McCarthy novel I would recommend to anybody. But if you have already read at least one other of his books and are familiar with his unique style -- as well as his unflinching depictions of dark subject matter -- I think you might find Blood Meridian a wrenching but rewarding piece of work."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"First off, a big screw you to Harold Bloom, who on the very first page of the introduction tells you what happens at the end.Ok, ok Harry, nobody doubts that you read it, but do you have to go and give it all away? Prick.He doesn't give it all away, there's so much more here then just a prelude to the conclusion. I'm not going to tell you what happens at the end because I'm not a dick, but I will tell you not to read the intro if you want to preserve the integrity of the powerful ending.I'm also not going to bore you with a synopsis or recycled analysis. There's been plenty of those already. I will tell you this though, it's not a casual, fluffy read. Cormac has a bit of an idiosyncratic writing style that doesn't immediately engage the reader, more likely then not deliberate as it compliments the overall theme and mood. He's also deceptively dense, using a masterful command of nuance and subtlelty to convey greater meaning in concise articulation. Nothing is superficial here, and in order to get the most out of it you need to show the writing proper respect by giving it your undivided attention.As a special aside, if there are any high school kids out there who got sent to the school psychologist because you wrote a dark story for english class, bring a copy of this book along to the meeting. When they ask what's wrong with you, whip out this book and ask why it is that when you write a dark story they call it psycho, but when McCarthy does, they call it genius.Disturbingly brilliant."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Wow! Upon finishing this book I Immediately went to the computer and began to research the story. I actually could not believe that what I had just read was even possible to achieve and I needed to know more. Most importantly, who and what was the Judge? Judge Holden is based on Shiva Nataraja, the Hindu God of Dance, representing creation and destruction and whose purpose is to release men from the illusion of the idea of \\"self\\" and of the physical world. And to my shock and surprise, the story is based on true events that took place in the southwest borderlands during the mid 19th century. The Glanton gang and their exploits are fairly well documented. As soon as I had some insight into the characters and story I picked it back up and read it again. This book is extreme, as it needs to be, the events depicted are influenced by war, genocide and survival. Even so, McCarthy paints fantastically beautiful imagery with his prose, he gives a complex and provocative sermon about the nature of man, also an all too important history lesson that gives attention to the world we live in today.--jAMES"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This is the most fascinating and absorbing novel about the American west that I have ever read. It follows the adventures of \\"the kid\\", an unnamed young man who, after a few brief preliminary adventures, joins a group of men who are riding into Mexico for plunder. McCarthy bluntly and without diffidence or delicacy describes exactly what they do and what happens to them, though occasionally he achieves a subtly powerful effect by collapsing a series of similar incidents into a passing phrase that by its seemingly casual, everyday quality is all the more striking. Consequently, the book tears the roof off of the cliches of the \\"western\\" novel. There are no noble frontiersmen or evil Indians here -- just warriors, some fighting for their people, others for themselves, as it no doubt was in reality.The one arguably unrealistic character in the book is the Judge, who serves as McCarthy's philosophical mouthpiece. He is an incredibly educated man who seems to know a fair amount about any subject that comes up, and is completely amoral and self-serving. He makes a grand entrance early in the book by denouncing a traveling preacher as a fraud, a child molester, and a zoophilist, only to admit after escaping the resulting gunfight and fire that he'd never seen or heard of the man before. A few hundred pages later, the Judge delivers the speech that is perhaps the novel's centerpiece, an explanation of war as the profession that is at the heart of all other professions, the one eternal constant of human life. (I daresay Heraclitus would have approved.)Aside from the story itself, Blood Meridian is also remarkable for McCarthy's magnificently eloquent prose style.

This is the most testosterone-laden book I have read. The main characters of this book make television's Tony Soprano - a self-admitted sociopath - a pussycat.But, McCarthy can write. He uses a simplistic style of writing with powerfully driven words -- often tripping the reader as his vocabulary is almost the antithesis of his characters: complex versus simple.Johnny Cash once wrote in a song that \\"he killed a man just to see him die.\\" That is what happens constantly throughout 300+ pages of this book.And, who is the evilest of the evil? A lawyer. In Hollywood, producers and directors constantly aim to label attorneys or lawyers as the most pathetic characters.

The portraits he paints of scene and deed are unrivaled; such violence portrayed so eloquently reveals again McCarthys gift for description. The character development is masterful, and the themes presented herein flash through one's mind years later. This book forces us to consider evil, authority, and perhaps divinity anew and is as beautiful as it is powerful. In my estimation this is McCarthy's greatest work to date, and I find it no surprise that this novel was his first to be inducted into the Modern Library.

I was sorry the experience was over. The lyric quality that McCarthy writes with is totally engaging. I was struck by what this novel had to say on the human condition, about what part we play in our own destinies, and what the end result of evolution might be.

This book kicks you in the gut and challenges you intellectually to keep up with the poetry of the wordscapes. If he would only make nice, Cormac McCarthy would sell a trillion books. But life isn't always nice and you'll thank yourself for the treat of reading this tome."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I read a lot.

But damn it is good writing and storytelling."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This is one of the most powerful books I have read; it locked me in during each of my readings. The language itself is onomatopoetic - it is sharp, dry, brittle, and panoramic. I was struck by how effectively McCarthy captured the essence of the southwest landscape by his use of language. The story itself is one we must absorb to know who we are as a people. Horrific, epic, and yet commonplace, the subjugation of the American land and its people by the Europeans has been nowhere better revealed. And the story telling... I could sit at McCarthy's feet for hours to listen to his stories. They are grand and stretch the limits of imagingation without losing the verisimilitude which would make us disbelieve. This book is a challenge, but worth it."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"McCarthy's prose traverses the edge of an alien and cruel frontier. It is populated by beings who are beasts in the image of men, traveling lands of baked dust, bleached bones and remorseless homicidal lust. It is a surreal dream scape, iridescent and nightmarishly beautiful, that might have been wrought on a planet without the verdancy and development of our own-- where the arid and primitive panorama reflects the condition of the soul. Blood here is avatar and seal. But we know this is our planet and this is our history.The language, imagery and nihilistic architecture of Blood Meridian evoke Conrad and Camus. --But--. Is there the same level of allegory and metaphor in this book? Compare it to Camus's survival in a plague-ridden city, Conrad's mission to the dark heart of Kurtz's jungle, Melville's search for the nemesis of Ahab. All of these books are of profound manifestations of spiritual affliction and internal conflict. All richly evoke the ambiguity and contrast of moral dilemma and hubris. I'm not sure the same compass and standard exist here. There is a brilliant exposition of landscape and conflict, objectively presented-- but I remain unmoved by the blind bloodshed, overwhelmed and uninvolved. The characters are specters of banal and simple violence. This could be a book which will live well past our age. It might be a book of our age. It is certainly a book worth reading for its stunning and original use of language and imagery-- but its company with the classics of modern literature might also have been prematurely bestowed."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I much enjoyed &quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot; and &quot;The Crossing&quot; and in those there was the hint of the violence that is the centerpiece, the driving energy, in &quot;Blood Meridian&quot;. The violence in the former two novels was, however, artfully forged. In the later the violence is wanton, crude, cruel and of mythical proportions. But maybe that was Mr. McCarthy's intent. Nonetheless the violence is overdone. Beyond the violence, and again this was seen in the other McCarthy works cited above though more artfully done, one gets tired of the endless parade of similes. In fact the similes become so tedious (though beautifully descriptive)they are predictable -- which isn't saying too much as the similes appear in every other paragraph. I don't know what role an editor plays in editing the work of an established author but &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; could have used a bit. As a positive Mr. McCarthy does have a well developed, poetic style of describing 'the country' that is, in my opinion, unsurpassed. If he would just tone down the over use of similes."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"At every town along the way, a little girl goes missing. No one escapes the filibuster. There was once a traveler in the woods, murdered by a jealous man, orphaning an only son. Their fates are known, and if unknown, still predestined toward annihilation. They are the dancers, and war is their dance. The judge never sleeps. He says that he will never die.These are the windows which divide the light and dark of Blood Meridian. The entire story wrapped, crystallized and ultimately made vital by these fragments. Along the way, the glistening hues of an apocalyptic desert make the Earth alien and unknowable, like the hearts of the men we follow. If any of them exist beyond the narrow confines provided them by the author, we never glimpse a hint. They are sad, lonely beings that ride the highs and lows of feeling. Here we have not one, but a world of Camus's strangers.And round and round the story turns on the Judge, who is everything on which this book depends. He breathes life into the wastes, and secretly, we are ashamed of ourselves for being happy at the end that he remains. So dismal and dark are the work's opening chapters that we begin the book hoping to see a little action, and by the time Judge Holden steps onto the horizon, we hope only for a little light. And light does he provide. His rambling jargons are set so starkly embossed against the endless landscapes that they become lucid less by their intrinsic meaning, than in their validating our desire for meaning to coexist in them.But more obsessing, and impossible to derive, is the book's protagonist, the Kid. In him we find no trace of uniqueness until the closing of the book, when the Judge elevates him above all others, to stand, I suppose, as a Straw Man proving man's ultimate un-worth. The Kid, I think, is meant as some sort of Grand Innocent swept up in events beyond his control. But if that is so, then why should we lend him our faith or empathy? By the end, he has proven nothing but his own obstinacy, refusing to kill the Judge when finally the decision-making hour has arrived.Indeed, where the Kid remains enigmatic, the Judge finds full actualization. He stands for something primal, and in that way, connects. Of course his finest literary companion would be Milton's Satan, charming even the reader before he reveals his duplicity. Yet, here we find no opposition in kind, no argument for goodness. Indeed, the enigma the Kid represents finds itself expressed, in part, in his conspicuous sameness. He never finds what he seeks, and perhaps Cormac McCarthy's point is made fine by such allusion.After all, the book which most prominently validated Blood Meridian, was Golding's Lord of the Flies. Indeed, the best summary is, \\"It's Lord of the Flies for grownups\\" - yet, though the violence has grown, and we no longer need the clever artifice of an island, we find the same lurking trickery. No one can escape, as Golding's boys cannot. Ralph and the Kid equally represent indecision, not light, or right. Neither book can explain with any deftness why some do not revel in destruction.Which leads to the great tragedy of Blood Meridian. Though we find in no other book Evil better explained, and the demonic natural force which grips even the most peaceful minds illuminated, we find no explanation for good, no advocate or standard bearer. Simon's character is notably absent from Blood Meridian. Sure, we have Ralph in the Kid, and even Piggy in the Expriest, but no character with vision beyond the filibuster.Yet, Blood Meridian is still great fiction, for the Judge allows it greatness. Though one wishes something rose just beyond the epilogue, some suzerain like God Himself, McCarthy chose to exclude one, and we must respect the decision. His epilogue does energize, but through language alone. Its inclusion is a mistake I think, a dry and perfunctory hopefulness as if we require our heads patted at the end, because maybe some new Prometheus might rise on our behalf.But the truth is that we are the dancers and this is the dance. And War shall never be dishonored among men, and so McCarthy should have ended with the Judge, the greatest dancer of them all, driving back the day, and harkening our night."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Cormac McCarthy is exactly as good as the critics say he is. Having said that, his writing style is challenging and his books aren't for everyone.This book specifically is an amazing and beautiful indictment of violence, especially American violence.While the settings are similar, this is not the Border Trilogy; this is something else.

But I can attest that, for my money, no book has ever affected me so deeply.

This is a book that scholars will be talking about for years to come. With that being said though, I would not recommend it to everyone.BLOOD MERIDIAN is bloody, as its name would suggest. It's vulgar, disgusting, gritty, foul, and horrifying. The spare, minimal style in which it is written can be unappealing to some readers. The pacing varies wildly, at one point, several years travel between two paragraphs. There doesn't seem to be any good guys or strong protagonists. Conversations alternate between broken English, light Spanish, and grunts. For all of these reasons, BLOOD MERIDIAN can be a tough recommendation. If the reader can overcome some of these \\"obstacles,\\" the novel is a very rewarding read.There are times (particularly in the first half) where the book feels aimless and bleak, but the final third of the book more than makes up for any reticence I had in reading BLOOD MERIDIAN. I can't stress enough that the ending of this book is what makes it work -- without it, most of the book comes across as mean-spirited and unnecessarily violent. The ending constitutes what I have found to be one of the best literary experiences I've come across. The final chapters are haunting; they are so filled with ideas that, once I put the book down, I couldn't wait to hear what other people's experiences were like. The themes of this book are as sprawling as its narrative, ranging from good vs. evil, violence, war, human existence, religion, futility, and American expansionism.Although this book is considered \\"Western,\\" I don't think I would recommend it to fans of the genre. Instead, I would suggest this book to anyone who loved McCarthy's THE ROAD, or even Melville's MOBY DICK."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This book was difficult to read but impossible to put down.

Judge Holden is evil incarnate, a hairless towering Kurtz-like giant facilitating the origin and endgame of human iniquities. Intense."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This book appeared on my shelf. I know my bookshelf, but I do not know how Blood Meridian got there. When I started reading it, I found myself rereading entire pages as soon as I'd finished them. The language is breathtaking. The descriptions of the landscape and horrific events are so thrilling and complex that every time you re-read a sentence you can unpack more of it, make another discovery about its flow and meaning. The narrative is so dense that it's almost a solid object. It took a long time for me to finish the book, and now I can't get it out of my mind and I cry very easily over it. Weird. I guess that's called reverberation, so if you like that after you read a book, read Blood Meridian now."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"McCarthy is the Gold Medalist of all modern writers. Blood Meridian is shocking inthe level of violence. Soon you are used to a construction of the world far different than any of us know. The dream and the timelessness are critical. Many such bands of rapist murderous thugs are roaming the planet today. Only the now call themselves Freedom Fighters or God's Liberation army. McCarthy's band needed no justification. They just murdered to fulfill a desire to murder."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I think it was three times that I started reading Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy and then had to put it down because I could not digest it. The fourth time I did, I followed through and finished it. This is not a Western, although it takes place in the Old West, and it is the kind of book whose story goes beyond its pages and reminds you of what you are--even if you don't like what you see: At the core of this tale is the nature of man, it is cruel and violent and poised to create conflict(some have called it war-like). I have since read other McCarthy books but none have matched the intensity here.Language: The language attacks you. It is an intense experience to read a sentence with a brutal subject (like the gory killing of Native American babies) that continues on and on, with no diminishing. The first thing I noticed about this book is that its sentences are not constructed to tell a story, they flow like blood.\\"See the child\\" is the first sentence and it describes the only aspect of the main character, the kid, that is innocent, his youth. But very quickly this changes and the kid is thrust upon a landscape that is barren and unforgiving. You can read this in many ways, as a metaphor of the violent growth of the United States of America, or as the descent of man from the innocence of childhood to his end as a fully grown, and very sinful, creature of war.Violence: The situations described while following the Glanton Gang give you a greater appreciation for the type of violecne that existed during this period of time, so we can say that it is part of the novel's setting. This is not stylized violence, the type of stuff seen in Hollywood Westerns like 3:10 to Yuma, but it is the grotesque thing, real and gritty like the landscape, unhindered by language or any Victorian sentiments held by the author. No one could glorify what McCarthy portrays so it does a service to any fool who thinks that becoming an outlaw or a killer is a postive thing.Characters: Glanton and the Judge are the two most intriguing characters in the novel and the kid is the perfect window to them. The author does not try to get you to like his leading boy and he does not try to redeem the gang. This is unlike many other books written about this period that include outlaws you end up liking in the end. You dislike the Judge and what he is the same way you are disgusted by Glanton and his decisions. There is no redemption here, no wasted attempt at shedding light where there are only monstrosities.Overall: A superior book in that it reaches far beyond the limits of its pages. I will admit that this is not the type of book that ought to be given to a minor, but an adult with all his/her faculties will enjoy the challenge that this book poses--because the lack of quotation marks and such will put some off. This is American literature at its best.LC"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Like all great books, \\"Blood Meridian\\" receives no attention from the general public, probably because it hasn't been made into a movie yet. That's a shame, because I think this book is better than \\"The Road.\\"McCarthy is careful not to glorify the history of the American West. Perhaps he sees nothing glorious or heroic about it; the '50s idealism of John Wayne and Gary Cooper lost on him amidst the ugliness of \\"The Wild Bunch\\" or Clint Eastwood's \\"Unforgiven.\\"I've heard that a lot of people have a hard time following or understanding this book. In \\"On Writing,\\"Stephen King admits he understood little of this book (but loved it anyway). I'm not sure what was so difficult about it. The plot is rather straightforward. The language can get heavy at times, and if you don't read this book with a pocket dictionary nearby a lot of it will fly over your head.The ending of this book is vague, and deliberately so. What happens to the Kid, the main protagonist, is mainly left to the reader's imagination...except that it's not really. Like the last scene of the last episode of The Sopranos, you feel like you get a sense of what has happened once the thing is over, whether or not you picked up on all the symbolism. I left Blood Meridian \\"knowing\\" what happened. Like all good writing, it uses a little bit of suggestive imagery and leaves the reader to fill in the rest. For that reason, no two readers will ever describe this book the same way."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Do not be fooled by the end of the book. Read the end, reread it, read it again and again. Think about the ending and then compare the ending to the personalities of the characters throughout the book. You may think differently about the ending than the typical belief. I personally drove an entire senior level college English literature class into a frenzy for two sessions over my disagreement with the ending. By the time we finished the discussion of the ending, all but two people were able to see it my way, not completely, but were leaning more towards my objection to actually who was the lone survivor of the outhouse. Please, really read this, slowly, and think about it. I can pretty much guarantee you it will open your eyes to other possibilities."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This is some of the best writing I have ever run into. Incredible! Different. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"In many years of reading and writing, I have never read a novel by a contemporary author and then gone out and purchased five other novels of that same guy. And continued to be amazed, novel after novel. Cormac McCarthy is up there with Samuel Beckett as that unusual modern novelist. He dosen't give interviews, do books reviews, teach writing classes; he's isolated, serious, successfully creating an individual world no one ever dared dream of inventing, and where followers would get lost in his wasteland, just as with Beckett. And God does he have language. If &quot;Art is reality seen through a unique perspective&quot;, then read this or any of his books. Other novelists seem to be playing it awfully safe compared to him."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"McCarthy certainly writes like no one else, and in my view, can write more beautifully than anyone else when he wants to. Although I enjoyed The Road, I didn't feel his skills were on full display; same for No Country For Old Men. Both are written in a simpler, more direct style, with less description and easier vocabulary. They are stories. But if you liked the style of All The Pretty Horses--a true masterpiece, I thought--or The Crossing, you'll appreciate the style he employs in Blood Meridian. Riveting passages of vivid, almost surreal beauty. If you fancy yourself a writer, you may read these pages and just throw up your hands--we will never approach this level.All that being said, there's one big difference between All The Pretty Horses and Blood Meridian. The former is not only beautifully written, but notwithstanding several very memorable scenes of graphic violence, leaves an impression of intense romanticism. Not so Blood Meridian. Most, if not all, of McCarthy's novels involve violence--we think of the protagonist in No Country being chased by a homicidal psychopath with an air gun, or cannibalism in The Road--but this is easily the most unremittingly violent and dark novel I've ever read. Moreover, unlike All The Pretty Horses, for example, in which there are characters with honor and nobility--some who make a point of it--everyone in Blood Meridian is bloodthirsty.Believe me, I'm not the least bit squeamish or prudish, I don't mind violence, and I don't demand that characters in books be \\"good\\"--not at all--but this is an extreme case. I have to say, after a couple of hundred fascinating pages, I was beginning to feel almost queasy. I know, this sounds almost precious, as though I like reading Victorian morality tales and playing badminton, but I've never had an experience quite like this--an extraordinarily well-written book that overwhelms with amorality. Not that I was tempted to stop reading--oh, no, it's gripping, alright--or regretted reading it. It's great, but it's a dark journey."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"In Blood Meridian, Cormac McCarthy has singlehandedly destroyed all of our stereotypes of the Wild West. John Wayne and his jingoistic flag waving would have no place here. Neither would the ecologicaly friendly, noble natives of Dances With Wolves. Almost every character in this novel is a ruthless killer or a hapless victim. The setting of Blood Meridian is a violent purgatory where white man and red revel in monstrous acts of barbarism. Human life is worth only the price an Indian scalp will bring in Mexico, or the glory a white scalp will bring to a warrior.What is most frightening of all is that it is based on true events. This is probably the most accurate fictional depiction of life in the west of the late 1840s that we have seen to date. Read John Sepich's Notes On Blood Meridian and see for yourself. Blood Meridian is not a book for all readers. It is certainly the most masculine novel I have ever read. Women and sensitive male readers will probably revile it, and it is a truly brutal story, but I have to admit reading this novel with great excitement. I could not put it down. I have read it 3 times in the last 5 years. I guess that this story forces each of us to look into their own &quot;heart of darkness&quot;, and admit that there is something deep in the human soul that thrills to primal savagery. Peckinpah fans will love it. All in all, the beautiful language, the vivid descriptions, the vicarious violence and the colorful characters make Blood Meridian an unforgettable reading experience... If you've got the guts.A couple of points of interest. I have seen an item on the internet saying Tommy Lee Jones is working on a movie adaption of Blood Meridian, in which he will star and direct. I do not know if this is just a rumor, or if anyone can do Blood Meridian justice now that Sam Peckinpah and Sergio Leone are dead, but I am still hoping it is true. (Mr. Jones, if you ever read this, may I suggest the band 16 Horsepower for the musical score.)Also, for those of you who wonder about the character of Judge Holden, here is a quote from a Texas State Historical Association website on Samuel Chamberlain, the man whose memoir, My Confession, inspired McCarthy to write Blood Meridian: &quot;In fact, many people who are skeptical of Sam's account believe that Judge Holden was a character that Sam inserted into his story as an afterthought because he needed a villain that would outweigh even the evil Glanton. Some people think that Judge Holden was modeled after one of the Harvard geologists named Nathaniel Southgate Chaler because Sam after the Mexican War lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and was familiar with many Harvard professors.&quot;"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Why I read...- To be entertained, have fun, be scared, laugh or anything of the like.- I want to fly through a book and not want to put it down...lots of action/adventure/mystery.- I want to feel like I'm there in the story with the other characters...I want to know them and understand them and like them.- I want to be able to read a book while the TV is on and the kids are playing in front of me and for me not to even notice...In terms of this book I could be all by myself in my room with no one home and it was hard to focus on the story.I don't read to unearth great literature or nitpick if the prose is this or if the plot is that.

And yes, the influences of Faulkner and Malcolm Lowry are evident: Both stylistically and thematically. But really, the impression left upon one, as noted by Alan Cheuse of the USA Today, is ultimately a visual one, rendered in passages of puisssant descriptive lyricism, reminiscent of the medieval paintings of Hieronymous Bosch. Anyone who has spent any deal of time absorbing these paintings and their twisted, dark visions of various forms of baroque grotesqueries and human depradations cannot help but feel a similar chord being struck in the reading of this work. The question the wonder at both these works poses to anyone drawn into deep contemplation of them is: What sort of world is this?Indeed, is this the \\"real\\" West of the time, despite its being loosely based on historical fact?-One wonders-The point is that this is not exactly \\"realistic\\" fiction. Rather, it is quite the opposite. In its essence, it is a visionary novel. -- Does anyone believe that a character such as The Judge, in all his omniscience and archetypal dancing immortality ever existed as described here? - No, this book, again presents us with with a certain VISION of the world, and that vision, as in Bosch, is irremediably bleak.As the \\"expriest\\" says, \\"But someplace in the scheme of things this world must touch the other.\\"-This book, I would posit, is a verbal landscape of that place. Can we give this place a name?: With a nod to Dante, other reviewers have compared it to both The Inferno and The Purgatorio.- But as The Judge puts it, \\"The truth about the world...is that anything is possible. Had you not seen it all from birth and thereby bled it of its strangeness it would appear to you for what it is...a fevered dream, a trance bepopulate with chimeras having neither analogue or precedent....whose ultimate destination after many a pitch in many a mudded field is unspeakable and calamitous beyond reckoning....\\" This is the world of \\"Tomorrow and tomorrow....\\" in Macbeth. It is the ghoulish \\"walking dream\\" beyond hope. It is, in short, the world of the Gnostics, created by an evil demiurge when God wasn't watching, so to speak.This is what makes Blood Meridian a masterpiece. McCarthy manages to capture what few artists in any medium in any age have managed: A compelling and convincing vision of the human condition."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I came to this novel urged on by the gushing, almost speechless, praise of Harold Bloom in an interview on television a couple of years ago. He called it the most important novel of our time and MacCarthy the finest writer living. He said all of this in the context of a discussion of the controversy he created in breaking with some literary elitists in his severe criticisms of hallowed icons of the modern literary canon. In short, I got the impression that Bloom was as impatient with pseudo-literary pretentiousness as was I.So I picked up MacCarthy's noble work in a feeling of near euphoric epiphany. This was surely going to be the most gritty, realistic and (above all) unvarnished western ever written. Then I hit this sentence:QUOTE: The thunder moved up from the southwest and lightning lit the desert all about them, blue and barren, great clanging reaches ordered out of the absolute night like some demon kingdom summoned up, the mountains on the sudden skyline stark and black and livid, like a land of some other order out there whose true geology was not stone but fear.That would make for perfect purpling in H. P. Lovecraft's &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot;, but its a bit too much to swallow for a novel that aims to be an unvarnished account of unflinching realism. It is by no means an exceptional out take. The book is unctious with this kind of prose. MacCarthy is the absolute worst pretender to literary significance I have ever read for the plain reason that he tries so damned hard to be literary that it gets in your teeth like fine alkali dust.Yes, he has a fine gift for a well turned sentence. So do armies of nameless hacks and better known writers who never get nominated for being visionaries of our time. What sets him apart is his deliberate effort at obtuseness. He makes no obvious effort to say anything, so the mavens of literary pith conclude that it must be so profound that it reaches beyond the capacity of mere mortal words to tell, thoughts angelic or infernal in transcendence. Please.This is the kind of pretentious rubbish that has made Melville the dandy of lit professors for the last 150 years. I hate to be uncharitable, but the emperor is starkers. If you think this is as good as it gets, or rises above the too self-consciously literary efforts of modern fiction, then you need to read more widely."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Blood Meridian is probably one of the most important books one could ever read. The Judge is perhaps one of the most memorable characters in fiction with his completely hairless, (including no eyelashes!), purely white body and baby face and his need to document and destroy all that exists. The violence, for me, was great. It is not meant to be violent for the sake of violence. It is rendering the true effects of imperialism. There is so much to talk about it. Read it."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Dangers of the Westward ExpansionThis was my first experience with Cormac McCarthy, and my life as a reader has not been the same since. The writing is poetically complex yet incredibly powerful even to the most novice of critical readers. Blood Meridian is a novel that employs a wide spectrum of devices to explore difficult themes drawn from a specific period in our nation's history. A romantic saga of the Wild West this book is not. While there is a driving plot (however brutal), it is secondary to the issues McCarthy is focusing on. Taking place on the western frontier during the westward expansion, a time when the abstract concept of Manifest Destiny saturated American thinking, Blood Meridian presents a world where the ability to use abstract thought, empowers a person over those who think in terms of the specific. Combined with the paradigm of the Witness (if no one saw it, did it even happen?), the world as McCarthy sees it is extremely dangerous for many people. Falling into the company of The Judge, The Kid joins a group of scalp hunters on the hunt for Native American victims. In the interactions between the two prominent characters, as well as with the band of mercenaries, the hierarchy of abstract thought is exposed and made frighteningly real. To further intensify all that is going on the novel, the prose is incredibly original. McCarthy's writing is reminiscent of Faulkner, and Joyce in terms of its uniqueness. He straddles the line between fiction and poetry like no other writer. Style aside, McCarthy carefully chooses the type of language used for certain exposition. The use of specific and abstract words is integral to the thematic development of the novel. The writing is also incredibly subtle. What might be mentioned only once in an early chapter, all of a sudden carries a lot of weight when it is alluded to at the end of the novel. Blood Meridian in not without its fair share of subversion however. The Kid appears to be the main character, yet The Judge gets the majority of attention throughout. The \\"mapped out\\" chapter formats are more suited to the Victorian era than to modern day America. Violence is one aspect of the novel that receives the most response from the reader. It will either deter you from immersing yourself in the conflicts, or strangely compel you to dive further in to this alien world where ruthlessness is inherent, second nature. I feel the need to make a disclaimer here: This book is violent; even more it is intensely graphic. I understand that this will discourage potential readers, but I encourage one to read the book anyhow. The brutality of the band of scalp hunters is vital to the story on both dramatic and thematic levels. Blood Meridian is the most important novel I have read since Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man. It deals with a period of our history that is usually romanticized by glamorous portrayals on the big screen. The period of Manifest Destiny was a very dangerous time for those who weren't American. The themes are consistent to the setting and the plot has its routes in actual events and characters. This book is not just a literary achievement, but also a courageous feat for any writer. McCarthy deals with themes that most people don't want to acknowledge. Read this book if you can. Its message cannot be ignored."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"BLOOD MERIDIAN was published in 1985 and I can see why it achieved lasting acclaim. Cormac McCarthy is a master of sentence and paragraph construction. The beauty of his words and the construction of his sentences provides a basic pleasurable sensation. Which is good for this book, because after a while the narrative begins to drag. They walk through desert. They massacre. They walk through desert. They massacre. They walk through awful landscapes and massacre again. And so on. It seems to lose coherence when it spins off from the heart of &quot;the kid&quot;--which may be a point being made but is damned annoying nevertheless. If you are coming to this novel retrospectively from his Border Trilogy, you might be disappointed in the absence of a &quot;hero&quot; on the scale of John Grady or Billy. At least there is in BLOOD MERIDIAN the character of the judge to (hopefully) capture your attention, though hero definitely does not apply."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"By Sumner Wilson (Missouri)This review is from: Blood Meridian: Or the Evening Redness in the West (Paperback)Beware!

A dark visceral look into a past far more real than most would imagine possible. A truly great piece of literature. The highest praise I can give to a book is to read it more than once. On a wall filled with shelves of books is a small shelf reserved for books to be read agin. Blood Meridian sets on this shelf."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Really grows on you. At the beginning there was definitely a period of getting used to the writing. He can spend a few pages describing the environment, and then a gunfight in a couple sentences. Also, very matter-of-factly describes the encounters with the Mexican army, Indians, etc., without describing the reasons. But then you come to realize, this is completely from the POV of the kid. Most of his time is spent travelling, with short staccato bursts of activity, then more travelling, and he doesn't understand the nuances behind why they're being sent to scalp others or why they're being chased. I'm still trying to understand the judge."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I cannot say enough good things about this book. I barely even consider this a book. I consider this almost a bible. The prose used throughout is nothing short of masterful. It has redefined how I look at the written word. The story flows through like a hellish fever dream, and as vicious is its invincible grip, and as haunting is its memory is in your mind, it was impossible to stop reading.I know many of the criticisms this book collects. Apparently, people read books for commas and quotation marks. McCarthy is telling a story here, and he's doing it on his terms. It's like a campfire tale you'd hear in the reds of hell.The characters are brilliant. The Kid and the Judge respectively are dueling metaphors for the violence of the world and the cruelty of mankind. The Judge leaves a sense of dread so present and palpable even after reading the story a dozen times that he ranks among the most memorable characters of any book or film. He knows all things. He speaks all tongues. He sees all men.If you consider yourself a reader or student of serious fiction, and you enjoy allegories and symbology of immeasurable scope, then do yourself a favor and buy this book. If you're offended by violence or from glancing at the inner sanctums of everything wicked and raw about mankind, then you should check your inhibitions and just enjoy this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This is McCarthy. Just buy it, read it, and if it gets too violent take a break and come back to it. Between the violence you will find some lovely prose, haunting imagery and wisdom way ahead of our time. This is McCarthy's first journey to the west and as of yet he hasn't looked back. To know his style is to know that he is thorough in his research and storytelling. You may (and probably will!) need a dictionary to get through this book but do it. Just do it.I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I don't pretend to be a literary critic and there are none who would classify me as a writer of any merit. But I know what I like in my reading material. This book will not appeal to a majority of casual readers. It is, I admit, a work of exceptional depth, imagery, and philosophical travel. It is not uplifting. It is not humorous. It presents a dark side of human nature.One quote that stuck with me (and by the way there is little in grammatical orientation in this book, no quotation marks, no he said, or she said. I liked that, at first, but there were times I had to re-read a paragraph to get context), but back to the quote, and I paraphrase, \\"it is not the meal which brings men together, but the sharing of enemies\\".I think this book is best read at night when you can't sleep, with low light and nothing to disturb you, but the book itself."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"When I first started this I thought I'd never be able to finish. The whole book, but especially the first few chapters, are full of sentence fragments intermingled with nearly endless run on sentences with weird punctuation, obscure words and no quotations marks. It got easier to follow as the book went on, but still the plot was occasionally confusing. Everything has been said by the other reviewers. In the end I love the old west subject matter and \\"no holds barred\\" depictions so much that I enjoyed it. This book is very similar in subject matter to \\"In the Rogue Blood\\" and that book is much easier to follow and has more character development. They are both very violent and gritty and well written. I suggest Rogue if you only want one, unless you just want to know what all the fuss is about with Blood Meridian..."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"First off, let me begin this review stating that Blood Meridian is one of the best American Western stories I've ever read, and being a fan of western stories, I'm especially critical of books based on the genre to which I hold very dear. Cormac McCathy is cruelly relentless and realistic in his depiction of the American West prior to the Civil War, and I would urge queazy or young readers to refrain from selecting this story due to its raw and complex presentation.I say \\"complex,\\" because despite the quality of the story and the obviousness of the plot, McCarthy has a way of complicating his vivid descriptions of characters and events by applying terminology that is incompatible or seemingly forced with the action taking place. For example:\\"Glanton's dog trotted moaning among the endlessly articulating legs of the horses.\\"Articulating legs of the horses? Now, I know what articulate means, but I looked it up again and could not see, for the life of me, how the term could be applied to the legs of a horse. Stuff like this is all over the story, unfortunately, and I felt that it broke the flow of the storytelling in a lot of scenes. While I'm not surprised since McCarthy is also a poet and poets, after all, do not always adhere to traditional rules of grammar, I was nonetheless disheartened at the reoccurring examples of these throughout the story.Now, even though I raised issues regarding McCarthy's idiom, let me not imply that McCarthy doesn't know his American West. He superbly captures the gritty mood and nomenclature of the Old West, and character dialogue has been appropriately marginalized to reflect the quiet, somber mood of the times.I've finished the book despite the issues presented earlier, and I'll only take one star off as it was the only issue I had with the story. Fans of the Old West should pick this gem up."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"That \\"Evening Redness in the West\\"? That ain't sunset, brother. That's the oil of progress, and hundreds of gallons of it soak the pages of Cormac McCarthy's unrelenting study of violence and American expansion in the 1800s.The novel's protagonist, named only \\"the kid,\\" is born under signs and portents. His arrival in this world ushers his mother out of it as stars fall from the sky above. \\"In him broods already a taste for mindless violence,\\" and the kid takes to it like a politician to forced sodomy. When he gets old enough to run away from home, he goes where all the ne'er-do-wells congregate: Texas! Specifically, Nacogdoches, future home of legendary reprobate Joe Lansdale His Ownself. The kid meets earless, branded felon Toadvine in a drunken, muddy knifefight outside a bar's privy. Of such confrontations are lifelong friendships forged. The kid also has his first encounter with one of the most indelible characters in the history of the written word: Judge Holden. He'll figure into things a little later.After roaming around Texas a while, the kid is recruited by a unit of army irregulars, disgruntled and dissatisfied with the way the border boundaries were drawn up after the war with Mexico. They set out to extend U.S. territory all by themselves. This proves to be a spectacularly bad idea when they run across a Comanche war party. The Indians skewer, scalp and dismember these would-be rulers of Mexico, then bugger their corpses. The kid survives the carnage and is clapped behind bars by the Mexicans. In the pokey, he finds his old pal Toadvine. They cool their heels until John Glanton's gang of scalphunters rides through town, looking like the marauders from \\"Road Warrior,\\" but on horseback. Among these professional murderers is Judge Holden.Toadvine claims he and the kid are fearsome Indian fighters, and Glanton bails them out to join his crew. And then they all gallop straight into hell, the monotony of infernal desert landscapes broken up by regular bouts of slaughter. The governor of Chihuahua has contracted with Glanton for the scalps of Apaches who've been massacring the populace. But Glanton's not that particular: Apaches, Tiguas, Yumas, even the peons he's paid to protect; they all have hair, women and children, too.Though Glanton is the leader of the scalphunters, the judge is the bloody engine that drives the gang. Holden comes from the mold of Melville's Captain Ahab, a near-supernatural, elemental being who lives his life as a defiant middle finger extended toward his Creator. At almost 7 feet tall and absolutely hairless, the judge does his best to make sure God notices. \\"This is him,\\" a reverend cries. \\"The devil. Here he stands.\\" He's a Zen master of Chaos, determined to reshape the world by eliminating as many pieces of it as he can. Every night, he holds sway around the campfire, talking in parables, sharing his blasphemous gospel of warfare. He's an absolutely chilling creation at the center of a book that's almost unfathomably cruel, and the reader had better be prepared to be shaken. This is an unsettling look in the mirror at a past that's not as comfortably distant as some might like to think.Pretty much from the moment Cain picked up that rock, the history of mankind has been a repeated cycle of advances over the bones of the vanquished. We live on stolen land in cities built with slave labor, enjoying space-age technology based on Nazi mad science. Yet does anyone argue seriously for reversing history to atone for all that blood, for going back to the cave, for giving up our land, our houses, our indoor plumbing, our sanitation, iPods and automobiles? Does that make us complicit in the crimes that laid the first paving on the road to the future? Of course not. People are so much more civilized and righteous these days. We've learned from the past. We love one another. We recycle. We frown on repression and abuse of power. We know much better now (he writes as that Evening Redness continues to spread at the border).Perhaps the hermit the kid encounters early in the novel has the right idea, retreating from his fellow savages and the grasp of civilization. He theorizes, \\"When God made man the devil was at his elbow. A creature that can do anything. Make a machine. And a machine to make the machine. And evil that can run itself a thousand years, no need to tend it.\\"Defense is speechless, your honor.\\"All progressions from a higher to a lower order are marked by ruins and mystery and a residue of nameless rage.\\" -- The Judge"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Hands down, one of the greatest American novels of all time. McCarthy does the brutal - beautiful dialectic like no other. Cinematic in scope, lean and muscular in prose, yet relentless in detail and development, \\"Blood Meridian\\" will undoubtedly go down in literary history--even if it's only for the Judge being the scariest character you may ever encounter in a book."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Much of what has been stated in the other reviews I tend to agree with. The writing is superb. The delineated violence is horrid yet so beautifully drawn that it is difficult to put this book down. What is most engaging to me is that many if not all of the events described in this tale probably really happened; and from what I know of that period of time in that part of the world, these events were most likely worse than they are depicted. We may shudder at McCarthy's beautifully lurid visualizations; but brutality and man's inhumanity to man are as old as the Beard of Moses. It is chilling to consider that the pictured acts of the Dalton gang and the Judge may have been even worse in reality. We live in a modern society that has a short memory or, in many cases, no memory, of the violence and cruelty that took place in the untamed territories of the West, not to mention much of the rest of the world. We shudder today when some over heated pressure cooker of an individual finally explodes and shoots a half dozen people at a shopping mall or court house. These events are considered anomalies in today's modern world. The truth is that we are the decendents of people who lived daily with violence, murder, and the knowledge that life was often cruel and unfair. It's unfortunate that I have no time machine to return to that period to see the extent of things vis a vis McCarthy's renditions. I guess I'll have to settle for McCarthy's poetry and his vivid, nasty, beautiful, cruel, malevolent, and often sublime depictions of the human animal and his struggles, both moral and physical, in another time and another realm."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This is the most amazing book you will ever read. I first read \\"Blood Meridian\\" more than a decade ago. It was the most brutal, haunting, and beautiful book I had ever read. At one point the brutality was so overwhelming I had to set the book aside for a while before I could finish it. I tossed \\"Blood Meridian\\" around in my mind for more than 10 years before I decided to read it again. I could read this book many times, each time finding greater depths without ever feeling that I reached the bottom. Many critics have explored this book from different angles -historic, frontier myth, religious, etc. All (or almost all) of these perspectives are valid. The book is complex, engaging, and poetic. The characters, drawn from historical reports, are both real and mythical. The judge, the great hairless giant, moves serenely and unscathed through the blood-soaked wasteland. He is L'enfant terrible, an overgrown infant, a brutal killer, a genius, a pedophile, Shiva, Yahweh, and the anti-Christ.Humor is rare in this book and never removed from the horror. Tobin, the ex-priest turned Indian killer, recounts a story where two deserters are found hanging upside-down from a tree. \\"They'd been skinned and I can tell ye it does very little for a man's appearance.\\" The writing is beautiful, even when the topic is horrible or depressing. For example, \\"the colt stood against the horse with its head down and the horse was watching, out there past men's knowing, where the stars are drowning and whales ferry their vast souls through the black and seamless sea.\\" The vocabulary and writing style can be challenging, but never gratuitous. Every scene, every word, every gesture has a purpose. What a book!McCarthy is a truly gifted writer and this book is among his greatest works."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"In addition to watching the recent movie No Country for Old Men and reading The Road, I thought I'd explore Cormac McCarthy more deeply by reading his novel Blood Meridian. I'd heard about it from friends and intrigued for a good story, I dove in. Thrown in is more appropriate, like an infant into the deep end of the pool, from atop the high dive while held by a seven-foot-tall, four-hundred pound freakshow delicately bouncing upon the board to get as much leverage as insanely possible. The atomic splat of sentience that resulted after reading the work brought a self-awareness that I now have truly entered McCarthy's world in as much as his writing syntax will allow.Which is an exquisite thing. Blood Meridian is an astounding work that spans styles and genres, from the most erudite works of literature, to historical fiction, to sheer horror. It takes a story, an era (the old West) that has been fantasized and romanticized to the point of nausea, and recreates it for what it most likely approximated in my opinion...unbridled lawlessness, havoc and murder.Blood Meridian is a work depicting immense violence, detailing the events surrounding the escapades of a young character called 'the kid', as he makes his way westward from Tennessee around the year 1848. He wanders purposelessly until faced with the prospect of adventure in joining a band of scalp hunters destined for the American Southwest. Initially starting with a more specific objective, the band's purpose slowly embraces the means rather than the end, under the direction of their leaders Captain Glanton and Holden, more commonly known as 'the judge'; the band consequently sweeps across the southwest deserts and mountains in a sandstorm of terror, through Texas, Mexico, California and all places in between.Though without glorifying war, McCarthy's style of writing leaves no detail of atrocity untold. The extent to which he elaborates on brutality and chaos reifies his more or less consistent theme of society's lack of morality, or at least the laughable facade of law and order. Which leads a reader to believe that this work is just as much a philosophical offering as it is one of fiction. That there are those among us who can manipulate situations and people to the extent as one particular character does in this story is the most frightening aspect. His insistence that existence of something requires someone else's consent is a highly disturbing credo and is the underlying current to the justification of events as they progress.In any case, that violence is eternal is but one aspect and message of Blood Meridian that's thoroughly thought provoking and engrossing and bizarre and frightening. Read it, if you get the chance."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This is the fictionalized account of the Glanton Gang, a rag-tag band of men who roamed the American west around 1850. Originally hired by Mexican towns to hunt down a group of Apaches that had been terrorizing the citizens, the gang eventually roams the countryside with an insatiable bloodlust, violently murdering and scalping everyone they encounter.There are no \\"good guys\\" in Blood Meridian, and if there is one inarguable theme to take away from a book that is both deep and cryptic, it is that neither the image of the cowboy hero battling the blood-thirsty Indians as portrayed in John Wayne movies, nor the revisionist history of the noble savage falling victim to the westward expansion of America is accurate. The picture that McCarthy paints is a west full of savage brutality, where nobody is innocent. It is an apocalypse of violence, surreal and unsettling. In no place and no character do we find sanctuary from the depravity. McCarthy spares no one: women, children, puppies and priests are slaughtered without prejudice. It is a tale with much posturing and philosophizing but no apparent morality, where destruction is as natural as the sky or the mountains.McCarthy's writing is bombastic and beautiful, juxtaposing imagery one might expect more in Dante's INFERNO with poetic descriptions of the open land. The characters read like a perverse version of Chaucer, many of them with titles rather than names: The Kid and the ex-priest. The judge, Holden, based on a real-life man, is the second in command. He is an enormous, pale white apparition, a hairless monstrosity with the gravity of a Colonel Kurtz. He is a poet, a preacher, a philosopher, knowledgeable in natural sciences, history, and the arts. He is the spiritual leader of the gang, and the moral nadir of humanity, the most brutal and memorable character of the book.BLOOD MERIDIAN is not for the faint of heart. It's unflinching in its personification of evil and depiction of the brutality of which men are capable. It has been criticized by some for its over-the-top language, and though it's not as sparse as THE ROAD or NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, the imagery is just as powerful. In fact, some of the apocalyptic imagery is repeated, perhaps more suitably, in THE ROAD. But THE ROAD is about an apocalypse yet to come. BLOOD MERIDIAN is about an apocalypse that occurred 150 years ago."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"To live in Cormac McCarthy's world is to know death in all its manifestations: from nature and wolves to human acts of evil or necessity, when good men do bad things to survive. Blood Meridian was high noon for this. A psychotic dream across the page - Sam Peckinpah meets William Faulkner - it felt more like lava than language."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"These poor dears who one star this book need to go back to their Danielle Steele and Stuart Woods tripe and leave McCarthy's work to real readers. This is reading at its best. Yes, it requires attention, perseverance, and at times a dictionary, but it delivers so much more than just a story. If you want to ease into McCarthy, start with ATPH or even the entire border trilogy, but once you have bought into the fact that he is the best writer, any category, working today, indulge yourself in this, his best work and the best book sitting on any shelf in your local bookstore today."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"\\"Blood Meridian\\" traces the life of a nameless Kid, who at 14 runs away from his Tennessee home. After a harrowing journey, he joins up with a band of outlaws, led by the brutal Captain Glanton. The group is on a mission to Mexico, to prosper from a growing enterprise: the scalping of Native Americans. It is a bloody life, and the Kid faces triumphs and tragedies on his way to a tragic adulthood.There are several comparrisons I could make between \\"Blood Meridian\\" and examples from classic literature, yet nothing I can think of seems to do it justice. This is simply a classic work of art. Grandiose, epic in scope, it is the bloody, heartbreaking saga of a too-often forgotten period in American history. The fact that this book is based on actual events will chill your blood. It is unflinchingly honest in its portrayal of characters--there are no saints here.One of the most interesting aspects of \\"Blood Meridian\\" is that it introduces a literary character who, decades from now, will be regarded as one of the great fictional inventions of literature: Judge Holden. A towering figure, he easily ranks up there with Conrad's Kurtz or any of Shakespeare's tragic rulers. Suffice it to say, \\"Blood Meridian\\" will be taught in college literature courses in the years to come (I'm sure it is already, somewhere), and will become the bane and guilty pleasure of literary afficianados. McCarthy's prose, as always, is elegant and delightfully dense; no easy reading, but well-worth the time you invest in it. You'll come away a richer, more self-aware individual. Think I'm over-doing it a bit? Then buy the book--buy any of his books--and take the challenge. McCarthy isn't writing for a generation, or a specific audience; he's writing for the ages. This is literature, folks--literature at its absolute finest."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"A business associate recommended this book to me. I am so glad he did. This book amazed me. There were moments when I simply had to put it down due to imagery overload. Blood Meridian is not for the light reader. I recommend this book for the serious reader only. Definitely not for the immature. A true masterpiece. McCarthy's name will some day as revered as Steinbeck's. My only regret is that I had not discovered it sooner. I look forward to reading it again."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Everything you've heard about Blood Meridian is true; it really is a magnificently written, blood soaked tour de force. If you're like me and read The Road or No Country For Old Men before this, Blood Meridian is probably both exactly and nothing at all what you're expecting. The punctuation, diction and themes of violence and desolation are very much here, however McCarthy's writing style is quite different. It's a lot more descriptive with long, stream-of-conscious passages - the flip side of The Road and NCFOM's sparse prose. As well, Blood Meridian explores much larger themes than The Road or No Country, everything from the nature of war and violence to metaphysics. As I read Blood Meridian I felt that it dragged a bit at times but since I put it down, I can't get it out of my head. Stay with it if you decide to read it - the final 12 pages are mindbogglingly good and well worth the trouble to get there. Recommended for any self-respecting person who considers themselves well read in American literature."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Blood Meridian offers a stark, piercing, and brutal account of U.S. western expansionism. It is a not a novel for the faint hearted or one for those with a sentimental \\"old west\\" view - the clear \\"good guy/bad guy\\" mentality. Characters are complex, gritty, and fuzzy. Despite the bloody pages, however, there is something beautiful in the writing - death never looked so poetic. Hard to follow at times, the novel demands attention. It forces you to look at what you'd rather not acknowledge.If I had to offer a criticism, however, it is in the final pages. After following The Kid the entire novel, drawn into his cold, pale world, his fate is not quite settled. Almost, but not quite.Ulitmately, Blood Meridian offers unforgettable characters, honest violence, and a definition of \\"the west\\" not found in the black and white westerns we so love to believe."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"What a miserable book! A friend recommended I read it and I've come to the conclusion we have very similar tastes in literature. When I read a book I don't want to have to sit there and try to decipher the language - I want to enjoy myself. This book did everything but that - all it really did was annoy the hell out of me. I will admit McCarthy does do a good job of making you feel like you're out in the cruel Mexican desert, but the flat characters and lame ending made me think it was a waste of my money."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I have read several of McCarthy's books, and actually thought that the Road was one of the very best books I have read. This particular book is page after page of purely blathering, mindless violence; there is no reason for the killings; there is absolutely no character development to give you any insight into the reasons behind the actions. It is pure bunk to me to give the author any credit for \\"literary prose\\" - this is pure and utter trash.His premise re the basic evil nature of man (I guess seen in most of his books) may be an acceptable premise, but how about some insights into the root causes, rather than an unending tabloid description of killing.Unfortunately, this will be my last McCarthy book."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I hate Cormac McCarthy - not just his writing, I'm pretty sure I would have no use for him as a person either. I have read and reviewed The Road (another complete waste of time, but at least it's shorter), but I figured I would give him another shot, considering the praise his \\"work\\" garners.I listened to the audio book for a couple of reasons - it is hard to read literature when you don't have the time to really immerse yourself in it, and besides, I refused to \\"read\\" another McCarthy book because his \\"style\\" (read: pretentious literary onanism) is distracting and disturbing.That said, I much preferred hearing the words rather than reading them. His structure and grammatical choices are invisible when you are hearing the words instead of reading them. But the content is - sparse at best. The main character barely exists in the story until the writer needs him to so he can illustrate some point or another.McCarthy Mary Sue's himself into every character, so that there really is not much difference in one or the other, with the exception of The Judge - a cypher for ... something. I'm not even sure McCarthy understands this character. The Judge is basically an un-killable (unless the story needs him to be threatened), all-knowing (unless the story needs him to be ignorant), invulnerable (unless the story needs him to be hurt), etc, demon-like creature who is basically the only character in the book who matters.Nothing happens until The Judge is around. Sure, characters wander in the desert for ... forever; but they are only saved if The Judge is there. Characters fight, but they only win if The Judge is there. He drives them on to worse and worse evils, but condemns them when they act.The story is thin at best. Basically, a bunch of bad guys kill a bunch of indians until everyone but The Judge and the Kid (who is the main character, supposedly) meet up in an outhouse - and who knows what happens then. Literally. He doesn't tell us, which ends an unsatisfying book unsatisfactorily.The violence in this book is monotonous and pointless. The language is intentionally pompous. The stylistic choices are pretentious. If you are a literary masochist by all means, read this book."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"What's the point. The meaninglessness of life.

Before expiration of drying ink they nestle ears against the box interior to decipher what readers, reviewers and publishers will say, like a fetus does his mother's womb.McCarthy never touches the box.Us readers pull out of the box a writer's work like any cigar, read the label, smell it, observe it. Perhaps lick it. Sometimes we smoke it.You can't smoke McCarthy as he is not in the box. If you claim to you are not of this matter.

If you attempt to harness his efforts and take a drag you will find your vision viscerally vexed and your upperworks in a state of antagonistic apoplexy allowing you to categorically conclude upon his characters or content contained within your illusory constant compos mentis. But your mind's eye is blind to that of your body's lamp. For therein lies the impossibility of any review of McCarthy.The greatest work of English was not written in native form and if one tries to analyze its content, character development or any other literal aspect they are missing the point entirely. I am making that analogy.If this review makes no sense and you are lost then consider this a compass point and don't read this book; McCarthy's zenith zeal."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Three Novels Not To Read: The Sadistic, the Obese and the Blood-Thirsty.I believe I have read as many books as anyone. I am not a glutton in reading, though, as there are books I will not read, and regret reading a few that I did. I will advise you of three novels not to read, as they are bad for your mind and emotions. People often know the bad effects of food they eat, but are less knowledgeable about the possible bad effects of what they put into their minds. Of course, I would not stop anyone from reading (as I would not stop an adult from eating, but I tend to avoid people who are obese who do not have a medical reason for it, and people of poor reading habits), but knowing what is undesirable will help counter the bad effects, ---as perhaps exercise helps counter the bad effects of fried foods, fat, salt, sugar, processed food and bad carbohydrates.1- The Sadistic: The Bridge on the Drina, by Ivo Andric.Andric's book had been on my list to read since adolescence. I was not enthusiastic to read him because I had been informed of the sadism displayed in his book, the first of his historical trilogy of Bosnia,--- oh, dear!One time at a library book sale I discovered a copy, and bought it for a dollar. I was reluctant to begin reading it, but then I thought I owed it to my education to do so. I lasted not much further than one hundred pages, maybe to 120 or so. At that point, Andric was describing in excruciating detail the impalement of an opponent of the regime by the brutal rulers of it and in loving detail, as I perceived. I put down the book, and thought about it for a few days, and then tossed it into the garbage. I did not and do not want to know what being impaled means in its entirety. (It is not a simple pounding of a stake through the heart, but is crueler than that. It is more torturous than crucifixion. Christ would have welcomed crucifixion rather than impalement. )A number of years later, I found another copy of Andric's book at a yard sale, and this time for a quarter. I bought it, brought it home, thought about it overnight, and then tossed it into the trash. I am perfectly educated without having read that book.Ivo Andric won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1975. Good luck to all who read him.*(I have thought for a number of years that the Nobel Committee is an organization that is very much overdue for a thorough investigation and savage cleaning, especially for its decisions in literature and politics. It now gives the peace prize for presumption of good works, as in the recent award (2009), and maybe soon for presumption for a literary work yet to be written. All of Western society was affected by brutal violence, once the Indian killing and the Civil War in America cleared the way for it, and the prize for Andric is the result. The Nobel Committee needs a cleansing like Hercules at the Augean stables.)2- The Obese - Gravity's Rainbow, by Thomas Pynchon.I had purchased Pynchon's first book, V, back in the 1960s, and found it worth reading. I also read The Crying of Lot 49, and accepted it as par for the course for novels that were published at the time. I will admit that I have not retained a great deal from these fashionable novels, though I meant to keep up with Pynchon's work.About fifteen years ago, I picked up Gravity's Rainbow. I dutifully began reading it, and thought I was getting into it, ---though I could not see where it was going, but then I reacted. It is a huge book, well over 700 pages in small print. I had far too many things to do and other books to read than to continue with this fat slob of a book. It must contain more words than all the rest of the works in the western tradition from Homer, both Testaments, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Whitman and all the books in the American literary tradition. I could not and cannot bear the ponderings of the fatso literary mind as displayed in the book. (It appeared to me that Pynchon had got hold of a word processor, a novelty at the time he started to write his book, I assume, and could not let go.)There are at least two ways to hit a target. One way is to load a double-barreled shotgun with buckshot, stand about five feet from the bull's-eye, and blast away. Of course the bull's-eye will be hit, and even blown to bits along with the rest of the target and the fence on which it was fastened. Another way is to use a high-powered rifle, stand three miles away, aim carefully, and---Zoooooook!---send a single bullet directly into the center of the bull's-eye. I would prefer the second way, in target shooting and in literary composition, as it is more skillful and satisfying in style. It indicates a disciplined mind.Gustave Flaubert, the great 19th century French novelist and the writer who established the modern idiom of the novel, was an advocate of finding the exact word (le mot juste) to describe his compositions, and thus preferred the high-powered rifle style. Pynchon, in Gravity's Rainbow, took the shotgun approach and used every word he ever learned and many thousands of times. He can thus, in his novel, be described as the ultimate anti-Flaubertian (Flaubertesque?) writer. Of course, modern fiction is given much latitude in narrative form, but I do not care to lard my mind with such lard as did Pynchon. But again, if everything possible is said then I guess a writer gets to say what he wants to say, or mean, eventually, whatever it is. If you say everything then eventually you will say something significant, ---I suppose. If you could disentangle what he might have meant from what he wrote, you might have something. But that is the le mot juste style. Have fun when you read the book.Pynchon has written other novels since Gravity's Rainbow, but I lost interest in him, as I have for most modern fiction because I find it narrow-minded, specious and contingent.3- The Bloodthirsty - Blood Meridian, by Cormac McCarthy.First of all, this book cannot be called a novel because it does not have character development. The main characters, though I am being kind in calling them so, the Judge and \\"the Kid\\" remain throughout the novel exactly the same, evil incarnate and stupidity incarnate. Modern fiction is given much latitude in format, but this book needs another genre. I suggest it be classified as Horror Fiction for Intellectuals, because in McCarthy's book the hero (or whatever) dies; in Horror Fiction for adolescents, the hero lives and triumphs. This is the only literary difference between the two genres. (It is a male companion piece to the romance novel genre, but in a studly way. Whereas the romance novel has \\"romantic rape\\" at its core, Blood Meridian has actual rape, torture and murder, the \\"shoot \`em up\\" style of writing.)Another first of all is that I read the book on the advice of Harold Bloom. It was the worse literary advice I ever got. (Unlike Bloom, I was unable - and thankfully - to overcome my repugnance of the book. The problem with Bloom is that he has read so much that he could take the advertising blurb on a tube of toothpaste and write a critical thesis of American intellectual history based on it.) The book is a monolithic, monomaniac working out of the critical thesis assumed by Bloom that America is an absolutely bloodthirsty place with its heroes (a la Billy Budd) reticent, even mute, sacrificial and barely even interactive with their environment. Such a hero is indistinguishable from a stupid and nave bystander. In fact, McCarthy's so-called ur-hero (or whatever), \\"the Kid\\" is totally non-comprehending to the point of not even understanding the context of his life. He is a mute and a neuter, stupid and unheroic and is qualitatively different than Melville's Billy Budd. He deserves to get killed in a toilet by the Judge. The book represents the dumbing-down of American literature, a cynical view of the author. It seems that the crude, primitive, adolescent development of America has found its nadir in McCarthy's work. It derives from the belief that the source or truth of things is \\"down- diggety-deep\\" in the psychic life of man, derived from Freud and company. Such belief is a metaphor and no more true or false than the view that all things good, true, beautiful and rational are from the \\"above\\" and beyond. (There is the possibility that McCarthy wrote his book in belief and to the life, alas if so.)As Bloom taught, so McCarthy wrote, though they may have never met, and maybe all the worse for it. While it is true that a new novel takes some of its power from novels written previously, it still has to stand on its own, --- and Blood Meridian does not. All the books in Bloom's head have filled the gaps of McCarthy's novel. You have heard that America is one long bloody fight. McCarthy's book is a working out of that thesis in mangled, dying flesh. No one needs to tell me that, though, and so the book is redundant. The book, further, is to be comprehended by sociology, and not by literature, a deadly error. It is a derivative work of literature, and not a novel.The worst thing about McCarthy's book, however, is that he wasted my time in reading it, as all his percepts and brutalities can be picked up elsewhere. There is nothing new in it: slaughter in the West; a superhuman (and perverted) villain; a moronic hero; hatred of the other (Native Americans). It may be the full working out of Manifest Destiny in the American West, an ideology made of bloody flesh.Blood Meridian represents the end of the novel in America in what may be called The Literature of the Republic. (Now it is time to consider a canon for The Literature of the American Empire.)*I am perfectly cognizant that my advice will not put off anyone from reading the books but may whet their appetite for them. Consider that I intended it.[I may write a separate review of Blood Meridian in a new format for review literature. It will have as its title: Blood Redundant: The Novel of the American Bloodlust. Or, perhaps I will call it Manifest Destiny: The Book of Indian-Killing.](TRC Final Revision 12-03-09)"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I have read the border trilogy and The Road by Cormac McCarthy and they were excellent. I agree with another reviewer on this book, that it seemed like Cormac McCarthy wrote this with a dictionary in his lap trying to find words that he had never used before.

Fine. Maybe they're right, if not, re-bunkers will appear soon enough. For those uninterested in this sort of academic dithering, the novel will remind you of &quot;Fight Club&quot;--only without the delightful Helena Bonham Carter to contrast with page after page of intensly brooding, harsh accounts of the mid-19th century American West. The book concludes with a standard tribute to human nihilism: the Judge, personifying malificience, dancing and proclaiming his immortality. In between lynchings, barfights, and battles, there is some extraordinary prose and a few interesting reflections. Overall, those who have no need of being shocked into a new view of the West may be a trifle--dare I say it?--bored with this occassionally overwrought reminder of how dangerous a place the world can be."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This was not a page turner for me. Instead, it was a book I picked up with great difficulty each time. I would not have finished it if it had not come so highly recommended from a literary friend.The violence is overstated. Like with Tarantino movies, MCCarthy has felt the need to slap us in the face with the worst kinds of violence to demonstrate his point that The West was not a glamorous place full of John Wayne heroics. There is child killing, animal killing, rape...all the worst sorts of death. It was just hard to get past these points and move with the story.You don't need to be \\"sensitive\\" to be offended by a saturation of violence against innocent people.The writing style is quite obnoxious. One more simile and he should apply for a patent on them. No quotation marks, which I realize is a writing tool to convey continuity and stream of consciousness, but here it just provides confusion.I did like the movement of the story and there were some good scenes, but the redundance of the killing just ruined it for me.

Yes, they both fancy the compound sentence, but Hemmingway wrote in a simpler elegant style. And you can be a good writer and not have to constantly use obscure nouns and reversed adjectives and odd pronoun usage and...oops, caught myself in a compound sentence.He's heard this criticism before.

Although it is not his most recent work, (quite the opposite being published in 1985) the book of McCarthy's which I have most recently finished is Blood Meridian: Or the Evening Redness in the West. As with most McCarthy novels this is a dark, intense look into the human psyche, and as usual he paints his story, with incredible insight, into a very specific place and time in American history. This particular story takes place in, what seems to be McCarthy's favorite setting, the area around the U.S. border with Mexico. The time period is the tumultuous era between the Mexican-American war and the American Civil war, when the west was being founded with very little interference from the \\"civilized\\" society of the eastern United States.In classic McCarthy fashion, the protagonist is simply referred to as The Kid. The Kid is, as the name implies, a young boy who runs away from his home in Tennessee to south Texas and puts himself into situations where extreme violence is often accepted, if not encouraged. I won't spend much time explaining the plot (if you want to know what happens, read it) but the majority of the story follows the Kid's time spent with the Glanton gang (a real group that spent the early 1850's hunting Apache Indians for bounty money in south Texas and northern Mexico).The main theme throughout the story is violence and there is a subtle argument being made concerning the place of war in human nature. Instead of blatantly stating an opinion, McCarthy allows the debate to be played out between the Kid and the Antagonist, Judge Holden. What makes this debate interesting is that McCarthy accepts violence as a part of human nature, and instead explores whether pure unnecessary violence is in humanity, or if violence is a purely defensive instinct. In this quest to learn the nature of human violence, McCarthy pits the Kid (who commits extreme violence in his own right, in self-defense or when goaded on by others within his group), against the Judge (who sees violence as a redeeming value, and necessary to human existence).It is hard to decide which point of view on violence prevails in the end, and what happens at the end of the story is, itself, up for interpretation. The real joy of this book is reading McCarthy propose each side of the argument in a beautiful and haunting narrative. As with most McCarthy stories, this book is dark and disturbing at times with scenes of extremely vivid and gruesome violence, and dialogue that makes the reader question her beliefs on human nature. In the end this is a great American novel based in the expanse and freedom of the great American West, ranging from Nacogdoches to El Paso to Chihuahua City (Yes, I know this is not technically part of the American West) to San Diego. In all his travels the Kid cannot find what he is looking for (namely peace), just as Dean Moriarty is unable to find what he is trying to find in his cross-country travels in one of the most iconic American novels, On the Road. (I know this comparison could be fleshed out a great deal more, but I am trying to keep this post somewhat short.)After finishing Blood Meridian, I am reminded that Cormac McCarthy is not only one of the greatest writers in general, but one of the great messiahs of the modern western. When considering his body of work in the genre, which includes classics such as the Border Trilogy, No Country for Old Men, and the book which I have just finished, McCarthy can only be compared with the greats such as Louis L'Amour and Larry McMurtry. If you are not a squeamish reader, and enjoy a book with incredible narrative interwoven with strong moral and philosophical questions, then this should be high on your list of to-read books.Check out my blog about movies, books, and music, [....]"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Poe is fantastic!

So horrific and the narrative really makes you feel there. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Blood Meridian is like Dante's descent into hell, but without Virgil. There is no guide to tell us the thoughts of the damned. It's a very existential novel, like those of Dashiell Hammett, in which we are told of events and what the characters say about them but not what they think about them. We are shown only the surface, the existence but not the essence. But unlike Hammett, McCarthy shows us this surface in the most vivid and excruciating detail, and in a poetic language recalling Faulkner, Melville, Lautr&eacute;amont and the Bible. It's a great book but a terrible one, not for the squeamish or faint of heart. As in The Inferno, the Devil is at the bottom of the pit, in this case an erudite albino giant known as the judge.It's a picaresque novel based on the historical exploits of the Glanton gang, a group of scalp hunters working the Texas-Mexico border in the late 1800s. It follows a trail of blood from one massacre to another, a devastating indictment of Manifest Destiny. The brutality of the gang is not only directed toward their victims, the Indians and Mexicans, but even toward each other. You can't help but feel that this indeed was the way it was in the Old West, and the way it will be again if our fragile technologically supported social structure should collapse, as happens in The Road, another McCarthy novel.Some readers have seen Gnostic symbolism in Blood Meridian, but in Gnosticism there is ultimately a balance between good and evil. Here evil is existence itself, and if there's an essence of good holed up somewhere it has left no scent. As at the end of McCarthy's play \\"The Sunset Limited,\\" we are left with the suspicion that there is no essence at all, only this desiccated and terrifyingly beautiful surface, this \\"Evening Redness in the West.\\"At the end of this one, even that surface is too terrible to be shared with the reader, so that our imagination makes it much worse than anything the author could have described. I think that hole in the narrative is a metaphor for the emptiness that is McCarthy's true subject."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Legendary author Cormac McCarthy has created a cross continental chamber of horrors in his work \\"Blood Meridian\\".

The main reason to plunge into this book--which is horrifyingly violent from start to finish--is to look at a culture of violence from within. The Kid is swept up into the world of the Glanton gang as though he was born for it. The wasteland of the southwest--as painted by McCarthy with dizzyingly wide expanses of desert, strewn with human and animal carcasses, and blood red sunsets--is downright phantasmagoric. There is no consoling shoulder for the reader to cry on in \\"Blood Meridian\\". There is no character to turn to to reaffirm the goodness inherent in men's hearts. There is only the Judge--an awesome creation, quite supernatural, whose meditations on the perpetuation of war and violence are as chilling as the physical brutality he dispenses throughout the novel. It is a demanding book, but it is not difficult for the attentive reader. McCarthy's prose is archaic, sparse, and beautiful.

Some of the more modern Western films had begun to explore this territory when the book was published in 1985 - many of Clint Eastwood's films spring to mind - creating a West where the \\"hero\\" is just the least bad person in the film. Even then, though, there are still undercurrents of the nobility of the cowboy, out to tame a savage land for the good of a civilization that will no longer need him when it's done.This book features characters who are violent and vicious, thieves and murderers who will stop at nothing to get what they want. It starts with the nameless Kid, a young man who joins a group of bounty hunters riding the US-Mexico border in the years before the Civil War. They're ostensibly looking for Apaches, bringing back scalps for gold, but they're not especially picky. Any black head of hair ripped from the head of its owner will do, and if that means ravaging some small Mexican villages, then so be it.The bounty hunters are led by Judge Holden, a man who gladly takes his place as the antithesis of everything that was supposed to be right and good about the old west. In both form and philosophy, Holden is barely human, and he only becomes less human as the book goes on. Insofar as the book has an antagonist, it is he.He contrasts greatly to our ostensible protagonist, The Kid, in many ways. For one, the Judge has a name. For another, the Kid routinely disappears from the story for pages at a time, only to reappear to get to the next stage of the story. It's actually very easy to forget that the Kid is in the book, until you see him again and think, \\"Oh yeah. Him.\\"The Judge, on the other hand, is impossible to miss. He holds court out in the wilderness and expounds upon his philosophy of the world. He is huge and pale and clean, standing out amongst the filthy and starving band of killers that he's assembled. Whenever he's off-stage, you find yourself wondering when he's going to show up again, and how much worse things will get when he does.Another image that McCarthy decides to destroy is that of the Native Americans as being honorable heroes, out to save their land from white invaders. Just as the cowboys of old were not all knights on horseback, the natives of old were not all noble savages who resorted to violence only as a last resort. The Apaches - and other native Americans in this book - are just as violent and bloodthirsty as their American and Mexican counterparts. Everyone, regardless of background, ultimately resorts to violence and savagery, throwing aside all morality in the name of either profit or survival, or simply the demonic glee of seeing things destroyed. No one comes out of this book looking good or ultimately redeemed. All are villains.All of this made it something of a tough read for me. Not because of the scenes of horrifying violence - I can deal just fine with those - but because there was no one I wanted to like. I mean, I was fascinated by The Judge, but with that same kind of fascination that made me watch tsunami videos or that made people visit Ground Zero in New York City. It's horror on a scale that we hope never to experience in our own lives, but we can't look away.Without someone to like, it was hard to care, and when it's hard to care about a book, I find reasons not to read it. The writing was amazing, don't get me wrong. McCarthy's use of language was a joy to read, even if his refusal to use quotation marks got me a little annoyed from time to time, and I sometimes found myself reading passages out loud in the voice of Sam Elliott. In describing the landscapes of the West, McCarthy turns nature itself into a character, one that is every bit as violent, dangerous and hateful as the humans traversing it.In addition, he does a very good job with the pacing of the book. The narration tends to grow as the book goes on, with sentences becoming longer and more elaborate as they unspool across the page, some taking a page or two to themselves, only to be stopped short by a single line or a rapid exchange. It's hypnotic in places, and something I wish I knew how to do half as well.All that aside, though, the only thing that really kept me going - other than the writing - was morbid curiosity. That, and the hope that I would figure out what McCarthy was trying to say in the book. What it all means.And that, friends and neighbors, is one of the pitfalls of being an English teacher. Always looking for meaning in things, for the bigger picture, the author's Big Message to his readers. And as far as I can tell, McCarthy's message is that man is a savage, terrifying animal, capable of cruelties that the average book-buying person cannot even begin to contemplate. The horrors that are depicted here are so brutally displayed and so viscerally described that we eventually become numb to them - which is a new horror by itself. There are things depicted in this story which should evoke nothing less than absolute moral condemnation, a rejection that such things should be possible to contemplate, much less carry out.So when you find yourself glossing over these horrors as though they were mundane, it's jarring. As you read, you want to keep a distance from the monsters populating the book, but isn't ignoring their evils a kind of acceptance? And do you really want to be the kind of person who accepts these things? At the same time you're trying to convince yourself that real people shouldn't be capable of the acts you're reading about, you end up accepting them.Maybe that was what McCarthy wanted all along - for the readers to look at how we view violence and what our understanding of it really is. To force us to re-assess the limits of what we will tolerate and why. To make us look again at our heroes and villains and try to figure out exactly what the differences are, and whether we are really that far removed from them.Or maybe McCarthy just really likes writing this kind of thing.Either way, it's a fascinating read, one that will linger with you long after you've finished the book.--------------------------\\"In the days to come the frail black rebuses of blood in those sands would crack and break and drift away so that in the circuit of a few suns all trace of the destruction of these people would be erased. The desert wind would salt their ruins and there would be nothing, neither ghost nor scribe, to tell any pilgrim in his passing how it was that people had lived in this place and in this place died.\\""},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"At what point are you giving something an overwhelmingly positive review because you want to believe that you, like all the \\"illuminated ones\\", understand this book?On the other hand, what constitutes a \\"good book\\" in your mind? Is it a book that keeps you turning the pages? Is it a book with a clear message? What about character development, or how long after you finish the book do you keep thinking about it?For me, an average reader with average intelligence and average education, I find myself somewhere between awe inspired and indignant. One could call the prose pretentious with its run on sentences, odd, archaic words, and lack of quotations. However, if you consider that the author is an old curmudgeon and likely somewhat insane, and at the very least has little regard for \\"writing rules\\", then you can see that the prose is actually quite beautiful and communicates a depth of feeling about things you dont typically find in modern works.The characters remain a mystery. The message is obscure. The prose is a battle to get through, and you will need a dictionary on hand if you hope to have any comprehension of what the hell the author is talking about.And yet, you will find yourself thinking about this book long after you flip that last page. It will bother you on some deep level that either the author is being intentionally vague, or maybe he is just dicking with the reader and we are all just making up deep meanings behind a book about men being the animals they are.

Though I am not really sure why..."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"From the opening sentence, \\"See the child,\\" I was hooked. The way Cormac paints pictures with words is amazing. You find yourself pulled into the harsh world that \\"the boy\\" who later becomes \\"the man\\" is forced to survive within. I guess the meat and potatoes of the story is when he joins up with Judge Holden and his gang of ruthless scalpers. I have to add that The Judge seems to have similarites to that of Anton Chigurh from No Country. There is also the imagery of fire and the well-life-goes-on elements added and his run-on sentences. I'm thinking they are something of Cormac's little signatures, along with his stripped-down style with no quotation marks and almost no punctuation other than commas, periods, and colons.I have to say, this book took me some time to read. Not because I'm a really slow reader (I'm not a really fast reader either) but because some of the gruesome images and scenes really turned me off. I almost didn't finish it. But, I figured: What didn't kill me would only make me stronger. So, just like the kid, I sucked it up and pressed on. Not to belabor the point, but some of the scenes are pretty darn sick. But, I suppose no sicker than what you see on the news or what isn't reported.Any fan of gritty dog-eat-dog westerns, shoot 'em ups, coming of agers, cryptic dialogue, or serious novelists should find it captivating, if not downright sobering. It's the kind of book where you'll wipe your forehead with a rag and catch your breath once you finish the last page. It's beautifully written to say the absolute least. Very poetic and stimulating. You really get lost within the book. And there is a lot in terms of philosophy and meaty food for thoughtThe ending is quite moving. In fact, I don't think I've ever read an ending quite like it. It definitely blew my mind, that's for sure.Lastly, I've only read The Road and No Country, so I can't say if this is his \\"master piece.\\" So far, I think it's a good read that anyone serious about novels should check out, but it's honestly not my favorite of McCarthy. I think he went a little overboard with similes at times, and the book may be a little bit longer than necessary. But, things that are exhaustive, if done effectively, are usually worth the effort. Blood Meridian pays off more than gold or scalps. You'll be pretty numb afterward. I was anyway.

According to me, McCarthy is the best living American writer today. Give the man his Nobel already."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"McCarthy's fact-based tale of Old West violence is a bleak yet compelling read. As in his Border Trilogy, the reader is occasionally harangued by a character's long-winded philosophizing, but here it makes more sense and is more organic to the story. The conclusion, however, is out of left field and gratuitously ambiguous. All in all, I think it's worth the read, although the ending is disappointing."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I read a range of book types: true classics (dickens, Austin, Dumas), more modern classics (Roth, Wolfe, Updike, Steinbeck), and recent literary authors (eugenides, Lamb, Michael Cunningham)...but also best seller-type authors like Stephen King and Picoult.So I'd put McCarthy somewhere in the recent literary authors category. Certainly blood meridian will be considered a classic for future generations. When reading Blood meridian, it had aspects similar to when I read old classics, in that I often employed the Kindle's dictionary to look up the archaic words that McCarthy employs. He obviously did his research when writing this...using terminology from the time and place. I wish that Kindle could decipher the Mexican phrases, though. Those took more work for me.I'd truly give this 3.5 stars, but I tend to be generous and I'll round up....I've read two other McCarthy books: The Road, and No Country for Old Men...and I'd place this one third compared with those. Now, he wrote Blood Meridian 20 years earlier than those two works, so maybe this isn't a fair comparison. Or maybe it is because I'm a woman, and the relationship bw son and father is more interesting to me than guns, rocks and desert. I can certainly see why people are struck by this book...he has a way with interpretation and description...a way of making an arrangement of boulders, or a pool of blood seem to speak volumes about gods and men. But it does get a little much after a while. I would say 30% of this book is descriptions of scenery..mountains, deserts, rocks, horses, blood, dead bodies, guns, dirt etc etc. Interesting descriptions at first but after a while it gets to be droning and repetitive. At least the characters traveled through varying environments. Most characters are ignorant, greedy and gutless. No one is admirable. Even the Judge, who first appears more intelligent than others, reveals himself as a gutless charlatan who simply has a flair for words. As in The Road, there is nothing to really hope for..although in The Road (and NCFOM), there were at least people to cheer for. There are no such characters here. I can understand that for the story he wanted to tell..maybe having men with no hope or pride is part of the point. But for me at least, it made for a less interesting read."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This is an amazing, yet incredibly complex book.It was hard enough to read this book and get an understanding; I am not going to review it. I will give advice. Seek out secondary sources (peer reviewed) of information on this book. Its a big help. Due to the lack of a cohesive, unified interpretation of this book scholarly articles abound and for this I was grateful. Why exactly? BM is a revisionist western that heavily parodies the mythical Western, as well as the Manifest Destiny. It is incredibly ambiguous work, loaded with allegory, and subtleties whose recognition depends on prior knowledge. This makes for a tough read.If you are not up for the intellectual challenge of this book may I suggest you read \\"The Road\\" or \\"No Country for Old Men\\".

Every time I read it, I notice something I didn't notice before. The closest way I can describe how it \\"feels\\" is that it's something like what you would see if you went hiking in the desert, dropped acid and then were bitten by a rattlesnake and left to wander in a state of dreaming hallucination and delirium.

I've already read it twice and I plan to read it many more times throughout my life because it is such an entertaining and enigmatic book that enthralls you in a number of ways.

He is a brilliant writer and I believe that this book deserves more attention. Why this isn't on 12th grade reading lists is beyond me. McCarthy takes everything you know about literature and he turns it upside down in this breathtaking western-inspired drama. I just bought a copy of this for nephew. This is a book that every young reader should be aware of. Many argue that McCarthy's style is alienating but I must disagree. McCarthy's style is an American style that we should be sensitive to. Unfortunatley, many people read McCarthy way too fast and deny themselves the pleasure of getting lost in his stories. I recommend this without any hesitation whatsoever. I guarantee that this will be one of the most interesting books you will ever read. To describe the book any more would spoil it. A great American novel."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian is both exquisite and horrific. Though not for the weak-minded or faint-hearted, this book is pure poetry. McCarthy's writing style is unmatched, flowing seamlessly from Faulknerian sparsity to intricately detailed descriptions reminiscent of Hemingway. Set in a literal blood meridian, the plot focuses on a young man's journey through a metaphorical blood meridian from childhood to adulthood. The real story, however, is the development of the ambiguous Judge. Is he God? Is he Satan? Is he simply Other? It doesn't matter -- at over 300 pages, Blood Meridian seems over too quickly."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Rendered in prose as searing as it is hypnotically holy, Cormac McCarthy's BLOOD MERIDIAN is a revelation. Based on a dubious autobiographical account of the mid-19th century misadventures of one Samuel Chamberlain, Capt. John Glanton and Judge Holden, as anti-Moses and anti-Aaron, lead their flock of mainly ignorant sociopaths through scorched southwestern desert landscapes, where every living thing preys desperately and viciously upon every other, where trees are decorated with dead babies, where churches are graveyards, where what isn't burning is already burnt, and God has cinched his saddle and left for better prospects. The protagonist--if that word may be used at all here--is a fourteen year-old recalcitrant runaway from Tennessee called simply \\"the Kid,\\" who all but disappears from considerable portions of the middle text only to reappear at the end in some of the most perfectly disturbing writing since Kafka and Kosinski. Unrelenting brutalities appear on nearly every page, hemorrhaging nihilism and the sorts of violence most writers would never consider handling no matter how hungry they got, violence McCarthy neither glorifies or denounces.While I've not read any professional criticisms of BLOOD MERIDIAN, it seems to me the key to understanding the book is through Judge Holden. Murderous, sodomizing, hairless, ageless, Satanically-prancing giant, the Judge is a philosopher priest of the very worst kind and an ingenious incarnation of the Gnostic Rex Mundi, King of the World, undying landlord of this diseased and wicked planet. Only evil reigns here, the evil of a purely material world, the few enlightened acolytes among us understanding the necessary divisions between this world and the divine one above. We are here because this is what we deserve while our ignorance and wantonness goes unchecked.The classic dualism by way of the Gnostic Cathars describes an endless, uncompromising war between compassion and power, a world so devoid of grays that the two endeavors simply cannot co-exist. (Hint enough when McCarthy gives Holden a fine firearm engraved with that old enigmatic and incomplete Latin phrase \\"Et in Arcadia Ego.\\" Unless McCarthy harbors a strange passion for the paintings of Nicolas Poussin, I'd say he'd perused a copy of Baigent, Leigh, and Lincoln's HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL, where all things Cathari, Gnostic, and Arcadian are given full pseudo-historical shrift. The book predates McCarthy's by three full years.) Through this ancient lens then, Holden is priest supreme and this sinful smoking world is his altar. Like Christ, he speaks in parables, often punctuated by shocking declarations. Cynically, he instructs the men, \\"If God meant to interfere in the degeneracy of mankind would he not have done so by now?\\" More heretically still: \\"Whatever in creation exists without my knowledge exists without my consent.\\" Hints of hidden powers.Stylistically, I do understand comparisons made to Melville, if only because both men knew best when to adopt a quasi-biblical tone. Comparisons to Faulkner, however, escape me. McCarthy's main influence here is clearly Hemingway. A pervasive myth has come down to us of Hemingway's almost exclusive use of short terse sentences, composed of monosyllabic words wherever possible. The moment one actually reads Hemingway, though, the myth is dispelled. Hemingway artfully interspersed his hard punctuated prose with sentences of sometimes amazing length and active descriptive qualities. These longer sentences were always managed conjunctively through substituting the word \\"and\\" for any other possible punctuation. The aim here is the establishment of a rhythm, rhythm that gathers force and even velocity over the life of the sentence. In any work of art, rhythm counts, perhaps more than any other single factor. Joyce and Hemingway knew this the same way Shakespeare did four centuries ago and as McCarthy does now.In the final analysis, I would easily rank this work among the very best of the 20th century. Hell. Any century. Like all the finest literature (like old Judge Holden himself), it refuses to age, becoming a part of you and a true measure for all to come."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I add my awe to the sentiments already posted: simply, a beautifully written book, a long poem seeking to enlighten the descendants of some of the bravest and basest people to ever live. I love the heritage, the romanticized version of the history of this country, but if this McCarthy book was taught in schools, we'd all have a more sober view of our origins. I am intrigued by a book filled with characters that I neither like nor sympathize with; it's the mark of an artist to populate a world with misfits and miscreants and still create something totally involving, hypnotizing, and compelling. Hats off to Mr. McCarthy."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Cormac McCarthy skillfully uses the power of word to weave an intricate and terrifying piece of poetry called Blood Meridian or the Evening Redness in the West. The title provides telling clues to the subject of the book, which is based on a true story of the Glanton Gang. It is a bloody epoch of horror associated with the trials and tribulations of the Glanton Gang who rode south of the border to peddle scalps for profit and glory.A nameless orphan or the Kid as he is known throughout Blood Meridian is released from a Mexican jail only to find himself a member of a gang hunting Apaches for bounty. There is no glory to be found in his travels with the gang. One bloody mishap layers upon another, each told with McCarthy's unfailing lyricism, until the reader slowly realizes there is no escape from this heart of darkness. The kid may well have fared better in the Mexican jail.The glorified myth of the manifest destiny of the nation is skillfully torn asunder by McCarthy. There is no immaculate history. By the vision of the Blood Meridian it was a gang of social lepers doing their best to earn a little gold and silver without once considering morality or the value of life.Words of warning are necessary for those considering reading this book. It is not for the soft hearted or those with weak stomachs. An example of a scene typical of the book, after purchasing two puppies from a child one member of the gang casually tosses them from a bridge into the stream below while another shoots them.Truthfully despite the McCarthy's beautiful and lyrical writing and the scope and magnitude of story, I considered carefully if it deserved the five stars, because of the extreme violence of the book. How does one tell a story of violence without including it?"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Blood Meridian will become an American classic. It will stand along with Twain's Huckleberry Finn and Melville's Moby Dick as an epic evocation of American culture. The kid is Huck Finn gone bad, Huck Finn without the civilizing influence of Widow Douglas, Aunt Polly, or the moral example of Jim. The Judge, a hulking, hairless albino, without soul or conscience, evokes Melville's white whale, a symbol of absolute evil. These characters along with a host of others ride the blood red dust of the Sonoran desert, McCarthy's Mississippi and Atlantic. McCarthy is not a moralist, like Twain or Melville, but he does demand that the reader reflect the characters and action upon the history of violence in America past and present. (I couldn't help but relate Blood Meridian to Gangs of New York, which share both theme and character.)Blood Meridian is a literary masterpiece and a page turner. Not many books can reach that distinction.The story is archetypal and mythical, but the style and narration are objective and naturalistic, the great periods of American literature, romance,realism, naturalism, and minimalism are all represented in the texture of this novel. McCarthy is a masterful stylist reminiscent of both Faulkner and Hemingway. His language is objective, vivid, and mesmerizing. And nowhere is there a better literary rendering of the topology and geology southwestern deserts in than this book. While the experience of reading this novel is unique, I also think it would make a great American film."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Blood Meridian is not a bad book. Let's get that out of the way from the get-go. Well and all, about half way through the thing, I found myself getting restless and impatient with page after page of metaphor heavy prose describing one desert landscape after another and one thunderstorm after another. I get it, the sun is hot and a body gets mighty thirsty without it and lightning in the distance is impressive and ominous. The book is, at heart, a morality play pitting \\"the kid\\" against \\"the judge\\" so why the lengthy detour into descriptions of local flora and fauna? The center of the novel, the part where it seems most negative reviewers gave up, is almost a first draft of \\"The Road\\" with a band of violent stragglers wandering through a bleak landscape of desolation and blood. But as far as I can tell, this has NOTHING to do with the tale being told. McCarthy just kind of wanders off into an adjective heavy haze and his keen sense of poetic and colloquial language (some passages of the book just scream to be read aloud) spins wildly out of control. The book starts well and, once it settles back down, ends well, but there is a huge tract of text that reminds one of the whaling chapters in \\"Moby Dick\\" in their irrelevance to the tale being told. This is a 200 page novel crammed into 330+ pages. So my advice is just skip the middle hundred pages. Here is the synopsis--Glanton and his party wander around Mexico killing and scalping, first Indians and then, Mexicans, as they wear their clothes and horses out across countless miles of desert. That's it. That's all that happens. You have just \\"read\\" the entire center section of \\"Blood Meridian\\" and didn't have to endure the exhaustive vocabulary. Around page 200, where Glanton and his men hijack a ferry, the kid and the judge once again become central figures in the tale and the story hunkers down into a taut battle of wills and philosophies. It is funny to note that in this final act of the book, when things really start moving, McCarthy all but abandons his mind bending twists of phrase and poetic language. There is too much actual story to tell. Although it is touted as one of his most \\"important\\" works, this is not nearly as good as other books by the same author. It isn't that this book isn't (as the cover blurb on my copy suggests) a masterpiece, because there is certainly a masterpiece huddling down in there somewhere--it is simply that you have to work too hard to unearth it."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I will start briefly by treating the two most common criticisms of this book: 1) Excessive violence, and 2) Excessive \\"verbiage\\" for lack of a better word. First, the book does have enormous violence within...if you can't get over that, you're not going to like it, but you'll never be able to read Dante's Inferno either so I feel sorry for you. Its just words on a page, people. Second, what can you say about the \\"wordy\\" argument (more specifically, too many archaic or unusual words); it reminds me of a scene in Amadeus where someone criticizes Mozart as having written \\"too many notes.\\" Modern life tends to want to streamline and compress everything down to \\"the essentials,\\" but this is literature, not a tech. manual, and if you think that's a legitimate criticism, you need to go watch TV and forget reading.Blood Meridian has the trappings of the western genre, but certainly has little in common with your typical western a la Louis L'Amour. It is to a western what Moby Dick is to a sea-adventure story.The challenge of the book is trying to understand the philosophy behind it. Many will find it nihilistic; while I can't rule out that possibility, I suspect that there is a very subtle philosophy driving it. Gnosticism is one candidate, as one analyist of this book has pointed out. The book's bizarre and beautiful epilogue may indicate this, with the solitary traveler \\"striking the fire out of the earth that God put there\\" while the bulk of humanity lurches confused behind him. Another is \\"historicism\\" by which I mean that McCarthy is simply trying to point out certain very deep and signicant facts about human beings that will forever be beyond reform. McCarthy seems to lead the reader in this direction, with one of the prologues pointing out that evidence has been found of scalping tens of thousands of years ago, as well as the historical veracity of the book, based mostly on true events.In the end, it is the character of the Judge that sets the book apart. He is War Incarnate, a caricature of human rationality without any real feeling, capable of acts of tenderness and great intellect while at the same time capable of producing enormous brutality, murder and depravity. He is a holy man of sorts, with war as his religion. (\\"If war isn't holy, man is nothing but antic clay.\\") There was a real-life Judge Holden who shared many characteristics with the literary one, but this Holden exists mainly on a metaphysical level. He attempts to categorize and systematize everything around him so he may then \\"erase it from the memory of man.\\" He speaks all languages, is an expert in many scientific fields, is a convincing naturalist (\\"...books lie, but God can be found...in rocks and plants...in the bones of things.\\")The Kid, the \\"lens\\" of the story, becomes a sort-of hero by staying outside the Judge's reach through his ambivalence, something that the Judge (and no philosophy, religion, political system) can survive against. So the Judge, after a lifetime of trying to convert him, simply snuffs him out in the outhouse at the end of the book.Violence is a part of us, and the modern world's attempt at erasing it will fail. The Judge will live forever, unfortunately, because we can only be what we are, flawed creatures born out of a flawed earth. At best, we can be like the man in the epilogue, doing our best to \\"strike the fire out of the earth\\" that God placed there, forever searching for strands of goodness while having to cope with our flawed nature. Poets and writers the calibre of McCarthy are out front, showing us glimpses of truth if only we'll listen."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I mean it. I know there's already been a lot said about this book. My two cents is, this is amazingly written. The insights are surprising and astounding. Enjoy. And if you haven't guessed, it's NOT an easy read!"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"So I'm in a bit of a love/hate relationship with Cormac McCarthy. Absolutely loved the Road, which was my real first foray into his writing, although I had seen a couple of movies done after his books. Thought I'd dive into another of his novels and Blood Meridian seemed to be a favorite amongst his fans, and I also had a friend recommend this book to me. Truthfully, I read about 3/4 of the way through and just eventually became so fatigued I had to stop reading it. I just didn't care anymore. There is no story, character development, or really any point whatsoever that I can find anywhere in this book. The writing style, while McCarthy is often a bit unconventional, is just incredibly hard to follow. It seems like about 75% of the book is describing in vivid detail either 1) The landscape and flora where the characters are traveling 2) Gore. Other than that, there really just isn't much here. It's incredibly verbose, oddly written with no standard use of common punctuations, meandering, aimless. Really, I'm not really sure what there is to enjoy here. A really boring, pointless story (other than trying to derive some deeper meaning from endless violence) that never builds or grips the reader at all. An epic bore."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Keeps you on your toes and you just can't put it down, makes you stop and think about the world"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Harold Bloom is right about Cormac McCarthy: he really does wear his influences on his sleeve. His language has all the dark brooding of Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor's tang of Gothic surrealism. For me, the real pleasure of this book, my first novel by McCarthy, was the language. There are magnificent descriptions of deserts, mountains, animals, and the blindness we encounter when we forgive, or perhaps even when we remember, our human moral sense. This isn't in any way a plot-driven novel; in fact, nothing much happens in way of action at all. It is just a story of a kid - that's actually his name - who runs away from home at a tender age and travels west to join up with a gang patrolling the Texas-Mexico border. \\"Patrolling\\" is a bit of a formal word for a group of vagabonds who have been commissioned to bring back the scalps of Indians, but there it is. They wander and wander and wander, heading west aimlessly.But it is an fascinating group of characters, including a spiritually lost ex-priest named Tobin and Judge Holden, a seven-foot tall, muscular, completely hairless man who has some demonic affinities, though I'm not so sure he's actually meant to be the Devil himself (or a symbol thereof), as many others seem to think. For all his caprice and cruelty, he may well be one of the most human people in the group. McCarthy also gives the Judge an inferiority that he completely deprives the other characters of. He knows several languages, is extraordinarily well-read, and often waxes philosophically about subjects that leave others disconcerted and confused. He has a tremendous intelligence and ability to reason, but often uses these for the ends of violence, deceit, and bloodshed. Isn't Judge Holden, then, the model not for the Devil, but for human beings themselves?And there is the violence, which is sometimes difficult to bear. One of the major characters wears a necklace made of desiccated Indian ears; Judge Holden spends one night comforting a young Indian boy to gain his trust, only to be found the next morning scalping the boy in flagrante delicto. McCarthy's repetitive scenes of shootings and scalping have a peculiar way of becoming - even to type it feels eerie - boring. It is morally and sometimes even aesthetically desensitizing. This is certainly part of McCarthy's purpose, too. I suppose complaints about human psychology, though, might fall on deaf ears.Most everything you've likely already heard about this novel is true. It is violent. It is bloody and full of gore. And, perhaps most painfully, it doesn't apologize for being either of these. Surprisingly, though, many readers seem to want an apology for what Cormac McCarthy has chosen to write about here. If you read a summary of the novel, you know you will, at the very least, read about scalping. It seems to me that you're doing the book a real disservice if you're a reader who can't stand to read about violence like this, but goes on to knock it precisely because of that. This is like reading \\"The Compleat Angler,\\" and writing a review saying \\"It was great, but I don't really like fishing - I give it two stars.\\" If you can't stomach large doses of violence, this book simply isn't for you. You won't enjoy it. But for your sake as a potential reader, I hope that's not the case. There's a lot to enjoy here including the spectacular writing, and plenty to keep you up thinking at night."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"One of the great American novels of the century? I liked it, and it certainly moved along, but it didn't move me. I didn't even like it as much as \\"All the Pretty Horses.\\" The whole world view of McCarthy's novels (based on these 2, and having seen the film of \\"No Country for Old Men\\") is too bleak and soul-less for me."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"A well told tale of horrible men doing awful things. The author tells it complete with an antique vocabulary and a scriptural cadence reminiscent of Old Testament slaughter in an ancient desert. It is relentlessly dry and dusty, and creaks along like an ungreased wagon wheel as it meanders through a landscape punctuated by blood and human degradation. It conjures a huge hollow vastness of nature that men inhabit as unwelcome aliens sheltering from inhospitable night.The judge presides over it: a lunatic Nephilim, bleak philosopher, cynical scientist, sexual psychopath, and metaphysical trickster. He is the echo of a repressed Gnostic dream that barely comes into focus before it dissolves again into half-remembering. The poetry of his pronouncements leaves us agape at his acuity and wit despite his obvious moral vacuity.It is a novel that is worth reading but it is not for the young. Its truth is lost to the optimism of youth. The kid is doomed right from birth. Why should the guileless young be expected to accept this fatalism as truth? They can't, nor should they, accept it. That is for the others, those devoured by time, to harbor secretly."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Another poster mentioned that he/she had a hard time starting another book after finishing this one. I had a similar experience. After Blood Meridian I picked up a more light-hearted novel as a sort of antidote to the desolate feeling I'd been left with. But the carefree tone of the next book just seemed so... inauthentic in comparison.McCarthy's writing style, as many others have mentioned, is so austere and ascetic that it would take me a moment to realize I'd just read of a blood-curdling incident. In most novels, certain scenes of violence are described in lurid detail and go on for pages. In this one, the author uses one paragraph or even one sentence to tell you what horrifying thing just happened (\\"They saw babies hung in the tree.\\") He also has his characters evince no emotion to the bloody scenes they come across or perpetrate, and for this reason, I found that I myself started to become numb to the violence. For the first few brutal scenes I'd put the book down momentarily, shuddering. Eventually, I'd read about vicious goings-on rather dispassionately, maybe taking on the anesthetized sensibilities of the characters.But he also writes about beauty in the same aloof, unemotional way. The moon and sky in particular: he evokes images with so few words that I was sort of in awe!I'd wager that most readers of the novel were intrigued mostly with the Judge. Dead children were found or children disappeared mysteriously whenever the Judge was around, like a vampire feeding on their blood (or innocence). That was so chilling that I felt, well, physically chilled. When the Judge pontificated on Man's innate need for war (which is a hideous and disheartening thought) I felt that he represented most cultures' version of a devil, or Satan. It seemed that in the aftermath of a particularly sadistic occurrence he would be seen naked and dancing or sitting alone in the moonlight, as though gloating like, perhaps, Nero fiddling while Rome burned. There were quite a few scenes of the Judge celebrtating, in his perverse way, death and violence. My feeling that he represented Evil was cemented at the very end when he was dancing (naked, again) in triumph (over whatever it was he had done to the Kid) and gloating that he would never die. It's a very cynical view of the world (Evil will always be with us) but no other conclusion to a book like this would have rung true.I had trouble with a lot of the vocabulary. I'm a stickler for looking up a word I don't recognize, but by the twentieth time (and barely into the book, yet), I decided I could get by with just guessing, plus it was interfering with the flow of the read. I think sometime soon I'll read the book again and this time look up unfamiliar words.You will not be humming \\"Happy Trails To You\\" after reading this, and might actually resent any romanticized version of the Old West that you come across. I give 5 stars to any book that can make me think this much! Not to mention writing such a long review!(P.S. By pure coincidence I happend to see for the first time 3:10 to Yuma with Christian Bale and Russell Crowe right after reading this book. By my estimation, the events in the movie were set 20 years after the main action in Blood Meridian, and probably at the exact time of the novel's epilogue. Plus, it took place in some of the same areas the novel was set. It fascinated me, and might you, as well.)"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This is one of the hardest books I've read and one of the best. Allegedly based in large part on the murderous rampage of the John Joel Glanton gang through Chihuahua and surrounding Mexican states in the lat 1840s, Blood Meridian follows \\"the kid\\" who is a witness to, participant in, and nearly victim of rampant acts of human destruction. The brutality of the Comanches, Mexicans and Glanton gang is depicted in cold, stark terms, as is the unsettled wilderness of the American Southwest and Mexican Northwest just after the Mexican-American War. This is a violent book.The haunting figure of the tale is Glanton's No. 2, Judge Holden - aka The Judge. Rated as the #43 character in all of literature since 1900 by the now defunct Book Magazine, and underrated as the #36 all-time villain by The Telegraph, he strides about the novel dominating it every time he speaks or acts. He's 336 pounds (\\"24 stone\\"), seven feet tall, and hairless. He seems to derive energy from conflict, glories in the \\"dance\\" of violence, bloodshed and death, and for some strange reason had appeared in the life of every man in the Glanton gang, except one (an ex-priest), before the member joined it. In a gang of reprobates, murderers, rapists and barbarians, The Judge is feared by and disquieting to each other member of the gang. He is McCarthy's greatest literary creation: mesmerizing, revolting, terrifying, cold, calculating, philosophizing, strange.A fascinating, difficult, brutal and violent novel."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I can not name a novel which affected me more. Narrative about mercenaries and outcasts patrolling the SW US/ Mexico borders collecting renegade Comanche scalps for money. or at least that is where it starts. The US merc's are not the only evil presence. Characters are larger than life and some seemingly supernatural. Insanely violent without redemption, interleaved with the most poetic description of landscape and then the same poetic narration of unspeakable depravity. Some familiarity of Spanish is helpful. And as always McCarthy lack of punctuation takes some getting used to. I re read passages trying to fully understand the full intention. I am totally puzzled by the epilogue and it meaning. I am beginning my third re read with anticipation and dread. Would somebody please buy McCarthy a puppy. Not for the squeamish."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Widely considered to be McCarthy's masterpiece, Blood Meridian explores the same themes which reached a wide audience in his more recent worksThe RoadandNo Country for Old Men (Vintage International), both adapted for the screen in recent years. McCarthy presents a world of chaos, violence, and inhumanity, a bleak landscape peopled by mercenaries, malice, and violence. But just as his desolate vision and descriptions of the horrific violence which characterized the much mythicized \\"Old West\\" are interspersed with expertly rich and poetic language, what at first appears to be a cynical and wholly amoral worldview holds something deeper nestled within.The book follows the fictionalized exploits of the historical Glanton gang, a group of mercenaries hired to kill Apache Indians in Mexico after the Mexican-American wa. Throughout the book stands the enigmatic and frightening character of Judge Holden, who many reviewers see as the personification of evil and perhaps the Devil himself. While the Biblical tone of the book definitely suggests this interpretation, McCarthy is as always saying something about the very real manifestations of evil in a world often viewed through rose-colored glasses. Holden is in fact a typical, if exceptional, psychopath. He is ruthless, remorseless, intelligent and malicious. He is larger than life and embodies the psychopathic worldview. (SeeWithout Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among UsandPolitical Ponerologyfor more on the worldview of the psychopath.)Interestingly, McCarthy associates Holden with science and law. In Holden's hands both become tools of self-glorification bereft of any human feeling, the law simply a means to win, and science a means to conquer nature. But within the Holden-dominated landscape of the West, is the kid. Born under the Leonids, he is the only character with the seeds of a conscience, and even these are hidden and unexpressed in the majority of the book. And as the events build up to the famous ferry massacre, we learn that these very qualities are those which Holden seeks to destroy.Just as in The Road and No Country, McCarthy shows us, in his own inimitable style, the realities of life in this world. The dance of war is recurring, and now, just as then, the philosophy of psychopathy is the dominant ideology. And yet within this reality, conscience still lives. It is fragile, yet it persists. It is often destroyed and defeated, but it is what keeps us together and makes us human in an inhuman world. It is the fire that we hold inside, sheltered against the cold dark of \\"the world inside the devil.\\""},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"A dusty, hard-riding, cowboy version of The Heart of Darkness. Complete with a Kurtz!"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"He's caught some flack for it, but I believe that Leo Daugherty's review of this book (\\"Gravers False and True: Blood Meridian as Gnostic Tragedy\\") brought up some really good points. Scream 'philosophical eisegesis' if you want, but there are basic Gnostic concepts woven throughout the novel. In fact, if you embrace this, aspects of the novel might make a bit more sense.McCarthy is obviously enamored with Fate. So much so, that various characters (villains?) in his books are often more-or-less avatars of it. The Judge in Blood Meridian. The black-bearded man in 'Outer Dark.' Even (to a slightly lesser degree) Anton Chigurh in 'No Country For Old Men.' These characters are Fate, dressed up as Ahab. You wouldn't be too surprised if one of them skippered a boat named the 'Pequod.'None of them are a more straight-forward example of this than Judge Holden in Blood Meridian. He has to be one of THE MOST memorable characters (villains?) in English literature. The 'Judge' character, alone, is reason enough to read this novel. His horror as a human being is only surpassed (and indeed intensified) by his complete idealogical and physical stasis. He is antichrist, in a non-apocalyptic sense.Another 'character' that often pops up in McCarthy novels is the LAND, itself. Blood Meridian is certainly no exception. Painful detail is taken concerning the flow of the landscape, and every geological nuance the mind's eye encounters whilst traversing the Texas and Mexico countries; from snowy mountaintops to blistering desert to dormant volcanoes. It is as much a person in this book as the Kid or the Judge or even John Joel Glanton.Many one-star reviewers have lamented the fact that \\"there is nothing redeemable\\" about this book. I think, perhaps, they miss its literary debt to Greek tragedy. It is dark, and it's supposed to be. It is depressing, and it's supposed to be. It is offensive, and it's supposed to be. It's painful reading at times, and the prose lends to this. When the Kid is forced to walk through snow all night - unable to stop lest he freeze to death - the reader really feels the laborious intensity of such an undertaking. Some people like this painful (literary) hyperrealism. Some don't.Sorry to 'follow the crowd,' but I loved this book, warts and all. This book is epic. This book is a classic.This book is EVERYTHING AN AMERICAN WESTERN SHOULD BE."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Blood Meridian lays waste to its readers. Much is said about the violence in the book, which accumulates to such a scale that by the end the wreckage seems to be as large and as bleak as the land it takes place on, but the true reward of this book is the themes and symbolism that coat each page. It leaves you both devastated by the scope of its brutality and violence, and mezmorized at the beauty of the prose. Those of his who hold Gastby and his green light close to our hearts are hypnotized by the fireside lectures of the judge, looming large at the fire.My interest in Cormac McCarthy through the Coen's adaptation of No Country For Old Men, which made me mark his name down in the back of my mind. Then in the grocery store I saw The Road, sitting in their tiny book section, and decided to pull the trigger on the impulse buy. What a wonderful decision. I knew from the moment I noticed there were no chapters in the book, that the author appreciated pacing and atmosphere. After finishing The Road, I went looking online for other titles to pick up. Reading that Blood Meridian is considered to be in the top three of the best novels written in the past 50 years creates as effective a sales pitch as any other.This book is not for the Stephen King crowd. It is not for the Twilight crowd. It is for those who love books that make them think and reflect at length about all they know about evil and the very primal nature of humanity.This book is not easy to read. The uncompromising and indiscriminate violence of the book is so shocking that at times I found myself having to pause for five or ten minutes just to comprehend the cruelty and horror of what I'd just read. But those who persevere are rewarded with an examination of war and evil and violence that will echo in the quiet moments of your life, long after the book is covered with dust on its shelf or better yet loaned to a friend.If you love literature, read this book. The violence will cause people to read at differing paces, despite being only slightly longer than The Road, Blood Meridian took me nearly twice as long to read due to the violence. But keep going. It is very very rewarding."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Truly a LONG & SLOW read; twisted descriptions; mean evil characters.

For me, it's little more than a Spaghetti Western written in arty prose, some of the prose impressive (McCarthy is very good on landscape and corpses) but most of it just arty. There are no characters, no recognizable human beings who turn into cold-blooded killers (which could give the material the moral weight many attribute to it). No, it's only presences, silhouettes with names (the Kid, the Judge, the Captain), the shadows of character types we already know from movies, without any actors to flesh them out. I'm not a big fan of Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name, but boy did I miss him here. Now and then the book gets beyond the formula pleasures of a Sergio Leone movie to achieve the nightmare surrealism of EL TOPO, but I don't find that a good work of art either.

There is basically little if any plot. While Cormac McCarthy can write poetically, writing poetically about nothing is still nothing. It's like a million times zero is still zero. Most of the book is just one murder, slaughter, killing, massacre, beating, stabbing, shooting, scalping after another. It is an unrelentingly dark and depressing view of a time and place in history (Mexico and the southwest in the 19th century) without any redeeming happiness or hope. You cannot read this book from end to end without becoming depressed yourself. While I admire Mr. McCarthy's writing (see my wildly favorable review of NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), BLOOD MERIDIAN is not worth your time or the fourteen dollars the book costs. Don't contaminate your mind with this jumped-up short story."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"My first and last McCarthy book.

You really feel as though you have entered a living, breathing world in this novel. So why the hideous, quite pointles violence for scene after scene after scene? Is it just some immature impulse on the author's part to see how disgusting he can be? Is it an attempt to out-do the Bret Easton Ellises of this world? It's a shame that such an obviously talented author stoops to such repulsive imagery - the novel would have worked perfectly well without it. The concept of decency seems to have disappeared from modern American writing - apparently not even the finest luminaries are immune. I can hardly bear to say it, but if you think a work which features graphic descriptions of infants' heads being smashed open across rocks is still literature, then read it. Otherwise, there's really something lacking in someone who can publish this stuff without embarrassment."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This was a great romp through the old west in a way you wouldn't think.

This book is very poorly written with no consistent story line."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"What can be said about this novel that has not already been said? I finished it several weeks ago and have wanted to write a review ever since, but I've been hesitant due to the caliber of critics and readers who have written their own rave reviews.Some negative reviewers have criticized McCarthy's writing style. I can't put myself into that camp. I personally love his writing style. I'm not bothered by his (deliberate) flouting of grammar, or blatant use of archetypes, or even his strange disdain for quotation marks. I consider that to be a bit silly, but it's his novel and that's apparently the way he likes to write. I only found it confusing during one scene, where several men were speaking to each other and it was a little hard to tell who was addressing whom. After a single re-reading it became clear.Instead I came away from this novel with a profound feeling of sadness, as if the whole sorry spectacle of life was without purpose or meaning. Was that his intent? Perhaps, but in that case I'll still dock some points from his score. I don't expect the books that I read to be necessarily uplifting, but at least to me there must be some redeeming factor, some character who both exhibits some semblance of a moral compass and, just as important, does not meet with failure at every turn due to his moral compass.MINOR SPOILER ALERTIt was an interesting story, but it could have been immeasurably more powerful had there been some character who (for example) spent years tracking the Judge or the Captain down to exact some kind of justice. Even the character of the Kid has that potential, if perhaps in witnessing the atrocities committed by the band in Mexico, he had gone through some kind of personal development and dedicated his life to bringing those horrible men to justice.I say this because in my own experience, it does some miniscule damage to our psyches everytime we see or read about some terrible crime that goes completely unpunished. Whether it be reality or mere fiction (for how much more real is it to read about a crime happening to strangers in the newspaper, than to read about a crime in a work of fiction?), this merely servers to reinforce people's hopelessness and pessimism.So what is the purpose of this novel? Is it to show us how terrible and violent men can be? Why is that even necessary? To show acts of cruelty and horror without any attendant judgement or morality, no actual lessons are learned. Is it simply because those acts occurred at some point in history, thus there is an inherent value to reading about them? If that is the case, we would also be well served to read detailed descriptions of the Captain's bowel movements. If not, why not? It happens, after all, all around us, every day. If there is not inherent value in reading about an act simply due to it being 'reality,' then what magic value is attributed to an evil act?For my part, if this book had a character who worked to bring these men to justice it would have made it one of the best books that I have ever read. Perhaps a small group of Mexican soldiers, angry at how their people had been slaughtered and abused, searching the mountains and deserts for this band of outlaws. Or, as I mentioned earlier, maybe the Kid could have gone through some kind of personal growth and sought to make amends for his own crimes by hunting down the Judge and the remnants of his gang. Alas, no such characters were presented, making this novel simply one long display of cruelty and nihilsm."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This book was very discriptive of violence in the west at a time prior to the civil war inwitch there was very little law&order.Survival of man was through strength of ones self and violence.I read very little humanity of human nature in the book.could have had a better closing.I believe the book could have added a little more human kindness and a better ending."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I bought this book because it was a part of my creative writing workshop.

So my curiosity got the better of me and I read it.This book reminds me a lot of the Clint Eastwood movie \\"Unforgiven\\". The story is told in a very straightforward style with very little insight into the characters emotions, feelings, or motivations. Numerous other reviews describe this book as one of the most violent in American literature. I didn't think it was very violent at all. The violence is described very matter-of-factly. I wouldn't call it \\"gory\\" at all.McCarthy is a writer with a style from a bygone age and I really enjoyed his scenery discriptions. Overall, I enjoyed this read, but I'm not sure it belongs on a list of the top 21st century novels."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"What is there to say about the West during the 1800's. More animals roamed the earth, there was a great deal of friction among Native Americans, Mexicans, and other settlers, and the land that they all inhabited. And all of the current news we have today reflects not only a time of unrest, but a time of justified unrest. Similarly, we must take into consideration the authors of these situations and occurrences were mostly white upper class males.With hate-filled lives, \\"pioneers\\" meandered from town to town, in search of life; a more fulfilling, wealthier life, or simply, just a better one. Unbeknown to them, their history recorded under extreme prejudice and narrow scope, the inhabitants of America during this time were nonetheless violent. To what extent, we are left without a truly unbiased account. All we know is that it (or something), happened. IT was called Manifest Destiny-still \\"recalled\\" that way-as if such savage and ungodly acts could acquire a label at all, the word itself sort of a binary opposite. IT was publicized in papers and flyers, pointing lofty fingers at right and wrong measured by the color of skin or religious affiliation. The idea was set to \\"push West\\", to develop lands previously uninhabited by a white population. It was seen, then, as a \\"moral\\" authority to take over certain lands. However, seldom do we think about what was already there before these decisions were finalized. More particularly, who was destroyed in the path toward a bigger and better \\"America\\"?In his masterpiece Blood Meridian, a book that sends the reader undulating through a previously unheard of history, Cormac McCarthy explores Manifest Destiny like it's never been portrayed before in any textbook.McCarthy implies abstracting thinking to the doctrine in an effort to downplay the appalling nature of the idea; and yet exemplify the action that followed those who carried it out. Despite this being a fictional account, the reader may find themselves wondering, what if? By looking at this account of history through the eyes of three main aspects-actor, victim, and witness-the author shows that history is unfairly portrayed in learning atmospheres today.The book opens with a 14-year-old orphan searching for a better life. He is forced to volunteer to a small army to participate in attempts of \\"clearing\\" out the territory today known as Texas of Indians in further attempts to gain the West.Along for the ride is a band of men carrying out an idea that was first introduced by the manipulation of their abstract thinking, or lack thereof. They come across roads and plains drenched in blood and bodies, whetting their appetite for further destruction.McCarthy's most mythical character, and possibly one of the most mythical characters by representation in American literature, Judge Holden, is a sort of historian, interpreter, and savage in the most intimidating form.The Judge stands near seven feet tall and lacks all forms of hair on his body, adding to the already heavy feeling of surrealism. Because of his fluency in all languages, the Judge controls the flow and censorship of information to the rest of the army, even the captain of their small army.He carries around with him a small notebook, in which he writes or draws situations they encounter. After copying down a thought or sketching a bird or flower, the Judge destroys it. In doing so, he is portraying one of the main themes McCarthy is after. By producing his own account or interpretation, the Judge becomes an \\"authority\\". This coincides very closely with the idea that history has been sadly misinterpreted.The journey they embark on is one that will never be forgotten, one that maybe should not be forgotten, but looked at as an important part of American history.McCarthy rewards the reader countless times in Blood Meridian-so much so that with each page, the reader must deal with a number of centralized themes and ideas.Dip your mind into Cormac McCarthy's world. Swim in the reality of \\"how the West was won\\". Decide for yourself how valid the principles are that shaped the way Americans live and believe in today. Walk the line that formulated history despite prejudice and savagery, a line better known as Blood Meridian."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"The Road is one of my all time favorite books, and I have also read All the Pretty Horses. This book is a well reviewed book, and I came to it well aware that it was going to deal with the shameful time in history when money was paid for Indian Scalps. What I wasn't prepared for was one senseless act of violence after another, page after page after page. If this group of men met people, they were probably going to end up dead. Supposedly about a young boy who joins up with this violent group of men, he was often not mentioned, and it never discussed his thinking. I would have liked to have known how he felt about the carnage he was involved with. The ending was a big huh? You go figure it out. I have googled it to read discussions about the ending, and there seems to be no real consensus between the three likely outcomes. I liked the book at first, as I like McCarthy's style of writing, but I soon found that I had to force myself through the book, hoping for some sort of redemption, or at least a worth while message at the end, but I found none."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"As I read Blood Meridian, I jotted down words that were either unusual or new to me or familiar yet not quite recognizable. This is the case with every McCarthy book one reads - astonishment at the writer's extensive vocabulary. I've deliberately left out most of the directly Spanish terms or Mexican off-shoots. So, anyway, here is one list of words you need to know in order to read Blood Meridian thoroughly. Each reader can come up with a similar list, I am sure.THE LIST: swale; sprent; carbolic; coping (not the verb); swagged; chancel; sacristy; purlieu; awap; ramada; weskit; mortice; felloes; duledge; panniers; jornada; bistre; suttee; jacal; cantle; bandoliers; manciple; midden; revetment; charivari; imbreachment; withy; vidette; dunnage; thrapple; morral; selvage; lazarous; galena; sotol; kerf; stanched; tonsured; talus; vadose; ratchel; corbels; squailed; bated; slag; rebozo; almagre; fusil; carboy; malandered; gantlet (gauntlet?); flensed; quirt; thews; rill; luff; querent; aubergine; surbated; sark; playa; cassinette; scows; replivine; lemnisate; fulgurite; scrog; preterite (shades of Pynchon); gastine; marl; remuda; lobation; dap; cantonment; ignis fatuus; yaw; spangle; duff; escarpment; enfilade; rill; crenelated; roweled; rebus; esker; supernummeraries; serried; devenian; ristra; pulque; auger; archimandrite; thaumaturge . . .. . . . and the list could go on, for I'm skimming the surface here, not for this one novel alone, but all of them. I've compared the volabulary of recent Roth books and DeLillo books and others, and nothing comes close to the vastness of McCarthy's lexicon. And then, as I've mentioned already, there are all the Spanish words, the Latin. Reading McCarthy reminds me mostly of the prose in Beckett's MOLLOY trilogy. There too you reach for the dictionary every page or so. Same pace, poetic intensity, fury almost, fluidity, biblical density. (Let's not even think about Faulkner here!)At any rate, test the words on your friends if you like, or do nothing at all with them. Interesting all the same."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"There is no doubt that McCarthy is one of our best authors. His writing style is unique and memorable. Admittedly, I didn't much care for it at first, being a stickler for proper punctuation! But the short descriptive phrases definitely suit the story (and are honed to perfection in McCarthy's later book \\"The Road\\"). His prose is nothing short of brilliant. Blood Meridian was described by critics as one of McCarthy's best works, and it is, but is too disturbing to be actually liked by the reader. It is a dark, soulless story and leaves the reader hoping that all the characters will be killed off in spectacular fashion in the end. Thus, I was disappointed."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This book is haunting -- terrifying and beautiful. Read this excerpt. The main characters are attacking a column of mules packing mercury for the mines: &quot;Every man of them was firing point blank at the muleteers. They fell from their mounts and lay in the trail or slid from the escarpment and vanished. The drivers below got their animals turned and were attempting to flee back down the trail and the laden packmules were beginning to clamber white-eyed at the sheer wall of the bluff like enormous rats. The riders pushed between them and the rock and methodically rode them from the escarpment, the animals dropping silently as martyrs, turning sedately in the empty air and exploding on the rocks below in startling bursts of blood and silver as the flasks broke open and mercury loomed wobbling in the air in great sheets and lobes and small trembling satellites and all its forms grouping below and racing in the stone arroyos like the imbreachment of some ultimate alchemic work decocted from out the secret dark of the earth's heart, the fleeing stag of acients fugitive on the mountainside and bright and quick in the dry path of the storm channels and shaping out the sockets in the rock and hurrying from the ledge to ledge down the slope shimmering and deft as eels.&quot;"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"It's dark, it's ugly, it's incredibly violent, but those sentences continue to make my jaw drop, and I've read it a dozen times.An interesting tidbit (a scary one) is that Glanton and the judge actually existed. There are several independent sources, the best being My Confession by Samuel Chamberlain, who was part of the gang for a while. This is reputed to be one of the primary sources for Blood Meridian."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Cormac McCarthy's command language is unlike any contemporary author in my experience. There are long descriptive passages here that make me think the words must pour out of him in a way he can barely control.His characters are sketchy, and the reader is never party to what a character might think or feel. You are left with actions and sparse dialogue. Although this may be unusual, it did not keep me from finding one sympathetic, nor does it make the characters less vivid.To say the vision is dark is gross understatement. There are parts where I felt as if I were experiencing some old testament prophet's nightmares. The violence is graphic, and it goes beyond men reacting to situations. There is pure evil here.Overall, descriptive language is the centerpiece of Mr. McCarthy's work. Plot complexity and intricate characters take a back seat. Read a description of the colors of a sunset reflecting on desert plants and rock formations, and you forget all ab! out characters and plot."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I have just finished the book that began with so much promise but left me feeling cheated. The grandeur of the described natural settings and of the prose and the 'importance' of the themes were the Faberge shell for a dessicated egg. The characters: An unbelievable sophomoric Nietzschean anti-hero main character - 'the judge'- and his protagonist,the kid, a bewildered and bewildering abortive being. The novel aspires to Faulkner and Melville but delivers a self-important catalogue of brutality, albeit in poetic prose. The brutality was lurid and pornographic - not in itself a terrible thing perhaps, but I learned nothing from the book."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"How do you review a book that you didn't like when others far more intelligent than you consider it a literary masterpiece? \\"Blood Meridian\\" is one of two books that I've had to force myself to finish, the other being \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" by James Frey. While Cormac McCarthy is obviously a legitimate and gifted writer, his painstakingly extensive descriptions and use of run-on sentences (often 100 plus words long) become overbearing with repetition. The attempt to reconstruct (or invent) unfamiliar words and phrasing intended to be 'period correct' for the southwest 150 years ago constantly throws off the reader's rhythm, causing the reader to go back for rereads to verify the author's intent. The author's continued use of Spanish requires the unschooled reader to continually refer to a Spanish dictionary in order to follow conversations.Many critics have described this work as a great horror story. It does tell of horrific events caused by evil men in an unforgiving environment. However it does so by repetitively slapping the reader in the face with these events, kind of like a modern splatterpunk novel. It doesn't take the reader long to accept the activities and environment as a 'new normal', thus lessening the psychological impact and the shock value. A horror story typically is a cohesive tale that follows a (sometimes) wandering path to its ultimate and impactful conclusion. True horror novels include \\"The Exorcist\\" and Jack Ketchum's \\"The Girl Next Door\\".Readers need to acknowledge that the atrocities and brutality of the old American southwest 150 years ago were no different than events that unfolded in Vietnam. Tom Berenger's character in Platoon could easily take the place of Judge Holden, and Charlie Sheen's character is similar to 'the kid'. Bad men will always sink to the same level and use their evil actions to justify their own sense of self worth. There will always be a king of these men who wallows around in the mud with them but still manages to emerge unscathed. And there will always be the relative innocent who will play in the mud but doesn't really want to get dirty.Hopefully this review will give you a different perspective on \\"Blood Meridian\\". Take on this 'masterpiece' at your own risk. I sincerely hope that you enjoy it more than I did."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Blood Meridian is a beautifully written yet horrifying story of the Old American West. This book is certainly not for the faint of heart or the squeamish. McCarthy certainly captures the spirit of the time and his prose is breathtaking. If one can move beyond the images of senseless, brutal violence that are found throughout the novel, it is certainly a book worth reading."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"You should read this book before the Ridley Scott movie comes out. The movie is only going to spoil things for you. This is a dark masterpiece about a mythologized American West that was probably closer to the real thing than even Cormac thinks. Those who think this is bad prose probably dont much care for much for Melville, Shakespeare or the King James Bible either. Dont listen to them. This is a great book."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"The opening line goes with other great ones, e.g. Moby Dick. I read this first and then went back and read his earlier stuff and then came back to the trilogy. In my opinion he goes through some kind of hell in the Southeast to move to El Paso where he sees life in the most interesting way, that somehow dries up and vindicates his gothic soul to write this book that reminds us of primevil existence. Somehow in this hell he develops the trilogy. I've only read All the Pretty Horses and part of The Crossing, but it seems it all got started w/ BM which was some kind of incredible acknowledgement and embracing of the dark side of human nature. Thanks."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I began reading Blood Meridian because it had been recommended to me by both my writing teacher and Harold Bloom - one of my heroes. Most critics laud the style in which it is written as unique, enviable, etc. I don't know if this brands me as an anti-intellectual, but I was completely put-off by the style. Call me old-fashioned, but I don't think that style should ever get in the way of clarity. MacCormack's prose is poetic but it runs on and on like a vast river tumbling endlessly into the wilderness where all the animals look on and ponder why anyone would want to write sentences like these that run on for pages and pages and don't stop no matter how much you want them to or how lost you are in the story without even having the decency to give us a comma or a quotation mark or any type of punctuation whatsoever and just keep connecting words using the word and on and on until you think you cant ever read the word and again. Give me good old Stunk and White English every day. Having made my way through the whole book, I don't think I got everything that was going on, but that is not my fault. However, just when things are getting boring, you are treated to over-the-top, Grand Guignol, gory, gratuitous violence to perk up your interest.The story, such as I can make out, concerns a 14-year-old boy, know simply as the kid. The kid is tough beyond his years and sets out on his own. He finds himself in the Southwest where he joins a band of outlaws, led by the diabolic judge, who kill Indians for their scalps. Even though this book is a \\"western\\" (it takes place mostly in the 1840's) it doesn't take place in a West I am familiar with. Blood red deserts stretch endlessly under blood red skies. In fact, I'd argue that the book really takes place in hell, because this is not even the earth I recognize. It is sophistry to argue that the judge is not a supernatural character. The judge is completely hairless - no eyebrows even - and spends much of the book wandering around naked. He is seemingly omniscient and immortal. He may be a manifestation of the Devil himself. This theory seems to be true from the first moment the party discovers the judge, sitting on a rock in the middle of an inhospitable desert with no tracks around him, to the very end of the book, which I didn't completely understand (it seems almost the end of the poem The Raven).There are things in the book I admire, but I can't really recommend it as pleasurable reading. I can honestly say that I have no intention of ever reading one of MacCarthy's books again."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"The only reason I have given this book 5 stars is because the option to give it more was not available.Just an excellent work. Cormac McCarthy will be remembered as one of the most important American writers of the late 20th century."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"My disdain let alone intolerance for mediocrity is legendary. In the realm of literature my standards are so intractable and immutable, that very little of the current culture of scribes can find their way into the penumbra of my sensibilities. Enter Cormac McCarthy's \\"Blood Meridian.\\"The first 65 pages of McCarthy's 1985 novel reads like a pilgrimage through Dante's Inferno, with Bosch, Blake and Milton as our delirious and diabolical docents.Though tethered to a factual episode in American history, nevertheless, \\"Blood Meridian\\" depicts a Faustian fable of infernal majesty and horrifying invective. A veritable maelstrom of unimaginable brutality and insidious carnage. Alas! The Garden of Eden narrated by De Sade.McCarthy's prose is both voluptuous and carnivorous. Teeming with metaphors--stiletto-like, conceived to literally rip the integument from the skeletal frame of American history. Imagine Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness\\" combined with Eastwood's \\"The Unforgiven,\\" and you begin to develop a sense of what McCarthy's fictional apocrypha intimates.What elevates McCarthy's sanguinary tale above the current fray is how deftly the author negotiates the universal themes of evil and historical veracity. Make no mistake: This is no morality play. McCarthy avoids degenerating his tale into social sophistry imbued with activist pretense and spurious, pseudo-intellectual jargon, dedicated to resurrecting the preternatural loss-of-innocence fetish. No. McCarthy has crafted a parable of transubstantiated terror and spiritual vacuity. The embodiment of Nietszche's Will to Power chauvinism--sporting spurs and a Remington. The regeneration of values through abject violence. A virtueless vanguard ordained in blood--elucidating the hollow point of nihilism and concentrated evil.In the end, McCarthy reveals history to be bankrupt of moral conscience when definitively employed as a hammer to sanitize & ultimately disguise truth, in the shroud of self-delusion and empire.*Chaperone your literary appreciation and comprehension of McCarthy's \\"Blood Meridian\\" with \\"McCarthy's Western Novels\\" by Barcley Owens. This taut, incendiary exegesis on McCarthy's style and sensibility, will only serve to intensify your passion and pleasure for McCarthy's paean to perdition."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I started reading Blood Meridian a few days ago. I got about 80 pages into it and stopped. I took it back to the library earlier this evening and feel relieved and happy that I did not continue reading it.There is too much horrible imagery in Blood Meridian. I don't want those images in my mind. It was very well written and the story carried me along and I was conflicted about stopping but I am glad I stopped. Too many graphic images of torture, murder, mutilation, dead babies, excrement, flies, bloody body parts, agony and so on.

Did you get a degree in liberal arts? Do you like unending metaphor and indirect communication? Do you like absorbing pieces that are largely left to your interpretation?If not, this book is an absolute chore (like scrubbing a toilet except it takes 20 times longer and there's nothing to show at the end). It reminds me of many of the Oscar award winning movies and literary masterpieces as declared by academia that don't make sense to us commoners. We think we are dumb because we \\"can't\\" recognize the brilliance we are told about, then after enough years of seeing/reading such pieces, and meeting academics that don't know how a light bulb works, it becomes clear a lot of critically acclaimed work is inflated pretentious garbage. That may not be fair to the author's intent, but explains the driving force behind the glowing reviews for what I foumd was a painfully, at times mind-numbingly, dull read.It is written with a very complex style and vernacular that initially leads you to think this book must be a masterpiece, but quickly becomes so grating that the book seems infinite even though it is only 3/4s of an inch thick. By 2/3rds the way in I quit looking up words I didn't know because I stopped caring and wanted to get the over with. At no point had my frequent previous efforts at deciphering the language reveal relevance to the story.

Like the other McCarthy titles &quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot;, etc. he accomplishes a feel for the desert Southwest like no other author I have read. He does that by painting a graphicly accurate word picture of the area. In addition, through the eyes of the Kid, he makes the reader feel, not just read, the era in which the story is set. I came away drained from the intensity. However, I feel that the philosophical journeys into which the judge wanders are too lengthy and too esoteric. If you want a philosophical discussion, go to a text book. Not only would some, if not most, disagree with the Judge's view of life, it in no way enhanced the story. If you are looking for another &quot;Ox Bow Incident&quot; you will be extremely disappointed. While the philosophical mindset of Ox Bow was more visceral and real, Blood Meridian was much more off the chart and contrived. In addition, McCarthy's use of the Spanish language, was over used. This book is written in English for English speaking readers. An occasional use of a foreign language should be used in moderation and never to convey critical aspects of the story. McCarthy has not accomplished that knack yet, in any of his novels that I have read."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"The author of this book uses absurd flowery &amp; verbose language to describe a series of violent, homicidal incidents perpetrated by a very forgetable group of murderous ruffians.

War Is A Force That Gives Us Meaning.I mean, that's it, right? Did I leave anything out? I don't think so. The horrific violence is arresting at first, but it reaches its crescendo, oh, maybe a third of the way through, and after that, McCarthy is just banging on the same key over and over again, to numbing effect. Yes, undoubtedly, he is an impressive stylist, even if the style in question is more or less a Faulkner/Hemingway pastiche, but that's really not enough. Blood Meridian might have made a decent short story, but as a novel, it just becomes unbearably tedious. Are we really this facile?"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Which is what is wrong with this book for me. I think this author took the nihilistic aspects of some of Nietzshe's philosophy and his concepts about the uberman and just went bananas without attempting any balance whatsoever. There's no yang to this author's yin. The book is very violent but there's no story to justify the killing, maiming and cruelty to animals he depicts. IMO when you stray so far from reality by just focusing on the horrific you lose any hope of imparting a message to your reader. In short, he lost me somewhere after the first child murder but well before the puppies got rubbed out.This author has a style which can be very entertaining. The story moves quickly with no wasted words. The descriptions of the landscapes are interesting and well drawn but there are too many of them. Nobody cares that much about landscapes, we get it, it's unpleasant. Same with the skyscapes and falling stars. Enough already, say something else if you can. Don't think this author can.If you're looking for a western, this isn't it. It's a philosophical and political opinion disguised as a western that's why it's not possible to really care about any of the characters. They aren't real people, they aren't meant to be. The main characters represent ideas, groups and philosophies not people. Oh and Satan.

I think that later in his years he has tried to move beyond the feeling of a period novel, but they don't seem to have the same power."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This is an audio book, and after I finished it I bought the hard copy. At first I didn't care for the narrator, but as I became used to his voice I realized he was actually doing a great job of emphasizing Cormac's nuances perfectly. It is one of a few audio books I have listened to over the last 15 years that I absolutely enjoyed from start to finish. Cormac's descriptions of men, horses, situations, countrysides, etc., are vividly imaginable without the use of five dollar words. A terrific story, Cormac has filled the book with historically verifiable characters using his years and years of research. Buy it; you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I know that McCarthy's not categorized as dystopian, but this novel, like his more recent _ the Road_ definitely have some traits that might characterize them as such.

His imagery is brilliantly haunting and the last image in this novel will leave you questioning the inherent evil in humanity, which is highlighted in the character, the Judge."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I have read reviews of Blood Meridian that say this could be the great American novel. I tend to agree. It is compelling to say the least."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This book is an easy book to read but a hard book to understand fully, and that's what makes it good. McCarthy at times writes in sweeping terms, providing long descriptions of the vast and empty desert that the main characters traverse, or long side stories about the characters. There are short scenes of stunning violence and depravity that will jar the reader. Redemption is elusive and may never be found, depending on your interpretation. Layered throughout is some deep symbolism that I'm not sure anyone has completely decoded. In the end, the plot is easy to understand, but the complete meaning may not be, and should cause the reader to think and analyze what was just read: it's not a book that is simply read then put down and forgotten."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This is a good book, but it is very violent. McCarthy is very subtle about the violence and the dialogue is often difficult to follow because quotation marks are not used. Overall, a good read though."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"The book is about violence and survival and therefore inevitably brutal and grotesque. The magic in this book is the beauty of the words describing the whold mixture of violence with the silent, often tranquil and serene surrounding nature. This is not the type of book one \\"enjoys\\" but the author's skills are extraordinary and very rare to find in modern American literature."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian is absolutely one of the finest achievements in American literature in the past century. The novel completely defies the Western genre, with its clearly morally-divided characters and sides, as every character portrayed is evil to a certain degree. There is no clear sense of morals and the protagonist, the \\"Kid\\", is likely the only character that can be remotely sympathized with. McCarthy's prose is astounding: He portrays some of the most grotesque and depraved scenes of violence with language of utter beauty. Many will see that his prose is almost biblical in a way, which ironically contrasts the savage violence which rules every page of the book.In this novel, McCarthy introduces the most frightening character ever portrayed in literature, a pale, seven-foot, hairless giant known as The Judge, a man whose knowledge seems infinite as well as his capacity for violence. The Judge is undoubtedly the greatest villain in literature, making Hannibal Lecter, Nurse Ratchet, and Alex Delarge look like they came right out of a Dr. Seuss book. McCarthy does a brilliant job of presenting this character, through extremely subtle details which many won't be able to understand until finishing the book.WARNING: For those thinking of reading this novel, be aware:1.) This is one of the most violent books ever written. Every page is riddled with the depiction or aftermath of violence. There are incredibly graphic scenes like of people being scalped, burned alive, shot in the head (where the state of the skull afterwards is described in depth) and many other scenes so horrible and shocking that it is best for the reader to find them.2.) The tone of the novel is extremely bleak. Do not expect to find a single comedic or otherwise bright moment in the entire work. It is unbelievably disturbing and can easily depress anyone who is susceptible to mood changes caused by books or movies.3.) The prose can be difficult so always read carefully. There is not a single wasted sentence in the book and many times paragraphs must be re-read to fully comprehend what scene has just passed. McCarthy is also not fond of punctuation like commas, quotation marks, and can be known for very Faulknerian sentences containing many conjunctions."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This is one of the best novels written. I couldn't put it down when I was reading it, and I couldn't stop thinking about it for months afterwards. I cannot remember characters depicted as vividly as his by any other author, and I think that is the real beauty of this book.This novel is worth reading, and then it is worth reading again."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Great analysis has been done in other reviews, but for me, this novel represents an epic, violent struggle between Man (in the form of 14year-old nameless Kid) and the Devil, aka The Judge, with the blood-drenched American West as backdrop. The Kid is a soulless creature, born and raised in violence, but even one such as he stands in stark contrast to the Judge, an intellectual killer, a compassionate madman. The language is dense but poetic, and has made me a McCarthy fan for life. Great read."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Blood Meridian shares the characteristic Cormac McCarthy scenario of a horse-mounted youth coming of age in a journey through the badlands of the Texas-Mexico continuum. Like many of McCarthy's others of similar theme, the arc of the story can be made analogous to a life in general. Being first of the author's wild west works, the analogy is more readily seen. The story is bloody, indeed, and this is not atypical of McCarthy, but the meridian is the key, here. The halfway point of the day is its meridian, and the imaginary half-circles that can be drawn on the earth are also meridians. Both meanings figure prominently in the story, and the title's portent recurs continuously.It's at once a cowboy story and a passion play. But, who is a romantic clich&eacute; and who is to be crucified fluctuates throughout the book's jaunting few years. The main character focus, the kid, given no proper name, is the only one whose thoughts are known beyond what he speaks, which is little. The kid is attitude and grit, but other luminaries give voice to some of McCarthy's own philosophical points. A behemoth known as The Judge, once having appeared, remains as an overpowering ballast for the eventual enterprise, a marauding band of bounty hunters seeking the bloody scalps of Indians, or anyone who looks like one, to profit from the prizes offered by various Mexican authorities. For its part, the quarry is not as unequal as revisionist history would propose, with various Apache and Pawnee warriors relentlessly in pursuit of the mercenaries, and violently merciless to all whom they encounter. We know that white people eventually vanquish the red ones in the tale writ large, but which will prevail in the issue of their mutual animus is still unsettled for the duration of the book.The jagged meridian of the Rio Grande seems to be the dividing line between what is a more pacified USA in the east and an essentially lawless Mexico to the west. The kid attaches to the soldiers of fortune with little persuasion, compelled only by the absence of other direction. The Judge is a most impressive presence, awesome not only by his apparent seven-foot massiveness, but for his polymath abilities in warmaking, oratory, languages, classical learning and natural history. The leader of the rabble is a Captain Glanton, lately of Civil War employ, expert in killing and unfettered by ordinary compunctions of tolerance, forgiveness or clemency. For his part, the kid is evidently a worthy marksman and fighter, but little is said of his internal conflicts, if any, over the violence his troop authors. Other members of the band include Delaware Indians, a black, and numerous lesser desperadoes who kill and are killed in the story's relentless progress.The sidereal meridian, or noon hour, is the halfway point of the day, and the sun beats down a harsh light that withers the morning's freshness and lays bare its promises. In a like fashion, men's lives and enterprises are measured by their rises and declines. The bloody decisions made by each participant in the unholy wastage of a race of men mark the midpoints of the passage from the innate reverence and awe that children feel to the callous indifference of evaluation and prioritization that marks the businesslike outlook of adults. The Judge says:\\"... If God meant to interfere in the degeneracy of mankind would he not have done so by now? Wolves cull themselves, man. What other creature could? And is the race of man not more predacious yet? The way of the world is to bloom and to flower and die but in the affairs of men there is no waning and the noon of his expression signals the onset of night. His spirit is exhausted at the peak of its achievement. His meridian is at once his darkening and the evening of his day. He loves games? Let him play for stakes. This you see here, these ruins wondered at by tribes of savages, do you not think that this will be again? Aye. And again. With other people, with other sons.\\"He has conceded that his is to die, as with all men, and that he might as not, despite his erudition, gamble on the stakes of kill-or-be-killed in lieu of some more benevolent pursuit. Indeed, he further avers:\\"It makes no difference what men think of war... War endures. As well ask men what they think of stone. War was always here. Before man was, war waited for him. The ultimate trade awaiting its ultimate practitioner. That is the way it was and will be....War is the ultimate game because war is at last a forcing of the unity of existence. War is god.\\"We who write such words as mine have the luxury of relative peace, perhaps purchased for our locale by the exertions of others, but do we not engage in all manner of competition in our own struggles for relative position? If the bloodiness is only known by systolic and diastolic measurements, it is the same wreckage of the illusions of childhood that results. Is The Judge right in his assessment that war is the human condition and that the failure to fight it, win or lose, is inhuman? We like to imagine a nobler destiny for this crown of creation, but our unscientific statistical sampling doesn't bode well for nobility in any form.Perhaps The Judge has passed the meridian where he sees curiosities and appreciates them as artifacts and natural phenomena, but no longer apprehends himself as a special case, instead choosing to subsume himself in what he imagines as the innate barbarity of humankind, and in so doing becoming as human and inhuman as the victims he and his crew scalp and bloody from the top to the bottom of their fleshly meridians. Our historical and cultural narratives suppose an age of innocence for the beloved country we know as \\"One nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\\" Accounts such as Blood Meridian's, claimed to be based upon factual information, put the lie to any such suppositions. The Romans enjoyed pax Romana as a fruit of the ardors suffered by its skillful legions. Our past 65 years of relative security and plenty have been similarly won, with all of the gore and violence that war represents.The question arises: is a plea for peace really a demand for war? Useful terms such as \\"pacification\\" fulfill political needs, but what pacification is done without coercion of some kind? War can break out, but it is rare, indeed for peace to do so. But, do we simply concede The Judge's point, or can we look at our times as being some sort of a bloody meridian in the human journey from Eden to Elysian Fields?"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Having read most of Cormac McCarthy's work, I was suprised to see I had overlooked his so called masterpiece \\"Blood Meridian\\".

Read this excerpt. The main characters are attacking a column of mules packing mercury for the mines: &quot;Every man of them was firing point blank at the muleteers. They fell from their mounts and lay in the trail or slid from the escarpment and vanished. The drivers below got their animals turned and were attempting to flee back down the trail and the laden packmules were beginning to clamber white-eyed at the sheer wall of the bluff like enormous rats. The riders pushed between them and the rock and methodically rode them from the escarpment, the animals dropping silently as martyrs, turning sedately in the empty air and exploding on the rocks below in startling bursts of blood and silver as the flasks broke open and mercury loomed wobbling in the air in great sheets and lobes and small trembling satellites and all its forms grouping below and racing in the stone arroyos like the imbreachment of some ultimate alchemic work decocted from out the secret dark of the earth's heart, the fleeing stag of acients fugitive on the mountainside and bright and quick in the dry path of the storm channels and shaping out the sockets in the rock and hurrying from the ledge to ledge down the slope shimmering and deft as eels.&quot;"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This is the first of McCarthy's books I have read. Other than this book, I have seen a couple of movies that were made based on his books. I read a non-fiction book last summer that dealt with the issues involved in the settling of the American West (Empire of the Summer Moon, which I enjoyed) and when I found out that Blood Meridian possibly involved the same issues in a fictional account, I decided to read it. And now I know that, well, it's not really the same thing.Blood Meridian is apparently based on the account of a man who actually rode with Glanton named Sam Chamberlain. Chamberlain's memoirs, titled My Confession, was published in Life Magazine in 1956 in a series of installments. I have not read that account, so I don't know how closely it resembles it(Chamberlain also participated in the Mexican War and in the Civil War) , but one interesting thing is that Chamberlain also sketched many of the scenes he saw, sort of like the judge in Blood Meridian.Blood Meridian is not so much a novel as it is a word painting. It describes a series of incidents, largely as they relate to an individual known simply as the kid. Many of the incidents are violent, most of the incidents are immoral, and almost all of the incidents are what we today would call uncivilized. Throughout it all, the kid remains sort of a moral enigma, simply noting these incidents, but not reacting to them as one would expect. The kid is not even present in large segments of the book. There is not a whole lot of real dialogue in the book, although there is a fair amount of talking. There is a whole lot of (an extraordinary amount of (lots and lots of)) descriptions of nature. So much so that nature has to be considered a major character. And of course, like the kid, nature is morally neutral. Not all characters are so gray, however, Glanton and the judge being two of them. They are evil, but in different ways. The judge is a sort of mythical being - he reminded me a lot of the character Clint Eastwood played in the movie Pale Rider. Except not in a good way. Glanton, well, he's just an evil man, but he is a man. Actually, he really was a man, so I guess McCarthy didn't want to change things too much. There are some - few - characters that portray humanity in a different light, a more benevolent light. However, this is a dark book, a brooding book, and for that reason, a rather simple book. It distills human nature to its brainstem - a mere survival mechanism, rather than the enormously complicated structure that it is. Actually, there is even a character in the book that represents this quite literally - the imbecile. In the Blood Meridian world, we are all imbeciles.This book is not my cup of tea. However, in the end, I'm glad I read it. I believe the ending could have been better - it seemed dissipated, somehow. Or maybe I just like things tied up more neatly (and I'm not talking about what happened to the kid). Maybe it will make a better movie."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"In my mind, this is beyond doubt the best of McCarthy, better even than All the Pretty Horses. McCarthy creates a vivid, if disturbing, portrait of the American West, leaving the reader thinking about humanity at the end. The conclusion, which I will not spoil for the reader, is equally powerful, and in my mind rivals even the intriguing speech by Sheriff Bell at the end of No Country for Old Men. For anyone who enjoys Hemingway or Faulkner, or who enjoyed other books of McCarthy's, this is a must-read."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"\\"Blood Meridian\\" is one of the few books that has stuck with me for years. Due to the graphic violence, I don't recommend it to a lot of people, and I must admit that it put me off for quite a while at the beginning. That said, it has passed the test of time with me. It is one of VERY few books that I have re-read. When I finished this book, I just had to take a deep breath. I'm not some literature major, or someone who wants to analyze all the symbolism that is obviously present here, but I still found this to be accessible and powerful. The language is magnificent, and the entire book has a \\"gut level\\" feel that, while taking a long time to cultivate, is truly unique. I've read all of McCarthy's novels and this is by far my favorite. If you really liked \\"No Country For Old Men\\" (a glorified screenplay, in my opinion) and/or \\"The Road\\", this book may NOT be for you. If you liked the Border Trilogy, particularly \\"The Crossing\\", then buy this and read it immediately. You might also like \\"Paradise\\" by Toni Morrison."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"The Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone and his contemporaries dispelled most myths of good cowboys and bad cowboys. His influence spread upon others, whose successive cinematic paintings would make the bleak Western desert landscape filled with bloodthirsty ruffians common knowledge to audiences. But while Angel Eyes Sentenza, Tuco Ramirez, and Clint Eastwood's nameless killers were Shakespearean in their amoral aspects, there was still something civil and sane in those men amidst leering Death.Here, morality is a virtue felt by victims while vice is the religion of the victors. The Americas twisted by Manifest Destiny have interbred the demonized Native Americans and Spanish, and it is almost like they have birthed a new race of devils as savage as their white oppressors. Scalps are the bloodstained market's chief commodity as the roving Glanton Gang murders Native American settlements and sells these items to towns warped in celebrating killers as heroes. The naive worshipful cities soon have their dazzling savage dreams brought upon them when the Glanton Gang sieges them, scalp the innocent townspeople, and in a continuance of falsehoods, sell these counterfeit scalps as the genuine article only for the celebrated sellers to become marauding thieves again.Almost as an American God of Western myth, Glanton's right-hand man Judge Holden is much like the serpentine deceiver, who is all but named as the martial Pope of the war party. Even when narrated to be lying, Holden's gravitas is utterly inspiring and his scholarly nature and sophisticated vocabulary among almost cancerous nomads on the mind make us want to join in the revelry for him until he murders children and puppies in an act of Heraclitean warmongering in the name of mankind's eventual future as overlord of the wild nature that would restrain him. Virtue in war is an oxymoron, an impasse to man's sovereignty, and all are enemies to him in our fragile plane of existence. Sometimes when we hear of hurricanes and the venomous snakes out there, we want to believe in the Judge's anarchic crusade against nature even though that entails monstrous amorality as treachery to our origins and a sort of ecological suicide brought upon an ignorance that we are a part of nature as much as everything else. But other men neutral to or against the Glanton Gang are also categorized with rampaging nature and as they slay enemy Native American settlements and soldiers sent out to task them for their crimes with flying colors, we seriously start to ask if such bloody imperialism is wrong if it guarantees peace from everlasting supremacy. As natural competitors bent on survival against an overwhelmingly hostile world, it is easy to shatter our moral compass and believe the Judge's lies until our need for violence as a weapon of law becomes a lust for war such as when unlawful aspirants rise to usurp the all too weak natural sovereign's throne and success or failure, this continuing cycle ensures that the world's fauna is only bones and corpses.The Kid runs from his abusive home at fourteen and eventually comes into the company of these warrior cultists. Even amidst such ruthless combatants, the Kid never loses his goodness as he once pulls out the arrow of a wounded comrade that would have died otherwise. As the closest thing we identify with virtue in a bloody wasteland, he and Holden shine like beacons of opposing forces, more than men, and given the Judge's ability to be in two places at once and immunity to age, we pray the Kid is such an angelic deity to oppose this demon that at times seems little more than a hairless Robin Goodfellow.In our current era we face a similar dilemma: Zealous glorification of our heroes as stainless statues and hatred of our enemies into mad beasts. We believe the Judge to this day into persecuting all that would dare to walk astray our path. The results have become reminiscent of mythical battles and mutate us into devils dressed in ripped and pasted man flesh upon demonic hides and where most of our fallen kin have learned to hide their cloven hooves in military boots and behind the staggering piles of waste in our shining criminal history. Manifest Destiny still lives. It is our favorite. It will never die."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I was eager to read \\"Blood Meridian\\", like most I heard it was a classic and profound read full of violence and gore. It was, but I found the reading in the 1st 100 pages tedious and slow going.I really enjoyed the book as a whole, but found many of the descriptions long winded!The violence and outright lunacy of the scalp hunters is what kept me reading.

McCarthy uses graphic descriptions that really put the reader in touch with the violence of the book, and the violence is not nearly as disturbing as the ending. However, he tells the story in a way that captures the essence of the situation in such a way as to make the violence necessary and immediate so as to prevent it from becoming gratuitous.Upon completing this book, I found myself deeply concerned and completely moved, and I realized that I loved this book even though it was not really a joy to read. It is most definitely not the page turner that some of McCarthy's later books are. Yet, it is probably his best book because of how it affects the reader.

The story makes one wonder about the history of this country, and the people who settled the west. I particularly liked the scenes in old San Diego and the Colorado River. I can't forget about the mercury miners and their burros carrying mercury in the Sierra Madres. And the kid was one of my favorite literary characters ever.

The writing is poetically complex yet incredibly powerful even to the most novice of critical readers. Blood Meridian is a novel that employs a wide spectrum of devices to explore difficult themes drawn from a specific period in our nation's history. A romantic saga of the Wild West this book is not. While there is a driving plot (however brutal), it is secondary to the issues McCarthy is focusing on. Taking place on the western frontier during the westward expansion, a time when the abstract concept of Manifest Destiny saturated American thinking, Blood Meridian presents a world where the ability to use abstract thought, empowers a person over those who think in terms of the specific. Combined with the paradigm of the Witness (if no one saw it, did it even happen?), the world as McCarthy sees it is extremely dangerous for many people. Falling into the company of The Judge, The Kid joins a group of scalp hunters on the hunt for Native American victims. In the interactions between the two prominent characters, as well as with the band of mercenaries, the hierarchy of abstract thought is exposed and made frighteningly real. To further intensify all that is going on the novel, the prose is incredibly original. McCarthy's writing is reminiscent of Faulkner, and Joyce in terms of its uniqueness. He straddles the line between fiction and poetry like no other writer. Style aside, McCarthy carefully chooses the type of language used for certain exposition. The use of specific and abstract words is integral to the thematic development of the novel. The writing is also incredibly subtle. What might be mentioned only once in an early chapter, all of a sudden carries a lot of weight when it is alluded to at the end of the novel. Blood Meridian in not without its fair share of subversion however. The Kid appears to be the main character, yet The Judge gets the majority of attention throughout. The \\"mapped out\\" chapter formats are more suited to the Victorian era than to modern day America. Violence is one aspect of the novel that receives the most response from the reader. It will either deter you from immersing yourself in the conflicts, or strangely compel you to dive further in to this alien world where ruthlessness is inherent, second nature. I feel the need to make a disclaimer here: This book is violent; even more it is intensely graphic. I understand that this will discourage potential readers, but I encourage one to read the book anyhow. The brutality of the band of scalp hunters is vital to the story on both dramatic and thematic levels. Blood Meridian is the most important novel I have read since Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man. It deals with a period of our history that is usually romanticized by glamorous portrayals on the big screen. The period of Manifest Destiny was a very dangerous time for those who weren't American. The themes are consistent to the setting and the plot has its routes in actual events and characters. This book is not just a literary achievement, but also a courageous feat for any writer. McCarthy deals with themes that most people don't want to acknowledge. Read this book if you can. Its message cannot be ignored."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"The only reason I am writing this review is that I was appalled by how obnoxious Derek Lang's review is.

He actually refers to himself as a non-elitist intellectual -- all while bashing modern authors, including Mr. McCarthy. He actually calls Cormack pretentious!!Derek - we are not impressed."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This novel is not an easy read, rather, it is an intricate explosion of prose that requires re-reading and alomst entices the reader to highlight the intensely beautiful and suggestive lines. Besides the intensity of the writing in this novel, it has an even more intense subject matter. To attempt to simplify this novel as simply being a &quot;western&quot; because of it's setting would undermine the point of the violence, and the metaphor of the judge. This complicated novel explores the true nature of the Nineteenth Century frame of mind concerning Manifest Destiny. The book revamps popular American ideals concerning western expansion. Perhaps this is why Bloob Meridian is so difficult to read. We all know (or should know) that what was done to the Native Americans, and likewise, the Mexicans, was wrong. But rarely is this shame dramatized or exposed in such a matter-of-fact manner. Even Dances With Wolves focused on the enlightenment of one individual as opposed to the darker undertones of western expansion. Blood Meridian focuses soley on the violence. There is no enlightenment, only a darkness which seeps in to every corner of the outstanding prose. The kid and the judge are the novel's most prevalant characters. The judge embodies the the abstract ideas behind Manifest Destiny, while the kid is slightly more complicated. He is part of a horde of unabstract thinkers blindly following those who have the power to think beyond what they know and use their phylisophical minds in dangerous ways. Unfortunatly this horde has been commisioned to collect Indian scalps for money. These men, through their violence possess a certain amount of power, but the most power is in the possession of the judge, who seeks to destroy everything he can in order to recreate it on his own terms. The kid is a plot device that McCarthy places in the novel to give the reader someone to root for, or attempt to sympathize with. He seems to be caught somewhere between the philosophy of the judge and the ignorance of the other men. He possesses a certain fleck of compassion on his soul, which we don't see in other characters. This book is full of difficult mysteries which will not easily be solved upon a single reading. It certainly is not suited to everyones tastes. It almost seems because of it's themes, in this PC era, McCarthy has managed to trap his readers (unintentionaly I'm sure) into the understanding that this novel is essential. I feel like if I was to say that I did not like this book, it would be synonimous with stating that I did not understand it, which would make me feel as if I was on the same level as the lowly American scalpers. If I don't like it because of the ideas it imposes, or the violence, I can almost hear the judge laughing at me. To me that gives the judge, or what he represents power over people like myself, because if what this book says is true, his thinking exceeds mine. It is a trap. No matter how one feels about the book, the imagery and emotions evoked by Blood Meridian are undeniably the work of a great man of prose. The landscape erupts in starlight, in bleached bones, in phallic sunsets, and all the while the judge sits before the fire, his eyes on the kid, daring him to speak out, to form an opinion, in which case he will squash him like a bug."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"In the first Batman movie, Nicholson's Joker offers an infamous evaluation of his vandalism: \\"It may not be art but I like it.\\" If you turn that phrase on its head, that describes my impression of \\"Blood Meridian\\": \\"It may be art but [at least for the first 200 pages] I don't like it.\\"In the first 200 pages or so, McCarthy turns a phrase. He evokes. He makes literary observations. What he doesn't do in my opinion is create one character whom we care about. That it took awhile to figure out who was who wasn't the problem. It wasn't the big words. It was that I didn't care if anybody in the book lived or died. Even an anti-hero like Captain Ahab or Tony Soprano calls you to feel for them at some level even though you know they have it coming. McCarthy doesn't suceed in doing that in my opinion.For the first 200 pages anyway. At about page 204, the story takes off. Characters begin to have some redeeming value. The judge becomes more mythological but at the same time starts to make more sense.I have read several reviews where the reader has given up disgusted after 100 pages. I would strongly encourage you (if you don't have completion compulsion like I do) to skip ahead to chapter 15 and pick up the story from there. You haven't missed a bit of the plot but there is some challenging writing in those last 130 pages."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Paradox. A great writer who thrills me with the brilliance of his language and fire of his vision, yet chills me with such repulsion that I know I shall never read another of his books again. This could as easily be a one-star review as a five-star one.But that language is stunning, with echoes of Homer, the Old Testament, and Hermann Melville, but very much McCarthy's own; just look at the opening and closing lines of the first page: \\"See the child. He is pale and thin, he wears a thin and ragged linen shirt. He stokes the scullery fire. Outside lie dark turned fields with rags of snow and darker woods beyond that harbor yet a few last wolves. [...] He watches, pale and unwashed. He can neither read nor write and in him broods already a taste for mindless violence. All history present in that visage, the child the father of the man.\\" That taste for mindless violence will send the boy, known only as \\"the Kid,\\" Southwest from Tennessee to join in 1849 a gang of scalphunters from Texas, killing Apache Indians for bounty. But first McCarthy shows us an attack in which the Apache are the victors; his description of the warriors coming out of a mirage of the dawn sun must surely stand as one of the finest uses of the unpunctuated period in modern literature:\\"They crossed before the sun and vanished one by one and reappeared again and they were black in the sun and they rode out of that vanished sea like burnt phantoms with the legs of the animals kicking up the spume that was not real and they were lost in the sun and lost in the lake and they shimmered and slurred together and separated again and they augmented by planes in lurid avatars and began to coalesce and there began to appear above them in the dawn-broached sky a hellish likeness of their ranks riding huge and inverted and the horses' legs incredibly elongate trampling down the high thin cirrus and the howling antiwarriors pendant from their mounts immense and chimeric and the high wild cries carrying that flat and broken pan like the cries of souls broke through some misweave in the weft of things into the world below.\\"The contrast could not be greater between the author's high diction and the scrabble existence of the illiterate Kid, wandering the parched desert in bloodstained rags. Never have I felt such intense experiences as an observer -- yet never greater distance from the thing observed, never so little sense of purpose, direction, or moral meaning. I felt I was in the midst of one of those tortures where they tape someone's eyelids open and force them to watch images of horror and violence. For the band that the Kid joins roams the borderlands in search of Apaches to kill and scalp, making no distinction for old people, women, and children, then eventually killing Mexican peons and American wayfarers when the supply runs out. The middle part of the book proceeds in a delirium of short episodes, all vivid, a few exciting, but ultimately all sickening with their total disregard for morality and human feeling.Is it better to learn that this is not the author's diseased imagination but based on fact? There was indeed such a band of renegade marauders, known as the Glanton Gang, after the former army officer who led them. Glanton appears in the novel, as do many other named characters who enter unannounced and die in ignominy. If any are memorable, it is only for specific actions or minor traits; I cannot remember ever feeling less investment in the characters of a major novel -- and this emphatically includes the Kid, who is a mere cipher. But there is one partial exception, the larger-than-life and probably apocryphal figure of Judge Holden, seven foot tall, completely hairless, immensely strong, and a fount of knowledge, both practical and arcane. We are attracted to him at the beginning by such things as his skill at making gunpowder from natural ingredients, and his unique possession of intellect in a mindless world. If there is a philosophy to all this violence, we suspect it stems from him. But gradually we come to see him as a monster of amorality, a psychopath, a pedophile, perhaps not even a mortal being. It takes a godlike writer to create the devil incarnate, but I shall not worship at his shrine."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"\\"You can find meanness in the least of creatures, but when God made man the devil was at his elbow.\\" --Blood MeridianBlood Meridian or the Evening Redness in the West might be one of top five novels of Modern American literature.I say \\"might be\\" because it is probably too soon to make that judgment even though the novel was published in 1985. Moby-Dick did not gain dominance over American literature until after WWII and it was first published in 1851 to mediocre reviews and multiple head-scratching.Sometimes it takes decades for an American novel to assume its rightful place in the rarefied pantheon of Great American Novels. I know some critics have placed McCarthy's work there. Personally, I think it is safe to say Blood Meridian is not deserving of that distinction...not yet. But one day it could be, and probably should be.Nevertheless, Blood Meridian is, without doubt, a definitive western of lasting power. It is, by any metric, a masterpiece of emotion, raw moment, and language:\\"When the dogs announced them the sun was already down and the western land red and smoking and they rode singlefile in cameo detailed by the winey light with their dark sides to the river.\\"Blood Meridian tells the story of the Glanton Gang (historically accurate) working the Texas-Mexico border in the 1850s who murder Native Americans for their scalps. (This was actually quite a lucrative business.) Already animalistic the gang starts scalping anyone who falls across their path and sells the scalps for gold. The novel deconstructs myths and Hollywood-inspired tropes promulgated upon an unsuspecting public. I say \\"unsuspecting\\" because many readers (and, sadly, some writers of the genre) have been nurtured and pampered through the bubblegum influence of pulp magazines, Saturday morning television, and cartoonish movie serials.This dangerously simplistic notion the Old West was one thing explicit, when we have solid historical proof it was quite another, has taken deep root throughout our Western Culture. Many western writers toil in the overarching shadow of this awful growth and its pervasive, debilitating influence. This becomes evident in the now-infamous line of John Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence when a newspaperman sagely opines if the legend becomes fact, one should by necessity be forced to print the legend. Thus, the power of myth, and its ability to sometimes usurp and weaken historical evidence.Blood Meridian breaks those barriers down with grim remorse. At its core are philosophical elements of Gnosticism and Nihilism. However, the violence on every page is in no way symbolic or meaningful. McCarthy doesn't use violence for shock effect or to elevate character description. Nor does he use it as a cheap literary device to move his readers. In his novels, and Blood Meridian in particular, violence exists for one reason: because man exists. Only once in the entire novel does a character allow himself to wonder if there is any other being in the universe more terrible than Man. The answer is quite clear: there is not. We are alone on that red plain.From the pronouncement \\"war is god\\" to the line \\"If god meant to interfere in the degeneracy of mankind would he not have done so by now?\\" the terrifying and enigmatic antagonist, Judge Holden, moves with unadulterated power through the entire novel. The Gnostic influences are evident both in his philosophy and his determination to judge not only the men around him but the very world itself. This dovetails with the grim actions of the gang and how they interact and shape the Texas-Mexican border through their own violent actions. It is an amazing novel.I can't promise you will like Blood Meridian. One suspects many readers will be turned off by the unremitting (almost uncaring) violence and the cold, enigmatic ending. We have been conditioned to believe violence must mean something, that it must have cause and thereby fit neatly within our dualistic universe. Books, movies and television have conditioned us to believe the world must be righted if canted over, and all will be wrapped in a neat, pretty bow before the credits roll. That simply doesn't happen in this novel. Because, as Judge Holden argues via his very actions, violence just is.I definitely recommend this novel. And, if you write westerns of any type, you would do well to read this American masterpiece and perhaps learn something from it about the western genre, and maybe even yourself."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Brutally violent, Blood Meridian turns the 19th century American West into a kind of hellish but hauntingly beautiful dreamscape, through which a gang of mercenaries wanders, killing without aim or reason. There is no comfort to be found anywhere in this novel, which overturns all Old West Myths, leaving only a stark, maddening world in which man exists on the edge of nihilism, \\"civilization\\" an illusion. The characters are almost opaque, reduced to actions and minimal dialogue. Even the language seems intended to confound and discomfit the reader, mixing arcane, half-forgotten scientific and philosophical terms with passages that sound almost like something from the Bible.Yet, McCarthy is the definition of a powerful writer. His prose is hypnotic, the book's scenes affecting the reader as much by their eerie beauty and lyricism as by the horror and violence contained within. Their images will stick around in your head for days. The Judge, a monstrous, demihuman prodigy at the center of novel, whose amused, philosophical queries about whether or not the scenes around him represent man in man's natural state, is one of the more memorable characters I've come across in fiction.Make no mistake, Blood Meridian is filled with powerful questions, about morality, about evil, about humanity's need for violence and dominance, about the nature of God, and so forth. Sometimes these questions are expressed explicitly, usually by the Judge, but mostly, they swirl just beneath the surface of the nightmare, challenging the reader to peer into the abyss and examine them. Though we don't live in the lawless 19th century anymore, the distance from our safe doorsteps to the modern equivalent of a gang of roving, murderous scalpers may be shorter than we think.McCarthy will certainly never be an author to everyone's taste, and certainly not with this work, but Blood Meridian has made a few critics' \\"Best of the 20th Century\\" lists for a good reason. This is a first-rate work of modern literature."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I bought this to have my own copy of the book. I read it first from the local library, and kept coming back to it in my mind because I knew I didn't get it all. Second time through it, I know I still did not get it all - and I doubt that anyone will, really, regardless of all the talking and writing and thinking literary people may do forever after.It is a fantasy, for sure, populated with fantastic characters, but I really think that the fantasy created in the book is more nearly reality than most histories.Things happen in combat zones that are unexplainable, fantastic, not bounded by what people think of as reality in any way. Motivations aren't relevant, conduct, either. Maybe this is a part of what he is getting at - I don't know. That's one thing I get from it, anyhow. Far as the Judge vs. The Kid - you could write a book on that relationship and never get it down totally.I'll tell you one thing, though. The Judge is more nearly correct than most, when he's talking about war, and humans, and the universe."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"When I first saw the movie Pulp Fiction, I remember thinking that certain lines had been moved with regard to popular acceptance of scenes of violence. Ultimately, however, the violence contained in Pulp Fiction and most mainstream Hollywood productions is more or less directly related to the plot; it is rarely gratuitous. Of course, the plotlines of horror and slasher movies revolve around depictions of violence, making them pillars of the plot itself. Blood Meridian, or the Evening Redness in the West, is unique in that the extreme violence depicted is not so much related to plot as it is the very nature of the characters and the scene in which the story is set. \\"Man is a violent (and godless) animal by nature\\" appears to be the premise out of which the entire novel develops. And it convinces.Most of the story follows action on and around the Mexican border in the years 1849-1850, when violent encounters between whites and Native Americans were commonplace. McCarthy creates characters that readers of his other work might recognize, at least in broad outline. \\"The kid\\" is the unnamed protagonist--a runaway from Tennessee with excellent gunfighting and survival skills, which lend themselves to violence only when necessary for the kid's protection. Judge Holden is the novel's antagonist and represents the embodiment of the violent nature of man. Large and hairless, Holden and the kid are sometimes placed together among the same group, but the reader is always conscious of the tension between them. In the end, it is the kid's capacity for pity and sympathy that places him opposite the judge both physically and philosophically.Not surprisingly, Blood Meridian is written in a style that emulates (and sometimes parallels) the powerful scenes of Revelation. In McCarthy's version, however, it is the weak and innocent that are found wanting and are condemned to violent death. Indeed, the end of the novel is as ambiguous and as apocalyptic as any I have ever read, wherein [**Spoiler Alert**] the reader can only be certain that violence has triumphed and firmly established itself as the nature of the world. Precisely how that triumph is accomplished (whether by violent murder or homosexual domination) is a subject of some debate.I think that I have never been quite as unsettled by a novel as I have by Blood Meridian (though The Road comes close). It is considered by many to be McCarthy's greatest work and one of the most important works of our generation. Ultimately, I think that McCarthy's genius lies in his ability to dig deep into the places that many of us are afraid to go and show us the logical outcomes of some of our most troubling feelings and capacities as human beings. As for Blood Meridian itself, it was so very troubling to me as to practically defy description or categorization. I can only say that it is the work of a genius; whether I can count is among my favorites (or even most respected) will take a considerable amount of further contemplation. Blood Meridian begs for discussion, and I am very interested in what all of you have to say."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This was my first Cormac McCarthy read. It was a great novel. There is no way to tell for sure what type of world McCarthy was trying to create, or how accurate the portrayal was of the times. However, this book was as ominous as a blade on the brow, as deliberate as a trail-ride across the expansive wilderness, and as morally ambiguous as a government sanctioned band of murderers. The book is a very interesting take on a complex element of American history. Not my favorite McCarthy novel (see \\"The Road\\"), but definitely a great one."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"If Melville had decided to channel the spirits of the Marquis de Sade and Elizabeth Bathory and then set out to write the great American western (only after devouring half a sheet of blotter acid), the results might be something along the lines of this epic. Tarantino and Scorsese wish they were this capable of depicting the human animal's capacity for bloodlust, delerium and psychosis. Friends, this book is damn raw and damn gorgeous. The intensity inches up the whole ride. Moreover, this one is home to one of the most insanely vicious hombres to grace the pages of the novel:The Judge. I couldn't put this baby down when I first read it. Read it 5 times since. Trust me. This one stays with you."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"...I won't go into the storyline here, as many others have, but rather let me tell you that this book is a rare experience: it gets you to understand the sheer amoral brutality that got us to our current state. Better than any other book, it presents the philosophical underpinnings of our ethics as people and Americans in the characters of the Kid (protagonist) and the Judge (the character of most interest). The book is rich with allusion, language, and stunning passages -- my book is marked up and dog-eared from my first reading.Go and read this book if you have a love for literature ... this is a book that will survive as a classic. It may not be the best novel of the last 25 years, but I'd be hard-pressed to name a better one. Like any great work of literature, I have many questions about the novel, things I'd like to discuss with friends, arguments that I'd like to have about it. It's a real shame that McCarthy is most associated with All The Pretty Horses which is a FAR inferior novel, but it often happens to great novelists.This final message: if you have, like me, disliked the sappiness of McCarthy's Border Trilogy, don't be put off. If you are a fan of his books, and missed this one, then read it immediately."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This is certainly a very disturbing book. I enjoyed it as I do most of his books. I am only writing this review to warn all those who buy the book not to read the Introduction until after reading the book. I was absolutely furious that Harold Bloom would give away the ending of the story in his Intro. I can't tell you how much it ruined the story. One last thing:DON'T READ THE INTRODUCTION!!!"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"The Modern Library edition of \\"Blood Meridian\\" contains an introduction by Harold Bloom that is a monument of literary excrement; it is easily the worst, most pernicious and irresponsible introduction I've ever read. He not only reveals the novel's ending in exacting detail (even going so far as to quote the epilogue and provide his own critical take on what the ending means in relation to the whole novel), but he also maps an entire symbology onto the characters which completely prejudices the reader and makes a fair and open-minded reading of the text nearly impossible.As for the novel itself, I found that it grew on me quite unexpectedly. My initial impression was that it was a spiritually hollow and desiccated mess with an aesthetic sensibility better suited to a cheap graphic novel. The incessant violence read like a prurient affectation, rather than a meaningful contribution to either form or function. As I got deeper into the novel, however, the raw power of the writing itself began to demand a kind of begrudging respect. McCarthy evidences an attention to detail here that is regrettably absent in some of his later work, and the result is often mesmerizing.The story is essentially historical fiction, based largely on the doings of the Glanton gang and their bloody work as mercenary scalpers of native Americans in the mid-19th century. There is a deliberately epic and unabashedly biblical quality to the prose; fortunately the writing is both expansive and comprehensive enough to actually make such conceits seem reasonable.This isn't a book for everyone. The gore is relentless and normative conventions of plot and character are clearly subservient to McCarthy's desire to create a parable out of mood and style. Oh, and the introduction is simply unforgivable."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This novel of the Old West is \\"about\\" neither Sin, nor Redemption, nor Judgement, nor Righteousness, nor Salvation. It IS most assuredly about Damnation, however. And a more spectacular paen to pain, magnificently wrought ode to woe, and artistic apotheosis of suffering is hard to envision this side of David Lindsay's A VOYAGE TO ARCTURUS or Malcolm Lowry's UNDER THE VOLCANO, two of its 'spiritual' relatives. Yet, in tone and language it often more closely resembles the haunted universe of Flannery O'Connor...And it may be said to share their sense of religiosity steeped in blood. And, more to the point, it revels in the perverse--i.e., recalcitrant--heart of humankind. What is at the core of its religio-philosophical perspective? That mankind's suffering is deserved. It is not so much the depiction of a Catholic universe, as it is a darkened Calvinist world in which most are ineluctably damned with but a few Elect to be spared...Yet under what conditions or for what reasons we can neither begin to apprehend nor have any right to expect to understand.The basic facts underpinning the book are truthful. There was a Judge Holden; there was a \\"Captain\\" John Joel Glanton who lead a band of marauding scalphunters through the borderlands of Texas, Mexico, Arizona, New Mexico, in the late 1840s--and who were themselves slaughtered by outraged Indians, deservedly so, at Yuma Crossing in April, 1850; there were incessant and horrific depredations throughout the borderlands by Comanche & Apache raiding parties during this period. Frustrated and terrified local state governments in northern Mexico turned to paying scalphunters to remedy the \\"barbarian\\" menace.From these essential historical facts McCarthy has fashioned an original work of genius--powerful, disturbing, and mysterious. His language alone marks this novel as among the most remarkable of its generation. No one writing in America today--after nearly a quarter of a century-- has yet approached BLOOD MERIDIAN's originality & strength. It isn't flawless, or no more than a slab of rock or chunk of limestone or desert cactus is, but is about as close to it as one has any right to expect.Not for the squeamish, and still less for the those who believe in humanity's spiritual or social \\"evolution\\", it nonetheless succeeds in the highest artistic sense (Schopenhauer's, let's say) and remains well worthy of our utmost admiration and attention."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Cormac McCarthy's 'Blood Meridian' is an examination of man's nature when the constraints of civilization are broken.Like McCarthy's other works, 'Blood Meridian' is set in 'The West.' Not Hollywood's 'Wild West' mind you, but a violent and frightening landscape of emptiness, dust and blood. You will find no show-downs between 'white hats' and 'black hats' at high noon here. America's national myth is drawn and examined and opened and destroyed to drive home the idea that 'Blood Meridian' is about us.As everyone notes, the violence starts early in the book and it never abates. Mr. McCarthy forces the reader to look, compels us not to turn away. The horrific violence is the vehicle McCarthy uses to move the novel from a story on his pages to a narrative within the reader's mind. Once the reader follows the characters across the border between civilization and chaos we find that, like McCarthy's characters, the violence has stripped us of our humanity. We've left it behind.As we read, Glanton and 'The Judge' become OUR king and OUR high priest. As The Kid's humanity slowly withers, we are compelled to recognize the degradable nature of our own humanity. The Kid is both the reader personally and a representation of the individual, both as part of society and opposed to society. If we are honest with ourselves we must allow Mr. McCarthy to show us that when faced with humanity's ever-present interior horrors (represented perfectly by 'The Judge') we are just as helpless as the pointedly nameless protagonist.That is the true horror of 'Blood Meridian.' Not the blood. Not the guts. Not even the dead babies. The horror of 'Blood Meridian' is that at any time we are a one choice, one action, away from the world of 'The Judge.' The constraining forces of 'civilization' are tenuous at best. And once the thread of humanity has been broken we are all either members of Glanton's gang or its victims.Mr. McCarthy's dense and at times difficult language paints a strikingly vivid picture. His word choice can be archaic and obscure, but no word (or sentence) in 'Blood Meridian' ever seems awkward or out of place. 'Blood Meridian' makes you work to understand what's going on, especially when McCarthy writes dialog. The 300 page book seemed much longer to me. While I occasionally found myself rereading passages the more likely reason was that Mr. McCarthy can construct two or three paragraphs that impart every detail of a hundred mile journey, all within half of a page.'Blood Meridian' is not a pretty book. It does not fit within today's entertainment consumer's expectations. 'Blood Meridian' is Hieronymus Bosch, not Claude Monet. Don't let that dissuade you. Mr. McCarthy has created a novel sublime in its ability to frighten and disgust you. It's well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"One of the best American novels ever written. The author shows us the heart of western man and wrings out the heart of the reader at the same time. What a movie it would make! No 50's genre cowboys, no John Wayne heroes, only reality in all it's horrors. I couldn't put the book down and have had the same report from everybody who has read McCarthy. Simply a &quot;Must&quot; for every reader of American fiction. This book has the same relationship to his later Trilogy (All the Pretty Horses, The Crossing and Cities on the Plain) as Steinbeck's &quot;The Log of the Sea of Cortez&quot; does to his later work. McCarthy is plainly in the same league as Steinbeck, Faulkner and Hemingway."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"The prose in Blood Meridian is so eloquent that it is often decieving. It is very easy to get caught up in the flow and forget what is actually being described. This is, without a doubt, the most violent story I have ever read, yet it is extreemly tender in its presentation. One has to carefully picture some of the scenes to see the full impact of McCarthy's vivid and incredibly authentic vision. He is able to describe truely horrific scenes with such care that one must look very closely to see the savagery he is depicting. It is incredibly authentic, which is what makes the horror palatable. It is not gratuitous, in fact, the savagery is veiled by the eloquence of the prose. It is on of my favorite books. I highly recomend it."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Okay, I confess: I'm one of those snooty high-brow readers. I peruse those ridiculous \\"100 Best\\" lists for my reading selections; I check the National Book Award and Pulitzer Prize titles for my next book to read. That said, readers have already posted numerous excellent reviews for \\"Blood Meridian\\", so I'll attempt a different approach.Writing/literature is a legitimate art-form and, like classical art-forms, has two categories: [1] the masterpieces and [2] everything else. \\"Blood Meridian\\" is a masterpiece. I'm not sure I've ever read any modern novelist who elevates literature to an art-form as convincingly as McCarthy does in this book.McCarthy crafted \\"Blood Meridian\\", too be sure, and reading it plagued me with alternating visions of him writing it: an erstwhile Von Frankenstein in full maniacal glory, or a transcendent Michaelangelo pouring his soul into the Sistine Chapel.McCarthy's style is peculiar to say the least and may be off-putting to some (unusual sentence structure, highly figurative language.) His execution...well, let's just say, I don't think I've ever re-read so many passages my entire life: mostly to experience again the sheer delight of his writing, but every now and then just to figure out what the heck he's saying.In summary, I feel privileged to have read the book and won't likely have a more affecting read for another 5-10 years. Six or maybe seven on a 5-star scale."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This book was listed as one of the top American contemporary novels in a recent New York Times-sponsored poll of writers. That tells you just about everything you need to know about it: the novel is a piece of writer's writing, an experiment that practitioners of the craft appreciate because it expands the boundaries of what has been done on the page. Alas, it also means that the exigencies of actually getting through this stuff is really secondary to its popularity in certain quarters. It's the kind of book everybody wants to have read, but few enjoy reading. As such, it naturally elicits a certain kind of intellectual pretension in those who have slogged through it.\\"Blood Meridian\\" is concerned with a party of white gunmen who have a writ from the Mexican government to kill Indians in the southwest border country. I hesitate to say it is a \\"story\\" about a party of white marauders in the border country because the plot really seems quite secondary to McCarthy's project. Nor are there any developed characters per se. There's somebody called \\"the Kid\\", who does and witnesses despicable things, and \\"the Judge\\", who does the same and pontificates about it. These are figures with names, to be sure, but nothing one might identify as recognizably human, with all the qualities that concept implies. There's also no obvious point of view, with narration that jitters from clear omniscience to the clinical narrowness of a child who likes to pull the legs off frogs.What the book does show is McCarthy, a deeply gifted prose stylist, at the top of his game. There are more indelible images on one page here--usually having to do with landscapes--than you'll see in whole books by other writers. The three stars in this review are for passages like \\"A thin shell of a man lay capsized over the jagged peaks\\".Still, it is possible to overstate the virtues of McCarthy's prose. There's a straining quality to it, a thesaurus-pounding desperation, that emerges in passages like \\"...they had been burned unredeemed in the a green and stinking bonfire so that nothing remained of the poblanos save this charred coagulate of their preterite lives\\"...or... \\"...the little stream braided over the sands in the valley floor shone like woven metal and save for the sound it made there was no sound other.\\" So far so good up to \\"for the sound it made...\\" but McCarthy looks like he's straining with that pointless reversal \\"no sound other.\\"In short, a interesting but highly overrated work."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Dark, bloody, discordant, dystopian, and more. But four such adjectives are enough. This book is in the same intellectual bin as Orwell's \\"1984\\" and Kosinsky's \\"The Painted Bird\\", but differs in that it is set in the Old West, whereas the others are set in the more contemporary times of the recent past (WW2) or the near future. The author's use of language in \\"Blood Meridian\\" sets this book apart from the others. Nearly every page has one or more unusual but perfectly legitimate English words, or ordinary words used in unusual ways. Some readers might find a large dictionary to come in handy. If your dictionary passes the test in this book, it still might not be good enough for the author's \\"Outer Darkness\\" (q.v.), which surpasses \\"Blood Meridian\\" in its liberal sprinkling of rare words, or ordinary words used in rare ways. A thriller of a very dark order."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"What a magnificent novel! Despite some convoluted sentences and other literary devices distinctive to McCarthy's oeuvre, the wonderfully-wrought imagery of the American West in 1849, the deft characterization of the wandering Kid, the marked man Toadvine, the brutal Glanton, the fallen priest Tobin and the satanic Judge Holden, and their sinister journey through the violent high desert of the Mexican-American Southwest make the story captivating and thought-provoking. It will be helpful to the potential reader to know elementary Spanish as some chapters are replete with Spanish phrases. I concur with Harold Bloom and the other Amazon reviewers who believe that \\"Blood Meridian\\" is destined to become a classic. It is certainly no ordinary Western!"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read.
