A really worthwhile read!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"great. Kept me reading until all hours. Being raised in the a small town in the south, it really was a true repersentation of what goes on."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book took many different avenues and spoke of many people which hurt the story in my opinion. The time away from the main character and the problematic conditions of Ron's actions while free made him very human, which I can understand seeing how it is nonfiction, but made Ron a very difficult protagonist to like. I felt for his situation and the injustice that had been done, but the stories of many other characters seemed to just die off. When they wound up taking so much time from the central story, it seemed as though it was incomplete. Grisham did a great job letting us into Ron and his family members' lives. Because of it, I truly feel for their ordeal."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read most of his novels, enjoyed all. The InnocentMan,was a tough read due to the recapping throughout.No author can please everyone. I hav ordered his next book."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I gave up on this book awhile back because I thought it moved too slowly with this entire backdrop on Ron Williamson. I didn't realize I was reading a true story, due to the fact I rarely peruse liner notes. Grisham always writes fiction I thought.Then...after being blown away recently by another Grisham book \\"The Brethren\\" I thought I'd give \\"The Innocent Man\\" another chance, STILL not realizing it's based on a true story. While reading, I kept thinking this is not that good a story. Did Grisham really write this? Those were my ignorant thoughts through the first half of this book but I stuck with it, and boy I'm glad I did.When Barry Scheck (lawyer in the OJ trial) became involved I gradually realized this was a true story but I didn't know how the story would resolve. This made for a great fantastic read! The story figuratively became alive.I'm not sure how I would feel about this book if I had known more about it from the start. Grisham is one of the most talented writers out there, fictional or non-fictional.Vincent Marzello does a good job with the audio book especially with the voice of the innocent man Ron Williamson. Thank God for DNA. Powerful book! Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I don't write book reviews often but I wanted to voice my love for this book. I have read Grisham before and while he's not my very favorite author, he is a great writer I've really enjoyed most of his books that I have read. I was a bit weary of his 1st non-fiction book however, but after having read it for the 2nd time now (I don't do this often) I obviously love this book. The fact that this a true story that in itself was amazing enough, however Grisham's writing just adds to it making it a great read. I love that Grisham is managing to make this story more widely known as I think it is well deserved. If you are like me this is a book that will have you infuriated at times, and tearing up with joy at other times, and will surely haunt you for years."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I read this book in under 3 days. I had it on my Kindle on my iPad and phone and was reading it every chance I could. Before even reading this book, I had changed my opinion on the death penalty. I used to be for it. Since becoming an attorney I have personally witnessed police completely completely change their testimony in front of judges when exposed as lying. I have seen prosecutors push cases for political reasons when that had little factual basis to. My personal experience had been on relatively minor matters. When you give someone a badge and a gun, or the power as a prosecutor to take away someones freedom and life, a sense of infallability takes hold in many cases. This book and case about which it is written, as well as the Norfolk Four case in VA show that this goes all the way up to where the death penalty is used. We cannot trust government to make life and death decisions. I shudder to think about the cases that where people were executed for crimes they did not commit.I challenge anyone who believes in the death penalty to read this book and still be pro-death penalty after finishing it."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I am 2/3 through the book. I normally really like John Grisham books but this one has been dull. The fact that it is a true story is the only interesting part and what keeps me going on it. There are way too many names to remember. It can get confusing at times. Grisham does a great job describing each person but it seems so rushed to describe the person that it is difficult to get attached to their emotions. It would seem appropriate to read The Dreams of Ada before reading this book. It makes a lot of reference to it."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is a true story about my home town. I knew the victims and the accused. John Grisham did an excellent job of telling the stories surrounding these crimes and corruption concerning small town politics. This is a must read."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"The summary of the book and the author drove me to purchase this book. I got through half the book and stopped, even though I felt guilty for not finished a book, because I have other books on my shelf that I want to read. The storyline is good but it is way too long and very repetitive. The book could have been shortened by at least 1/2 and still have a powerful story. Good storyline but it drags on and on that it gets lost to the reader."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"At first, I did not think I would like this book, because I do not really care to read. However, I had to read it for a college course. Once I started reading it I could not put it down. If you ever thought that within our legal system that you are innocent until proven guilt, then think again. This is a book that really needs to be read."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have never read any of John Grisham's books, so I really have nothing to compare this book with. As far as I know this is his first nonfiction book, and I think he made a good job. I got this book for my birthday last year. I don't think it's a book I would have bought myself, but I don't regret getting it or reading it. I read it in 5 straight days. The most terrifying thing about this book is that it's a true story. It's really indignant to see how the arrogance, stubbornness and sloppy work of the police and some prosecutors can get innocent people convicted. And even worst, get sent to the death row.Justice is supposed to be blind, not stupid. But at certain times it's really scary how the scale can be tipped based on people's prejudices, beliefs, egos and level of stupidity. I'm not a lawyer, but the evidence or rather lack of it was so overwhelming that it's inconceivable that this two people, Ronnald Williamson and Dennis Fritz got convicted based on mere speculation, suppositions and nonsense logic. None got fair trials, and Ron Williamson didn't get a fair treatment according to his mental state. They neglected his mental health and even got a kick out of it in prison.The forensic science still has its flaws and is limited in some things, but it's still a blessing for some suspects. Some can count on it to save their asses of being wrongfully convicted based on the presumptions and dislikes of police and prosecutors alike. Some people just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, or they just do things that look bad but aren't necessarily so. So, if you have the stomach to dive into the twisted word of injustice, and the cruelty of some prison's warders, go ahead and read this book. For me it was a page turner, but it might not be for everyone else. It is heart breaking to read about the life of this tormented soul, Ron Williamson, and the tragedy his life was due to mental illness. It is a very sad book, but an interesting one no less."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"There is no way of getting round the anger at the police and the corrections officers that builds while reading this true story. The overwhelming notion that prevails after the last page is yes: absolute power corrupts absolutely but what humans can do to eachother with only limited power is astonishing and heartbreaking. The police who convinced (or maybe they just thought he could've been the one and that was enough) themselves that the man was guilty had enough power over him and the investigative process to accept evidence that even a lay person would argue was dubious. But that was enough for the police who needed to arrest somebody, anybody: the truth, the oath of their office was irrelevant.There seems to be something missing in training of the police force - they need to understand that arrests aren't quotas on a factory line. They need to be taught ethics, otherewise we end up with the hubris of one criminal element with power enforcing the laws against defencless citizens.Well written - still angry."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is John Grisham's only nonfiction book and proves he can still write a good story.

This book reads like fiction."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I bought Ann Rule's new book and this one by Grisham, thinking that I'd be set for holiday reading.

I haven't read Grisham's fiction books, but I think he should stick to what he knows how to do best.This book was really confusing...jumping from character to character.

Granted, his notes at the end assure us that this is not unique to Oklahoma or any other state. On the other hand, those states like Bush's Texas that are backward enough to retain the death penalty and in a hurry to carry their legal lynchings to conclusion are also the source of most of what is wrong with our entire country these days, including additional examples of the junk science used to rationalize these wrongful convictions."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"At best this is a very poorly organized documentary.

I am an avid reader of John Grisham - have read all his books, and I am having a hard time finishing it. If it wasn't John Grisham, I would have closed it for good at this point.

You know who did the crime in the first few pages. While I initially was interested in the massive coverup and found the characters compelling, after a while I started not caring. The level of incompetence was distressing; but Grisham's writing was not as good as in fiction. I usually cannot put Grisham down, his writing flows so well. I was easily able to put this one away. Scimmed through to the end."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is a harrowing story of an innocent man, falsely accused of murder, who makes it all the way to death row before finally being exonerated, but not before his mental and physical health are irreversibly damaged. It is written in a straight narrative, passionless style -- really a 'ticking off' of events as they occurred. Although the author states he wants his readers to understand how an innocent man can end up in this terrifying situation, I gained no such understanding, and this is why the book was so unsatisfying. I sympathize with Ron Williamson's plight, but the story is still so one-sided. What were the forces that caused him to be railroaded by the justice system -- sheer incompetence? Prejudice? Laziness? Was no one on the prosecution side willing to talk about why they stood by and watched this man go through the system despite a complete lack of evidence? Witnesses are not interviewed, evidence is ignored, appeals are denied -- but we are never told why, or even the prosecution's explanation, if there was one. I don't know if the author made an attempt to talk to anyone on the prosecution side, and perhaps there is no excuse they could offer, but it left a hole in the story. I finished the book shaking my head at this man's ordeal, but still not understanding quite how it happened."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"To date this is the worst book I have ever read, and I have read thousands. I saw an interview with Matt Lauer on the today show and the book seemed so promising. I don't even know how to begin to describe why it is so bad.

If you are a fast reader, like things in order and quickly told -- don't waste your time!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Do not buy this book.

Shame on you Grisham to put out crap like this just to make money."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Is what I wonder each time I pick this book up. I consider myself a very caring person but I haven't conjured up anything but pure disgust at this Williamson. Mental illness is very scary and disturbing to me and I think it can't really be helped all that much and it ticks me off that they quit taking their meds and go off the deep end. What purpose did he serve here? I looked at the pics and saw he was wasted away to nearly nothing so went searching to see what finally put him out of his and everyone else's misery. That was the high point of the book and I may not have to finish it now. Yes, it sucks that he was not guilty but he was crazier than an outhouse rat!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I firmly believe that Mr. Grisham should stick to fictional writing.

In the middle of the book, there are a few pages of photographs of different stages of the suspect/defendant's life. The captions next to the photos give away the story. How stupid was that.

Very disappointing."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I know Grisham is famous for entertaining novels and I love true-crime stories (many of which are not entertaining) so I looked forward to this book. I was disappointed by the style (I think crisper editing would have kept all the elements of the story pulled together more neatly), but I was not disappointed by the story. And I'm glad Grisham wrote this because he has so many loyal readers, ensuring that the terrifying reality of how easily any one of us can become a victim of the state will dawn on a greater number of people."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book is great. It sheds light on many controversial issues as well as telling a great story about a man that was lacking in many areas, specifically his mental health. Any one that is on the fence about the death penalty or is for the death penalty should read this book. The death penalty is a full-proof way of ridding a criminal from society, however our justice system is far from full-proof. Many officers want to be the \\"good guy\\" and put someone, anyone, away for a crime whether they committed it or not because this is what society and the victim's family wants. Despite what many think, the most important thing to give to today's society is not just someone at the wrong place at the wrong time, but to be honest and to do their job with the respect that millions of people entrust in them. Too many cops use their occupational status to do bad instead of good."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"As you probably know, The Innocent Man tells the story of Ron Williamson, and how he was arrested and charged with a murder he did not commit. He was later sent to death row for the murder, due to a failed system. The story is truly tragic and unfair, but it is this unfairness that draws the reader in. Amazingly, Williamson is not the only person charged in the rural Oklahoma county with a crime that he didn't commit, and Grisham's book brings to light how several bad players including police and appointed defense attourneys can fail people, especially the poor. Unfair trials do exist, and people are wrongly convicted, although I have to say Grisham's book opened my eyes to just how this can occur. I found this book tragic, yet extremely interesting. He does an excellent job of writing nonfiction and letting the reader get to know the background and personalities of those involved with Williamson's case. I could not put the book down and read it in just two days!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This was not what I am used to from Grisham. I know fiction and non fiction are different, but I always enjoy Johns' novels this was a long dragged out story, that I would have put down after about a quarter of the book except I always finish a book after I start it.

I ordered this one simply because of the author. I was expecting a novel, and was disappointed because this book more closely resembles a history textbook."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"As a Grisham fan I own every book he wrote. The Innocent Man was slower to grab and hold me, but after a few chapters it became a page turner. It even affected my previous views of the death penalty. This book brought home to me how spine chilling a trip through the court systems can be. John Grisham did a fantastic job, again."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I think John Grisham did an excellent job with a very difficult subject. I prefer his non-fiction books, perhaps because I don't want to admit that there are such injustices in our court system. It's a rather unforgettable book to read."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Grisham is a good fiction writer, so it is interesting that for his latest project he has chosen a non-fictious account. Maybe truth, after all, is stranger than fiction. As a Grisham fan, the book is worth a read. Although, personally I feel that he should stick to fiction. Towards the end of this book, the sytle degenrates into juvenilistic writing: short sentences and simple paragraphs. Not to mention too many characters that come and go throughout the story. Now to the book itself. In this book, Grisham recounts the story of two individuals -- Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz -- who were framed for the rape and murder of one Debbi Carter in Ada, Oklahoma. Ada is a small town, everyone knows everyone else. Which is why the fact that the murder remained unsolved for five years was a mystery. Which is why the police thought that they had to work harder to find a suspect. Which is why they zeroed into Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz. Grisham makes no bones about the fact that his sympathies lie with Ron and Dennis. After all, the police had to solve this murder, and since the real murderer was being sheilded by the police (for of all things, providing a steady supply of narcotics to the Ada police force), they had to frame someone else. So Ron and Dennis drew the short straws. The police had a dream confession from Ron, and that was enough. You see, dream confessions in Ada had a productive history. They had helped solve the case for one more murder, implicating another pair of innocent bystanders in the process. Ron and Dennis were ultimately exonerated by DNA analysis and the real killer is behind bars. That is good; however, if Grisham wants the reader to feel sorry for Ron Williamson, then he fails (at least when I am that reader.) To be sure, I feel sorry for what Ron Williamson went through -- no one should have to suffer the indignities of the state's wrath upon them -- but I do not feel sorry for Ron Williamson, the person (I do feel sorry for Dennis Fritz, though; but he is not the explicit object of the book.) Ron had everything in his life that a child could want; his father even purchased second-hand clothes for himself so that his boy would have money to buy baseball bats and uniforms. Ron had a talent for baseball that saw him all the way to playing in the minor leagues for the Yankees. But because of injuries, he could not make it to the majors, and as is usally the case, he breaks down. Drugs and booze follow threafter, coupled with delusions of what he would have been. All these conspired to ensure that Ron was literally, a walking disaster. We live in a society where it is best to shunt one's blames on something or someone else; Ron is no exception. He had all the means for making his life better at his disposal, even without baseball. He chose not to use them, and instead spirals into an endless abyss. If the Ada police would not have gotten him off the streets for a framed murder, they may well have done so for a real one. Ron was tried for two previous rapes, though he was acquitted in both cases; he was also cited for drunk driving: qualities that do not neccessarily point to a fruitful life (yes, I know what people will say -- we cannot pre-judge in a free society. True, and that's why I am not pre-judging Dennis Fritz. Dennis Fritz's life had a few hiccups, but by and large, his education and intellect enabled him to steady it. Education eluded Ron Williamson, and with excessive drug use and booze, so did intellect.)"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I was shocked and dismayed at the horrid misuse of the American criminal justice system, though I suppose matters like what Grisham described happen more frequently than publicized - most likely because of DNA testing.I recommend this to all Grisham fans."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This true story is horrifying and gripping: two innocent men at the mercy of rumour, corrupt local government and inept lawyers and forensic experts, both found guilty of murder, one of them five days from lethal injection on death row, Oklahoma-style. The fact that the injustice was eventually righted cannot detract from the frightening prospect of it happening today, somewhere else where the death penalty is in force. The book gathers momentum after the first sixty or seventy pages, but Grisham in his epilogue says he could have written 5,000 pages on the subject. I, for one, am glad he stuck to about 350.The story is fairly objectively told, and although the title tends to give it away a little (!) this is a fascinating page-turner, a copy of which should be sent to everyone who works in law enforcement or the legal profession in any death-penalty jurisdiction. At the very least, Grisham and his publishers will be performing a wonderful service to the few who, in all probability, still slip through the net.This book makes me want to go out and research more deeply into the whole subject of the presumption of innocence (and I have legal training, like Grisham, although perhaps not his budget!).Buy it, read it, pass it around. It gets four, not five stars because the story could, perhaps, have been told a little better."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I really like John Grisham's other books, and I expected ths nonfiction book to be different but was disappointed. It appears that Grisham is trying to do a book similar to In Cold Blood, but the topic here is just not as interesting. It is quite long and actually boring until the last fifth or so of the book, but it takes perseverence to get to that point. I think a shorter format would have helped."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This was yet another great Grisham novel.

Definately recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"An excellent book; an important book. The tone of the prose puzzled me for a while, but I realized eventually that there is a kind of dark allegory in the style that helps keep several themes going at once. The most obvious of these is the intertwined stories of the several characters, but the depth is created by interweaving the issues of Law, Capital Punishment, Due Process, Mental Health, to name just a few. The myriad minor characters provide a sort of cell structure to continuously regenerat the narrative. Grisham also has a plain respect for the basic story, and never intrudes, except for the rare expression of disbelief. A must read--read it!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I've read this book twice now, and I'm still enamored with it.

The only thing we need to do is revise the way we do it."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I've read a few Grisham books over the years and found them page turners without any lasting effect. THE INNOCENT MAN changes that. Two men are accused of rape and murder five years after the crime and are convicted. An occasion that should be a credit to the law enforcement of Ada, Oklahoma, but instead it became a case study for the injustice of our justice system. Just the thought that it was so easy to convict two men of a heinous crime without any real evidence and then sentence one of them to die is bone chilling. Grisham does an excellent job of sticking to the facts of the case and giving the reader a full account of what occurred. The facts alone are an intriguing tale, and with the added benefit of Grisham's clear narrative line, this becomes intriguing as well as important. Occasionally there is a tough of indignation, which has just cause to be there, but does interrupt the clarity of the narrative. This occasionally can make the book move a little slower then it should but don't let that dissuade you; the value of what's being told is significant. This book should make anyone re-think how the death penalty is applied and regardless of your feelings on the issues does raise important questions about how this miscarriage of justice can occur in the USA."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"John Grisham is a great author.

Quite a talent he has in writing."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Grisham could do more non-fiction! As this story unfolds, you'll be horrified and amazed at how this small town's legal system operates. I have a legal background and know first hand how things get botched, but these were mind-boggeling screw-ups. Grisham can definitely tell a tale, and you will be totally absorbed by the characters. I do give this 4 stars instead of 5 as the story got a bit draggy and slow in parts. A few parts were repeated a bit too much. Didn't matter though. Still a great read by Grisham and will leave you wanting him to do more of the same type work. If he tries another non-fiction, I'll definitely give it a try."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"great book . I read it in 24 hours , which is not normal for me."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"The Innocent man is quite good and its main subject is very interesting. Ron Williamson is the main guy talked about in this book and while the book summarizes a true story, Williamson's storied life reads like a work of fiction. He was a star athlete in high school and it looked like he had a very good chance to establish a career in Major League Baseball. He was already playing for a team affiliated with the New York Yankees and life was looking good. His family was very uptight and prudish, attending Pentecostal church services each week and enforcing a strict moral code in the household. The family foundation seemed strong and young Ron Williamson was talented in sports. He seemed like he had a promising career ahead of him.But Williamson also had a darker side that surfaced every now and then, particularly when he was drunk. Ron and his buddies liked to carouse and drink the night away and his excesses often got him into trouble with the law. Of course, he never came even close to killing another human being but his police record- however slight- and his established record of living as a wanderer led the prosecution in the Debbie Carter case to issue a warrant for his arrest. The prosecutors ultimately convicted Williamson and Fritz with no physical evidence of any kind. They relied on snitches, intimidation, and distorted facts. It was an act of injustice at the highest level, but the prosecution got away with it and even convinced most of the people in the town of Ada that Williamson and Fritz really were guilty as charged.Grisham effectively tells the tale of injustice in Ada and his writing is strengthened by the frequent use of dialogue. Exact quotations are included in many parts of the book and many of them are (apparently) taken directly from court records so they add an extra element of reality to the book, making you feel like you're right there, in the midst of the trial, listening to every word. I like Grisham's story telling and even though this book seems fictional, it is a true story all the way and deals effectively with the issues of injustice and wrongful conviction.As much as I like The Innocent Man, the critic in me must point out a few things that prevent this book from being the perfect classic it might have been. First, with the writing, Grisham often uses short paragraphs and he likes to use multiple \\"and\\" in the same sentence rather than separating the items in his list with commas. This will drive English students and others a little batty as they read. Also, and most importantly, Grisham failed to include a reference, index, or footnotes section, and I find this somewhat surprising. I know that Grisham ordinarily writes fiction but I find it unusual that he failed to include, at the very least, a list of notes to back the book up.Overall, The Innocent Man still ranks highly in terms of readability and appeal and it's the type of book certain to invoke emotion and outrage from many readers. Injustice like this does take place, sometimes right in our own hometown, and we need to think twice before we accept the conviction of a \\"criminal\\" or the words of a prosecutor as hard facts. The book isn't as enjoyable as some other true crime books, but it is still quite good and I recommend it to all- including those who are not normally inclined to read non- fiction. The book keeps you in its grip, even though you already know what will happen in the end"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I typically am a big Grisham fan, but not this time. For me, this book has been a slow and plodding read. If you are looking for drama and excitement, this book won't deliver. Yes, it tells an important story. If that's the type of novel you want to lose yourself in, have at it. However, stories of sloppy and/or corrupt law enforcement hardly make for \\"can't put it down\\" reading. If this is the direction Grisham is taking with his future novels, I'll pass and look elsewhere for my dose of great legal drama."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I'm so glad this tragedy of injustice was uncovered and Mr. Grisham did a fantastic job of telling the story.

Actually, I'd give it 4 1/2 stars for Grisham's first work of non fiction. He certainly developed the characters well and I thought the sisters, Annette and Renee had moved in with me. As in other John Grisham books, he shared with us how to know the Lord. And this is a case where the prayers of the sisters and the late mother were answered. He certainly detailed the incompetance and non caring attitude of locals in the State Court System of Oklahoma, specifically in Pontotoc county. Bad language to them! On the other hand the Federal Court System, specifically U. S. Magistrate Jim Payne, his staff and U. S.District Judge Seay are to be commended in their dillegence and saving the life of Ron Williamson. The book should be a must read for folks serving in law enforcement positions and in the court systems across the US."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"John Grisham has done a great service in producing this book.I'm intrigued by how often reviewers on this page have voiced their opinion of the quality or readability of this book and how it compares to other of Grisham's work. IMHO, this book stands alone compared to his other work AND is vastly more important work than any of his fictional works (all of which I have enjoyed). To declare whether or not someone \\"enjoyed\\" The Innocent Man or whether it is \\"dark\\" or whatever is fine as far as it goes, and would be most appropriate for fiction - but misses the point. In the case of non-fiction the much bigger question is whether it is an accurate, well crafted documentation of objective facts and realities (including the opinions, attitudes, feelings and perspectives of all the key characters). From this view, John Grisham has produced an outstanding work.In this very tragic story, the biggest failure was not the legal \\"system\\" per se but rather specific individuals (prosecutors and others working on this case) who let their \\"opinions\\" or \\"feelings\\" of the guilt of Ron Williamson (and Fritz) interfere with their professional and moral responsibility to conduct thorough and precise investigations and legal work.And by the way, I also thought this book WAS a highly readable page-turner!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Fans of John Grisham know what to expect when his latest effort lands on bookstore shelves. Unique plot twists, evil villains, sympathetic heroes and a page-turning plot are the cornerstones of Grisham's work. THE INNOCENT MAN, his newest book, has all of these components in spades with one additional element: it is a true story. His first work of nonfiction will fascinate and frustrate readers as they ponder an American legal system run amuck. This is Grisham's nineteenth book, and in some respects it may be his most important. Fictional characters in fictional courtrooms may cause readers to think briefly about our legal system. THE INNOCENT MAN forces readers to take a probing look at and ask some serious questions about a legal system that, in important criminal cases, appears to be malfunctioning in every corner of our nation.While THE INNOCENT MAN ostensibly is the story of Ron Williamson, who spent 12 years on Oklahoma's death row after having been convicted of a murder he did not commit, the book is more than Williamson's heartrending tale. Co-defendant Dennis Fritz was wrongfully convicted of murder but sentenced to life in prison. Along with Williamson he was ultimately exonerated by DNA evidence. Two other inmates, Tommy Ward and Karl Fontenot, whose cases were interwoven with Williamson and Fritz, remain imprisoned in Oklahoma serving life sentences despite substantial evidence of actual innocence.Ada, Oklahoma, was the venue for the outrageous events leading to the miscarriage of justice chronicled in this book. In 1982, that community was rocked by the brutal sexual molestation and murder of Debra Sue Carter. From the outset, the investigation was poorly handled by law enforcement officials, who incorrectly assumed that two individuals were involved in the crime. Promising leads were not investigated because police attempted to establish a case against Williamson and Fritz instead. Grisham records in vivid and excruciating detail how police hid evidence and ignored constitutional safeguards in their zeal to obtain convictions in the case. Sadly, they were ultimately joined in their effort by prosecutors and judges.One difference between Grisham's traditional works of fiction and the factual accounting of THE INNOCENT MAN is his hero, Ron Williamson, wrongfully convicted of Carter's murder. Williamson is not the sympathetic character one finds in many of Grisham's novels. He starred as a high school athlete in baseball and was selected by the Oakland Athletics in the 1971 Major League draft. His professional baseball career never achieved the promise displayed by his youthful potential, and he returned home to lead a life dampened by divorce, drugs, alcohol and small-time crime. Burdened by mental illness, his attitude contributed in many respects to his conviction. But Grisham's portrayal makes perfectly clear that Williamson's behavior in no way justified the outrageous actions of law enforcement, prosecutors and judges.It is perhaps one of the ironies of the law that while lawyers and judges failed Williamson, it would be others in those same professions who rescued him only five days before he was scheduled to be executed from imposition of his sentence of death. Lawyers from the Oklahoma death penalty assistance program and a courageous federal judge ultimately secured a new trial for Williamson. During the course of the investigation and preparation for that trial, Williamson underwent DNA examinations that would establish his innocence. It was one of the first big DNA exonerations in American courts.THE INNOCENT MAN is not a book that Grisham planned to write. Speaking last month to University of Virginia law students, he described how he first came upon Williamson's story when he read an obituary in The New York Times. The headline of the death notice read, \\"Ronald Williamson, freed from death row, dies at age of 51.\\" That simple sentence stirred Grisham's interest: \\"After reading the entire obituary, I knew it had the makings of a much longer story.\\" He followed up with interviews and has written a brilliant documentation of how innocent defendants are sentenced to prison far too often in America. His research and writing have caused him to take a long hard look at justice in our nation: \\"Even if you support the death penalty, you cannot support the death penalty system as it stands in the U.S. My one hope is that people realize this system we have is simply too unfair to continue.\\"Two of America's greatest courtroom novelists are John Grisham and Scott Turow, who have written about murder and death in our halls of justice. How ironic that both have begun now to speak out about the injustice of capital punishment. Grisham does so in a voice loud and clear and through a book that fully explains why the nation needs to reexamine the process by which we sentence criminals to be executed.--- Reviewed by Stuart Shiffman"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"John Grisham's first non-fiction book, \\"An Innocent Man\\", is a story of several tragic events. First, Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz are convicted of crimes they did not committ. Second, Bill Richardson, the foolish Ada District Attorney, is still in office. Next, Tommy Ward and Karl Fontenot were also wrongly convicted. Also, the police in Ada were totally incompetent, as were representatives from other Oklahoma law enforcement agencies. Basically, the entire system failed miserably, and I wonder how often it fails at other times.The book is very sad in the beginning, as we learn of Debbie Carter's death, and Ron Williamson's decline into mental instability. Then, the book picks up at the end whe Williamson and Fritz finally are released from prison and gain peace in their lives and make amends with their past. This book is worth reading, but I don't know how well it compares to other Grisham books. It's a true story of justice gone awry.I live in Oklahoma City, and I was outraged to read about the horrible tactics used to convict Williamson and Fritz. I was amazed of how many people it took to turn the other way to allow this conviction. One of the more amazing parts of the story, is that, before her death, Williamson's mom testified to the police that Dennis was home with her all night. She kept a calender of everything that happened, and on that night she and Dennis watched movies at home. This evidence was never introduced at trial because the police hid it, and Williamson's lawyer was pretty bad.I could go on and on about the things that appalled me. You should just read the book yourself. This book may just have a profound affect on your views about the death penalty. I'm an extreme religious conservative that is against the death penalty. A good fiction book to read on the subject is Richard North Patterson's Conviction. Grisham's book also convinced me that if ONE person is executed when they are actually innocent, then the death penalty should not be used. I'm convinced there are many people that have been executed who were actually innocent. Ron Willilamson is proof that it does happen.One of the worst things I found out about in this book is that Bill Peterson, two of his assistant attorneys, and Gary Rogers are still working in Ada. Hopefully this book will help get those dishonest people run out of that town. I've been to Ada once in my life and I promise I will never go back.Grisham writes with an obvious bias. He believes the police and DA in Ada were fools, that justice was mocked, and Ron Williamson was not treated fairly. Much of this is obvious, but in his bias he does not give the side of the story from Ada's view. Then again, it probably didn't matter. There is nothing to say to justify the prosecution and conviction for murder for a crime a mad didn't committ."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"John Grisham's The Innocent Man is a thought-provoking book on the wrongful murder conviction of Ron Williamson. True crime fans will not want to miss this one.Innocent Man is an intriguing tale that recounts Williamson's star-crossed life. Williamson began as a small-town baseball hero who was a second-round draft pick of the Oakland A's. Less than 20 years later, he sat on Oklahoma's death row for a crime that he did not commit. Grisham's descriptions of Oklahoma's death row are vivid and very disturbing.While I recommend The Innocent Man, I think that the book could be better. As is the case in Grisham's novels, there is little nuance. Grisham's fictional characters often strike me as caricatures who embody good or evil (but never both). In The Innocent Man, readers will have no trouble identifying Grisham's \\"good guys\\" and \\"bad guys.\\" I much prefer writers who see \\"shades of gray\\" and who trust their readers to draw conclusions for themselves.I was surprised to see that a number of Amazon reviewers stated that The Innocent Man is a boring book; it held my attention for all of its 400+ pages. In fact, it made me want to read The Dreams of Ada, about two other murders in the same town.In summary, The Innocent Man is worth reading. But, in reading it, you have to deal with Grisham's shortcomings as a writer."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I enjoyed the first half of the book.

However, we find that he is denied justice by the town, the detectives, and the judge that presided over the case.This true story kept me up late into the night, turning pages until I could find the outcome. It made me rethink my positions on the death penalty and the justice system. It made me wonder how many innocent men we have convicted, and how many we have executed.I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"It's never easy to become popular.

It's never easy to be able to write extremely well. Not if you want to be recognized as an excellent writer.All Grisham's fiction is entertaining, easy reading with a clear, distinct writing style and no hidden meanings. He tells a story and presents his view on what goes on within the American legal system. Straight forward. Clear conclusions. No doubt anywhere.\\"The Innocent Man\\" is a true story. No clever legal fairytale this time. And Grisham tells it in his usual nononsence way. Shocking facts about \\"confessions\\". A detailed general description of execution with lethal injection. Fatal verdicts based on false or non-existing evidence.The story has been thoroughly researched. Facts about people and incidents are presented in his usual easy style. Legal and police language is made undestandable to laymen. Grisham tells what is necessary. He has a story to tell and never strays.And beneath the seemingly detached presentation, Grisham reveals a big heart and a strong social conscience. The very private pragmatic bestselling author who has partly, but only partly, hidden behind a tough guy image all through his authorship, could not have shown his true self more clearly. In this book we are, if indirectly, introduced to the man John Grisham. A kind, warm-hearted, even sensitive human being with strong opinions and a soft heart.Many authors are compared to John Grisham. \\"Better than Grisham\\" the critics say. Meaning, as I see it, that Grisham is no big deal.

Grisham's skill with non-fiction is as accomplished as his skill with fiction and the result is a gripping, compelling story of a gross miscarriage of justice that certainly calls for some serious reflection upon the merits of capital punishment, if for no other reason than the ever present risk of an innocent being put to death for a crime he or she never committed. The details of the story were so incredible that they were almost unbelievable and had this been a work of fiction rather than non-fiction, it would have seemed far-fetched.I think this book also has a point to make about human prejudice in that while the two men accused of this crime weren't always model citizens, it was more the fact that they were \\"strange\\" that led to their being convicted on such shoddy evidence.

In this case, he's writing about a real life occurrence, backed up by some excellent evidence in the form of a dramatic, shocking, and somewhat \\"how the heck could they do this\\" kind of story.Ron Williamson is the man highlighted in this book. He was a potential baseball star who was bound to become a huge name in the sport. Unfortunately, personal problems stood in the way of these goals. Then he was wrongfully accused of murder, and that was what put his life in a whirlwind. A little over a decade of his life was wasted and scarred before he was finally declared innocent, but for what exact purpose?\\"The Innocent Man\\" shows us real life occurrences in the legal system. It shows us how being proven guilty doesn't necessarily mean that you are guilty, but nevertheless could cause you to be killed or ruined for life. Williamson also had to put up with life in prison and how the guards treat the prisoners is just honestly described.

Even knowing the final outcome, you will feel compelled to read the entirety, however, there are many, many, many, many (notice the monotony?) sections where I feel like the same information is reiterated. This isn't really true, because he is describing another episode of mental illness, but they all seem to blend together and be almost the same thing happening over and over again. In the epilogue, Grisham states that he could have written many more pages on this story, which I would have read. I would just have preferred the specific details of Ron Williamson's bouts with mental illness to be more condensed since they were basically repeats.Overall, the writing of the rest of the story was done well, I encouraged my teenage son to read it as he is doing a research paper on the Death Penalty, and I feel it will give hime good insight into what death row is, and the injustice that goes on in the Justice system. I believe that most people are decent and honest (as there were some who helped Ron Williamson in this story ), but this story focuses on how the need to solve a crime can lead officials to make horrendous, dishonest decisions, and how these decisions destroy a life. (This is not to say I don't want murderers caught and punished, even if by the death penalty, but there would have to be no doubt, not just beyond reasonable doubt. If there is any chance at all (I mean any) life in prison would be a better choice to me.). Sometimes this same desire to solve a crime can hinder the chance of solving it, and do the reverse (OJ Simpson case).On the flip side of this story, you may be interested in the movie \\"Just Cause\\" from, I believe, the late 90's with Sean Connery and Laurence Fishburne."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This true life story outdoes any fiction for drama.

This story of an innocent man wrongly convicted is unimagineable. Ron Williamson, the subject of this book, needed mental health treatment from an early age. Because he did not receive a proper diagnosis and followup treatment, his whole life was ruined. It affected his entire family and probably contributed somewhat to his parent's shortened life. Because the legal system in his hometown failed him, he spent years in a maximum security prison, which caused him to deteriorate further physically and mentally. It makes me shudder to think that this happens to people like Ron, more often than we realize. Congratulations to John Grisham for bringing this to the attention of all of his readers and the public in general. Bravo!! I say."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"While the story in itself was oppresive, I found that I was unable to put down this book. I have been an avid Grisham reader from day one, and his last couple of novels have turned out to disappoint.This is a story that needed to be told. This is a story about a very sick man, who nearly died for a crime that he didn't commit. The thing that bothered me even more...he wasn't the only one in that town punished for a crime that he didn't commit.I was also reading this during the rapid execution of Saddam, and while I think at times we allow for too many appeals and drag on our executions, I now fully understand the reasoning behind it. An avid supporter of the death penalty at one time, I am not teetering the fence.I give this book 5 stars - this was not an easy topic to write about. Grisham takes a non fiction book and is able to weave the storyline to read like fiction!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Grisham should have titled this book THE INNOCENT MEN and gone more in depth with the lives and supposed crimes of the other innocent men who were tried and convicted in Oklahoma courts (four convicted of murder in Ada, Oklahoma alone) on the shakiest of evidence. He seems to have had to pad Ron Williamson's story a bit to make it to acceptable book length and he easily could have expanded his work to tell more about the other horrific injustices in the same general time period and locale.Having lived in Oklahoma I can confirm that Grisham does a great job portraying the people and lifestyles of small town (and actually Tulsa and Oklahoma City residents are really pretty much the same as those in the smaller communities) Oklahoma without looking down on the state. And he is careful to say that the injustices are not just an Oklahoma problem. Yet as a former Oklahoma citizen I can also say it is not surprising that these incidents happened there. Hopefully this book will \\"open the eyes\\" of many Oklahomans so there are not as trusting or complacent in regards to authority including the local police and court system."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"John Grisham's newest book recounts the story of a man who was treated, at the hands of the criminal justice system, with cruel and unusual punishment, and the punishment was for something he didn't even do! I constantly shook my head in disbelief at the number of injustices the reader becomes witness to throughout the telling of this story. Grisham never becomes preachy regarding the death penalty--he merely tells an engrossing story well. This is not an indictment of the death penalty, it is an indictment of arrogant prosecutors, power-drunk police, and a justice system that prefers expedience and manipulation to truth. Well done, Grisham. May many read and respond with their voices and their votes for local politicians who so often have more to do with the death of innocents than the Supreme Court or legislators who lobby for the death penalty."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"In this remarkably grave narrative expose of how things can really be done incorrectly in the 'justice' system, Grisham tells the story centered around a small Okhl. town. While the author himself states that this is a \\"legal thriller\\", I beg to differ. While the 'story' is grave, well-narrated and sharply focused, it is not a thriller - at least not in the context of what I associate his previous legal thrillers to be. The focus of this book, is the stark reality of how incompetent cops, detectives,and judges can subvert and ignore rules to suit their own ambitions or requirements. The first two chapters almost gives away the whole story, and certainly for anyone who has read the story or its reference (almost all death penalty related articles mention this story), suspense is virtually non-existent. So, a reader shouldn't expect the semi-super-man-like heroic lawyers or their paralegals to save the day. In a way, thats good. One can immediately emphatize with the characters' depression and feeling of outrage of whats happening to them. Grisham manages to invoke that feeling without resorting to any histroinic narration. The gravity of the story is powerful enough. A good read."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"The bare reality of the story is outlined in a few sentences near the end of the book: \\"When you don't have any money to defend yourself, you're at the mercy of the judicial system. Once in the system, it's almost impossible to get out, even if you are innocent.\\" This is a direct quote from the accused - a boyhood sports hero, Ron or Ronnie Williamson, who went to the Yankees' minor league team in Fort Lauderdale, to only end up in death row.What happens in this book is everyone's worst nightmare. In fact, as stated in the book - it is a dream that became a nightmare.Mentally insane, the accused Ronnie Williamson was called to the police five years after a murder. He went, and took a polygraph, not knowing that it was the end of his freedom and the beginning of oppression the American way. Three hundred pages later, you have read the detailed account given by Grisham as to how this man lived more horrors in 12 years of imprisonment than entire communities endure in generations.Distilled into one paragraph, Williamson's original trial was a disaster which required a new trial. \\"Ron deserved a new trial for many reasons, chief among them ineffective assistance of counsel (blind attorney named Barney with limited resources and paid only $3,600.00). Barney's mistakes were numerous and harmful. They included the failure to raise the issue of his client's mental competency; failure to throughly investigate and present evidence against Glen Gore (the real murderer); failure to flesh out the fact that Terri Holland (a lifetime jailhouse snitch) had also testified against Karl Fontenot and Tommy Ward; failure to inform the jury that Ricky Joe Simmons had confessed to the murder and had even done so on a videotape that Barney actually possessed; failure to attack Ron's confessions and suppress them before trial (the products of hours of oppressive questioning); and failure to call mitigating witnesses during the penalty phase.\\"To be fair to the attorney involved, even Mickey Mantle - the subject's hero - had weeks of being hitless, constantly striking out in important situations, and being equally inept on the field. The difference is that for Mantle, it is only a game. This book shows the problem of being \\"off one's game\\" in law - a person can be sent to death row.And, thank God that Williamson's game involved a rain out. The game would be finished at another time, when Mantle was at his best, with new umpires, and the opposing pitcher was incapable of getting one past him.The end result was a man's catastrophic rise from sports heroics to a fall derived from a \\"bum arm\\" which bottomed out at death row, then to the rebounding rise of being the attention of the national news. Then gravity hit. As his freedom's furnicular ascended to newer heights, his health simultaneously descended. The stress, wear and tear of medicines, and just bad luck combined to make the 51-year old Williamson look and be fifteen years his senior. The sadness pervades with Ronnie and his family who unfortunately gathered a cornucopia of bad memories which cannot be covered or forgotten by good events like the efforts of pro bono attorneys or this book - a first nonfiction account by Grisham.Depicting the struggles in the court, describing in simple language the complexities of the courtroom, and making the endlessly inexcusable escapades of the criminal system of the small town seem personal, Grisham has the reader experience and feel like Ronnie - prisoner to the pitfalls and problems involved in American justice. Albeit the best judicial system on earth, especially in providing the accused rights to a fair trial, it consistently or even constantly fails when handled by less than extremely conscientious and proud professionals. And, too often we are human, which means too often human attorneys, police and judges are less than always conscientious. And that is when the perceived great halls of justice can be seen as less than hallowed.This was a great read for the topic alone."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"It's becoming a well known fact in the US - there are two different justice systems, one for those who can afford the best defense, the other for those who cannot. The indigent can be, and often are, treated to a paltry parody of trial and sentencing. Nowhere have I encountered a better example of this than in John Grisham's account of the railroading of Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz in the Oklahoma murder case of Debra Carter. Grisham recounts the outrageous details of the case, in which every standard of evidence, from the sloppy work of the local police to the misconduct of attorneys and judges, was blatantly mocked. The trials were both travesties of perjury and corruption, based upon the testimony of snitches and legal system cronies.Whether or not Ron Williamson was a nice person or a sane one, whether or not he had the potential for violence, he and Dennis Fritz did not commit this murder. The authorities destroyed the lives of two men and their families, while failing to prosecute the true culprit, who was always prominent in the picture, and indeed provided false testimony. Readers can usually ignore \\"must read\\" recommendations, but with respect to The Innocent Man, it is \\"a book that no American can afford to miss.\\" The system of justice upon which our country is based is in danger."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"John Grisham tells a true story that shows how our justice system can truly fail.The case of Ron Williamson shows us how Ada police and detectives ignored overwhelming evidence and placed Ron William in jail for the murder of Denise Haraway, one which he did not commit.I am disappointed that Grisham will not make any more adventures into non-fiction, because this was a very interesting and eye-opening read."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book is heart wrenching, and all the more so because it is true.Prosecuters, judges & police blatently ignored clues & evidence pointing to the real killer and arrested and convicted 2 innocent men. Because of the Innocence Project in New York and Texas and lawyers who believed in them, they were set free 12 years later.I support the Innocence Project but I never realized how it is close to impossible and sometimes takes YEARS to free an innocent man.I am a true crime fan, but NEVER have I read anything that compares to the detail in this sad story.Grisham should be commended for writing the complete truth about this case. It shakes you to the core of your being.Prosecuters take heed! A recent example of runaway presecuters is the JERK at Duke University.

Anyone should read this book it is very informative and scary to think innocent people are on deathrow."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I purchased this book thinking that it was a Grisham novel. It reads like a novel--though not necessarily up to Grisham standards. At first I hought that it might have been an early, previously unpublished novel, written before Grisham's extradinary story-telling skills were fully developed. About a third of the way through, when it became seriously tedious, lacking the surprises, humor, and plot twists that I expected, and lacking any characters I could personally identify with, I read the cover and realized that it is non-fiction. Although \\"non-fiction\\", Grisham stands tall on his well-used soap box, with his opinion that the justice system failed by executing a mentally defective innocent man for a gruesome murder.Honestly, I'm glad that Grisham did not attempt to present the other side of the story, because a \\"balanced\\" approach would have been even more tedious. Grisham's self-righteous preaching to the choir (and superb writting skills) is the only thing that keeps the book going---at least for me, a novel reader, with little patience for most non-fiction, and little interest in the underlying story.Considering the large number of reality shows on TV, there is a large potential readership for such time-consuming non-fiction. For those readers, and individuals who are professionally interested in law and the justice system, the book is probably sufficiently fascinating to overcome the slow pace. It is one-sided---but I do not find that objectionable---rather, it is just something to keep in mind.Otherwise, the only serious criticism I can offer is for Grisham's editor, who should have edited the book down to half its length."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read a couple of other books by him and this one is no different.

Yes, it was on all the morning shows and some talk shows, but I did not hear or see anything about this prior to Grisham's account, so kudos to John for getting it all down on paper.Tragic.

I enjoyed it and finished it...but did I relish it like The Last Juror? Unequivocally NO.I thoroughly enjoyed his baseball lore and the endearing and incredibly compelling tale of Ronnie Williamson being hung out to dry by the Ada PD and the equally inept Oklahoma Judicial Department as well as the inexcusably incompetent Oklahoma Prison System. I felt for him...I really did. But, by the end of the book, I was almost bored with the lack of suspense. I mean, a blind man (sorry, Barney) could have seen the last 100 pages coming. Worth a read...just don't expect the amazingly dramatic Grisham dramatic ending as we have come to know and love."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is a compelling story about a man wrongfully, deliberately and maliciously prosecuted for murder, his narrow escape from lethal injection while on death row, his eventual exoneration through DNA evidence and his pitiful life.Grisham makes plain that the district attorney in Ada, Oklahoma and the local police are worse than inept. They usurped justice in this case, blindly ignoring one who should have been a primary suspect from the beginning of the investigation to erroneously pursue and convict two others with absolutely no evidence. Once committed they bullishly refuse to this day to admit wrong and never took a hand in correcting the error. Other parts of the criminal justice system eventually righted the wrong.The story, while not converting me from pro-death penalty, certainly gnaws at me long after the last page. I would insist that the death penalty not be available in cases where a large portion of the evidence is circumstantial rather than forensic and factual, however, that alone should not be the end for reform in our criminal justice system while there are prosecutors and police officers such as those in Ada.Unfortunately while the story is compelling, even riveting, Grisham's narrative is sub par for a writer of his caliber. Throughout the book he is repetitive and redundant, making some points so frequently that it begins to annoy and detract from the story. The story drags in many places. I've seen some compare Grisham's work here to the level of Capote's \\"In Cold Blood\\" but that is very unfair to Capote. Capote's book was much thicker and still moved quicker than Grisham's. Grisham spends too much time exhibiting how the central character was flawed and mentally ill from the strain, constantly parading his lunatic rants in front of the reader. After the first one or two instances the original point has been made that he is not a perfect victim and then it wastes paper. One instance required several pages of quoted transcript to demonstrate how the judge made several unsuccessful attempts to drag Ron Williamson into court to participate in his own defense. Grisham the lawyer was possibly attempting to show the basic fairness of the presiding judge and he utilized the familiar tools of transcripts and court testimony but it adds nothing to the story and detracts from the pace. Utterly non-essential.I recommend the story but give the story teller mediocre marks."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I listed to the unabridged audio version of this book. Between the pedantic writing style and the narrator's monotonous voice it is a wonder anyone could make it through the 12 hours of this audio book.

I am a major Grisham fan & enjoy all his books. Yes, this is different because we know the ending, we know Ron Williamson is released, exonerated...however we didn't know the Ada police/DA continued to pursue evidence that would bring him back to trial...they just couldn't live with their exposed frame that put him & Dennis Fritz in prison, Ron on death row.I thought THE CHAMBER did an admirable job on the cruel & unusual punishment of the death penalty. Now Grisham writes of the probability that innocent people are executed. Unfortunately because man is fallible, our justice system will be fallible. There is no real justice in this world. Frankly I'm happy that Ron Williamson is with his Lord."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I think I have read most of John Grisham's books, enjoyed them all (particularly Street Lawyer). I believe that he started as a very good writer, and has simply gotten better and better. This book was, for me, a \\"page turner,\\" although I listened to it, rather than read it. I was compelled to finish it as fast as I could, and simply couldn't stop. \\"The system\\" isn't always right, and when its wrong, its so wrong. Its easy to join the mob of people who, often inspired by the press, rush to judgment in cases like this, and want to give the accused a quick trial, then take him out and hang him. God bless the lawyers in various innocence projects, and the ACLU, who quietly seek to protect the rights of the innocent and overwhelmed. And thanks to John Grisham for telling this story - one which needs to be told."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I wrote that the Broker was not the book I should strongly recommend. Well, I'm astonished now, because Mr Grisham knew about ties between Cia and Italian Telecom. How did he manage? Well, back to the Innocent man. I have read some of the recension before me. I think it could be hard to cope for a layman, but it's very interesting for a jurist, expecially for a no American one. The plot is intriguing, and the style is very dry. I read it in a day, and I learnt very much about American system. System is really good, sometimes men aren't, like everywhere. The clue is: American juries care more about what a convicted should do in the future, then about which crime one actually performed, if then. That's the reason why a dropout like Ronnie was a perfect candidate for lethal injection. He was crazy, noisy , arrogant, he slept most of the time and use to chase boozes and skirts. What's the use of let he in life? Grisham is great when at the end calculates to the penny what's the cost of such a court mistake for the american taxpayer. A cynical could rebuke: right, but only because it happened to be eventually corrected. The correction was the really burden, and not the mistake. I hope to read more nonfiction from Mr Grisham, that could even write a postfaction like Victor Hugo in the Miserables: Italy loves my books, but Italian judiciary ssystem isn't any better ( Hugo said Italy loved les Miserables, but Italy was really a worse country then France ).It's a book about justice, not simply a book about american judiciary system or small countries judicial oddities. I recommend it to all law students."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"The Innocent Man is definitely worth reading, even if only to enlighten those of us who generally have full faith in the American justice system. The shocking reality of pressure on the police and prosecutors to solve major crimes, the inclination of judges and jurors to believe such \\"unimpeachable\\" professionals, and the frequent lack of financial and manpower resources amongst investigators, prosecutors and public defenders creates a very troubling brew of cut corners, indifference and outright deceit. Far too often this leads to innocent people going to prison (or worse) and criminals running free.As a dose of reality Grisham's first work of nonfiction is excellent. As a \\"good read\\" it is somewhat less so. Too much redundant detail makes some sections drag on. Too many similar characters suffer a similar fate. And too many police and prosecutors cook the evidence too many times. All important, all tragic, all outrageous but also after awhile a tad tedious.Finally, Ron Williamson, the central character, is surely no angel. While he clearly did not commit murder he also clearly had a history of violence against women. How sorry can one feel for a man who was charged with rape by one woman while out on bail for the rape of another? Or, by this very statement, am I too guilty of a rush to judgment (he was cleared of both charges)? It's hard to ever be 100% certain...and perhaps therein lays the challenge of our judicial system."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Grisham does it again. Only this time he makes us all see what can and does happen to innocent people in our so called Justice System.Being the webmaster for two websites for innocent men on death row opened my eyes to this horrible injustice done to so many.In telling the story of \\"The Innocent Man,\\" the king of the legal thriller has put a human face on capital punishment and gambled with his audience. If you are expecting a breezy, true-crime read you won't find that here... but you will find a darker product, a well-crafted, meticulous study of a broken system. Grisham asks a nagging question: If wrongful convictions happen all the time, how do we know that the poison is flowing into the real killer's arm?\\"This is not a problem just in Oklahoma, far from it,\\" Grisham writes. \\"Wrongful convictions occur every month in every state in this country, and the reasons are all varied and all the same -- bad police work, junk science, faulty eyewitness identifications, bad defense lawyers, lazy prosecutors, arrogant prosecutors.\\"Before his descent into hell, Ron Williamson was a young man bursting with big-league promise, the next Mickey Mantle as the people around Ada, Okla., liked to say.Ron was drafted in 1971 by the Oakland A's a few months after graduating from high school. After a perfunctory stint in the minors, was headed for The Big Time.Ron's love of strip clubs & alcohol was as strong as his swing.By 24, his marriage was wrecked as well as his shoulder.Stripped of his uniform, Ron was either so depressed he couldn't get up off of his mother's couch or filled with manic energy. He moved from job to job and was twice accused of rape, but none of the charges stuck. What his devoted Pentecostal family didn't realize was that Ronnie was slowly losing his mind, beset by undiagnosed manic depression and schizophrenia.The hometown hero had turned resident creep, so when 21-year-old Debbie Carter was found raped and strangled in her Ada apartment in 1982, it was inevitable that the police would find their way to Ron Williamson.What shouldn't have been inevitable, Grisham argues, is the perversion of justice that followed.Though witnesses saw Debra Carter arguing with a man she knew hours before she was killed, that man was NEVER pursued as a suspect. Instead, detectives homed in on Williamson and his friend, Dennis Fritz.A bloody handprint on the bedroom wall of Debra Carter's didn't match Williamson or Fritz -- NOTHING at the scene did -- but the lack of hard evidence didn't stop prosecutors. They convicted the men using a BOGUS confession cobbled together from one of Williamson's tortured dreams, the perjured testimony of jailhouse snitches and \\"the junk science\\" of hair analysis.Williamson was clearly mentally ill -- he had to be dragged screaming & hollering from the courtroom -- but NO ONE consulted a psychiatrist to see if he was competent to stand trial.Grisham expertly dissects each judicial and constitutional outrage with cool precision.\\"Once in the system, it's almost impossible to get out,\\" Fritz told a reporter, \\"even if you are innocent.\\" And that is the terrible truth Grisham lays bare. After DNA proved Williamson and Fritz hadn't killed Debbie Carter, the prosecutor announced that he still considered them suspects.Please, NEVER TRUST THE AUTHORITIES! TRUST THE EVIDENCE!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Please don't assume you are getting the regular John Grisham novel.

Along the way, he exposes a seedy world of drinking & drugs, shocking murders, big league dreams and small town corruption. I worked in Ada, Oklahoma, in the late 1980s as a news reporter, even covered the Ward & Fontenot re-trials in person. The Innocent Man took me back to a time when I believed in 'Innocent Till Proven Guilty'. Grisham's book raises serious questions about the adage. But it also paints a landscape of hope, of believing in one's self in the gravest of circumstances and of never giving up, no matter what the odds.

However, I was actually able to empathize with him and cheer for his release from death row, while at the same time cheering against the Ada police.I am from Oklahoma, and although I was not familiar with this story, I was familiar with a lot of the places mentioned, and I actually know (friend of a friend) one of the reporters mentioned in the book a few times, and also have another friend that was going to school in Ada at the time of the murders. He said Ron Williamson was definitely the talk of the town.I will definitely buy this book and see if the impression is different than reading."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book, written by novelist John Grisham, is written in a novelist's style, but is a non-fiction book. I have been a traditional \\"pro-death penalty\\" advocate, but this true story challenges and perhaps changes my convictions. This well-written book is almost impossible to put down. Don't read it just before bed! oRV"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This may be the most important book John Grisham has ever written.For those of you who haven't read it or are not familiar with the case, \\"The Innocent Man\\" centers on Ron Williamson (the primary focus) and Dennis Fritz, who in 1987 were convicted in Ada, Oklahoma (just a few miles from where I sit typing these words) for the 1982 murder of Debra Carter.The case against them was based primarly on a disputed \\"dream confession\\" by Williamson (which was neither recorded by audio or video, though both means of recording were available) and on testimony by jailhouse \\"snitches\\", who traded their testimony for lighter sentences of their own.One of these jailhouse snitches was a man named Glen Gore, who, in 1999, when the DNA from the rape/murder was finally tested, was proven to be the actual killer. Unfortunately, by that time, Fritz and Williamson had spent over a decade in prison, Williamson on death row.Grisham has especially harsh condemnation for Pontotoc County DA Bill Peterson (who's still in office, and who also used \\"dream confessions\\" that didn't match the facts of the case and a lack of physical evidence to pin the 1984 murder of Denice Haraway on Tommy Ward and Kurt Fontenot), and the Ada Police Department.Living so near Ada, this book has special relevance for me, and I highly recommend it to everyone. It points the j'accuse finger at shoddy police work and arrogant prosecutors who don't care about the facts.Sending innocent people to prison does nothing for law and order -- why isn't that axiomatic?"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Grisham has finally written a non-fiction book. He goes straight to the point, by describing the murder of Debbie Carter in the town of Ada, within the first chapters. He then continues on how the police caught the suspects, allegedly Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz; how Williamson got to Death Row through a corrupted justice system; how Williamson and Fritz never got a proper trial; how Williamson lost his mind (to say the least); how the prosecutor didn't present all the facts and didn't research *all* possible suspects; how important evidence is; how corrupted cops, judges, prosecutors, etc. are.I already knew the American justice system was corrupted, and that MANY innocent men (and women) were sent to jail/death row because of bad trials. But reading it, and particularly reading Williamson and Fritz's story, is infuriating, and maddening.It is refreshing though to see groups like the Innocence Project exist and do their best to provide new trials based on DNA testing to exonerate innocent men.The testimonies of Ron's sisters, Annette and Renee, his older friend Bruce Leba, and several other contacts, add to the incredible injustice Ron has gone through his entire life.Grisham delivers a moving, poignant story, which is almost a biography of Ron Keith Williamson, who many people still believe guilty of Carter's murder even though DNA testing proved his innocence!!Extremely well researched, it is a well written book that is worth reading, and which may prompt you to take action, especially if you live in the USA.I can't help but wonder, after reading this book, how George Clooney (who recently bought the rights to the book) will adapt this to the screen."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"If you believe in the idea that people are innocent until proven guilty and that the authorities are fair and honorable then you must read this book.

The book exemplifies the problems with the death penalty, i.e. if the verdict is wrong and the accused is executed than new evidence comes along, you can't fix the problem. However, the book reminds my of first year of law school \\"readings\\" in criminal law cases. It states a lot of very dry facts and more facts. Barry Scheck and his crew at the Innocence Project are champions: they always have been champions the of \\"phrase gulity without a reasonable doubt.\\" However, the true heroes in this book are Ron's two sisters: Annette & Renee. The author states in the book flap \\"if you believe the criminal justice system is fair, this book will infuriate you.\\" I state that the criminal justice for the most part is fair; however, there are rotten apples in the criminal justice system. It's amazing to me that the people who live in Ada didn't at some point question the actions of the prosecutor. Read, react, protest, inform and question: after all we are not sheep to be lead. Why would a town like Ada continue to tolerate Bill Peterson and have Bill Peterson as their current district attorney? Hello Ada ? ? ? There is no doubt the author did his work and spent many hours with interviews and documents writing this book; but still it's dry reading and some of the dialogue is repeated and repeated. The criminal justice system, as this book plainly exemplifies has problems acknowledging issues regarding mental health or the lack of it: and this is a real problem for both the defendant and the justice system. The author does a great job of clearly painting this picture: I believe it's the strongest point of this book. Our justice system is not perfect, but it's the best in the world. A point to be taken from this book would be it's not who you know; but what you know that counts. Also, science really came through for the Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz: DNA is an astonishing tool in seeing justice done in criminal deeds.

It's a compilation of facts, not a novel. After forcing myself to finish the book, I decided that John Grisham must not have been able to find a \\"there\\" there. He must've initially been drawn to what seemed a compelling story of gross injustice and broken dreams, but then Mr. Grisham just couldn't find depth or heart and soul or even much intelligence in the people he wrote about, so he was left with dry chronology, dates of events and legal facts and he did the best he could with the limited material he had to work with. After reading \\"The Innocent Man\\", I felt great relief that MY ordeal was over and felt very little sympathy or caring about Ron Williamson or any of the rest of the characters. I'm sorry that Ron Williamson and too many others suffer gross injustices perpetrated by fools and evildoers, but after reading this book, it seemed to me that Ron Williamson was the #1 cause of his problems, he was weak in character and selfish, he became a drug addict and threw away his life in doing so not only ruined his own life, he upset and polluted the lives of his parents and sisters and everyone else who cared about him. Evidently he was a spoiled, self-centered child who was never taught to be accountable for his actions, he was the only boy and his parents and sisters doted on him, and through high school, everything in his young life came easily, he was handsome and a gifted athlete, but when time came to be a man and create a good life for himself, he crumbled when his initial dream of becoming a pro athlete didn't happen, and used that \\"broken dream\\" to muck up the rest of his life. Most of us don't get to live the dream lives we envisioned when yhoung, but we do what we can with what we've got, we don't become drug addicts and selfishly ruin the lives of people who love us. I ended this book not liking Ron Williamson at all; yes he was wronged but primarily he was his own worst victimizer. If he'd had stronger character and less selfishness, if he'd looked just a little beyond himself, he probably would've had a better life and certainly his family would've had better lives.

He grew up in a religious Pentecostal home and participated in a lot of boyhood mischief. The one thing that set him apart was his athletic ability and he was the first Oklahoma player taken during the major league baseball draft of 1971. His promising career floundered because of injuries, a wild lifestyle, and other players who were more talented than he was. He returned to his hometown where he began exhibiting signs of mental illness coupled with an addiction to alcohol. Through a bizarre series of incidents, he was accused and later convicted of a murder he did not commit. Prosecutors and police were extemely anxious to solve the murder of Debra Sue Carter, a local girl. Grisham shows us with meticulous detail how this case went off the rails and an innocent man was sent to Death Row. With his legal background, Grisham is able to understand and reconstruct the many ways that this case went awry. Even knowing the end of the story, the reader is swept up in Grisham's expert story-telling and is fascinated to find out how this bizarre situation came to be. At times, the telling is almost too pedantic and detailed, but the overall impression from the book is that our legal system is seriously flawed and can produce terrible injustice."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"When I got the Innocent Man I knew it was based on a true life story. Most of the great writers that tried their hands at true life stories have failed or produced books that where mediocre in quality. Grisham has done this one well, it rates among one of his greatest so far.Innocent people are found guilty by the system in a small town where the prosecutors, the judge and the townspeople want a guilty party. This shows the legal system at its worst.The prosecutors in this case falsefy evidence, withold evidence in order to prosecute based and satisfy their narsisistic needs. The trial judge that does not follow protocol and disregards the safeguards in the system designed to protect the innocent and ensure that due process is given to every case.The story shows that while the American legal system is the finest in the world and has a lot of safeguards to ensure that accused are given a fair trial, there is not safeguard to make sure that prosecutors remain honest as they are essentially protected. personally I think that prosecutors that behave in this way should face criminal charges and sending a man to death with false evidence is murder"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"The fact that the story is based on an incident taken place in 1970's helped the story to be legit. Ron and Fritz are put on death row with nothing more than dream confessions. The court all along fails to see that there are not enough evidence to prosecute Ron and Fritz. For more than twenty years none of the lawyers or judges were able to see Glen Gore as a main suspect, something that is plainly out there to see. And the book mentions over and over again how a good lawyer like Barney fails to get a psychiatric leverage on Ron. I feel the book should either not mention it or do something about it. Not just plainly skipping through the fact that a lawyer fails to mentally evaluate Ron despite his obvious psychological imbalance.The book was very gripping in the start. We all knew that Ron is not guilty, even before starting to read the book. What I did expect is some groundbreaking discovery, something very minor that nobody ever imagined would come up and twist the whole face of the case and let Ron go free. But it was far far from a twisted ending. The story was over half way through the book.Let me break down some facts:Facts I knew before starting to read the book:1) Ron is convicted of a murder he did not commit.2) Ron will be freed.Facts I learned not even half way through the book:1) How the Ada police convicted Ron of a murder he didnt commit.Rest of the facts I learned from the book:1) Disappointing prison conditions.2) How Ron failed his life to become next Mickey Mantle.3) How he gradually wasted his life.4) His psychological problems.So in fact the story was over half way through the book. There is nothing new discovered at the end. It was just plain old mistakes made two decades ago that were re-discovered again and make Ron go free.I think John Grisham could have made this more twisted. Not his best."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is perhaps the most incisive popular book about the death penalty to be published since Stephen King's The Green Mile. The focus here is on the psychological toll of living under the sentence of death for decades as many on death row do. It is easy to understand why Grisham was drawn to this story when he first read about it in an obituary. Ron Williams' transformation from golden boy high school baseball player to death row inmate is fascinating enough. But in a deceptively simple prose style, Grisham also illuminates the effect of a crime on family, church and town. Along the way he also offers eye-opening, sleep-depriving descriptions of what can go wrong with expert testimony, prosecutorial power, interrogation techniques and legal representation. I noted at times that Grisham reached for and almost achieved the lyricism which Truman Capote summoned in In Cold Blood. Some high schools teachers should consider teaching this book in place of that one, because The Innocent Man carries some of Capote's non-fiction techniques into the CSI and Innocence Project Era.

I think his fiction is written in formula form due to his publishing so many books so quickly (much like - shudder - Danielle Steele). I decided to read this book, however, because I found the premise to be interesting and a sad reflection on what can happen in the criminal justice system. I couldn't make my way through the morass of details without becoming frustrated/bored, so I mostly skimmed it. I had no high expectations of Grisham, and he didn't surprise me. Ann Rule writes about true crime in a much more engaging way. I don't understand quite how this book made it to any best seller lists.

While we all know injustice in the system exists, this book was a real eye opener."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I think John Grisham should stick to writing fiction. He's very good at it and this particular non-fiction story, although well-written and researched, was a tad too long and kept constantly running along the same lines. Okay, so the reason for that might be because that was the way Ron Williamson's life turned out. The guy couldn't accept the fact that he couldn't physically stay with the game of baseball, so he turned to the booze, women and drugs. And he appeared to be somewhat of a wimp, a crybaby. And his parents and his sisters probably helped to cripple him, although they weren't aware of it at the time. And they loved him, so it was to be expected. So if this is my opinion, why the four stars. Well, I'll tell you why. Grisham did an excellent job of researching ths book. For a non-fiction, he went about it in fine detail. And as a lawyer, he had no qualms about telling how the criminal justice system can ruin a person's life, when in effect that person is perfectly innocent. They manufactured the evidence they had against Williamson, which as we've read over and over in other books and newspapers, it's done all the time. Prosecutors don't give a rip whether a person is guilty or innocent, they just was the verdict to be in their favor because it makes them look good. You have to admire Grisham, as a lawyer, for showing this to be true and speaking his opinion about how wrongful it really is. They may very well have executed an innocent man with little or no regard for the truth. They ruined Williamson's life (what little of he had left) and did so without even admitting they were sorry. No apology whatsoever. But in the long run, it cost them the big bucks. In the future, and maybe if the States have to start paying out enough money for the wrongful convictions and lawsuits, the legislators will wise up as to what's happening with the taxpayers money and get tough on the unfair and unjust situation. OF course, it may not be in this century, buy someday maybe.It took me a while to get through this book, I'll have to admit. It's not the page-turner that Grisham usually provides with his fiction novels, but then as non-fiction goes, it's okay. I doubt, knowing Grisham is a lawyer, that he left any page of his research unturned. You gotta admire the guy for that too. I bought the book and I'm glad I did. I have a collection of Grisham's work in my library. But you'd have to enjoy this kind of reading too."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I started out hoping for something intriguing. The back blurb led me to believe I was in for a treat and what started out great soon descended into one long boring drone. At times I had to force myself to pick it up again. Can't put my finger on what it was. Perhaps it was Grisham's need to constantly hammer home what a great guy Ron was (he should have trusted the readers to come to their own conclusions). Or perhaps it was all the erroneous boring day to day activities that Grisham constantly subjected me to. A lot of it felt like filler and I began to wonder if this story really fit the novel word count.

It opens one's eyes to injustices that are still occurring in our judicial system. People make mistakes, some through human error, some through will, some through choice, with repercussions rippling out in waves. Ignoring an obvious suspect, ignoring evidence that doesn't support a theory, ignoring alibi evidence, all this happened in Ada. Where else has it happened?Grisham's style has been contrasted in these reviews against Capote and Ann Rule, but Grisham was writing about innocent people. Guilty people usually have a much more compelling story to tell. Was it written perfectly? Probably not, but it was written well. It was interesting throughout.This is a culturally important book. As a society, we need to take a good look through the mirror Grisham has held up to these injustices. The wrongfully convicted should affect everyone's opinion on the death penalty.

It's really a biography of Ron Williamson's life and the injustice he was served. As I said, it's not a true crime novel but is it a \\"real life\\" story that is very intriguing.

This is a TRUE crime story and true crime is not what Grisham normally writes. I think John did an admirable job switching from novel to true crime.Having worked with prosecutors, I know that a lot of them are more worried about their egos, getting convictions (regardless if they're accurate), and continuing to get re-elected. The judicial system is for the rich and/or famous and it isn't about justice at all. What I can't believe is that the citizens of Ada re-elected this baffoon Bill Peterson. Come on folks, wake up!Although the story got off to a slow start, as it picked up speed, it was frightening, infuriating, and well crafted. Parts of the story, especially death row, were very sad and what happened to Ron Williamson and others who were incarcerated is all too common. I believe Bill Peterson, the Judge, the police and others should have been made to pay for their parts in this travesty. The fact that it took a civil law suit and some willing and interested attorneys to get some reprieve for these victims is very telling.I thought this was a compelling story with many layers and its amazing how many cracks Williamson fell throuogh without a peep from anyone, including his own court appointed attorney. If anyone, after reading this book, still thinks that in America you are innocent until proven guilty, then you havevn't been paying attention. It's happening everywhere and it's time America woke up to the realization that this could hapen to you in a system designed to protect your rights.

The more recent ones, though, are less interesting. They give the impression of being written for the sake of the paycheck rather than because of a real passion in storytelling. This book is the exception. Grisham really got into this sordid story of crime and punishment with two twists-the people who committ the crimes are NOT the ones being punished, and the story is real. This book is not quite as good as \\"Tulia\\": the characters are not as detailed, the writing is not as interesting. However, it is well worth reading if you want to get a picture of how the American justice system works if you happen to be poor. This is not an isolated case: the recent articles about exoneration should give pause to anyone who trusts this system. Yes, Grisham has his political opinions. Given that they are based on reality, I cannot see anything wrong with that."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"John Grisham is a good author.

He exposes the biases of law enforcement and even judges as he describes the real life drama of Ron Williamson and his long road to and through prison as well as through his mental illness.Ron Williamson was a fair haired child who was the favorite of his family. His older sisters helped to rear him and he had them wrapped around his finger, doing his bidding as if it were expected. He was a successful high school baseball player with dreams of becoming a pro, though it is clear from Grisham's narration, that he clearly lacked the professional skills and competency to become the great baseball player he hoped to be.Williamson caroused and drank and lost his shot at becoming a pro, though he was drafted and worked in Single A ball. In fact, he gave up the opportunity to go to college because he was sure he would become a pro baseball player. He was an abusive drunk, and had his run-ins with the law. When Debra Sue Carter was murdered, police were looking for a fall guy, or so it seems from the narrative. Ron Williamson was ultimately charged along with an acquaintance, Dennis Fritz. The two were railroaded through the system, tried and found guilty. They were given inept legal counsel, had manufactured evidence presented against them and the police tried to fit the \\"criminals\\" to the crime, rather than look for the real criminals.Ultimately exonerated, this story is a devasting reminder that the poor do not have resources available to them, are often accused and judged unfairly and pushed through the system. This story also tells a sad tale of mental illness and how it was used against Mr. Williamson, who was a bi-polar schizophrenic. Finally, it tells of severe abuses within prisons. I felt as though I was reading about a third world fascist state rather than America. Surely even death-row criminals deserve not to be starved, kept freezing cold or severely hot with inadequate heating and ventilating systems in cells that are too small. That innocent men, and several others on death row were mentioned in this book, are kept in this fashion is inexplicable as well as inexcuseable."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"John Grisham's first non-fiction work is an engrossing work. It tells the tale of Ron Williamson wrongly convicted of murder. Grisham recounts in a concise manner the details that amounts to a chilling tale.I've never been a fan of non-fiction works but I was willing to try this one because of the author. Mr. Grisham has a track record that's certainly one of the greatest in fictiondom. The only problem that I had with the book was all the names that were included. I know that it was necessary but it was still somewhat confusing. The story centers on Ron Williamson; accused, convicted & sentenced to Oklahoma's deathrow for a murder he did not commit. Williamson had a promising baseball career as a young man graduating high school. Unfortunately he wasn't able to hit at the bottom level of the minor leagues & wasn't able to progress beyond that point. This partially led to an increase in usages of drugs & alcohol which helped lead to his downfall. He was later diagnosed with being bipolar & schizophrenic, though these weren't his only issues. Grisham's story details the questionable police investigation, the \\"manufacturing\\" of evidence, the D.A. filing & pursuing the conviction of Williamson & Dennis Fritz (the so called accomplice). We are told about the inadequate defense of Williamson's lawyer, the judge who allowed evidence that was questionable & the many \\"Brady\\" violations, the jail snitches who lied in order to get plea bargains & diminuation of sentences.But the most appalling error was the fact that Ron Williamson was not mentally competent yet this was never brought up at his trial. In a previous trial in which he was rightfully convicted of check fraud the issue of mental incompetency had been addressed. After his conviction we see Williamson's slide into a mental nightmare from which he was never able to recover. Williamson spent eleven years on deathrow. His physical & mental health decline. It is a story of redemption in which innocence, finally, prevails. Unfortunately, it doesn't end there. Grisham goes on to tell us a little about Ron Williamson's life after release. Though Williamson gamely tried to live independently he wasn't successful at it. The most despicable part of the story though is the way the D.A. pursued this conviction based on the flimsiest of evidence. What made it worse was the fact that Oklahoma, the D.A., the Ada police department, the judge that presided, the defending lawyer nor anyone else involved ever apologized or admitted to wrong upon Williamson's release.I can highly recommend this book by John Grisham."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I could not put this book down. Its concise, clear and compelling because it reminds you not to put too much faith in those in power.

I won't name names because I don't know where the lines are drawn. Not that it matters much but I am so glad I am not a criminal type, they can make you look like one anyway. The county jail is full of staff infection and they will not allow anyone medical attention, they are stacked 10 to a cell, they sleep on the floor sitting in corners, where ever they can find. They are not given attorneys or read their Miranda rights. Most of them do not even know what they have done!! That is on the female side I can only imagine what happens on the male side. OSBI doesn't seem interested and the FBI will not return their calls, so these women sit and rot. The justice system in this small town is still in a horrible state.

You can tell by the way that his words weave a symphony of characterization, plot, suspense, and hope. However, the labor of love that became The Innocent Man is not like his other books. This book burdens the reader with the truth about our criminal justice system and the absolute immorality of sitting back and doing nothing to change it. What is worse, it seems that there are many who are willing to overlook the facts for the sake of their own vengence.Lots of people have trouble with this book because the truth simply hits too close to our fears. When you read it you will find yourself shaking your head because you know it is true.Those who think that this is about an agenda simply overlook the reality that truth is the truth is the truth. Grisham's work is mightly and empowering and will either have you pumping your fist that something has to change or backed into a corner defending broken systems and shallow justice.Brilliant work! Haunting. Challenging. Full of hope that sooner or later we will see blood thristy zealots losing their need for retribution and actually looking for facts to prove guilt or innocence.There is a study guide available for book groups and religious congregations [...].

It is a very one sided story and is easy to read his contempt for the the bad part of the criminal justice system, but it also made me think.

(*DON'T READ THE REST OF THIS PARAGRAPH IF YOU WANT THE STORY TO REMAIN A SURPRISE*) Even though the prosecution built their case on flimsy science and the testimony of obviously bribed convicts and snitches, Williamson and Fritz were both convicted. These mens' story will both frighten and infuriate you. From the inept police, to Williamson and Fritz's inept state-appointed lawyers, to the district attorney who systematically denied these young men their constitutional rights simply to get a conviction, to the various judges who all ignored the D.A.'s overt disregard for the defendants' constitutional rights, this is one frightening testiment to the American criminal justice system. From the start, everyone assigned with the task of solving this crime and bringing the perpertrator(s) to justice presumed Williamson and Fritz were guilty, and no one involved in the prosecution or defense of this case found it necessary to follow the rule of law with regard to these mens' trials. The result was a sentence of death for one, and life in prison for the other.This is one compelling story that absolutely needed to be told. The only reason I gave it 4 starts instead of 5 is because of the author's dry, overly-detailed and repetitive writing style. I felt so bombarded with characters' names that I actually had some trouble remembering who was who. (I kept wishing Truman Capote had written it - \\"In Cold Blood\\" was a such masterpiece with its compelling story and exquisite writing!)That said, I recommend \\"The Innocent Man\\" for the horrifying truth it uncovers - that even in The United States of America, people in power can imprison innocent men without having to follow the rules of our Constitution.And by the way, I was beyond disgusted to discover that the district attorney responsible for this debacle, Bill Peterson, is still the district attorney of Ada, Oklahoma!

Grisham did an excellent job researching the facts and presenting them in an unvarnished manner. If you want to read or to believe fiction, this book is not for you. \\"The Innocent Man\\" challenges the reader to take a hard look at the American justice system as well to honestly confront their own biases about punishment, mental illness and what we owe each human being regardless of their choices. It is also a beautiful testimony to the fidelity of Mr. Williamson's sisters who never stopped walking the road with him."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Though Grisham is well-known for his fiction, his artistry served his book THE INNOCENT MAN very well. When reading this book, it was sometimes tough to remember that this was an entirely true story. The amazing facts coupled with Grisham's extraordinary ability to tell a story contribute to this.The fact that Grisham was a practicing lawyer also was beneficial. He does a lot of legal editorializing -- especially regarding the overzealous prosecutor that convinced the jury to wrongfully convict Ron Williamson of murder (\\"The Innocent Man\\"). This book truly should be a lesson to prosecutors that their duty is to fairly present cases and that the end-goal should NOT be to achieve convictions at any cost -- in this case, the freedom of Mr. Williamson.But Grisham never forgets the humanistic elements. He went to great lengths to interview family and friends. It gives perspective on Ron Williamson that one would not find merely by reading the newspaper stories or the court records. Mr. Williamson, aside from his legal troubles, was a very sick man mentally, and the way that his two older sisters stood by him through thick and thin was quite moving.In all, there is nothing that John Grisham left out of this book that would have made it better. This book is truly worth 5 full stars."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is not up to the standard you have come to expect from Grisham.Some of the book seems to repeat itself.

Nevertheless, Grisham tells the story in his previous 'page turner' style and, despite his last few efforts, is back!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Absolute power corrupts absolutely. The founding fathers understood that principle and we all have at least a passing familiarity with the Declaration of Independence, yet we routinely ridicule the exercise of Constitutional defenses as \\"technicalities\\". Here is the story of what happens when those \\"technicalities\\" are ignored. We have a legal system that puts the common man and woman, as jurors, in charge of insuring that the power of the state is not used without justification. Not so, apparently, in Oklahoma where the prosecution chose to indict the town schizo and his best friend because the prosecution and police were unable or unwilling to do their jobs. Grisham implies but can only circumstantially show that the police deliberately ignored the guilty suspect and rushed to convict a person against whom there was no evidence. The sheer magnitude of the prosecutorial misconduct is staggering.Mr. Grisham surely understood the depths to which prosecutors can descend, before he ever wrote The Innocent Man; frankly, it is impossible to practice law for any length of time without seeing a mockery made out of due process by a politically-motivated prosecutor. What is truly frightening about this book, however, is the fact that the judge, jury and Court of Appeal all dropped the ball. There needs to be a greater appreciation for the protections afforded to society by the jury--is it really too much to ask that a prosecution put forward a solid case?Jurors (and judges) must appreciate the gravity of their role and be called to account when they fail. Take, for example, the Duke Rape case. I'm watching that one very, very closely. The prosecutor in the Duke case exhibits the same knee-jerk, politically motivated rush to judgment clearly evidenced by the Mr. Peterson who stars in Mr. Grisham's reality show. It is telling that when confronted with the fact that he directed the treatment of the lacrosse team with the assumption of guilt rather than innocence, the Duke University President could only stammer that he had placed his trust in the prosecutor; this is a dangerous attitude from Joe Six-pack much less a University President who show know better.Grisham's cautionary tale is excellently descriptive and a quick, compelling read. He captures the impotent frustration of a defendant being run through a corrupt process. He demonstrates the personal cost of a destroyed individual, a destroyed family, and a bankrupted county. Grisham does nothing less than argue convincingly that in our country the criminal defendant is presumed guilty unless proven innocent. As a society we have fought wars to preserve the precious gift of a Constitution the protections of which are all too often neglected and ignored. We no longer have the fortitude to look at the evidence and are all to ready to abdicate our responsibility to the police and prosecutors who are too often under-budgeted and unwilling to do their jobs."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Although I am a Grisham fan, I was really disappointed in this novel.

But perhaps one of the most powerful arguments against the use of capital punishment is that, every once in a while, the justice system goes seriously off the rails and makes a tragic mistake.As a young man, Robert Williamson was an exceptionally skilled baseball player. Thinking himself destined for the major leagues, he began to lead a self-indulgent debauched life style that ultimately would lead to nowhere but trouble, self-destruction and severe mental illness. Robert Williamson and his alleged co-conspirator were definitely not nice people. But neither were they rapists.\\"The Innocent Man\\" is the story of the blind, single-minded quest of the Oklahoma judicial system to arrest, imprison and execute a man for the 1982 rape and murder of a cocktail waitress. It was a very near call but, ultimately, Robert Williamson was proven to be innocent and released before his rapidly nearing date with the executioner.Even those who believe in either the deterrent or the punishment argument on the pro-side of the capital punishment debate will be un-nerved by this near miss of a system gone so badly wrong.Unfortunately, the writing in \\"The Innocent Man\\" is not as compelling as it might have been give the nature of the subject matter. But it is still quite gripping and certainly important enough that every thinking citizen should read it and make themselves aware that this kind of miscarriage of justice can and does happen.Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I'm not about to go into detail about what the book is about, as other reviewers have already done so. Some other reviewers have stated that this book was boring or it was hard to follow. It was not boring in the least. It kept me captivated as I was hearing first hand accounts of four convicted \\"murderers\\" (two from each murder) who were found guilty upon a weak prosecution. Yes, the story does have a tendency to jump around in certain spots, as Grisham not only explains about the primary murder, but another murder that struck the small town of Ada, Oklahoma as well. This book also made me realize how unreliable the courts are, and if they are reliable enough to institute the death penalty. I believe that there may be more innocent people put to death than most would think. There are more people put to death each year (especially in Oklahoma) than we know since most aren't highly publicized. To wonder about how many of those accused are innocent is nothing short of scary. I would recommend this book to any die-hard true crime fan. I have read my share of books from this genre, as well as all of the other Grisham novels, and this is one of his best!!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I've been very critical of the fiction work of John Grisham in recent years and have said many times that he needed to take more time to write his novels to make the stories more interesting. Well, he has taken time off of writing novels to write this interesting, if not spectacular non-fiction work of the trials and tribulations of Ronald Williamson, a former minor league baseball player implicated in a murder and sentenced to death row. I won't go into the details of Williamson's ordeal, but I will say that Grisham has written a pretty cut-and-dried book, that probably would have been handled better by career crime writers, but is still interesting nonetheless. He does a good job giving the details of Ron's case and what he and his family had to go through as events unfolded and Ron suffered from growing mental issues. Grisham didn't even think about writing Ron's story until after Ron passed away, so there are no interviews to draw upon, but he does a decent job of tying it all together. I will also say that although he is anti-death penalty, he doesn't hammer that opinion at you. He lets the story itself do the talking.I'm actually interested in how this book will impact the quality of Grisham's next novel, as he'll have actually gone almost 3 years between novels by that time. Hopefully the break will result in a more classic work like \\"The Firm\\" or \\"A Time to Kill\\", not dreck like \\"The King of Torts\\"."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book should make even the staunchest proponent of the death penalty take pause. Although situations like this are probably rare due to the appeal process, DNA technology, and organizations such as Project Innocence, founded by Barry Scheck, this book paints a vivid picture of how the falsely accused can slip through the cracks, especially when law enforcement and prosecutors focus less on justice than on politics and personal ambition. This is a great book, and should be accompanied by reading 'The Dreams of Ada'.

That's not to say it isn't a good book. But, given the author's reputation and the amount of publicity the book received upon publication, it's easy to be disappointed. The true story of two men, Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz, wrongly accused of a murder in a small Oklahoma town is nightmarish. It's disturbing to realize that such injustice can occur.Because it's clear from the beginning that the accused are innocent, there is little or no suspense in the book. The core of the book is about how one injustice after another was heaped upon the accused. Misguided prosecution, shoddy police work, junk science and incompetent defense attorneys all play a role.The story is told is a straightforward, simple matter.

Now when I hear stories of someone who confessed to a crime for which there was no other credible evidence will cause a red flag to go up for me.The book was fascinating and well written and anything but boring.

While I've read other reviews discussing the depressing and dark portrait that Grisham has painted, I found this book enlightening and intense. There are slow periods where there is a lot repeated, but it's meant to hammar home the ideas presented.

He is suffering from mental illness and alcoholism and is targeted by local law enforcement for a murder he did not commit. His friend, who is a high school science teacher, was merely guilty by association. It is reprehensible that so many people in the criminal justice system dishonored the constitution.

Are they the ones inside the jails, or are they sitting next to us on the bus, subway, perhaps driving in the car in the lane beside you? Or, are they the people who we pay to maintain justice in our nation?Reading these well written chapters, you wonder out loud: how often does this happen? Is the Ron Williamson story a unique case? You'd like to believe that. But Grisham seems to hint that thinking that way is wishful at best. In this day and age of technology, our moral fiber is seriously wanting, and the author deserves credit for exposing it to the masses."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"The previews for this latest book were mixed; however, after I read it myself - in less than a day, I knew that this was another Grisham winner. Truth is indeed stronger and stranger than fiction. The storyline is presented factually with a minimum of comment from Grisham; and when he does offer a comment, he echoes what the reader is thinking as the facts unfold. This story is a tragedy for these two innocent men and for Debbi Carter, the victim. The fact that the town could not accept their innocence in the face of DNA testing is mind-boggling! Where is the justice in taking away years of an innocent person's life and not apologizing at the least? Seeing Rom Williamson spin down into madness is heartbreaking when there were obviously people in the prison system i.e a psychiatrist for one, who was willing to treat him. It's bad enough how people in Iraq are treated in prison, but this is the USA!!!! Surprisingly, or maybe not so in this age, no heads seemed to have rolled for this fiasco masquerading as justice."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"The story is simple and straight forward. Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz were falsely convicted of a murder in a small town in Oklahoma. The police and the DA in the town were committed to find Ron and Dennis guilty and believed they were. To assure conviction they overlooked evidence and even tampered with some evidence.Ron was convicted and went to death row. Dennis was sentenced to life in prison. The convictions were eventually overturned. Ron was mentally ill but when he was on his medications he was evidently a pleasant person.After reading this book and some of the articles surrounding it I am left with several questions about the book. I wonder why John Grisham a skilled novelist who can create wonderful characters decide to strip all the life from the people in the book. He decided to lay out the story in an organized manner with no emotions other than the evils of the death penalty and the corruption in the legal system. He did not even attempt to give insights into so many of the interesting characters such as the DA. He never really explains Ron. One of the most interesting characters was Judge Seay but we do not learn anything about him until the acknowledgement section at the end of the book. In fact that section is probably most insightful and after reading it I thought of the lost opportunity that was available in a story like this with an author like Grisham.I could not help compare this to In Cold Blood. Capote tried to make the reader understand the characters. Here there is no such effort. I finished the book wondering why the story was interesting and why Grisham decided not to draw characters out."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"The point of this story appears to be that it is all too easy for innocent persons to be sentenced to death, based upon bad evidence and worse police procedure and misconduct. No doubt this is true, although in this case it didn't help that several of the \\"innocent men\\" actually confessed to the crimes, albeit wrongly. This seems to be an example of the old legal axiom: \\"hard cases make bad law.\\"Grisham tells a compelling story. He also tells it in a much more longwinded than necessary fashion, which caused me to downgrade the rating from 4 stars to 3. There are endless pages detailing the alcohol-dependency and personality disorders and erratic behavior of the protagonist. OK, Mr. Grisham, we get the point--it is not necessary to make it several hundred times. The fact that Grisham does this makes this story very tedious to work through. This book would have benefited from a much stricter editing process. The story could have been told in a much more succinct manner which would have, in my opinion, been much more forceful.This is a worthwhile read, and at times an entertaining one. Better editing would probably have made it a compelling one, but as it stands it is unnecessarily tedious. A good reading experience nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"\\"The Innocent Man\\" is a chronicle of Ron Williamson (former minor league baseball star), his life and ordeal as he was wrongly accused of murder and sentenced to death row as a result. He was forced to suffer this horror for 11 years until finally the system began to work for him, but only through the diligence and persistence of attorneys assigned to him years later, Mark Barrett and Barry Scheck, his loving mother and persistent sisters, in particular, his sister Annette. The cruelties and disrespect by the officers and District Attorney Bill Peterson that were inflected on him were horrifying. The shabby police work and \\"junk science,\\" as well as the district attorney's expert witnesses (a majority of them picked from men and women serving time for horrendous crimes themselves) and brought to the stand to testify against Ron, was not only incomprehensible in itself but the fact that the Judge allowed their testimony to stand and control a man's life sentence is abominable. Ron's hometown of Ada, Oklahoma completely turned on him and he was proven guilty without a shred of hard evidence as was his friend, a respected 7th grade Science teacher, Dennis Fritz, merely by association. The book goes on to tell Ron's sad story as only it can be told by such an esteemed author/attorney as John Grisham. I would highly recommend everyone read this true story; it is a real eye opener as to how our justice system can go astray with the wrong people serving in our trusted government positions."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I've read everything Grisham has written. Most of them--his legal thrillers--I have loved. I didn't like his true or semi-autobiographical books so I didn't expect to like this one too much.Now I have to say that it is one of his two or three best ever, right up there with The Firm. It reads like fiction of the best kind. It is a true thriller: suspense, whodunit, how-will-our-hero-fare?, etc.Here's a hint, however, to heighten your enjoyment of this book. Since it is a true story it has that center photo section, so if you look at all the photos before you finish reading the book the ending will be spoiled for you. As I said, this is written like the finest mysteries out there, and you want to be surprised like I was (fortunately I didn't look at all the photos until after I finishing the book).It has been close to a year since I read The Innocent Man, but it has stuck with me as much as any book I have come across in years."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I picked this book up at the library and didn't realize it was non-fiction until I started reading it. I have read all of Grisham's novels, and while this book wasn't as smooth a read, I was impressed by the level of detail and the enormous amount of research that went into writing it.What remains with me after reading this book is how close Williamson came to being executed - only five days. How many other innocent men haven't been as fortunate? I also wondered about how the juries were able to decided guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence was underwhelming at best.Injustice can happen to anyone, it seems. Scary."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"John Grisham books are about the only fiction books I still read. I love reading stories that I know are about real people and real events. So when this book came out I couldn't wait to read it. I was not disappointed at all! I'm unsure about how I feel about the death penalty and I guess this is partly why. Ron Williamson was charged for the murder of a girl in his town , then years found innocent by DNA testing. At first I wasn't sure about the book, but then you learn about all the evidence left out of the trial, all the witnesses who lied, the details that were twisted, mainly because Ron couldn't afford a good lawyer. I found it interesting to learn everything he did to just keep on living, like playing the guitar, making a new friend on \\"the row\\". Ron eventually grew more and more crazy but never gave up that HE WAS INNOCENT! This was a sad book because an innocent man was almost sent to the death chamber and that this happens to many others. It makes you realize that not everyone in jail is bad. Sometimes they get there by just unfortunate happenings, and that the justice system is not always fair."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"When reading this book early on I didn't know this was a non-fiction. I took for granted that if Grisham wrote it, it was fiction. I was disappointed that Grisham wanted us to think that a Police Department was so inept, then I got to the middle of the book where the pictures are located and I was flabergasted that the Ada, Oklahoma Police Department was incompentent to the degree that Grisham provided. Once I understood this was a non fiction book, the intrigue grew immensly. Again, it's not as good as Grisham's initial works, but a good read nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"In 1982, Debbie Sue Carter was raped and murdered. In 1988, desperate for a conviction, prosecutors and the judicial system placed a death sentence on two men who had nothing to do with the crime. It took eleven years to clear their names and prove their innocence.One of the exonerated was Ron Williamson, a former professional baseball prospect who suffered intensely from mental illness. The treatment of his illness inside the prisons was nonexistent, leading to a brutal type of treatment by ignorance of his condition.This story is first rate, it tingles down your spine when you think of the hell these innocent men went through. Whether you're pro death penalty or against death penalty, this tale will make you shudder.Unfortunately, Grisham needs to stick to fiction. While his fictional tales are full and rich, his true-crime account of Ron Williamson is dry and repetitious. Heaven might be in the details; the details are so minute at times that it was often hell to plow through them.Five stars for the story, three for the telling, equals a four star review.

It's actually a nonfiction book which (from my understanding) is unlike his other novels."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"The phrase \\"Grisham book\\" and word \\"important\\" aren't often found in the same sentence, but John Grisham's 2006 non-fiction book, \\"The Innocent Man\\", allows me to state that Grisham has now written the most important book of his mega-successful career, and one of the most important I've read by any author.The book recounts two murders in the small town of Ada, Oklahoma. Both victims are young women. In both cases, the local and state police investigating the case are stumped. But with a toxic blend of extremely circumstantial \\"evidence\\", shocking crime scene photos, junk science, inexpert experts, jailhouse snitches and critical \\"dream confessions\\" induced by near-torture tactics, the police pin the murders on four young men of the area, two per murder.The \\"innocent man\\" of the title is 30-something ne'er-do-well Ron Williamson, a schoolboy baseball star whose dreams of playing in Yankee Stadium dissolve in the low minors in a mix of arm injuries, booze and the onset of mental illness. By the time of the murder that consumes most of Grisham's tale, Williamson has washed up back home in Ada, and deservedly earned a reputation as a loudmouth loose cannon of sorts. Still his worst crime is passing a $300 phony check.Skipping forward quickly, Williamson becomes the focus of the police's investigation and ultimately finds himself on death row in an Oklahoma criminal justice system whose aim seems to be to continuously reduce the amount of respect shown to death row inmates until it reaches zero. Shrewd detectives that they are, the police \\"know\\" that there's a second killer because of a misspelled warning message written in catsup at the scene, \\"dont chase us or ealse.\\" Enter suspect two, single father Dennis Fritz, whose main crime is to be a friend of Williamson.I'll stop here regarding the \\"plot\\", even though this is a news story and you could look it up. While novelistic in format, \\"The Innocent Man\\" reads more like a newspaper report, or like a lawyer dispassionately recounting the facts of a case. (Well after awhile not so dispassionately, as the injustices against the accused and then convicted men pile up.) The issues raised by the case and brought to light by Grisham cover the gamut of criminal justice - abuse of police power, single-minded focus on particular suspects and deliberate ignorance of others, near-torture-induced confessions, prosecutorial arrogance, lack of resources provided to defendants, mishandling of evidence, coercion of expert witnesses, use of junk science to dazzle a jury, the general and mistaken belief by the community that the police only arrest guilty parties, and most compellingly in Williamson's case, the inability of the criminal justice system to recognize and deal humanely with mentally ill prisoners.My wife read the almost 450-page paperback version in one day. She then bugged me to read it for several days until I interrupted my second attempt at Barbara Kingsolver'sProdigal Summer: A Noveland dove in. Even while sick, I finished it in a day-and-a-half. After his disappointing novella \\"Bleachers\\", I'd pretty much written off Grisham (never have considered him much better an airplane read in the first place), but I'm deeply grateful to him to recognizing the power of this story and bringing to the attention of so many people with this fine book. I also salute him for sticking to the non-fiction format, resisting the novelist's urge to fictionalize the story and embellish it with tie-ins to the Oklahoma City bombing, 9/11 and the like. \\"The Innocent Man\\" may not stand up as literature to recently-deceased Norman Mailer'sThe Executioner's Song, but it's still a great book--the best true-crime story I've read with the most important messages about America's criminal justice system and its generally unrecognized threat to innocent men and women everywhere (and especially in Ada, OK where the DA that prosecuted the cases is still in office)."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Ambivalence really sums up my feelings toward Mr. Grisham's latest book. Depressing is another. I applaud Mr. Grisham in his attempt to analyze the hows and whys of just what happened to Ron Williamson during his hectic, confusing, and sometimes just unlucky life. From outstanding major league baseball prospect, to drug and alcohol abuser, to mentally unstable convict, to exonerated felon, Ron Williamson never really knew any peace off the baseball diamond. His dream of a major league career shattered he simply withdrew into his own private hell of dope, booze, loose women, honky tonks, and insanity.Sometimes a difficult book to follow, the darkness that Mr. Grisham maintains throughout the book is at times oppressive. How many times must Ron Williamson have to exhibit mental instability before someone, anyone, gets him real help and not just temporary \\"band-aid\\" his CHRONIC mental problems. It is a wonder that he didn't harm someone during his drunken, drug induced haze. Finally convicted of a murder he never committed, the complex judicial process to free him was very well told by Mr. Grisham. Ron's years spent on \\"death row\\" were both illuminating, sad, and frightening all at the same time. His eventual release and exoneration was the ONLY happy point in an otherwise sad biography of a profoundly unhappy life.Again, I was ambivalent about this book. I can not say I enjoyed it but I did learn from it. This is not your typical light Grisham reading so be very careful. Be ready for a heavy, dark, oppressive book that while educating about the legal system, at the same time leaves one empty about the sad state of this nation's mental health programs. This up close and personal view of America's seamy underbelly will stay with you for quite awhile."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"The fact that this is a true story is both the book's greatest asset and it's biggest liability as well. To think that such irresponsible legal shenanigans could occur in America is truly a sobering thought. The manner in which the Williamson case and others described in the book were handled by the parties involved is disgusting. That aspect of the story makes the book an intriguing read.On the flip side, the true nature of the story also holds Grisham back. In sticking with the facts, his creativity was limited. Among Grisham's greatest strengths as a writer are character development and intricate setting of the locale. In both of these instances, the facts limit what Grisham can do. Simply put, at times I felt I was reading the daily news, not a book.Grisham should be applauded for writing a book that helped bring this injustice to a larger audience. The book may not entertain, certainly not to the degree of his best work, but what he did here was more important than anything else he could have written. Somewhere, at some point in the future, this book will prevent another innocent individual from being unfairly railroaded. If nothing else, Grisham should be proud of that fact, and we all should be grateful to him."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Justice sometimes get to be a commodity, rationed not by need but by wealth. This dirty secret is something all lawyers, including myself, know.The justice system itself is designed to protect the truly innocent even at the cost of protecting the guilty. Thus a lot of safeguards are built into the system because experience has shown that once an injustice is done, it is very difficult to undo it.Criminal lawyers, and although I am a trial lawyer I practice solely in the civil courts, will tell you that their greatest nightmare is to represent the truly innocent client. This is because although the law presumes the client is innocent, trial counsel, jaded by thousands of lies from clients, does not. If your lawyer does not truly believe in you, and you are truly innocent, can you get a fair trial?The answer to this question is explored in what may be the best true-crime work since In Cold Blood. Ron Williamson, former minor league prospect, now burdened with incurable mental illness is targeted by the police and prosecutors in Ada, Oklahoma as the killer of Debbie Carter. Another man Dennis Fritz, whose real crime was to be a friend to Ron, is also targeted.When the police fail to turn up a killer in nearly five years of investigation and an author puts the spotlight on the local police for a highly questionable conviction in another murder case, the cops and prosecutors press forward against Fritz and Williamson, using perjured evidence, discredited forensics, high emotion, and active concealment of exculpatory evidence. The trial judge tolerated the abuse of the defendants constitutional rights to the point of scheduling a Brady motion ( a hearing to punish the state for not turning over exculpatory evidence) after the trial, when it could do no good. The appellate courts, perhaps overwhelmed with appeals from the truly guilty, showed little evidence of ever having read the record.So it came down to the federal courts for the system to correct itself. A federal magistrate judge carefully considered the briefs, and the trial record and was persuaded that Williamson had been denied a fair trial. The district judge, exercising the same degree of care as his magistrate and law clerks concurred, ordering the state to retry Williamson, who at one point was five days away from a date with death.It was that order for a new trial that set into motion the events that would lead to the total exoneration of Williamson and Fritz.When the DNA results were provided, they not only showed that Williamson and Fritz were not involved and also that the chief prosecution witness against them was in fact the real killer."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"To be honest, I had grown tired of John Grishom's books. They seemed to all have the same plot after a while. But this book...WOW. I was very impressed. What a scary thing to think that this goes on in our judicial systems, however, I have seen first hand that it does happen, everyday in our court systems. While some may feel that they were weighed down in too many facts, most true crime stories do this, but I didn't find it to be boring in the least. It was a great book, one of his best."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"John Grisham fans may regard this book with suspicion. It is not his usual gripping fiction. I will admit that I have read very few of his books because I am more interested in nonfiction; although I did read A Painted House and I loved it. However, this book is captivating. I was fascinated and couldn't put it down. Some true crime books predictably describe the crime and then in agonizing detail relay what happened during the trial, including transcripts of opening and closing arguments (which I usually skip through.) Grisham only includes information that is meaningful and allows the story to flow. I found it almost painful to follow every development of the evidence because I knew the significance and I was so sympathetic to the main character. I also enjoyed his occasional sarcastic comments here and there, which provided some amusement and levity.I think that if one enjoys the true crime genre, and respects John Grisham's writing talent, this book is absolutely worth the read. I recommend it whole-heartedly. I was disappointed when I watched his interview on the Today show and he said he would likely never write non-fiction again."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I always enjoy an author who takes a chance and tries something new. It can prove he isn't a fluke or just lucky but genuinely gifted. Grisham's first foray into non-fiction is a powerful, thoughtful, important and ultimately (nessesarily) depressing and proves once and for all he is a master writer in more than one genre.Ron Williamson's story is cautionary tale for a flawed judicial system that can, and unfortunately often makes horrible mistakes. The story of an innocent man found guilty and sent to jail for the crimes of someone else is sad, especially knowing even after years pent in prison that those years can never be returned. Some ultimately found innocent after first being convicted never live down the crime because there will always be those who will still believe he was really guilty, and the discrimination almost never ends. In the case of Williamson the injustice can never be undone, and that is just too horrific to dwell upon.I'm sure Grisham didn't write this story to establish a basis for ending capital punishment, but maybe, just maybe that can be a single good result of his effort. As a civilized country we should be able to see beyond the rhetoric of those who think the death penalty does any good in any situation. But this book will probably bring back the debate and that can only be a good thing.The writing is strong well paced, and the research that went into telling the story in an honest way produced an excellent result. Though I hope Grisham will continue with his fiction career, I wouldn't be at all disappointed if in the future he wanders again to non-fiction. He has the honest, legitimate chops for both genres."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"\\"If you believe that in America you are innocent until proven guilty, this book will shock you. If you believe in the death penalty, this book will disturb you. If you believe the criminal justice system is fair, this book will infuriate you.\\"Whenever I think of John Grisham, I think of all the joy that he has brought to me through his writing, and I am always happy to see his new arrivals.An Innocent Man is a work of non-fiction taking place in the state of Oklahoma, in the small town of Ada, in the eighties.When Debra Sue Carter, a cocktail waitress is raped and murdered one night after leaving a bar, the police pounce immediately on Dennis Fritz, and Ron Williamson; two young men of Ada. With no evidence or witnesses, it seems as though the Law wanted to have someone to bring before the courts to prove they were doing their job. These two unfortunate men kept claiming their innocence over and over again, but all to no avail. Their appeals fell on death ears. Eventually, Mr. Fritz was given a life sentence and Mr. Williamson sent to death row.How did the judicial system work that out? Why did they not spend some more time trying to get at the truth of what really happened that night? They spend their hopeless lives behind bars until one day; someone gets the guts to tear this charade to pieces, bit by bit, revealing the plain truth of that night.What makes you mad about this case is to see the amount of precious time these guys wasted in jail. It took a toll on their mental and physical health, and someone should have to pay for incriminating these poor guys.Reviewed by Heather Marshall Negahdar (SUGAR-CANE 23/11/06)"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This story had a tremendous impact on me. I support the death penalty but was abhorred to see how flippantly it was applied in Ada Oklahoma. Read this book first and then log onto District Attorney Peterson's web site to read his defense of his actions that were the subject of the book. The first thing he displays on his website is the American flag. Then he has a lengthy and tedious defense of all the minor points in Grisham's novel. He provides statistics on the probability of innocent people being convicted of felonies as if this excuses him for almost sending an innocent person to his death. Peterson tries to blow off Grisham as an anti-death penalty advocate. I truly fear for the soul of Mr. Peterson and the good people of Ada Oklahoma - a bit of remorse and repentance for what they almost did to an innocent man would help them when they meet their Maker. Hiding behind the American flag might help now but certainly not later!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book chronicles the life of one Ron Williamson, born in Ada, OK, 1953, as he spiraled down from being the teen-age town hope as the next Mickey Mantle to being the town drunkard in his twenties, living only on the generosity of friends and family, and, worst of all, to death row in the OK prison system after egregious actions of the local prosecutor resulted in Ron's unjustified conviction for the murder and assault of a young female.The book is strongest in its depiction of what it is like for a person with limited resources to become ensnared in the legal system, where without good legal counsel the checks are few on police misconduct, even coercion, manufactured witnesses, misuse of so-called experts, and prosecutors willing to sacrifice the innocent to community demands for revenge. In addition, the book is commentary on the willingness of prison systems to permit the physical and, even more so, the mental deterioration of inmates, denying treatment for blatantly obvious conditions. In contrast to local malfeasance, the various legal persons at the appeals levels were consummate professionals and were ultimately responsible for recognizing prosecutorial excess in the very trying of Ron Williamson and his friend Dennis Fritz. Whether their recognition of prosecutorial misconduct would have resulted in acquittal in another trial became irrelevant in the face of exonerating DNA evidence.The book does get a bit tedious in following the carousing of Ron and his buddies and the many attempts of him and others, most especially his older sister Annette, to obtain help for his fragile mental state. Even upon release from prison after being exonerated, there is a lot of transitioning among a variety of residences and nursing facilities. The author's entire coverage of the subject of mental illness and competency as it relates to the legal process is vaguely presented at best. Furthermore, as Ron's story unfolds, the reader is constantly given the impression that Ron is practically insane and must be pumped full of psychotic drugs, yet the treatments are constantly abandoned and he functions reasonably well until the next intervention. His approach seems unnecessarily alarmist.Though not emphasized by the author, this book is a huge reminder of the ramifications of poor child rearing and exaggerated expectations of a professional career in sports. Ron as the youngest in his family learned to be a manipulator, forcing the family to spend money on him that was not there. He was so certain that he would make it to the big leagues in baseball that he had no backup plan, nor did he receive much in the way of realistic consultation in that area. He was not well-served by his parents or by those who exploited his baseball skills with tremendous consequences to his maturation.While the author acknowledges that Ron became a loud drunk and often intimidating when his abbreviated baseball career ended at age twenty-four, he has little to say concerning Ron's very real potential for violence. During Ron's hearings and trials numerous women came forward with stories of being frightened by Ron, which were not refuted. And of course, he was acquitted of two rapes in Tulsa in his early twenties. Ron is not a particularly sympathetic character. Though obviously wrongly accused and convicted of this murder, it is not a stretch to wonder what potential for violence existed within.It really is alarming to think that an innocent man can get to death row. But in this case, the local law enforcement personnel and the prosecutor actually did not care. They knew they had no case, yet manipulated the system to put an innocent man on death row. Is justice in this country really that fragile? This was a factual case. Their non-involvement was clear. But the facts meant nothing. That is the author's main story.As a further note, the local prosecutor vehemently objects to the author's book and has on a web site a lengthy rebuttal. Yes, maybe the author obscured or ignored some facts or got others out of order. Yet the rebuttal does not explain away the fundamental actions that were taken to put an innocent man on death row. One would think that the citizens of Ada would fear facing this prosecutor, but he has been elected time after time. That's disturbing."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I found it unbelievable that such a travesty of justice could be carried out, with even basic steps of investigation being ignored"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Excellent reading.

This isn't one of Grisham's better novels. The pace is way too slow.6-27-12: I just realized this is non-fiction. I just thought it was bad fiction storytelling, which seemed odd for Grisham. Now I actually feel offended that he took a horrendous real life situation and told it in such a way that I don't particularly care about the people or the events. This is poorly written and, in my opinion, is an injustice to the people who lived these events.6-28-12: Okay, to be fair, now that I know this is non-fiction the writing style makes more sense, though I still think it's poorly written. I feel empathy and interest in the characters and events now, but I'm not sure that is enough to make me want to continue to plod on, I'm trying though.6-29-12: I'm changing my rating from 1 star to 4 stars. Not so much for the writing but for the subject matter. The last 1/4 of the book flows better and the writing is much more compelling. I could feel the connection and humanity in the last 1/4 that seemed to be missing until then. Maybe Grisham intended that to correspond to the events, but that just made it difficult to engage with the story. I just feel that if the first 3/4 had been edited and revised in some way the whole book could have been more compelling. (In the author's note Grisham says he could have written 5,000 pages, and my thought was, \\"Thank God he didn't!\\") I do think that my not realizing it was non-fiction until 1/2 way through may have contributed to my not engaging with the story or the writing until later, so it's possible my early criticism is unwarranted. I think the subject matter is so important, I learned a lot, and was deeply touched by the story and the people who lived it. I'm glad to have learned what I learned from this book and will recommend that my son read it someday. The subject is important for any citizen who cares about fairness and justice, and the fallibilty of people at all levels of society."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is a real page turner, somewhere in the middle my thought was \\"oh dear, how will this continue\\" but it kept me gripped right to the end"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"What can I say?

It was obvious to me that the people involved in this travesty had never read my textbook. I could not believe how the initial homicide investigation was conducted, the malfeasance of the detectives, as well as the lack of any physical evidence to link the suspect to the crime. I was completely exasperated by the arrogance of the prosecutor, Bill Peterson, who like Dennis Nifong in North Carolina totally ignored any exculpatory evidence against the defendant. Instead, he relied on the testimony of jailhouse snitches and a convoluted \\"dream confession\\" by a certified mentally disturbed person.The conviction of this innocent man was the result of a complete breakdown of our criminal justice system. The combination of the defendant's mental condition, coupled with inept and deceitful police investigation, junk science, the \\"dream confession,\\" and dishonest prosecution created a \\"Perfect Storm\\" of injustice. Even when confronted with the DNA testing, which exonerated Ronald Williamson, the district attorney insisted that it did not prove his innocence.The author, John Grisham was right. As a professional law enforcement expert, I was disturbed that this innocent man was almost executed for a murder he did not commit and I was infuriated with the participants in this outrageous case, who allowed this injustice to occur. I would highly recommend this book to anyone involved in criminal justice system as a vivid reminder that one is innocent until proven guilty."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book is an absolute MUST READ!!! I have read every book John Grisham has written and that is why I bought this one, but for those that are not fans of the Author you still must read this book. It is absolutely astounding that this happened and what is even more unnerving is that this wasn't the first time this type of thing has happened and regretably won't be the last time either."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I almost passed over this book because of the reviews I read here. This is not a typical John G book, in that it is a true crime story in the same class as Vincent Bugliosi's books (Helter Skelter and \\"And the Sea Will Tell\\"). His in-depth research and explanation of the finer points this gross injustice using his legal backround and ability to explain in layman's terms, make this a very informative book. The story reads more like an investigative piece than a dramatic story, which I prefer.I liked this book better than John G's other books in that I am a fan of true crime stories. His reiterating of the main Character's mental problems is necessary to drive the point of this incredible miscarriage of justice.If your looking for a typical John G novel, wait for his next book.But if your a fan of true crime, get this book, it's his best."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This was an incredible book. I couldn't put it down except to sleep, reluctantly. I wonder how those who committed such miscarriages of justice can live with themselves. I was touched greatly by the devotion of his sisters. It is quite frightening how this sort of thing can happen."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Embarrassingly ambivalent but still disheartened, might sum up my reaction to this book if the questions raised weren't so important. It is well written as one expects from Grisham. However, not being of the activist's mindset, I found the doubtless factual, but transparent, commentary throughout the book distracting in the extreme. In other spots, the book reads almost like an appellate brief. Two things might help the Grisham aficionado: buy the audio version instead of wading through the print edition; and, read the author's notes thoroughly at the outset, to help get your head in the game.If you're trying to ramp up your activist hormones for an upcoming anti-death-penalty rally, or and anti-police-corruption movement, then this might be your tome and Grisham addresses both issues factually and without undue hyperbole - but, as was said, not without scrivener's commentary. But a thriller, this is not. The issues are very serious, the characters (particularly the main character) maddeningly frustrating at times, and the pace glacial as is often the case in real-life legal matters... This book will probably not leave you sitting on the edge of your seat, but it may leave your mind working well into the night. This is a serious book, for sincere readers, and probably not the first choice for the casual thriller consumer looking for a vacation page-turner. Exceptional effort nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is bleak and depressing, but it accurately depicts the horror the central characters went through. The profound corruption of nearly all the legal professionals involved, the frightening drug abuse in and out of prison, the failure of the mental health system. Although these crimes occured 25 years ago, the abuses described are likely still integral to a trip through the US justice system.Mistrust of the police and a \\"bunker mentality\\" seem appropriate for these characters and by extension, the population at large. With the drug war seeming to be heading into high gear, Big Pharma seemingly operating with zero controls and corporate power reaching unseen heights, trust in America can only be headed in one direction- down."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I was shocked, disturbed and infuriated just like the last paragraph of the dust jacket said i would be.I thank John Grisham for writing this novel, i've been a fan of his since high school (the firm) and the well researched, worded and informative book baffled me. When i think of innocent people being murdered by the government i think of the 1800's and even up to the 1950's. This book is a MUST READ especially for my generation (Gen x).To put this into prospective the story started when i was in kindergarten and by the time these men got out of prison i had been married for 3 years.

Instead, we are simply being relayed the facts based on accounts from 15 to 25 years earlier.I was somewhat apprehensive about reading a non-fiction book from the master of legal thrillers, but I was thoroughly impressed with this effort.Grisham succeeds in painting a rather horrific account of Ron Williamson's tragic life, and in turn, creates a rather strong case against the death penalty."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"John Grisham who has had some great fictional works, takes on a real-life story and does a superb job of research and translation to produce an interesting picture of the criminal justice system at its best and at its worst.The author begins early in the book to thoroughly reveal the life of Ron Williamson who is the central character. He is a star high school baseball player who has a brief stay in professional baseball but in later life is overwhelmed with mental and drug/alcohol problems. This is not a fictional character or fictional story. Williamson is not only falsely accused of a gruesome murder but is convicted and sent to \\"death row\\" in McAlester, OK. The justice system in Oklahoma leaves a lot to be desired particularly in the town of Ada. The author hones in primarily on the legal systems' treatment of Williamson but also touches on the plight of other innocent victims including Dennis Fritz, a friend of Williamson and defendant in the same murder case.The unfair treatment of indigent defendants is highlighted. The Innocence-Project is discussed and becomes involved in the Williamson and Fritz cases. This organization takes cases where DNA testing can be a factor in a post conviction appeal. One of the project's co-founders was Barry Scheck made famous by the O.J Simpson trial.The author clearly does not believe that Ada or Oklahoma has a monopoly on the dispensing of injustice. It can happen anywhereThe impact of a wrongful conviction can be enormous not only on the \\"felon\\" but also on the family. Williamson's mental problems were no doubt magnified by his confinement on death row. His two sisters were concerned and attempted to help him. However, he needed help beyond their reach.Just as in one of his previous books \\"The Chamber,\\" the author gives a desolate and dismal picture of \\"death row.\\" I again have the impression that he does not favor the death penalty."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I had a hard time making it through the first 100 pages of this book. I actually didn't know it was nonfiction (received as a gift and just starting reading -- I didn't read the blurbs). I really didn't like John Grisham's writing style -- it came across as a list of facts.But once I started feeling for the main character, Ron, I had a hard time putting the book down. I began fighting for him inside, and got pretty wrapped up in the story.*Spoiler*In the end, it was a pretty sad story. Even though he was free, the damage had been done. He finished his life as best he could. And of course, he never received true justice (even though he got $$$)."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"While I've found them here and there, it is a rare book that can truly get me to reconsider my beliefs. The Innocent Man by John Grisham was one of those books. I do believe in the death penalty. That has not wavered in the aftermath of reading this book, but what has wavered is the idea that our judicial system is fair and just and carried out by professionals who are committed to finding the truth.Did I really believe this? Yes.What I learned from The Innocent Man was that I am nave and that there are people in the world: policemen, prosecutors, \\"expert\\" witnesses, etc who would rather slant their findings to what they personally believe, than spend their time searching for the truth with evidence to back it up. This is what The Innocent Man is about.Ron Williamson grew up in small town Ada, Okalahoma. He dreamed of playing professional baseball, but even with talent, he only made it as far as the minors. He declined mentally, falling to alcohol and drugs and other bad behaviors. He toed the line of legal with some of his activities. The truth is that Ron Williamson was not a likeable guy or a \\"good guy\\", but he also was not a murderer. After the murder of a young woman in this small town occurred, the police department decided that Ron committed the murder and since they also decided it was likely done by two people, his only friend, Dennis Fritz, must have been in on it - guilt by association, not evidence, was all that was required.The Innocent Man is a work of non-fiction. It is a factual account of the years between the murder of Debbie Carter and the point when Ron and Dennis are finally exonerated. There are some that will consider it dry and truthfully, there were parts of the book that were longer than I might have liked. But, Grisham was portraying a picture. In true Grisham style, he was giving us a picture of the lives of many people, not just Ron and Dennis. He showed us how the Ada law enforcement and prosecutors affected everyone in the town; from the grieving family of the dead woman to the grieving families of Ron and Dennis who had to struggle emotionally and financially to help their loved ones. The book discussed other innocents in the same city, county, or state who underwent the same unscrupulous treatment and were falsely sent to prison - some still in prison to this day. While these police officers and prosecution staff may have thought they were doing what was right, they were committing the most heinous miscarriage of justice. Ron Williamson was days away from execution when one judge finally took a look at the facts and realized that more investigation was needed. Underlying the whole story was the fact that Ron Williamson was also mentally ill. His mental illness was ignored repeatedly from the time he was arrested, and then tried, and throughout his years on death row.This doesn't read like a John Grisham novel. There is little actual dialogue, but instead it is a narrative that spans the years and the lives of the people to whom this shocking injustice had lifelong consequences. Some people will like it, some will hate it, but everyone who reads this book should be sickened that our legal system, which we take for granted as being a good one, can so terribly go wrong. This could happen to anyone and it is terrifying that the controls put in place to keep an innocent person from getting convicted can be so blatantly ignored.The high point of this book is the portrayal of what a true loving family is. Ron's sisters Annette and Renee supported Ron throughout his life and this ordeal. They sacrificed for him and did everything they could to help him and improve his quality of life.I listened to this book on audio, read by Craig Wasson and the narration was very good. Mr. Wasson maintained a very even tone throughout the book and read it as it was written, which is as a narrative of facts, rather than a novel.I highly recommend The Innocent Man to anyone, but go at it with the knowledge that you're not reading a John Grisham novel. Go at it with the knowledge that there is nothing happy about the story; even the good results can't be considered happy because of the horrible ordeals that the people endured. Finally, take away from it that our legal system is, in fact, not perfect and hopefully with stories like this being told, we can hope to see those who can make a difference, do so."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Now it becomes clear why John Grisham has created the villains we have all read about through his illustrious career writing legal thillers. The Marshall service (The Client), The White House and Big Business (The Pelican Brief), crooked judges (The Bretheren), a corporate tax firm (The Firm), cigarette companies (The Runaway Jury), and of course the criminal justice system (The Chamber).Grisham takes on the criminal justice system again in taking his first go at nonfiction, with \\"The Innocent Man.\\" The book recounts the murder trial of small town Ada, Oklahoma's own Ron Williamson (the titular man), and his friend Dennis Fritz, as the state tries to pin the murder of townie and barmaid Debbie Carter on the pair.Grisham's editorialized style leaves little doubt - from the minute he delves into the murder investiagtion and trial - that he takes the book's title very seriously. While never acquitted of the crime, the pair did have their conviction and death sentences overturned when an appeal found that the prosecution had not only presented flimsy evidence, but that much of it had been generated by the DA's own direction of the police and forensic investigation.Facing misconduct and other charges, the state dismissed the charges against the pair, ultimately settled a suit to compensate them for the 12 years they spent on Death Row, and did charge and convict another man of the murder.But, Grisham's story is less about the meat of the crime, investigation and trial; it focuses more on American penal policy, calling Oklahoma to task for the management of its Death Row, railing against a system that employs imperfect means in dealing with the mentally ill, and questioning the efficacy of a system that is rife with human error, political pressure, backlogged processes, and more.I wound up angry at Grisham for offering up this report on the state of the American penal system under the guise of a true crime tale. The book can best be compared to \\"Lazarus and the Hurricane,\\" which became the big screen \\"The Hurricane,\\" starring Denzel Washington as wrongly convicted pro fighter Hurricane Carter. The comparison works right on down to the athletic credentials, Ron Williamson was an ex-minor leaguer in the A's and Yankees' systems, but Grisham's work fails to convey any of the gravity that the Carter book musters, and \\"The Innocent Man\\" feels rather like a nagging treatise against the death penalty.For whodunit? and true crime readers, this book disappoints; even for Grisham's regular audience I suspect there is disappointment in these pages. There's no suspense, no drama, and no emotion (other than perhaps empathy for a severely deranged person - though he doesn't act nearly as deranged once he is freed from conviction and execution - he just acts drunk). All that's left is a gooey pile of anecdotal political ravings, although for me the book did become an introspective window into Grisham's fiction reading list."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Best-selling legal thriller author (and attorney) John Grisham's first foray into non-fiction True Crime is a grippingly nauseating expose of an American (This is America?!?)

While the story is certainly engaging enough, I felt that the writing could have been better.The Innocent Man is Ron Williamson, a small-town baseball hero from Ada, Oklahoma. Williamson was on top of the world when he was drafted by the Oakland A's in the early 1970's. Six years later, he crashed back to reality due to an injured arm, bad choices, lack of discipline and drug and alcohol abuse. Not only did he lose his chance to finally make it to the majors, but he also lost his pretty young wife and his sanity.In 1982, a 21 year old cocktail waitress was brutally raped and murdered. The names of Williamson and a friend, Dennis Fritz, were mentioned as possible suspects. But it wasn't until five years later that they were arrested on very circumstantial evidence. Grisham relates how these two were rail-roaded by a ruthless and arrogant district attorney, Bill Peterson. Both men were found guilty on the flimsiest of evidence manufactured by quack scientists and jail house snitches. Evidence was also altered, hidden or tampered with by the prosecution. It is during the appeals process that the true heroes of The Innocent Man come alive, and they are the lawyers and staff from the Appellate Public Defender's Office, the Oklahoma Indigent Defense System and The Innocence Project. \\"Long before DNA erased the mysteries, they had found the truth the old way with brains and sweat.\\"Unfortunately, Grisham gets bogged down with the story and ends up repeating the same facts over and over. He also goes off on tangents--including jailhouse conditions, death row cases, etc. Ron Williamson's battles with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are very depressing. Also, I question an author who would write a non-fiction book without an index. This seems a big omission for a book of this scope.The Innocent Man is what we have come to expect from Grisham--an entertaining and very disturbing tale. I just felt that it could have been assembled a little better."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I see that a lot of people read the beginning, skipped the middle and read the last couple of chapters. If that's the case, they missed A LOT. There were so many details about this poor man's case that are truly amazing, and you really can't skip over anything to get the full grasp of what happened. Fritz and Williamson were absolutely railroaded by the entire judicial system, and it is such a shame. Their poor families were destroyed.I commend John Grisham for writing such an eye-opener. It surely did open my eyes. I'm not even sure I knew that it was going on even though it was within the last several years, but I truly enjoyed the book and highly recommend it to others.

I feel it was one of John Grisham's best."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"The power of this book lies in its great description of how completely ordinary people can have their lives utterly ruined by a miscarriage of justice. The main characters did nothing wrong except be mentally ill (in Williamson's case), happen to live in Oklahoma, and be patrons of a particular bar. Friends, this could happen to any of us if an overzealous prosecutor got mixed up in our lives. Grisham should be commended for exposing how our system can go horribly wrong and generally writing a compelling read. His passion for the subject of the book is apparent.My reservations about this book are minor, but irritating. Grisham's editors need to edit a little more actively. Grisham starts sentences with \\"there\\", uses the passive voice, and sometimes interjects his opinion at moments that require him to stay in the background.With a little more polishing Grisham could be one heck of a non-fiction writer. Mr. Grisham, please write another!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I don't know Mr. Grisham, so I won't presume to speak as to what his intentions were in writing the story of Ron Williamson. I have read several of his novels, which in no way detracted from the reading of \\"The Innocent Man\\". Having said that...I did not find this book boring at all. It did have a slightly slow start, but much of that was the necessary background to understanding what came later.One reviewer commented that it left him/her wanting to read about the other side of the story (that of the prosecution/police/judge), though this was said like it was a bad thing. Shouldn't all decent works make us question, or at the least, provoke some good conversation? I, too, would like to read the story from the other side's perspective, but I don't find that a bad thing...Like anything else, what you take out of this story is going to depend on what you put into it. We all have different views and beliefs about our justice system, the death penalty, and about what \\"should\\" happen. What this story does is, hopefully, make you stop and evaluate your beliefs for validity. I still believe in the death penalty, but I believe that it should (and could) be over-hauled drastically.The Ron Williamson story could also be used as an indictment on our mental health system. This man fell through the cracks so often and in so many different ways, it's no wonder he ended up in serious trouble. Unfortunately, this is all too common in our society, and does not seem to be an issue that many take seriously enough to try and fix.Frankly, your best bet is to read the story and decide for yourself. Will you stand on the sidelines and complain because it wasn't fast-paced enough for you? Or will you give it a try and work on expanding your beliefs and values?"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is an important story that needed to be told. Those that weren't entertained...well, life isn't all entertainment. This was highly educational. But Grisham's writing leaves much to be desired.

I have not finished the book yet, but it grabbed me immediately.

The story had me hooked from the start. I literally could not put this down. Ron Williamson's story was heartbreaking and left me very sad for what this man endured.This book challenged my thoughts on the death penalty and opened my eyes to the many flaws in our legal system. If you only have time for one book this year, I recommend it be this one. It was truly riveting."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Don't expect this to read like a novel that grabs you from the get-go and keeps you on the edge of your chair. This is more like a documentary, a lot of statistics about minor and major league baseball, about the current events in Oklahoma in the 70's, about Ron Williamson's upbringing, and a lot or rehashing about the interrogations, taken from real records of course. I started getting impatient after 100 or so pages, yet I kept plugging on, even 'though I didn't look forward to picking it up. I agree with another reviewer that it could have been shortened, and yet didn't give us a lot of background about the victims - that might have added to the appeal of the read.It's a reality check for us, and a story that needed to be told, but it is disturbing, not entertaining, nor was it intended to be. You won't easily forget Ron Williamson or the others that apparently were victims of bad police work, and of our flawed justice system.The reader closes this book with a heavy heart. I applaud you Mr. Grisham, for bringing this to light, but I prefer to read your fiction. There is too much sadness in the world already."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I am a Grisham fan and thought his first attempt at nonfiction was on the mark. Although the story focuses mostly on Ron Williamson, his story is also tied to another innocent man, Dennis Fritz. Sadly, these two men lost precious years of their lives and endured many hardships while the real killer (who was last seen with the victim) walked free and terrorized others. The fact that Ron Williamson slipped deeper and deeper into mental illness without treatment was especially sad.I did not give 5 stars because I felt there were just a few parts that either weren't needed or could have been shortened. However, like a prosecutor trying to establish a motive, I felt it was necessary for Grisham to give many examples which showed 1) Williamson's deteriorating mental and physical condition, and 2) The willingness of the district attorney and others to ignore crucial evidence, while emphasizing \\"junk science\\" to put someone, anyone, behind bars. Now that we're in the age of DNA testing, I found the importance given to hair samples and the unreliability of hair testing eye-opening. The book does a good job of making you think about our criminal justice and prison systems."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book shows that Mr. Grishman can not only spell bound us with his fiction story telling but that he also has the diligence to research and assemble an excellent non-fiction book.

It could and does happen in our country. Too many citizens and not just in Bible Belt have wrong concept from outset (as this read illustrates) that one is presumed guilty until proven innocent. I experienced firsthand evidence of this in OJ's trial on talking with people. They could and would not separate the allowable evidence in the courtroom versus what their gut told them about the innocence or guilt of the defendant.

(Author's Note: 429-435)by John GrishamReview by SpeekNDaTruufBefore 1982, very few had heard of Ada, Oklahoma. It was a small familial town; there were no strangers because everyone knew everyone else. On December 8, 1982, however, that all changed. Debra Sue Carter, a bartender at the local nightclub, The Coachlight, was raped and brutally murdered in her apartment. Scrawled on the wall in red fingernail polish were the words: Jim Smith next will die. On a small table in the kitchen were the words, written in ketchup: Don't look fore us or ealse. On Debra's back, smeared in dried ketchup: Duke Gram. Inside Debra's mouth was a green washcloth. Two men, Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz, would sit in prison for 11 years, wrongly convicted of murdering Debra Sue Carter in 1988, until exoneration on April 15, 1999. This is the story of The Innocent Man, brilliantly authored by John Grisham.As with most Grisham novels (i.e. The Client, A Painted House, The Pelican Brief, etc.), I originally thought this was a fictictious account of two men wrongly accused and convicted of murder. I grabbed a bottle of water and my fresh pack of Newports, and sat down to enjoy a fictictious novel. Yet, within the first few pages, something was bothering me. I know good authors when I read one, and I know that Grisham is an astounding author. The praise he receives is a testament to that very fact.Yet, The Innocent Man seemed... too good. It was a bit too real for me, and oddly enough, I noticed a difference in writing. It seemed as if someone was narrating a story as opposed to a first person account that I'd noticed before from Grisham. The writing was... stilted, but not in the sense that it was a hard read. It was just different. It reminded me of those docu-dramas on A&E.; I could easily hear Bill Kurtis from American Justice speaking these words. I thought to my Self, Wow, this man's imagination is amazing! So, I kept reading, amazed at Grisham's talent to concoct such a story. But, it kept nagging me and nagging me, and eventually, I decided to do some research on my own.I found out that The Innocent Man was, in fact, based on a true story! Two real, living and breathing men were wrongly convicted for a murder that they did NOT commit! Suffice it to say, I finished this book in approximately 3 days. It was that good! Sad, but very well-written. Now, I could tell you all about Mr. Williamson and his mental issues, and I could tell you about the separation between Mr. Fritz and his daughter, Elizabeth, but I'm sure I wouldn't do this any justice. I would strongly suggest you read this book for your Selves.Out of all of the novels that I've read by John Grisham, The Innocent Man, by far, is my favorite. Though it is a long and sad account of a failed justice system, and though I was often frustrated because of that, it's still a great read. FIVE STARS."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"The Innocent Man by John Grisham is his first true crime novel, about a miscarriage of justice in Ada, Oklahoma, wherein several innocent men who were sent to death row. They spent eleven years on death row until freed by DNA evidence. With the number of people being freed in recent years due to DNA evidence, it becomes clear that all too often, people are convicted and sentenced to death more because they have lost the game than because they are actually guilty. The police are under pressure to make a quick arrest, the DA is under pressure to get a conviction, the judge is under pressure to be hard on crime- and so on.In Grisham's book, Ron Williamson is a mentally disturbed pro-baseball wash-out who becomes a subject of interest after the actual killer suggests to police that the victim was scared of Ron and asked him for protection. Dennis Fritz, a middle school science teacher, attracts the attention of the police simply by virtue of being Ron's friend. Despite the lack of eyewitnesses or physical evidence, the two men are convicted.The book also details the cases of Tommy Ward and Karl Fontenot, two other young men from Ada who were convicted of murder despite a lack of evidence. Unfortunately for these two young men, there is no DNA evidence available in their case to help exonerate them.No matter what one's stance on crime and capital punishment, I don't think anyone can read this book and not be dismayed at the gross negligence exhibited by the police and prosecutors or at the how close Williamson and Fritz came to execution by the system that was supposed to provide justice for them and for the victim. With John Grisham's stature and following, it is to be hoped that by his interest in this case adn others, more people's attention will be focused on the Criminal INjustice System in our country."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Making insignificant bad choices during young age can sometimes lead to extreme hardship in the future. I have friends who are behind bars for crimes they never committed, or simply because they were at the wrong place in the wrong time. After all, the sloppiness of the justice system makes it even harder for such mistakes to be avoided.John Grisham's book \`The Innocent Man; Murder and Injustice in a Small Town' talks about a true story murder and rape of Debra Sue Carter in Ada, Oklahoma, which lead to one of the wrongful convictions throughout the United States, the conviction of Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz; creating \`one' of the most \`known' incompetence and dishonesty prosecution in history.If you haven't yet read this book, then take this chance because the movie-making process is in the oven, ticking for some-weekend in 2009."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Ron Williamson was at one time one of the favorite sons of Ada, Oklahoma. He was a young man with tremendous athletic skills and many locals believed that he just might be the next Micky Mantle, who is still the greatest baseball player to ever come from that state. But largely because of chronic injury problems that started in high school, Ron was not destined to become a great professional ballplayer. He got his shot, and managed to stay in the minors a lot longer than he probably should have, but baseball is not the thing for which Ron Williamson is remembered by citizens of Ada, Oklahoma.No, when the people of Ada think of Williamson, what they recall is the rape and murder of which he was convicted and the years that he spent on death row. They remember that he came within five days of actually being executed for a crime with which he had absolutely nothing to do. Well that's what most of them remember, anyway. Other Ada locals perhaps still want believe the local prosecutor who refuses to admit that he was wrong to ever charge Williamson with the crime, and who still wants to hold out the possibility that the DNA evidence that exonerated him does not prove that he was not involved in some way.When it came to pinning the rape and murder on someone, Ron Williamson was certainly an easy target. Ron's drinking problem began in high school and, when his baseball career unraveled, alcohol, drugs, and struggles with depression made it impossible for him to hold a job or to move on with his life. So when the baffled investigators and prosecutors in Ada decided that the crime was so brutal that it had to involve two people, Ron and his running buddy Dennis Fritz were \\"chosen\\" as the crime's most logical perpetrators.Now all they needed was the evidence to convict the two innocent men and cover themselves in glory as great crime fighters. There was no evidence to be found, however, something that did very little to slow down the police investigators or the local prosecutor who had already decided that Fritz and Williamson were guilty. A combination of creatively coerced \\"confessions,\\" testimony from local lowlifes (one who was later to be convicted of the very crime in question), sloppy testimony from experts, a judge who proved his own incompetence, and lies suggested to, and regurgitated by, jailhouse snitches, managed to convict both the men.Their story is one that most of us would like to believe never happens in this country. Unfortunately, as Grisham proves in The Innocent Man, it probably happens much more often than we know. All it takes is the right combination of incompetent policemen, investigators, expert witnesses, prosecutors and judges to make it possible. Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz had years stolen from them and their lives were largely ruined by the very people charged with protecting the public welfare. This is one scary story.Grisham tells the Fritz and Williamson story in a very straightforward way. There is no attempt to \\"novelize\\" what happened through the use of extensively recreated dialogue or by speaking from the points-of-view of its main characters. That does make for some rather dry reading at times but the details resulting from Grisham's research makes his straight reporting of the facts a fascinating one. The 10-disc unabridged audio version of The Innocent Man is read by Craig Wasson who does a particularly effective job in giving a voice to Ron Williamson's frustration and outright anger about the situation in which he found himself.Fans of John Grisham's novels, in which the action seldom seems to stop, might find the pace of this one to be a little slow. But Grisham had an important story to tell and he told it well."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I just finished reading this today. I have to admit it took a while for me to get into it. My first impressions when I was reading the \\"police report-like entries\\" in the first few chapters were: \\"this doesn't sound like Grisham\\". So I read the blurbs and foreward and realized, \\"AH! It is non-fiction!\\" And from there my perception of the book changed. There were moments when I was sad, others when I was angry, others when I was fed-up with Ron and his inability to stay in rehab, and still other moments when I wondered if Grisham was going to be sued because of the bias towards the defendants (it turns out he is being sued!)Regardless, I read the last words with a tear rolling down my cheek. This is not light reading, and I am thoroughly surprized by reviewers who still haven't figured out that this book is non-fiction. It is a truly sad story and gripping.Although biased, I have researched this book as much as I could, the story line is still true. Two imperfect men were pinpointed as murderers, imprisoned for 12 years (one of them on death row), and then exhonerated. They never received an appology for their torment, never a word of regret for their misfortune. And to top it all off, the real killer was revealed but never fully brought to justice.My only real criticism of this book is that I would have liked to learn more about the true killer. What changed in his relationship with the police with whom he was dealing drugs? What happened to him in the end?"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Although this is not my favorite of Grisham's is definitely one of his best.Grisham beautifully draws how the combination of human error, human negligence, personal interest, broken judicial system can destroy one's life."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book again was one of Grisham's great books and even more that it was based on a true story.

I enjoyed it immensely!Randy"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"At first, I thought this was a great book...and like anyone else who read it without prior knowledge of the case thought the small town police department was inept and looking to hang someone. But I did a little research on the web and found the other side of the story and think there may be more than Grisham lets on, even though he took longer than necessary to tell the story (some stories seemed repeated). Still, a fascinating story and the first true crime type of bok I have read, unless you count In Cold Blood. Read the book but also look at http://www.billpetersondistrictattorney.com/ for the Ada, OK DA's side of things."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"A lot of people seem disappointed that this book wasn't a \\"Grisham\\". I truly believe that Grisham didnt intend it to be. In some ways, I'm glad it wasn't. I loved Grisham until the \\"Street Lawyer\\" stomped me. By ch2 of \\"The Summons\\", I left for coffee & never came back. 10 pages of the Brethren showed me I could not relate. \\"A Painted House\\" was a refresher but I soon forgot abt J.G. I was curious as to what he would do w/ a non-fiction story when I picked up \\"The Innocent Man\\". Though the book was darker than his previous ones, I could still hear Grisham's great storytelling. I could sense the struggle between entering too deep into what the people \\"might\\" have felt (fiction) and a dry statement of the facts. The build up of the suspense was really good. I was very upset w/ the way Ron's parents & sisters raised him-a spoiled brat, who ws never taught responsibility, a Britney Spears of the 50s. But I admired his tenacity, his humility & even childlike vulnerability in accepting that God had forgiven him when he'd asked for forgiveness. And I wondered whether I would have done better. This book is about real people, who make real mistakes and pay for them in one way or another. This book is about real people, who make real mistakes and pay for them in one way or another. It's about a system that is not perfect; it's about real life and it could happen to anyone. It's what makes this book scary.Grisham does what the Ada police, officials & the state of OK didn't do: he admits out loud the faults in a system he's breathed, lived & maybe even loved. He sets out in his own way to make things right by telling the story & lending his name to the causes of Fontenot & Tommy Ward. Had the state done its part, they wld have gained credibility w/ the people but they kept silent and hid in their corruption & hypocrisy. This is what I ws left with: this country is not perfect-being proud of our system (or ourselves) is one thing but when we ignore its faults and turn the other way while people die for the sake of saving face or preserving a false sense of security, we are misled. And that's what scares me the most."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"The Innocent Man reads like a John Grisham novel with one twist--it is a true story. Grisham methodically details how a small-town police department and prosecutor had an intuitive feeling that two men must have committed a brutal rape-murder and pursued capital murder charges against them in spite of the evidence. After many years in prison, the two defendants were finally exonerated by DNA evidence and released.Grisham does a convincing job of describing how Ron Williamson, a former minor league baseball player, and Dennis Fritz, a middle school teacher, were steam-rollered by a malicious criminal justice system which cared more about proving itself right than being right. Particularily troubling is the story of how Williamson's borderline mental illness blossomed into full-blown insanity as a result of his wrongful incarceration and Fritz's quiet desperation as the justice system failed him at each step of the process.This book is a real eye-opener. While the criminal justice system functions honestly and accurately 99% of the time, this book shows how it can and did go astray. The book also does an excellent job of describing the work of the Innocence Project. The Innocent Man should inspire the reader to go further and examine the work done by The Innocence Project."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Good book and presentation but as I did not yet read it, I can tell you a properly opinion right now."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read other John Grisham books and have really enjoyed them. However, this work of non-fiction did not live up to my expectations. It was very enlightening, seeing how an innocent person of little means can be convicted on information not based in reality. The second half of the book held my interest much more than the first half. Most of the book was a detailed account of the the main character's life and subsequently the case. At times it was a little slow. I congratulate Mr. Grisham on a story that needed to be told. Unfortunately, there are many more like this one."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I got this for my wife who is the book reader in the family, she advised she liked it alot, would be a nice addition to your book collection."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I am a great fan of John Grisham and have read & enjoyed every book he has ever published. I also love non-fiction true crime stories. But I am afraid this book didn't meet up to my standards in either genre. I agree with another reviewer that the title should have been The Innocent Men. I also agree that the other four innocent men should have been fleshed out a bit more and the majority of Ron's childhood and youth cut out. I was amazingly bored with chapters 2 through 4 and again with chapters 7-9. I would advise anyone who begins this book and thinks they can't finish it to be sure and catch all chapters not mentioned above. The book moves along smoothly after you get to Chapter 10, but there is information you need to know in Chapters 1, 5 & 6.I think this just shows that a great writer of fiction may be able to easily branch out to light comedic fiction, but not so easily to non-fiction. Grisham is a great story teller, but perhaps is just a poor reporter of actual events.I am sorry that I bought a copy for my dad for Christmas, and just wish I had read my library copy prior to buying for him."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read all of Grisham's books and was looking forward to this one, however, unlike his past works, I have a hard time wanting to pick this book up and finish it.

Would prefer this story made into a movie vs. a book."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"What was the victim's name? What were her goals and aspirations? What kind of musical instrument did she play? A book that delves into the minutiae of the main characters' lives should also provide information about other key characters. This is not a long book. There is certainly room to explore the murder victim and her position in the community. The second victim receives even less attention. In reality, only Williamson and Fritz are fully developed. It would have been nice to know more about the cops. Had they ever been investigated by Internal Affairs? Were their records blemished, or were their careers sparkling clean?Sadly, the dearth of information about the \\"supporting characters\\" makes this presentation shallow and opportunistic. \\"I'll gather the information that has already been revealed on Good Morning America, package it, put my name and picture on the cover, and it will sell like hotcakes.\\" Mr. Grisham, I've been following your career for nearly twenty years. I know that you would not want your talent to be measured by this truly commercial effort."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I generally enjoy most everything that Grisham writes, and truth to tell, I enjoyed 'An Innocent Man.' But to be honest, this isn't about a completely \\"innocent\\" character, and Grisham really goes HEAVY into the details of Ron Williamson's criminal record, prior to his trial for murder. It's one thing if the book was about a completely innocent bank teller being yanked into court falsely for a murder. But Ron Williamson, as detailed by Grisham, has a lengthy history of things like drunk driving offenses (would Grisham have ever written the book had Williamson, on one of his drunken drives, killed a family in an automotive collision?) And TWO rape convictions? Sheesh...These were the details that came to mind as Grishom plodded on with his account of the cruel trial, sentencing and prison details. This wasn't necessarily an \\"innocent man\\" per se. He was a man accused of one crime he didn't committ, but considering the multiple drunk driving charges alone, did this really bother me that he was being shipped off to jail? Yes and no. Yes, it bothered me that he was falsely accused for this crime but.... it's also one of those \\"live by the sword\\"-kindof things, and Ron brought this direction on himself by the way he was living his life. The book in many ways felt like a lot of sympathy for the devil.Actually, now that I think about it, this entire novel reminded me of that 'Miami Vice' episode where Crockett hears about a criminal from his past, who was in jail for a crime he didn't commit. The criminal DOES confess that he committed a number of nasty crimes over the years, but that he was in priosn for one that he did not. Crockett, for some strange reason, investigates, gets the guy freed, then the criminal goes off and kill's Crockett's wife.With Ron Williamson, he gets out and goes back to his heavy drinking and strip clubs. Gosh, the post-prison release details of Ron are just tiring. When it's back to drinking again, you just want to moan and skip ahead.Grisham does push sortof heavy with the anti-death penalty movement, and this is fine, but it does read heavily of his own view on this subject. We never really hear the persepective of the other side of the issue. But whatever.The book was decent, but not my favorite Grisham work."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"While this isn't one of John Grisham's best literary attempts, the story is fascinating. I read the book in one sitting. It's a perfect example of how our justice system can go totally wrong, with horrifying results."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"The Ronnie Williamson story should be retold and never forgotten. Far too many people believe that our system of justice always lets the innocent go free. The reality is that even in the third century of our nation's existence the Bill of Rights enshrined in our Constitution does not fully apply to all in our society.Ronnie's life is a tragic tale of a young man who began life full of optimism only to begin a long downhill slide. He had some talent as a baseball player and, after high school graduation, was signed to play professional baseball for the Oakland Athletics. Unfortunately, from here on his life slowly unraveled. Ronnie never made it beyond the minor leagues and when his shoulder was injured playing ball his baseball career came to an end. He than began a great unraveling that included alcohol abuse, drug abuse, and mental disease. Gradually, Ronnie became identified in his hometown of Ada, Oklahoma as being a \\"trouble-maker\\".In 1982, a young woman Debbie Carter was savagely sexually abused in her apartment and than strangled. The law enforcement authorities in Ada were desperate to solve the crime. With little foundation, suspicion was focused on Ronnie. For five years nothing happened, than in 1987, Ronnie was charged with the crime after making a false confession after being subjected to police interrogation for twelve consecutive hours. There was very little evidence to suggest he was guilty of anything.He couldn't afford an attorney and his court-appointed attorney made a number of mistakes. He failed to challenge his client's mental competency to stand trial, he failed to adequately rebutt prosecution evidence that consisted of jailhouse informants, he failed to pursue a confession made by another man to the police in the case, and he failed to prepare mitigation evidence during the death penalty phase of the trial. The trial judge was equally inept. He even refused to take action when it came to light that the prosecution had withheld exculpatory evidence in the case from the defense. The prosecutor was blind to the notion that anyone else could have committed the crime and pursued Ronnie with visceral determination--until he was finally exonerated by DNA evidence years later.Ronnie is sentenced to death. He spends eleven years on death row. At one point, he came within days of execution. Finally, a federal judge becomes aware of how marginal the case against him is and grants his petition for habeas corpus, ordering a new trial. Before this new trial can take place, DNA testing--unavailable in 1982--is done and it exonerates him and identifies the real killer. Ronnie is released from prison after more than a decade of captivity.John Grisham tells this horrific story in a very matter of fact way. One has to wonder how such a thing could happen in America. One also has to wonder if the death penalty is justifiable when mistakes like this occur. In fact, the book identifies one other case in Oklahoma where another innocent man is released from death row when his innocence is established as well. Very possibly there are others.Sadly, Ronnie died after his release from prison at the age of 51. Hopefully, Grisham's book will create an awareness that innocent people end up on death row and prison even in America. Although the guarantees in our Bill of Rights allow guilty people to go free on occasion, we must never forget why they are there. We must remember that criminal defense lawyers have an important role in our society as well.

Overall, I was not impressed, and found myself quite dissapointed.Grisham is a wonderful story teller. Perhaps not the most poetic, but his characters and storylines have always entertained me. All of which is absent in this book.I found it to be little more than a regurgitation of the facts, with a rather thick bias. Gone is any hint of wit, or even the slightest sense of his humor.Anyone on the fence regarding the death penalty might benefit from its pages, but aside from that, I'd recomend you wait out his next novel."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"John Grisham should stick to fiction!

In a Wisconsin case that year an \\"expert\\"for the state compared a \\"known\\" hair sample with one foundat the crime scene and testified that the two came from thesame source. The source was convicted, but on appeal theWisconsin Supreme Court reversed and said, strongly, \\"Suchevidence is of the most dangerous character.\\"There were several memorable passages; among them:* The tales started immediately--Holland was describing statementsRon allegedly made in jail about Debbie Carter--and it was obviousRon was about to explode. He shook his head, clenched his jaws,stared at Holland as if he'd like to kill her. Finally she said, \\"He saidif she'd went ahead and went with him, he'd never had to kill her.\\"* Practice makes perfect, and executions as McAlester arecarried out with precision. For the inmate whose time hascome, the last day is spent receiving visitors--family members,friends, usually his lawyer. Of course the visits are painful,made even more so by the fact that there can be no physicalcontact. They chat and cry through a thick wall of glass whiletalking on a phone. No farewell hugs or kisses from the family,just a gut-wrenching \\"I love you\\" through a black receiver.Often the inmate and his visitor will symbolically kiss each otherby pressing their lips against the glass. They also imitatetouching with their hands.And this frightening one, describing an actual execution:* First a saline solution is pumped in to open the veins. The firstdrug is sodium thiopental, and it quickly knocks out the inmate.Another flushing of saline solution, then the second drug, vecuroniumbromide, stops the breathing. Another quick flush and the thirddrug, potassium chloride, stops the heart."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I listened to the abridged audiobook. I found it tedious at times but overall enthralling. How can one not sympathize with the unjustly convicted man? You get goosebumps when the truth is known. I think Grisham has made his mark and would like him to write about more true crime situations."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I'll be brief. Grisham writes action-packed novels which are fairly interesting and readable, but his foray into true-crime should stop here. The premise for Innocent Man is undoubtedly thought-provoking, a classic example of perverted (in)justice, but Grisham is not the man for the job. I had to stop at 150 pages because I was bored to death--it read like a dragging newspaper article, a recitation of events without the heart and soul that makes the story come alive. Say what you will about Ann Rule or Jack Olsen--they can make the players jump off the page and keep you riveted to the end."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is Grisham's first attempt at non fiction. It's an interesting story, but anti-climatic. You know from the beginning that the wrong person is sent to jail for murder and is later set free. It's cool to see how the police departments investigate crimes, the pressure put on them to find a suspect and how easy it is to swing a jury. Worth the read, but not a page turner by any means."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I was surprised to read that John had problems getting this novel published in the first place.It was a terrific story and very well toldI found soon after starting it, that I had read it years ago, but had forgotten how it ended up, and having found out could still read it againMarleneAmazon verified purchase"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"It doesn't matter, fiction or non-fiction(as this one is), John Grisham is going to keep you interested.

Give it a try."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Grisham writes a good book, but I think I like his fiction better. Perhaps because this is based on fact and he couldn't create the scene flow to be as consistent as fiction since life doesn't always follow a smooth pattern. I also feel that there was a little too much proselytizing to have the author's view on what occurred. The author seldom intrudes in his fiction even though they're his characters formed from his belief system; the spectrum tends to be broader. He wasn't there to experience what all the players were dealing with and there's certainly a general condemnation of those involved. Right or wrong, 'just doing my job' is certainly an easy escape of responsibility, but at the same time, when you must make a decision based on the only information you have before you, you shouldn't necessarily be vilified. Hindsight is always 20-20; in fiction, that's fine, but in real life, it tends to sound heavy handed from an experienced novelist."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I'm a Grisham fan that's read virtually everything he's ever written, but this one isn't very good-- kind of a dull recitation of court proceedings, and confusing bounce-backs in the time line.

I have read it several times and the events still astound me. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"The Innocent Man was one of my favorite books that I have read. It is definitely a thriller that I could not put down. I actually read it a couple of years ago before I was writing reviews on Amazon.Thinking about the details of Ron Williamson's case are still frustrating to this day, a couple of years removed from when I actually read the book. Sitting here trying to remember all of them is causing me to want to read the book again, and I think I might. Ron Williamson's story is a tragic one that is painful to read about. As his dream of becoming the next Micky Mantle had come to an end his mental stability started to go as he was trying to accept that his life as an amazing baseball player was not going to pan out. Ron began drinking and using drugs frequently, and started demonstrating behavior that showed indications that his mental stability has leaving him. Then the issues with the police started as Ron began getting in trouble for petty crimes.As the murder of the woman (her name has slipped my mind over the years) happens Ron seemed a good fit for the crime. A good fit for the crime according to, in my opinion, small town authorities who did not want to take the time to do their job correctly, or risk having the people of Ada, OK running scared because there was a killer on the loose. This book takes you through a frustrating tale of small town corruption from the police all the way through the judicial system. As you read all of the evidence that should have shown that Ron and the other man accused really had nothing to do with the murder, it will make you angrier and angrier with everyone involved in the prosecution. As the book goes on and talks about Ron's time in jail and the affects that it has on his already weakening mental state.As you read this book you keep thinking that the wrongs done to Ron will be righted and that it will be the happy story of him getting out of Jail and living a happy normal life. Unfortunately in this TRUE story the fairly tale does not happen. I enjoy Grisham's work for the most part, but I am typically a non fiction kind of guy. So for him to tackle a true story that is right up his alley with a story about the judicial system was really nice for me. I would recommend that any Grisham fan and anyone that enjoy's a good page turner should read is and I would almost guarantee that you will enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"*This review contains spoilers. You have been warned.*Many of you will be shocked by the following statement:This is my first John Grisham book.Okay, well, that's not entirely true. I did read the Theodore Boone books by him, but they were so dumbed-down for kids they can't even be considered to be by John Grisham. And I do have a legitimate reason for holding off his books until now--I'm a teenager, and I didn't feel I was ready to explore the world of books written for adults until now. But I happened to be in the vicinity of a bookstore while travelling and running out of reading material, so I went into that bookstore and decided to take a stab at reading a book by Mr. Grisham.The titular \\"innocent man\\" in the novel is Ronald Keith Williamson. As this work of nonfiction--because that's what it is, not your standard Grisham novel; this is nonfiction--begins, we see that Ron is going to be the next baseball legend. He's won multiple state championships with his high school and was even honoured by being selected as an all-star player. But then it all came crumbling down. Ron began drinking, and hampered by injuries, his baseball dreams were shattered, though he refused to admit that. And in 1987, Ron Williamson and his friend Dennis Fritz were charged with the violent first-degree murder of Debra Sue Carter, a crime that Mr. Grisham so brilliantly shows that they were clearly innocent of committing. But the state of Oklahoma was desperate. The state of Oklahoma was ridiculously focused on convicting these two of the crime. And so it happened that Dennis Fritz was headed to prison for the rest of his life. Ron Williamson was headed towards death row and eventually, death by lethal injection.The description of the hardcover edition of this book says \\"If you believe that in America you are innocent until proven guilty, this book will shock you. If you believe in the death penalty, this book will disturb you. If you believe the criminal justice system is fair, this book will infuriate you.\\" I do not believe that in America you are innocent until proven guilty. I do not believe in the death penalty. And I do not believe our criminal justice system is fair. Yet this book completed shocked me. This book very greatly disturbed me, and it really, really infuriated me.This book will shock and frighten you. As you will read, the evidence against Williamson and Fritz was a joke. The trial was littered with witnesses with false information, witnesses who were \\"snitches\\". Science experts were not the experts the state claimed them to be. And this book will frighten you because since Williamson and Fritz did not have money, they were at the mercy at the state giving them lawyers. Lawyers who did barely anything to help them. Even though this situation is very unlikely to happen to me, I was frightened by the thoughts of \\"What would I do in their situation? What if I was Ron Williamson or Dennis Fritz?\\"This book will disturb and depress you. This is not a happy story. Even though Williamson and Fritz were granted full exonerations, there was no happy ending for Williamson. And my stomach turns just thinking of the hell the two of them went through for twelve years. The prison guards would make fun of Williamson at night, pretending they were Debbie Carter, and taunted him by asking him why he killed her. Williamson would scream that he was innocent for nights on end. Furthermore, there's not just one innocent man in this book--as mentioned before, there were Williamson and Fritz--but there were three other innocent men as well, raising the grand total in this book to five. A little thought experiment (if you can call it that): five innocent men on death row, in the same state, over, what, the course of two years? Now picture the United States. Fifty States. It's been 36 years since executions resumed since 1976. How many Ron Williamsons are there out there? How many of them have been wrongly executed? This has got to be the most disturbing book I've ever read, and I've read a lot. And it definitely ranks up there as one of the most depressing, if not the most.And this book will infuriate you. Do not be surprised if you get very angry and start wanting to curse at the book. With every page, the riduculousness of the State's case against the innocent grew and grew, and so did my anger. How could this happen? I thought to myself. I thought Oklahoma was supposed to be a nice place! What makes this book so infuriating is that the blame had to be placed on so many people. The District Attorney. Williamson's lawyer. The judge. And finally, the jury. I don't think anger is an emotion is an emotion you can describe clearly, so I'll stop.Some reviewers have commented on the book's slow start. It is true. The book begins rather slowly, without much legal drama. But I'd like to kindly remind those reviewers that this is a work of nonfiction. And nonfiction's primary purpose is to inform, not entertain.I would also like to comment on the District Attorney, Bill Peterson, involved in this case. He did not even offer a single apology to Williamson to Fritz, for the 12 years they spent. Mr. Peterson, how would you like it if you came within five days of an execution because of a crime you did not commit?Think about that. Then go get this book."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Another good read from Grisham. Only reason it's not a 5 star is the fact that it took Grisham a long time to get to the story. I wasn't hooked from the start but later on got hooked about half way through.Makes you really afraid of the justice system."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"The book centers on the story of Ron Williamson, arrested, tried, convicted, and sentenced to death for the 1982 murder of a young woman in his hometown of Ada, Oklahoma. Though he was eventually exonerated (no secret here--the title indicates as much), the years he spent behind bars were the major contributing factor to his rapid physical and mental decline. Amazingly, until his retrial after years of incarceration, no one--not the prosecutor, not his defense attorneys, not the judges who oversaw his hearings and trial--thought to have him formally evaluated for mental competence, even though he was already exhibiting clear signs of mental deterioration. Grisham's telling of the story is a sad account of shoddy police work, a closed-minded prosecution that refused to consider any alternative to Ron's guilt (and that of his co-defendant Dennis Fritz), feisty but inadequate defense by a court-appointed attorney who would rather be doing other things, and a man already disappointed with his life (Ron was a skilled athlete, a hometown hero, who had aspirations to become a professional baseball player) now finding himself in the clutches of a legal system on which he cannot depend and which he does not understand. Kafka already wrote part of this story as fiction. In his short novel \\"The Trial\\", he described how K. found himself in the clutches of a byzantine legal system that operated on three fundamental assumptions: a) the fact that someone comes to the attention of the court system means that he is most likely guilty; b) it is not necessary for the accused to understand the charges against him; c) evidence is far less important than the presumption of guilt. The difference, in Grisham's book, is that this actually happened. There is little doubt that it still happens far too often, despite the great strengths of the American legal system. The level of incompetence displayed throughout the legal proceedings is frightening, as is the prejudicial determination of the prosecutor to pin the murder on Williamson and Fritz, as is the callousness of \\"professionals\\" from the medical, legal, and prison ranks, all of whom watched (and often contributed) as Ron lost his mind. Grisham clearly has no sympathy for those he sees as bunglers throughout years of investigations and legal proceedings, and there may be factors that could be adduced in defense of those he criticizes. But this is not simply a hatchet job on the justice system as it operated in Oklahoma; Grisham is too skilled a writer and too knowledgeable a lawyer to simply slash and burn. His legal training and his experience writing legal thrillers mean that he brings the eye of both a writer and a lawyer to his task, and the result, while not particularly subtle, is an effective study of justice delayed, denied, and ignored. There are so many times when the system does not work as it should--that is, it does not work in the interests of justice--that at nearly every point where you are thinking that now, finally, something will work out right, you also have a nagging sense that it just as easily might not. And of course, you have to keep reading to find out, so you keep turning the pages with a sense of both anticipation and nervousness. Ron Williamson was far from a model citizen--he drank far too much, abused drugs, hung around with some unsavory types, spent much of his time in unproductive ways, had trouble with the law--but he was not a murderer. I've only read a couple of Grisham's legal novels, and I do not read much at all from the true-crime shelf. So while I am not an enormous Grisham fan, I did enjoy this book--if \\"enjoy\\" is the right word for the combination of interest, frustration, anger, and sympathy that the story elicits. It's not great literature; Grisham's writing is more workmanlike than subtle, profound, or beautiful. But it works. In fact, I'd probably read more Grisham if he wrote more of these. Well, maybe not. I can do without the frustration."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Ok, let me first tell you that this review is biased....... I am a Grisham fan...... In fact his novel A Time to Kill is my favorite novel of all time...... This one is a close second! Grisham's books are either strictly either dead on spell bounding........ or just kind of wander off on a trail........ this one was dead on spell bounding....... Not since A Time to Kill, The Firm or The Chamber have I been so wrapped up in one of his novels....... and the scariest part of this novel, is that it is a true story!(Ok, I know that I live in North Dakota), but I do consider it to be a civilized part of the USA...... Hey, Microsoft has a huge campus here, and the state has a 2 Billion dollar surplus in it's state government........ It scares the HELL out of me that such an undjustice could be done in Oklahoma.....which is 5 states away...... How in the world could this happen........ I do realize that it was done before DNA became the mainstay of an investigation, but wow, talk about small town police work, small minded police investigators, and a a judicial system, except in the later appeal years should be so ashamed of them selves.......So anyway, a great read........ enjoy! Thanks Grisham for a great read!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"It has been awhile since I have read this but I remember picking it up and not even realizing it was a non fiction true crime book until I was almost half way into the book. Even tho John Grisham usually writes fiction novels this was one of the best true crime books I have ever read he really brings you into the story and makes you care."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I got squirreled into reading this book by my local book club. I normally like Grisham's works but do not normally read his genre. And I guess I have never read a nonfiction book on a crime before either, so I was unprepared for the way the story was told. I opened it up expecting to read a story, where characters interacted telling the story themselves and instead got a step-by-step factual telling of how events unfolded by a narrator.It is the story of two murders that take place in Ada, Oklahoma in 1980s. It centering on the men who were convicted of the crimes and their innocents. It retold the horrible mistreatment they received at the hands of the judicial system and the failure of society to protect them from being unjustly convicted and treated inhumanely. It tells of the plight of the families of the convicted \\"innocent\\" men and how they were helpless to stop the horror that was happening to their loved ones, expanding on how the crime flows outward affecting all it touches. It tells of the single-minded focus and ignorance of the police investigating the crime. Detailing the desperation of the police to solve the crime quickly; pages and pages on the lengths they were willing to go. But mostly it told the sad tale of a man whose life was breaking apart from a mental illness, whose family was desperately trying to save him from himself and failed.First off, I did not like the style of storytelling; it left me feeling detached from the characters in the tale. I wasn't able to get a feel for them. Whenever it was stated how a character felt at the moment it sounded contrite. It in no way made me want to like them, in fact most all of them disgusted me.Second, due to personal reasons I hate reading about things that happen to real people. It disturbs me that such things happen and I get no joy out of reading the grisly details of a murder. And the step by step telling of how innocent people became entangled and framed by law officials just made me want to hurl at the unjustness of it all. If anything this book opened my eyes to the inadequacies of our justice system; making me scared of any interaction with police if ever I am on that side of the law.Third, I hate real life tales that end in tragedy. No matter how you try to spin it... The story of the people involved in The Innocent Man is a tragedy; there is no happy ending for any of them.So is this book good? Oh ya, it's good at telling you the horrible happenings in the lives of all involved. It exposes all the nastiness of a corrupt system and for people who love to follow murder cases...this book is it! Read it, enjoy it. For those whose hearts get ripped out at the misuse and abuse of others...avoid it, you will cry for a long time.I am giving it a 3/5 just based on my personal preferences in what I expect from a good read."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is a good story for a road trip.

Loving many of John Grisham books in the past, I expected to to love this book based on the summary and the author. However, I have not been able to finish the book on two attempts. It read like a newspaper article more than a novel,and when another book turned up I was eager to switch to it without forcing myself to finish this one."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is a true story of a small town in Oklahoma where a horrible murder took place; where two innocent men were arrested by policemen using insubstantial investigation methods and who were more interested in the arrest than whether or not they had the real killers. They were prosecuted and convicted by the state prosecutor who had no real evidence and who used unreliable witnesses whose testimony was based on what they said they overheard in prison. They were denied some of their basic rights during the trial because they could not afford a decent attorney, and they were sent to prison where after many years they found someone to believe in their innocence.This book explains the many flaws in the legal system that caused the arrest and conviction of innocent men. Under the Constitution of the United States, its citizens are guaranteed many rights not found in other governments, but we do have many flaws in our legal system and until these are corrected, innocent people suffer. Like all of John Grisham's books, most of which I have read, this one was fascinating from start to finish.

Really makes you wonder how many innocent men and women have been convicted of crimes they didn't commit. Great read!!!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Guh. This book was really compelling and just made me want to scream. I always squirm when I watch movies or dramas based on the premise that the protagonist is accused/convicted/pursued wrongly and no one will listen to them. Man, I even hate when it happened on Star Trek! I mean, come ON, Captain - when one of your crewmembers says they heard something weird in the warp core, don't just suggest they're under stress and need to take a day off. Geez. It's like that recurring nightmare where you scream and no one hears you. Well, this book made me feel like that, only it's a horrifically true story. You just want to reach in and yell at the characters. I suppose I had a slow time getting into it (5 minutes at a time at bedtime for a few weeks), but I hit some kind of stride about 1/3 of the way in, and I couldn't pull myself away from it for the last three days, finishing it. I just feel exhausted, sad, etc. (don't want to give away the end). Like most people, I just want the prosecutor to die of hemorrhoids, or to stalk him and put Visine in his chili con carne. I've now spent the last two hours reading wikipedia and other websites about this story and its characters, scouring the Internet, YouTube and so on for more information. I really feel like I want to keep up with the story, or get even more detail about some of the events. I feel like this story will be with me for a long time. Good on you, John Grisham, this is well written and fascinating."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"If you're thinking of becoming a law enforcement officer, a prosecutor, or a defense attorney - go ahead and try this book on for size. It can serve as the one book that you need to read to maintain perspective in your chosen field. Why? Because it issues a real life example of how the justice system can operate as a flawed and dangerous weapon when wielded by the lazy, corrupt, and uncaring.Let me tell you that in my experience as a defense attorney and a prosecutor 99% of the time the person who is arrested for the crime is the person who committed the crime. However, it is the 1% that we must never, ever forget exists. The Innocent Man should not be taken as your only medicine in regard to the justice system but it should be consumed at some point. Friends who have read this piece have commented that they \\"never thought things like this could happen\\" etc, etc. They do happen and will continue to happen. It is good for people to realize that.While the events in The Innocent Man are the exception rather than the rule within the justice system that does not make the situation any less frightening. A good prosecutor in a capital case should always try to convince himself, prior to filing charges, that the defendant is innocent. After all, he never knows at what point in his career 1% will come his way.Grisham breaks from the fiction mold and comes up with a nice telling of an ugly issue. You should be bothered by the events portrayed in The Innocent Man and the book should leave you with questions that must be answered before you can sleep well once again."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Several men accused of capital crimes are exonerated for different reasons. The main focus of Grisham's book is Ron Williamson, a pathetic man who along with his only friend,Dennis Fritz, was framed for brutally raping and murdering Debbie Carter, a local girl he had never even met.What made Grisham's book so difficult to read was how completely disgusting Williamson was. He was accused (although not convicted) of rape twice, he treated women horrifically -- sometimes beating them, sometimes making them leave a car while still in motion, in general, frightening them in myriad ways. He mooched from anyone who would spend any time with him and always took advantage of all of his family members. He abused drugs and alcohol, and had an inflated sense of his self-worth. He started out as a narcissist, and deteriorated over time to having more serious psychological problems.While I despised Williamson, and felt he never should have been on death row, I was glad he was away from society, and found it hard to sympathize with the time stolen from him. His friend, Dennis Fritz, on the other hand was a much more sympathetic sort, who, while he did get in trouble from time to time, had the ability to change and to make something of himself.What was so bizarre in this story was how many people saw Debbie Carter the night she was murdered, expressing fear of someone else, after dancing with him and leaving in the middle of a song, pushing him away from her car, telling friends she'd feel more comfortable if someone stayed over her house etc. That person wasn't even considered a suspect despite a long criminal record. The incomplete and inept police work done in the initial investigation, and utter incompetence of the entire legal team, including the judge in Willamson's and Fritz' trials, was mind-boggling.Grisham did a stellar job writing a very important book."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"A legal thriller from John Grisham with a twist -- this one is true. In the early 1980s, in the small town of Ada, Oklahoma a young cocktail waitress is brutally raped and murdered in her apartment. Right from the start, the local police force suspected Ron Williamson, a former local baseball hero who became a transient. With barely circumstantial evidence, however, the prosecutor was able to convict Ron and have him sentenced to death.Frightening look at what can happen when a perfect storm of corrupt law enforcement, ineffective defense lawyers and indifferent legal and medical systems combine against an innocent individual. With evidence so clearly lacking, I was left wondering how it was even possible for travesty of not only a guilty verdict, but also a failed appeal, to occur. Part of me wonders if Grisham didn't sugarcoat and gloss over the complete story."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I found that this book was very well written and very apparent that it had extensively been researched. I felt that the book could have been wrapped up sooner than it was and could have been maybe 75 pages shorter. As a matter of fact, I ended up skipping some of the trial information because it was just too much and was putting me to sleep.I found it awfully sad that something like what happened to Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz could happen in a country like ours. It just goes to show that if you don't have money, you can literally get screwed by the judicial system, with bad legal representation. This, unfortunately, also happens with medical care. The ones that don't have are so much more in danger of getting bad, or no care/representation than the ones that can afford to pay.Something is wrong here, isn't it?"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I never thought I'd enjoy a fiction book by John Grisham, but this one is simply amazing. It reads like one of his best selling fiction books, but the sad thing is, all of this is true.The book centers on the town of Ada, Oklahoma, a typical midwestern town where not much happens, and most people know one another. In the 1980s two murders are committed with very similar circumstances. The Pontotoc County police department and prosecutor's office focus on a former baseball star, now a washed up drunk with the early signs of mental illness, named Ron Williamson and decide he must be guilty of these two murders because an acquaintance \\"confessed\\" to committing these murders in a dream. The acquaintance only \\"confessed\\" to the murders because of an intense, and illegal, police interrogation, deciding to give the police the craziest story he could think of in order to get them off his back. However, regardless of this absolutely crazy \\"confession\\" the police take this seriously and, as Grisham makes clear, pass up clear evidence that Williamson didn't commit these murders, and arrest him. After his arrest, the Pontotoc County prosecutor's office puts pressure on witnesses to shape their story in order to convict Williamson, as well as use totally junk science, to convict him and get him sentenced to death row.This story is an absolute page turner, I read it in one day. It's engrossing, enraging, and scary. If any one of us was arrested by the police, Grisham shows it's very easy to get convicted of something you did not do, even with almost no evidence to prove you did it. Further, as Grisham notes, all of the individuals involved in Pontotoc County from the police to the prosecutor believe they got the right man despite all of the evidence to the contrary. They weren't looking for justice, they were looking to close the murders and make themselves look good.I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants a real look at how the justice system can sometimes get things horribly wrong. The innocent do get convicted, far more than we'd like to believe."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"The item for which I asked for was shipped in great condition and in a timely fashion.

So when this book was recommended to me, I was skeptical.Immediately I was intrigued. I love true crime books that start with recounting the victim on the night of the murder, and then work their way around to the whole story. He set the book up well, and I was instantly hooked (although I did notice a striking resemblance to another quite famous author and their true crime work: Truman Capote's In Cold Blood; read the beginning pages of each book side by side and see what I mean).The story itself is amazing. I found every person involved sympathetic, but also difficult to like at times. The amount of details can be dizzying, but I enjoyed the confusion. This case is so ridiculous at times that it is hard to believe this really happened. But it did, and not too long ago mind you.I never thought the book was boring or dragging. I had difficult times putting it down, which lead me to read well into the night. I wanted to devour all 400+ pages as soon as possible because I was so intrigued, and dying to know how any of this debacle was resolved.Even if you don't like Grisham, you may really enjoy this book.

This one has just enough theory and background, and a lot of detail for two specific environments: (1) CVS and (2) SourceSafe. If you are not using either tool this book may not be the best resource.Highlights include the way the book covers the use of the two tools in great detail, ensuring that readers in Microsoft and UNIX/Linux environments have realistic guidelines for implementing and effectively using SCM in their specific environments. Note that the examples are slanted towards the Microsoft .NET and Linux environments, which make this material relevant to a significant number of readers.SCM as a discipline is clearly and succinctly covered. I like the way the book examines both roles and processes, and the emphasis on tasks. These make this book one of the most practical I've read because nuances of each tool, as well as unique build requirements for each of the environments are clearly covered.If you work with either CVS or SourceSafe and want to quickly learn how to best employ either tool in their target environments for an effective SCM process this book will prove invaluable."},{"Title":"Real World Software Configuration Management","review":"Keneflick talks like he knows the business of source control and builds. My knowledge of these critical functions was based on experience and errors. (Hey, I'm a code monkey!) After reading the first seven chapters I now have a better idea how software configuration should function.The book also provides a working knowledge of CVS, SourceSafe, and scripting builds."},{"Title":"Real World Software Configuration Management","review":"Compared to the last title I read (Moreira's SCM Implementation Roadmap), Real World SCM has a considerably lighter tone (more axiomatic than prescriptive, and with some humor), not so much like a textbook. That is not a knock on Mr. Moreira; both books have their place. If you need a recipe (and forms) for creating an SCM process, get the Roadmap book. If you are a developer looking to expand your horizons, try Real World SCM.The first four chapters present an overview of the SCM role, process, and tools. I can't quibble with any of the info presented -- my only advice would be to consider including a review of CA's Harvest tool. [...], it is one of the most popular (or one of the most buggy) source control tools available after CVS, VSS, and maybe ClearCase.The write-up on Perforce piqued my interest. Maybe it's time to finagle an evaluation copy.I photocopied \\"The Golden Rules of SCM\\" (p.15) and stuck it on the wall of my cube.I skipped the chapters on CVS and VSS.Chapter 7 also has some useful tips.I skipped chapters 8 - 10 because I work in a Java web shop, using ant for builds, and a custom app for deployments.Chapter 11 has some useful tips on deployment. I'm glad that most people recognize a need to manage components such as the database; I've yet to encounter an easy-to-use and consistent solution to that particular problem. Maybe my DBA can reverse-engineer our schema and hand over the scripts to version control.To sum, the general sections will be helpful to the typical (i.e. self-trained) SCM or developer-cum-SCM; those who work in shops that build executables, deploy to clients, use CVS, VSS or .Net will find the tool-specific chapters useful. Some may need more organization in how the author presents his advice, but many readers should walk away with a reasonable amount of additional knowledge."},{"Title":"Real World Software Configuration Management","review":"If you are stuck using Microsoft's code control tool, this book may give you some practical info on branching, pinning, and all that other VSS garbage.

Yep. It had the magic power of filling your glass and providing you with high quality cuisine.Wolfram Von Eschenbach's Parzifal, written in the 12th Century (when knights still really did joust and women still really did wear wimples), will disappoint anyone determined to discover the hidden secrets of the Templars. Instead it illuminates in rich and exhuberant detail the desires and concerns of the aristocratic Germans of Wolfram's class while telling a timeless story of spiritual development. Parzifal, the child who knows nothing of knightly ways makes mistakes, but slowly, by learning to understand them, grows into the not-too-perfect knight who achieves the Gral through compassion.For a modern reader who is really interested in the period it is full of fun insights into Mediaeval life - have you ever considered how rusty one gets in armour? Wolfram's ideas about women, people of colour and Muslims might surprise you too.If, however, you're not patient enough to deal with many a joust or details of kinship lovingly described, I think this won't be the book for you."},{"Title":"Parzival","review":"Wolfram von Eschenbach gives us a glimpse into the fantasy life of the 12th century noble. His romance of Parzival, based on Chretien de Troyes Arthurian works, is the modern day equivalent of an action movie - the plot is unbelievable but the settings, ideas and characters reveal much about the society for which it was produced.The story tells the tale of how Parsival is born, becomes a knight of the Round Table and ultimately achieves the Grail, which, it turns out, is not Joseph of Arimathea's chalice but is rather a stone. The text does not actually dwell on the description of the Grail, and aside from this oddity, follows the usual myths about the Grail quite closely. And while the Romance is entitled Parzival, he has to share his screen time almost equally with Gawan (Gawaine) who looms large in the book and generally gets all the interesting action.The Romance is often less than romantic. No stodgy Victorian drama this, it revels in violence, dirt and sexual encounters, often much more explicit than later Arthurian writings. Parzival definitely does not fit the \\"my strength is as the strength of ten because my heart is pure\\" knightly mold. One of his first acts is a rape. Gawan, noble knight that he is, basically falls in love with anything that moves including a girl who is little more than a child. Death and destruction are all part of daily life for these guys and it becomes very difficult to tell the difference between tourneys and battles. Wounds are described in detail, including the unfortunate Lord of the Grail's rather private injury.The plot largely concerns itself with tourneys and jousts, although there are definitely some interesting moments. The description of the Grail, the mystical Bed Marvelous (translated as Wonder Bed in this version) and the horrifying appearance of the sorceress Cundrie add some magic to the daily grind of hand-to-hand combat.The Arab world also plays a large role in this novel, revealing a much more complex and enlightened medieval view of Islam than is commonly thought to have existed. Of course, the author seems to think Muslims worship Jupiter but, that aside, several of the main characters are Muslim and they are usually cast in very positive roles. Clearly, being a good knight had little to do with Christianity, and Feirefiz's (Parzival's brother) conversion at the end of the book seems almost an after thought by the author. The author's approach to Christianity is none to orthodox either and Parzival actually denies the existence of God at one point only to be led back to the the truth sometime later by a kindly cleric.This translation of Parzival, originally written in German, leaves something to be desired. It often seems that the translators attempted to leave the German grammar intact. Perhaps they were seeking to leave an impression in English of the convoluted German sentence structure. Indeed, they often leave footnotes indicating that certain phrases were too tortured to translate directly and they have added information to make them more readable. The end result is that the book reads a bit like the King James Bible if you only modernized the vocabulary and left the grammar alone.The book is also published in a rather unusual format, a very narrow paperback, with two unattributed illustrations that seem to have been added at random. It also contains a fairly extensive introduction, an extended set of text notes, a list of persons, and a set of family trees. The packaging seems intended for a general audience with some attention to artistic book headings and \\"Gothic\\" fonts on maps and elsewhere.Overall, the story is fascinating both as a tale and as a way to understand how real knights viewed their ideal role models. The translation is tolerable, if difficult. The lack of an index or bibliography would not make this the best book for a scholar but, for fans of Arthurian legends who have the desire to study the early manuscripts and the persistence to get through them, this is a good read."},{"Title":"Parzival","review":"An ecellent way to meet this kind of literature (I did read it also in the original mediaeval German text), in a more understandeble version!"},{"Title":"Parzival","review":"Wolfram's story of Parzival is the best of all of the &quot;quest for the Grail&quot; legends because it is the most complete and incorporates all of the older elements of a highly derived tale into one wonderfully written work. The Grail scenes are fantastic, mysterious, and captivating. The development of the characters is by far the best of all of the many versions of the tale. The adventures of Parzival are filled with fantastic creatures and outrageous events. When Parzival completes his quest, the reader is left exhausted but satisfied by Wolfram's engaging story. Highly recommended for the student of Arthurian literature or for anyone who wants to know the complete story of the Fisher King and the knight who saves him."},{"Title":"Parzival","review":"There seem to be currently available three complete English translations of Wolfram von Eschenbach's Middle High German \\"Parzival,\\" an early, and slightly eccentric, version of the Grail Quest. Wolfram, both a knight and a (slightly eccentric) poet from thirteenth-century southern Germany, is the author of this long Arthurian romance, of a long Carolingian epic, \\"Willehalm,\\" and some shorter works. His complaints about rival poets, and their replies to him, have turned out to be clues to relative dating of their works. On this and external evidence, Wolfram's poetic career has been dated between about 1195 and 1225; with the almost 25,000 lines of \\"Parzival\\" being composed between about 1200 and 1210.The most recent translation, Cyril Edwards' \\"Parzival: With Titurel and the Love Lyrics,\\" I have not yet seen. It includes a fragmentary related work, and Wolfram's contributions to the \\"Minnesaenger\\" (love poetry) tradition, which makes it attractive. The price of the hardcover is against starting with it! A more reasonably-priced paperback, aimed at the student market, would be a winner, if the translation is good.Of the other two, both rendered in prose, the older is \\"Parzival: A Romance of the Middle Ages\\" (usually cited without the subtitle, in my experience), translated by Helen M. Mustard and Charles E. Passage, and published by Vintage Books (Random House), in 1961. With an Introduction, Additional Notes, an Index of Persons, and a Genealogical Table, I found it an attractive entrance to Wolfram-studies, and Middle High German literature beyond the \\"Nibelungenlied.\\" The language of the translation is relatively colloquial, and has been criticized as both inexact in its use of hunting and heraldic terms, and perhaps too American. A more valid criticism, in my opinion, pointed out that a good deal of the introduction is spent discussing discarded theories floated by Jessie L. Weston (of \\"From Ritual to Romance\\") in connection with her verse translation at the end of the nineteenth century. Since Weston's version was the one most likely to be familiar to Mustard and Passage's original readers, this made a certain amount of sense, but they might have mentioned that her views were no longer taken very seriously. The cover art is a medieval \\"portrait\\" of the armored Wolfram, anonymous under his knightly helmet.Almost twenty years later, A.T. Hatto (on whose review of the Vintage translation I have been drawing) produced his own version, in the Penguin Classics (1980); the cover art uses manuscript illuminations of scenes from the poem. Like Hatto's \\"Nibelungenlied\\" translation, it is in prose, and has, instead of an extended discussion before reading, an appended \\"Introduction to a Second Reading,\\" along with a Glossary of Personal Names, and a List of Works in English for Further Reading. The critical discussion is excellent, and postponing it until a reader has a chance to form an opinion is an interesting idea. At least the student won't be quite so tempted to substitute reading the editorial commentary for a reading of the text, if one has to look for it.Hatto's English is a bit obviously British; and some of his \\"corrected\\" readings are actually more difficult to follow, unless you are already familiar with the technical languages of hunting and blazonry. Otherwise, for example, \\" a pair\\" of birds is going to be clearer than \\"a brace\\" of them. This was not the case with Hatto's translation of the \\"Tristan\\" of Wolfram's rival, Gottfried von Strassburg (also from Penguin). The \\"Tristan\\" tradition makes a great point of how its hero uses the correct -- meaning fashionable -- hunting language, and Hatto was there, obviously, correct to reproduce the impression of mastery of an esoteric art. Either version is enjoyable, although Hatto (obviously) seems a bit more concerned with precision, and Mustard and Passage a little more with immediate appeal to readers.Wolfram himself was translating, in his own fashion, Chretien de Troyes' unfinished \\"Perceval, or, The Story of the Grail\\" -- although he himself claims to have an additional source, the mysterious \\"Kyot,\\" who had a better, truer, version. Since Chretien himself claimed to have been working from a source provided by a patron, this has at times sent scholars searching in many directions. Jessie Weston's theory, emphasizing Wolfram's references to Anjou and the Angevins, whose dynasty of Counts had come to rule England (see Henry II), was as plausible as most, and just as much a blind alley. It looks very much as if Wolfram had some sort of additional material -- there are odd resemblances to \\"Morien,\\" an apparent interpolation in the medieval Dutch translation of the Lancelot-Grail romances, for example -- but mostly to have used his imagination quite freely.We have an entire opening section with the hero's father, Gahmuret the Anschevin, having adventures in a vaguely-conceived Near East and North Africa, where he leaves a \\"pagan\\" wife and son, the latter, the multi-colored Feirefiz, crossing paths with Wolfram's main hero years later. (It is worth noting that, although Wolfram is a snob, and is fascinated by physical differences between human beings, he is in no sense a racist; color is no bar to aristocracy.) This is followed by Gahmuret's second marriage and death, the birth and upbringing in forest isolation of Parzival himself, his fateful encounter with Arthur's knights, and the splitting of the story to include the exploits of Sir Gawain (recognizable under German renderings, variously handled by translators over the years), and Parzival's first adventure at the Grail Castle, all derived from Chretien's account of Perceval and Gauvain, all retold in Wolfram's quirky style. Then Wolfram returns to what seems to be new material, writing his own conclusion. (Eric Rohmer's film version of \\"Perceval\\" is a splendid visualization of Chretien's version, and works almost equally well for parts of Wolfram's retelling, too.)As in other versions, Chretien's very mysterious \\"graal\\" is drawn into a Christian conception of the universe. But Wolfram explains it as a sort of magic stone that fell to earth during the War in Heaven, not a relic of the Last Supper. That more explicitly Christianized version seems to belong to the Old French cycle of \\"Joseph of Arimathea,\\" \\"Merlin\\" and \\"Perceval,\\" attributed to Robert de Boron, and was later picked up and amplified in the \\"Vulgate Cycle\\" of Arthurian romances (centering on Lancelot, and introducing Galahad as the Quest hero, alongside Perceval), the version known in English through Malory, and, so far as the Chalice interpretation, also used by Wagner.Wagner plundered Wolfram for names and a certain \\"German\\" quality for his Grail opera, \\"Parsifal,\\" besides using another version of a story Wolfram alludes to in \\"Lohengrin,' and the poet's name for a character in \\"Tannhauser.\\" Personally, I suggest tossing aside all Wagnerian preconceptions, if any, and allowing Wolfram's real personality to have a chance. Sarcastic (especially about competitors), sentimental (especially about wives and children), full of pride in the knightly caste (a new phenomenon, which its members wanted to be very old), arrogantly announcing that he is completely illiterate in the company of poets who boasted they could read anything ever written, he is both annoying and lovable. A living personality, in fact, appearing in a time used to anonymous authors.For those who find \\"Parzival\\" a pleasure, or who would like to try a more military, rather than chivalric, work, there are also translations of his \\"Willehalm,\\" based on the Old French *chanson de geste* of William Curt-Nose, or Guillaume l'Orange, one of the heroes of the legends of Charlemagne and his descendants. I am familiar with two, both into prose. One, by Marion E. Gibbs and Sidney M. Johnson, was published by Penguin Classics in 1984, and is currently in print, as \\"Wolfram von Eschenbach: Willehalm.\\" Charles E. Passage, one of the co-translators of \\"Parzival,\\" had earlier translated it as \\"The Middle High German Poem of Willehalm by Wolfram von Eschenbach,\\" published by Frederick Ungar in 1977. Although it is out of print, used copies of the trade paperback edition seem to be available.Curiously, the supposedly illiterate Wolfram seems unusually aware of the idea (if not the facts) of history. The \\"Pagan\\" Saracens of his French source are connected by him with the Romans (as descended from the followers of Pompey, rather than of Caesar, and heirs of an old feud), and also with the extra-European characters he had already invented for \\"Parzival.\\" He rather neatly brings into the correct sequence his versions of Arthurian and Carolingian Europe."},{"Title":"Parzival","review":"Well, that's how Joe Campbell describes it, anyway. And, for those who find the language and style one finds in literature like this tolerable, Parzival is rich in symbolism, peppered by it's author's private concerns, and has a convincing account of battle here and there (Von Eschenbach was himself a tried knight at the open of the 13th century-- in fact he not-very-credibly claims to be illiterate.) If you managed Mallory, you owe it to yourself to read something with a little more depth."},{"Title":"Parzival","review":"Hatto gives his usual accurate, precise and elegant English prose rendering of this classic German epic poem of the early 13th century.Wolfram's Parzival is a more coherent and well-structured narrative than the Niebelungenlied, and is more courtly and refined than the Icelandic sagas of the same era. It is a lively, colorful insight into 13th century European culture. This, along with its place in the evolution of the Arthurian and Grail legends, is its main source of interest to modern readers.Wolfram is particularly knowledgeable about military affairs and you can learn a lot from this story about what it was like (or supposed to be like) to be a knight at the time.The Grail of this story is a stone. In Chretien's earlier story, on which Wolfram's is based, the Grail was a bowl. In other stories, it doubles as the cup used by Jesus at the Last Supper and the vessel used to catch the dripping blood at the crucifixion. In our own time it has served as a boon to conspiracy theorists and an excuse to cast Sean Connery in an Indiana Jones movie. Next...well, who knows what's next?Parzival combines folk traditions - the Grail's power of providing unlimited food and drink is a favorite folk motif, most famously with the magic porridge pot - with knightly adventure, and adds a dash of mysticism. It is no more than a dash, and I think subsequent commentators have read too much into this aspect. Certainly it is a coming-of-age story and a tale of redemption, but the spiritual edifice that has since been built around it seems to me a bit of a stretch. At the time of writing this review, youth counselors in Britain are using Parzival as an allegory to teach the true meaning of manhood. Good luck to them.Although Parzival does not have the continuity errors of the Niebelungenlied, individual sentences are sometimes mangled beyond comprehension. Presumably they sounded more acceptable when recited as poetry. Hatto wisely avoids the temptation to tidy these passages up and translates them warts and all.History books can only take us so far in an understanding of a previous age. To get beneath the skin, to understand the anxieties, hopes, prejudices and beliefs of the people who lived then, we must share the stories that they told. In Parzival, we see how medieval man related to his own masculinity, his fellow man, his womenfolk and his god."},{"Title":"Parzival","review":"Note: This review is from the 1961 Vintage paperback with a translation by Helen Mustard and Charles PassageWolfram von Eschenbach's early 13th century poem (rendered here from the Middle High German into modern English prose) chronicles the events of the title character's life from childhood to knighthood, and of his quest for and attainment of the Grail. Along with two chapters devoted to Parzival's father Gahmuret, and several throughout the middle of the story concerning Gawan, the book is a celebration of knighthood, most likely written from the point of view of one of its practitioners. More abstractly, it also approaches Jungian archetype territory and Joseph Campbell's ideas about Hero mythology; wrongs committed in ignorance block Parzival from obtaining the Grail when it is first revealed to him, and only after the quest's hardships have purged him of ignorance and sin is he rewarded with the earthly and spiritual sublimity of achieving his goal.The Grail of this version is interesting in and of itself: Wolfram writes before the object had become wholly associated with either the last supper or Christ's crucifixion, and long before Mallory and Tennyson (or Terry Gilliam) stamped it into the culture's consciousness as a holy cup. Instead, here it is a stone, one that has both life-sustaining properties and the power to dispense enough food to supply the entire contingent of knights and ladies stationed at Munsalvaesche (the castle of the Grail's keeping). The king of this castle, Anfortas, (also known as the Fisher King), is gravely wounded - it is only the Grail that keeps him alive, albeit in excruciating pain. In Munsalvaesche, both king and subjects wait for someone to come who will ask the king the 'healing question' ('What is it that troubles you?'). Parzival, in his youthful ignorance, stumbles upon the castle and is shown the wonders of the Grail, but in order not to appear foolish, keeps his peace instead of asking the question that will bring the king relief. The following morning, he awakes to find his host gone, and as he rides out after him, he discovers that he can no longer find his way back to the castle. For the next four and a half years he wanders, dishonored, searching for the Grail. Only when the Grail calls to him, by virtue of Parzival's name appearing in writing on the stone, does his quest end.There are several different translations of 'Parzival' available, including this one by Mustard and Passage written in 1961. A.T. Hatto translated it forPenguin Classicsin 1980, and in 2009,Oxford World's Classicspublished another version by Cyril Edwards. Using the look inside feature, I compared several paragraphs side by side, and, although I suspect that they all have strengths and weaknesses, if I were forced to pick based on this tiny sample, I would probably go with the Hatto. But, as they are all priced similarly, the Oxford edition has the advantage of including a secondary work, which may make it the best value.Translations aside, the question remains as to whom to recommend this work, aside from medievalists and scholars. Grail researchers will also be interested, but anyone attempting this book should know it not an effortless read - nowhere near as difficult as Chaucer's Canturbury Tales or Beowulf, the translators do still attempt to reproduce Wolfram's style, and all three translations I looked at mimic an older structural and syntactical arrangement. A brief example, as Parzival rides into Munsalvaesche for the first time:'Little gaiety had there been here for many a day; the knights were too sad of heart. Yet they did not let Parzival feel this, and welcomed him, young and old alike. Many pages ran out to seize the bridle of his horse, each one trying to be the first, and held his stirrup for him to dismount. Some knights bade him enter the castle, and led him to his chamber, where they quickly and skillfully removed his armor. When they then looked upon the youth, with his boy's face, still beardless, and saw how beautiful he was, they confessed that he was indeed richly blessed.' (Mustard and Passage)Some readers may find the re-telling of 'Parzival' byLindsay Clarkeeasier on the eye and ear (although there is no 'look inside' to see for sure) - and evenKatherine Paterson'sversion for younger readers may be all the 'Parzival' that anyone really needs. Still, there is an inherent medieval atmosphere in the translations that attempt to replicate the original author's style which is missing in Ms. Patterson's re-telling, although it's difficult to know how much currency that carries with it. I would probably recommend the others over the re-telling simply because it feels more 'authentic' - but these are translations we're talking about, so none of them are really any more authentic than the other.In the end, I found 'Parzival' worthwhile mostly because I appreciate the familiarity with a foundational piece of Western literature, and also because I find it enjoyable to recognize links between modern era literature and its source material. I realize that that is a very narrow recommendation - I did like the book, but I wouldn't have considered it a five-star experience. But, then again, as far as star ratings go, it seems ludicrous to assign a value to a work that has survived over 800 years. My way around it is to give everything over 500 years old an automatic five stars, even if I feel four is a better reflection of how it affected me - so there you have it."},{"Title":"Parzival","review":"Is this the greatest \\"novel\\" ever written? - the most beautifully written insight into the threefold nature of mankind via the Grail journeys of Pazival, Gawain, and Feirefiz."},{"Title":"Parzival","review":"Wolfram von Eschenbach's \\"Parzifal\\" (Penguin Classics) is a must-read for everyone interested in the Medieval Arthurian Grail Romances.With heavy Alchemical and Astronomical symbolism, and hinting at Middle Eastern contribution to Modern Science and the Arthurian legend, this is a great classic that should belong to every bookshelf in the modern world.

But it is also delightful, and in places, an absolute scream. Hilarious & entertaining as well as beautiful. And while I've not read other translations (except to note that one in modern German, of which I have read a passage or two, appears to be somewhat dry), I have read big swaths of a published version of the Middle High German original text. The fact that this is a prose translation takes away from the gloriousness of the tale *not one bit*. If you like a good yarn involving knights, their entourages, their quests, and the unusual characters they meet in their wanderings -- read this translation. Hatto comes to the text with a lovely feel for language. And the story moves.

Another important character is the knight Gawan.The epic is written in forceful, violent and colourful sentences, sometimes worth the surrealistic demoniac paintings of Hieronymus Bosch. It paints the not always heroic or galant deads of the chivalry of the Middle Ages with ordinary brawls, tournaments and other (love) contests. The highlight is the masterful and vivid description of the nearly unsurmountable difficulties for the capture of 'Chastel Merveile' (the Marvellous Castle).This epic is also not what Nietzsche said about Wagner's opera 'Rome without the text', for the author states that 'today very few people want to change earthly wealth for heavenly glory. I do not know one man, or one woman.'This ambitious and impressive work is by any means one of the highlights of world literature."},{"Title":"Beyond the Best Interests of the Child","review":"Length:: 5:58 MinsIn this video, I discuss my concerns about this book.

It's one of those volumes you might buy because the cover looks interesting or the synopsis on the jacket is intriguing -- but once you begin reading, you realise what a gem it is.The story, in brief, centers around 12 swords forged by the olympian god Vulcan to give to mankind for the amusement of the gods. He enlists the aid of a local townsperson (Jord) during their creation and in return gives one of the weapons to him. Jord is killed but his son, Mark, carries on thru a series of adventures revolving around one sword or another.The fascinating part of the book is the swords themselves. Each has a special power, and a special weakness. Each is totally different than any other. This first book touches on only a couple of the artifacts in any detail. Subsequent books tell the stories of the remaining swords.For a good read with a decent amount of adventure and a plot that twists and turns, this book is hard to beat.~P~"},{"Title":"First Book of Swords","review":"On the surface, this appears to be just another fantasy novel - young boy given a magical sword, sets out to seek his fate, blah blah bibbity blah. However, we see depths here, hints of a mysterious past in the world (technology was banished 2000 years ago for a length of time of 49,949 years - what a strange number - does it mean something), tales of other magical swords - which are apparently true, as evil-doers start coming out of the woodwork left and right seeking the boy to steal his magical sword in order to gain its power for their own.While I would like to see deeper character development, or more details on the mysterious past (although, now I see while browsing through other available texts that the past is described in other books - what a pity, I'll have to buy more books, oh, woe is me ... *grins*), at the same time it would likely ruin Saberhagen's forward momentum to slow it down and do so.I think I've discovered a new author to add to my list of \\"favorites\\" and a new list of books (what a HUGE list it is, too!) to add to my \\"want to get these\\" list. I would recommend to those who haven't yet discovered this classic gem of a book to run out and see if you can find a copy.

Hunting game for the family and doing household chores for his mom. He probably didn't expect that one day he would have to leave his house to start life anew. But what is the secret behind his father's sword called Townsaver. And what game are the gods talking about. Now the life around Mark is changing, perhaps faster than he would ever would want or expect.This book is a prime example of a fantasy novel. This book was a joy to read and easy to follow. When the story follows Mark excitement is sure to trail. But Fred Saberhagen kept changing point of view every chapter. The many mysteries are unraveled throughout the story, but once one is, a new one springs from it. This feature makes you never want to put the book down. Fred Saberhagen is great at portraying a medieval setting. But it is odd that when the book refers to the old world it seems like it's referring to modern time.I would recommend this book to anybody but anyone into fantasy will love this book. This is a great read I can't wait to finish."},{"Title":"First Book of Swords","review":"The Book of Swords series was one of the first series I read and is still one of my favorites, even after ten years and countless other literary adventures. Once you start this series, you'll find yourself living through the characters, first hoping they survive, then hoping they prosper. The Gods' role in the making of the swords, giving them to humanity, then, like a greedy child, wanting them back for themselves, imposes human qualities on them and makes their exsistance in that world much more believable while creating the background for the series. I found this to be one of the best tales of MAN VS. GODS I've ever read. Thanks Fred."},{"Title":"First Book of Swords","review":"I found this book to be a very interesting experience. It is in no way typical. One trait I found fascinating about the plot is that there is no knight in shining armor. The main character happens to be a boy. I guess, while this gives me a break from everyday form-fantasy, I did gape incredulously at his strong resolve. It just seems out of character, to me, to a young person. I have never seen a human that age with such a terrible purpose. But all-in-all this is a very believable, entertaining story line."},{"Title":"First Book of Swords","review":"This is a good beginning to this series - there were a few twists and turns that were enjoyable and overall, this is a good read for me - enough that I will continue the series at this point."},{"Title":"First Book of Swords","review":"The First Book of Swords is simple, but I loved it! Swords with special powers and kingdoms at war are not the most unique things in the world, but interesting characters, gods, and a fast paced plot push this book into greatness. I admit, the story was slow to start for me. The prologue was boring, and the main character walking around made me skip sections, but that was only a small part of the book, and I'm glad I stuck through it. I couldn't wait to find out what happens to the swords and the characters, and since it's only the first part of a trilogy I was even more happy. But, I have to say, I really expected more. If there were only a few more things this book would have been five stars. I would have liked to have seen more of the 12 magical swords, instead of just four. I thought there would be a big event with all of the swords coming together. I thought different people from around the world would come together in a big way, but that didn't happen. This novel also has a definite conclusion, and the second book does not pick up the plot at all. I really want to read about the people who own these swords and what they can do, instead I have to settle for a 200 page book revolving around a few characters making a trip. A few hundred more pages added to the end would have been nice instead of an unrelated second book. Oh well, this book by itself is fun, exciting, and entertaining, and I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"First Book of Swords","review":"I may have made a tactical error, beginning this first volume of a trilogy before I had the second and third volumes in hand and standing by. Saberhagen is an old-school writer, best known for his \\"Berserker\\" series (which was also the model for Star Trek's Borg). This is straight sword-and-sorcery, but not really in the classic, Tolkien-esque mold. Saberhagen has the knack of combining fancy and fact in a way that's foreign to \\"high fantasy.\\" It's 50,000 years in the future, after the end of our present technological age -- 2,000 years in the future even of Saberhagen's \\"Empire\\" series, upon which this present trilogy builds. And society is more or less medieval again. Barons and knights and dukes run things, with millers and blacksmiths and yeoman farmers occupying the lower rungs of society. But there's also sorcery and mythological beasts, the most powerful of which are dragons of many and diverse species. Most important, though, is the return of the gods -- or that's how they represent themselves, anyway. And the gods are engaged in playing a game (a motif Saberhagen often invokes). Young Mark is the focus of the narrative, the second son of a blacksmith who lost an arm to Vulcan while helping in the manufacture of twelve swords of power, each of them with a different profile or personality. The sword Mark's father was given in payment for his arm has come down to Mark, who now finds himself on the run from the forces of Duke Fraktin, who wants to obtain as many of the swords for himself as possible. He becomes involved with Nestor, an ex-knight turned dragon-hunter, who possesses another of the swords and is also of interest to the duke. Balancing the Bad Guys in this power struggle is Good Sir Andrew, a do-gooderish sort who also provides a bit of comic relief. Saberhagen's narrative style is straightforward and unadorned, letting the story tell itself, and it works. If you've read a lot of fantasy and semi-fantasy in its various forms, you'll be interested in seeing how he sets up the story within the real-world constraints he has set himself. I would have made some different choices, though. Vulcan, for instance, belongs to the Roman pantheon, but most of the society in this future world seems to be northern European in origin; I would have depicted the smith god as Wayland, for consistency. (But perhaps there are unmentioned reasons for all that, since parts of this novel are derived from earlier books and series I haven't read.) It's also strange to hear distances by wagon and the length of a sword blade described in metric measurements. But that's carping, and the story, which ends here with Mark in possession of two of the swords and escaping the destruction of Sir Andrew's castle, is well worth reading as he and his companions move off into the next stage of their adventure. Now if I can only find those other two volumes."},{"Title":"First Book of Swords","review":"AS BEST DAMN SERIES I HAVE EVER READ BUT DONT BUY THE INDIVIDUAL BOOKS OF THE FIRST SET BUY THE COMPLETE BOOK OF SWORDS.

He edits 15 chapters (in 302 paperback pages) from today's Christian thinkers on subjects ranging from Universal Grace, to Existential Freedom, to Predestination and Assurance.The various chapters bring clearer understanding to Wesley, Calvin, Luther and Arminius. Written for the seasoned Christian this book will also be interesting to the faith novice.The book is very well sourced. Each chapter concludes with extensive endnotes. Pinnock also provides three indexes for: persons, subjects and Scripture references. These make the book very useable and a quick reference.The ideas of \\"God's conditioned foreknowledge\\" (page 107), God's \\"middle knowledge\\" (page 147), and the \\"compatibilist doctrine of freedom\\" (page 282) will be sure to raise the eyebrows, if not the genuine ire, of postmodernists. The first 180 pages proffer a good and substantive reading in contemporary Protestant theology. The remaining pages offer a additional thinking on themes such as salvation, sin, freedom, grace, and election.In a nutshell, read Pinnock to learn what some of today's Protestants are saying about age-old doctrines and theologies. These 15 writers make the case that Christian Arminianism has a voice in the present.All students of theology should read this book.

Some chapters are a bit deep, but you can get similar ideas from the authors of the other chapters (most of whom wrote concisely and simply). What a great collection of non-Calvinist scholars!Cottrell really helped me understand the biblical nature of sovereignty. He deals directly with the idea that faith is NOT a work. Calvinists claim that Arminians work for that salvation because believing/faith is a work. This is just not biblical.John Sanders makes the God of the Bible a personal God. He thinks, creates, plans, anticipates, remembers, responds, punishes, warns, forgives. All of these biblical examples (not from a systematic theology) confront the \\"immutable\\", impersonal God of Calvin, who only acts and never reacts. Do they read the Old Testament?Read the Bible. Simply and without systematic presuppositions. You will not find Calvin's limited atonement.

He is attracted to P. Hanson's attempts to reconstruct a social matrix that explains the 'dawn of apocalyptic' in terms of alternate visions of what post-exilic life should be, and to arguments from background materials in Canaanite mythology and parallels in the Oracles Against the Nations and enthronement psalms. Millar proposes a new look at these matters and at issues of the passage's structure.A second chapter ('The text and prosody of Isaiah 24-27) attempts an analysis of the poetic style of chs 24-27, then makes a comparison with Isaiah 51.9-11 and Ugaritic Text 5.1.1-5. Millar finds close parallels between Isaiah 24-27 and both comparison texts, though he believes the similarities to the Deutero-Isaiah text are more compelling.A substantial third chapter ('The Structure of Isaiah 24-27', pp. 65-102) argues that the Isaiah Apocalypse shares four themes with Canaanite myth as this can be documented from the Ugarit material in the early 1970s: threat, war, victory, and feast. The persistence of these motifs in the biblical material, argues Millar, justifies the assumption of an institutional-cultic matrix that renewed them regularly. The best explanation is found not in the reconstruction of an unknown feast, but rather in the feast of tabernacles, viewed as an annual New Year's feast. Here Millar cites Mowinckel's well-known theory of an institutional setting of the psalms, critiquing in a measured aside Westermann's consideration the 'Sitz im Leben in life' precludes such an institutional setting for the Psalms.Two significant moves round out the chapter. First, the author reconstructs a hypothetical celebration in which these themes-recognizable in Bible and Ugarit-might have been reenacted on an annual basis. Then, he elaborates his view of a reuse of these themes by Second Isaiah after the exile had de-institutionalized them.A final chapter ('Isaiah 24-27 and the Origin of Apocalyptic', 103-120) seats the apocalypse in Second Isaiah circles ('a close disciple of Second Isaiah') based on considerations of prosody. This writer utilizes materials already in circulation to elevate the confrontation of historical enemies that is found in the OAN to a new level of Yahweh-confrontation of powers that are now described in the language of myth:'In the eyes of Second Isaiah, Yahweh was moving against elements of the created order. And yet, faithful to the prophetic stance, he was not falling back into the perspective of nature mythology. History was being periodized (Is. 42:19). Yahweh's destruction of creation was not a return to the beginning . He was ushering in a new age ... It was this radical openness toward the future which preserved both Second Isaiah and apocalyptic from the cyclical character of nature myth. Myth was turned to the service of history.'The 'recrudescence of myth' occurs under the influence of Second Isaiah as the writer of the apocalypse applies the ancient Holy War tradition of the song of deliverance to Zion's imminent deliverance from the inconcinnities of history. The singing/shouting of the apocalypse corresponds to the \`new song' of Second Isaiah; both herald the dawning of a new age.It is a pity that Millar's work has gone out of print, for the fourth chapter is one of the clearest statements of the birth of apocalyptic in the exilic period that is available. Millar does not go as far as P. Hanson in discerning the parties engaged in intramural squabbles during the period in question. Though I honor Hanson's courage in pushing the evidence the farthest conclusions it can be made to support, my tastes run more in Millar-ian directions. I find his general reconstruction of the Isaiah Apocalypse as a history-defying and regenerative statement from out of Jerusalem's ashes attractive and compelling."},{"Title":"Blacks and Social Justice","review":"Bernard Boxill is a Professor of Philosophy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In addition to this book (1984; revised edition 1992), he has also editedRace and Racism (Oxford Readings in Philosophy).In the Introduction, boxill states, \\"The first aim of this book is to rebut or defuse these and other charges being leveled against the color-conscious policies that have been threatened by Ronald Reagan's administration.\\" In the chapter, \\"The Color-Blind Principle,\\" he states that \\"My object in this chapter is to demonstrate that the color-blind principle, which considers all color-conscious policies to be invalid, is mistaken.\\"In his illuminating chapter, \\"Black Progress and the Free Market,\\" he criticizes black economists Thomas Sowell and Walter Williams (who have minimized the effect of discrimination, on the grounds that employers in a free market would have economic incentives to not discriminate), by stating, \\"An employer may decide that he had better not hire blacks, even if he neither dislikes them nor believes them to be incompetent, because he perceives that the public would rather not be served by blacks, either because IT dislikes them (pure discrimination) or thinks them incompetent (perceptual discrimination).... for, just as there are situations in which the free market makes it costly to discriminate, in the situation cited the free market makes it costly not to discriminate.\\"In his chapter \\"Marxism, Justice, and Black Progress he writes, \\"I am defending color-conscious policies in this book, both on the grounds that they are just and on the grounds that they are to the advantage of blacks.\\"In his chapter on \\"Separation or Assimilation?\\" he writes, \\"I am proud that St. Augustine was a black man, but I am sure that my culture is not his, and I am not less proud---for I do not really care---that his The Holy City shows no traces of Negritude.\\"This is a tightly-argued, very illuminating book that will be essential reading for anyone interested in Black/Africana philosophy."},{"Title":"God's Library: A Catholic Introduction to the World's Greatest Book","review":"I have recommend use of the God's Library to a number of groups looking for Bible Study and great dialogue around Scripture.

He is an engaging and inviting writer with that knack of making forbidding things attractive and palatable. Yet this no diluted Bible-made-easy book. 'God's Library' is grounded in the best insights of scholars about the historical character of Scripture, and in a depth understanding of its treasures for the life of faith. I used it in ministry with adults who were trying to get into the Bible for the first time; they confirmed my judgment about its excellence and accessibility. Now as part of the Theology Department at a Catholic university in the Pacific Northwest, I teach undergraduates who for the most part have read little and know less about the Bible. For the next semester I have ordered the new edition of 'God's Library' as a supplemental text, requiring it for those without previous exposure to the Bible, and recommending it to the rest.

For example, he seems to only have a vague recollection of a lot of the movies. Because, a lot of reviews get the stories completely wrong. (HELP's plot is not about the Beatles looking for Ringo's magic ring. Everybody knows that!)Some actors are credited with the wrong roles. Also, there are many glaring spelling errors and a slight continuity problem: A title will say \\"see altertnate title\\", and that title and review would not be in the book!

It contains some introductory material to help people understand what images are and how to process them.

It contains material from 100 different professionals on 50 different topics.The style is academic. The editor is the editor of the IEEE Transactions on Image Processing. The page style is similar to what you would see in an IEEE Transaction.There is plenty of math. The text explains the mathematics, but not to the depth I would like to see.The authors illustrate the techniques with many images. If there are no &quot;before and after&quot; images in an image processing book, reject it. Well, this book has plenty of images. That is a strong point.A week point is there is no source code illustrating the techniques and algorithms. I find this a major weakness, but one that is not unique to this book.The authors leave much to the reader. This is not a read from cover to cover book. The reader must go slow, take notes, study, and read again to understand the material.All in all, this is a good source of knowledge on image processing.

If you are not comfortable with that style of exposition, or if you are simply trying to find a snippet of code to implement a particular algorithm, this is not the book for you. At the other extreme, do not expect to find new and startling insights into the field that you did your dissertation on.

Though Why Ask My Name is a scholarly and carefully annotated book, based on close reading of the Hebrew text, it is never pedantic and is fun to read.

Once you understand the importance of efficient running mechanics, both for injury prevention and enhanced performance (well presented by several of the authors), you are prepared to include the activities that lead to the neuromuscular coordination that good form requires: core-strength; running-specific strength; balance; and dynamic flexibility through the full running range of motion. You are willing to learn as much as you can about fueling your body, allowing it ro recover from training and racing, and maintaining it should injury or illness strike.Run Strong covers all of these essentials, and does so in manner easily accessible to the non-scientist. It includes a generous supply of photos illustrating key strength and stretch moves, tables summarizing recommendations, and sidebars adding interesting highlights. The editor has done a good job of cross-referencing chapters when the authors mention areas covered in another chapter. And yet the chapters can stand alone, so that the busy runner/reader can pick one topic here, another there, and come away with useful suggestions to be tried in the next workout or program design.As a long-time coach, I have many how-to running books on my shelves, not to mention all the running fiction, biographies, autobiographies and combinations thereof. Run Strong will definitely find a place on the shelf nearest my workplace."},{"Title":"Run Strong","review":"This is not a traditional training book like Daniels or Coe and Martin, nor is it one of the scores of \\"Explain Everything About Running to the Beginner\\" books out there. Instead, it focuses on the aspects of training with which even experienced runners may be unfamiliar. For example, it discusses lifting weights, stretching, dietary concerns, etc. in addition to topics directly related to running such as peaking for a race, improving leg speed, addressing long-term aerobic development, multi-pace training, etc.This is a valuable book because even if you know a lot about running, you will probably find something new in here. Keep in mind what many of the authors say must be taken with a grain of salt. The jury is still out on whether lower-body exercises and form drills will make you a better distance runner, for example. If you tried to do all the supplementary training discussed in this book, you would probably be working out three hours a day at least. You'll have to try different things and decide for yourself if they are helping your running or just wasting your time and energy. But hey, if you're like most serious runners, you're willing to try almost anything if it will keep you healthy and make you faster.

There are 5-6 websites listed, again with no guidance.The editors obviously solicited articles from a wide range of practioners and published (in realtively unedited form) the 12 best, covering what they believed were the most current subjects in distance running.

In her case, she was the first woman to achieve this status and she ran up a total of 7 - 2 Oscars (\\"Airport\\", \\"The Sin of Madelon Claudet\\"), 2 Tonys (\\"Happy Birthday\\", \\"Joan of Lorraine\\"), 1 Special Tony Award, and 1 each for an Emmy (\\"Harriet Beecher Stowe\\") and a Grammy. Her life was more devoted to the stage, and hence most readers will not have seen this work, but she managed 50+ performances on TV and 20+ films. My favorite Hayes performance was from \\"Anastasia\\" (1956).\\"My Life in 3 Acts\\" is the third of Hayes' recollections and was published just 2 years before her death. It is a fairly superficial account of her personal life and a mere accounting of her stage and film appearances. There is little depth and no appendix with a list of her performances, as so many of these celebrity biographies contain. On the positive side, the book is well written and makes for an easy read.Here are a few of Hayes' comments about her collaborators over the years -* John Barrymore - \\"America's great actor [had ] a tempestuous personality\\"* Ethel Barrymore - \\"an actress of great beauty, dignity, and warmth\\"* Joan Crawford - \\"a vulnerable insecure woman behind the tough mask...not quite rational in her raising of children.\\"* Lewis Stone - \\"a fine actor\\"* John Ford - \\"as celebrated for the extraordinary number of great films he turned out as he was notorious for his drinking.\\"* Marion Davies - \\"warm, effervescent, and very generous...a gifted comedienne at her best in light romantic comedies\\"* Charlies Chaplin - \\"an incomparable comedian on screen, he as funny in real life [but] could be an awful bore\\"* Frank Borzage - \\"had a wonderful for intimacy: he knew how to get inside an actor's heart and mind, and that rapport gives a special glow to his films.\\"* Louella Parsons & Hedda Hopper - \\"these two women were tough, mean monarchs, reigning over the movie colony with their viper tongues.\\"* Booth Tarkington - \\"a likable, unusual man. He used to drink a lot but got control of his habit before it destroyed his health and writing career.\\"* Clifford Odets - \\"the most appalling guest, a crashing bore\\"* F. Scott Fitzgerald - \\"used alcohol as a stimulus until it became a stumbling block.\\"* Anatole Litvak - \\"a tough taskmaster, though he did turn out good films.\\"* Lee Strasberg - \\"one of the founders of the Actors Studio, which I blame for many of the things wrong with the American theatre then and now.\\"* Richard Burton - \\"cared only for himself...he felt deficient because of his blemished skin.\\"* Kim Stanley - \\"was gifted and she drove herself mercilessly to discover \`the dramatic truth' of whatever character she portrayed.\\"* Maurice Evans - \\"Almost singlehandedly he made Shakespeare popular with the American public.\\"* Dean Martin - \\"was a dedicated professional.\\"In summary, this is a well written easy to read book, but it is relatively superficial with regard to Hayes' personal and professional life."},{"Title":"Helen Hayes: My Life in Three Acts","review":"For more than fifty years, Helen Hayes has been a star on stage, screen, and television. In that time, she crossed paths with some of Broadway's most famous stars: Charlie Chaplin, Scott Fitzgerald, Gloria Swanson, and many more. As for being acclaimed First Lady of the American Theater, Hayes starred in her first play when she was just six years old. My Life In Three Acts tells about Hayes's hit play, such as Victoria Reigna, and about some of her not so respected plays. In her autobiography, Hayes speaks with wit and wisdom on topics that are both public and private. She expresses her thoughts on World War Two, and about the assassination of Kennedy. She reflects on the mournful parts of her life: the death of her husband and daughter, and the alcoholism of those dear to her. Hayes also supplies amusing anecdotes about her friends, which include John Ford and Al Capone. After finishing her career as an actress, Hayes expresses her opinion on what is wrong with the American theater today, such as how porn theaters are taking over classic Broadway theaters.I found My Life In Three Acts to be inspiring by how Hayes improved her life everyday. Throughout Hayes's career, her life was rousing in every aspect. \\"George Tyler, (a movie producer,) once told me that I were only four inches taller, I could reach the heights too.\\" I liked this quote because I could tell that throughout Hayes' acting days, she was growing by exceeding heights and overcoming problems. Such as after a horrific event occurs in her family, Hayes finds a way to deal with the problem by taking sympathy from others, moving homes, and doing what she does best; act. Hayes was able to capture her emotions and to put them into words that made me feel like I was engaged in the experiences as well. For example, she wrote about a delightful childhood treat of hers that her grandmother used to prepare for her. \\"She would cut a hole in the orange, insert a peppermint stick, and then we'd squeeze the orange and suck the juice through the stick.\\" I felt as if I was enjoying the treat myself.The events Hayes encountered were very detailed and made My Life In Three Acts exciting. Some of my favorite parts of the book describe the stirring parties Hayes attended. \\"The people who sat around that table in the Algonquin Hotel's Rose Room set the style for New York, dictating what one should read, think, wear, eat, what plays to see, what opinions to have, and so on.\\" Not only did this quotation capture \`the style for New York,' but it also described the style of the kind of people that were at the parties and in Hayes's life. I thought that it was also exciting to hear about the different places Helen toured through throughout her career, from France to Oklahoma City. One time while touring, Hayes got ready for bed on the train and saw a breathtaking site; the stars in the night sky seemed close enough to touch, and the snow sparkled like diamonds. Hayes then rushed to tell the rest of the actors on the train, and they became enthralled too. This scene in the book demonstrated all of the simple things in Hayes's life that she appreciated and didn't take for granted. Everyday there seemed to be excitement in Hayes's life. Because of how inspired and excited I felt reading this book, I can defiantly call it an engrossing memoir that is able to take a reader back to stimulating theater life in the mid-1900's."},{"Title":"Helen Hayes: My Life in Three Acts","review":"Helen Hayes whose life story would be fascinating to all fans of Broadway and/or Hollywood pretty much squanders this effort by traducing a large assortment of individuals. What makes this badmouthing all the more unpleasant is the fact that most of her targets were deceased at the time of its publication and unable to present their side of the story.While the recurring instances of charcter assasination are the book's biggest liability, the First Lady of the American Theater also comes off as somewhat self-centered and shallow.Those who respect the many noble actions which typified Helen Hayes' final decades will be disappointed and likely disturbed by this autobiography that does not do her memory justice."},{"Title":"Low Carb Sinfully Delicious Desserts: More Than 100 Recipes for Cakes, Cookies, Ice Creams, and Other Mouthwatering Sweets","review":"This new book is more professionally done than his previous book, but many of the recipies are duplicates from the original book.

Hope this helps you decide whether you want this particular Biggles book or not. For myself, I classify pretty much all the WW1 Biggles stories as 5 star as these are by far the most authentic and well written, the WW2 stories as 4 star and the remaining non-WW1/WW2 Biggles adventures as either 4 star or 3 star depending on the story. Hope it helps.First Published in July 1943 - 185 pagesBiggles is asked to take 666 squadron to Borneo to fight against the Japanese from a secret airfield. Captain Rex Larrymore had discovered the airfield prior to the start of the war when he had to make a forced landing in Borneo. Larrymore has befriended the local natives, dangerous headhunters, and had set up as a prospector with a good supply of fuel and oil on this airfield, which he had named \\"Lucky Strike\\". The base is used to good effect for initial attacks on the Japanese. Our heroes are also able to rescue three men, Jackson, Gray and Flannagan who have escaped from Cotabato on the island of Mindanao. They have tales to tell of the brutality of the Japanese commandant there, a man called Yashnowada. While flying as rear gunner for Algy in a Beaufighter aircraft, Ginger finds that a deadly Krait snake has got on board the aircraft. Algy makes an emergency landing but his plane is wrecked and the Japanese capture both Algy and Ginger.They are transported by submarine to Cotabato. Biggles is soon on their trail and with the help of Suba, the chief of the headhunters they capture a Japanese soldier to find out more information. Launching an air attack and dropping escape equipment to Ginger and Algy, Biggles and his squadron succeed in not only freeing Ginger and Algy but also approximately 40 other prisoners from Cotabato. Soon after, the Japanese discover Biggles' secret airfield and make plans to attack it. One of the escaped prisoners is a Chinaman called Fee Wong. He has information about a convoy of 100 Japanese barges loaded with rubber and Biggles is asked to destroy them. Biggles sets off with Algy, Ginger and Fee Wong, in a Cayman flying boat with just enough petrol to get to Sarawak, where they are located, and back. However, the monsoon arrives early and the weather conditions call for the use of so much petrol that the machine is unable to return without refuelling.Landing at the saw mills of Telapur on Sarawak, Fee Wong makes contact with his brother and by making use of the monsoon flooded river and the bravery of a Malay called Kayan, Biggles is able to destroy the barges. With the flying boat caught up in the flooded river, Biggles and Ginger find themselves separated from Algy and Fee Wong. Biggles uses a surviving barge to get himself and Ginger back to Algy and the plane. By using a captured Japanese uniform, Ginger lures a Japanese flying boat down allowing Biggles to steal the aviation fuel. Returning to \\"Lucky Strike\\" airfield, our heroes find the Japanese in all out attack, with wave after wave of bombings and more troops trying to force their way through the jungle to the airfield. Repairs are made to the runway and Ginger is forced to fly their Liberator supply plane away towards Australia to avoid it being destroyed in the next attack. Ginger finds an Australian aircraft carrier and is able to return with a squadron of Fairey Fulmars to fight off the Japanese bombers. Suba and his headhunters deal with the attacking ground force and they return with Yashnowada's head on a spear. With their airfield safe, Biggles hands over to the Royal Australian Air Force.The dust jacket depicts the headhunters as a plane flies overhead."},{"Title":"Great big beautiful doll: Everything for the body and soul of the larger woman","review":"2/25/02 The book will not support the notion that \\"lean is mean'(however hard it tries to) nor that a fat woman should feel complimented when \\"the taxi driver\\" says he wishes his wife were as 'jolly' as the 'stouter versions' who ride in his cab are...but it will support the proof that Ms Reichman 'looks thinner' than she said she was(many good photographs with hats that suit her well), and that she has authored a book that was pleasant reading with several pages devoted to itemized beauty tips!"},{"Title":"Gift of Change","review":"A great fast, fun read. It takes me back to the &quot;classic&quot; si-fi from the fifty's. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Gift of Change","review":"I received a copy of this book from the author, and I'm glad I did. It was a fun and fast-paced space opera with interesting characters and a highly developed world.I, like other readers, read this book very quickly, I did take time off to sleep, but otherwise I read it almost non-stop from beginning to end. After a bit of confusion at the beginning I found the characters appealing and I wanted to know more when it ended. In fact, I think my biggest regret was that the book ended, and there doesn't appear to be a sequel.Read my full review:[...]"},{"Title":"Gift of Change","review":"Some time has passed since I first read this book, enough time to mull over the content and remind myself that I don't know jack daniels, which I think is an important part of the reviewing process especially if it is an area of media which one has not professionally engaged in oneself - it ensures the swirl of initial kneejerk opinions can settle down and form something coherent, which is not something that can be said for the inner workings of our protagonist's brain when the first chapter opens. I am not a professional writer. Our hero is not good at not being crazy. There is sympathy here. So please also sympathize with me, as this is my first formal review, and I'm reviewing someone's first formal book. But I digress.As you might have noticed me mentioning, the main character is crazy, and this is where we find him when we drop in on what is apparently an average space wayfarer's morning, with the ship preparing to explode and a psychic alien thingummy in the cargo bay. The protagonist is also drunk, and things are just sort of happening left and right and setting on fire and blooping at him. By the time he gets his head un-wedged from his nethers the alien is dead and seems to have done something to his brain - he can think straight now, but he also seems to be able to read minds and other creepy Carrie-esque things. From here his smart aleck computer AI and sassy redheaded copilot realize they finally get a break with this mumbling drunk and they set about rocking across the universe, half as part of their freelance work an half because our hero would really like to know why everyone in space seems to want him dead, and what he can do to avoid dying.It's a good old fashioned \\"Firefly\\" style rogue's story which appropriately ends with a massive deep space firefight, and possibly therein lies my initial hang up which in itself speaks more of my obsession with routine than anything. See, I grew up with Star Treck, Farscape, Red Dwarf, Rogue Galaxy (a video game of the same narrative ilk), and some old Nickelodeon show about a bunch of alien teens on a spaceship and one of them had an invisible friend from another dimension or some bloody thing, so I tend to anticipate a certain formula: we meet the crew, there is distrust, a mystery is hinted at and then we are lightly teased by said mystery whilst the cast goes on several unrelated hijinks on other planets (mostly) for filler and (less so) for character building until finally, space battle. This is great for a TV series, but not necessarily for what was intended with this story. The author is very keen on showing you nothing but what is important to whatever is going on at the time - other adventures are hinted at, what's going on in the minds of the people we're following is hinted at, but it is very much a moment by moment little tale that lets you be a voyeuristic fly on the wall for this very specific point in the characters' lives. This keeps the narrative on a clear path and all the fat cutting does wonders for length, which if you've ever seen a sci-fi/fantasy novel bending the middle of the shelf in a library for lack of proper peer editing to chop out some of the unnecessary \\"side questing,\\" you'll know this is very much a good thing.However, it does make the story come off as jarringly brief, and I didn't feel like I got as much time to get to know the universe and the people in it as I would've liked before horrible things were being done to them and suddenly exit left, pursued by sexy space battle. There were also a few plot points that, at the time of their establishment, seemed like they should've garnered more attention than they ultimately received, for example: the psychic alien that keeps Obi-Waning the poor protagonist and attempting to exposition at him JUST when things are starting to blow up doesn't appear to receive much explanation as to why it's doing what it's doing, and a scenario involving possible psychic date rape that the woman involved kind of shrugs off, indicating it might've been consensual after all but we don't know because it never gets mentioned again. These are nitpicks since this seems to be the setup for a longer series of books, hence my hesitancy to claim that these things were done in error as the author will most likely come back to them later. Taken as a standalone story however, the dangling plot threads rankled a bit.That being said, it's a brilliant start - I do really want to know more. I want to know more about the captain before he was drunk and crazy so I can truly understand the bittersweet joy his crewmates seem to feel at his sudden cognizance. I want to know more about the adventures they went on that inspired such loyalty in the face of all those mental, emotional and physical pitfalls that were our first introduction to the man we know today. I want to know why that psychic alien ghost is such an interruptive tool and what his meddling means for their future. I have a sickness, and the only cure is more sexy space battle."},{"Title":"Gift of Change","review":"\\"Gift of Change\\" is Science Fiction with a light hearted mood. The main character, J, is retired military and a genious engineer. J and his partner, lady pilot F, run an independent space ship freighter. As the book opens, J is an incompetant alcoholic with spurts of genious; but a dying alien reveals that these problems were all artificially imposed by someone when he left the military -- and that this someone has sent a military ship out to kill him & make it look like an accident.This book is light hearted and cheerful, fast paced and full of surprises. Very quickly, J recovers his wits, and his spurts of genious are well portrayed. There is little character development and no drama whatsoever; instead, expect alien ruins, a funny talking ship, and light hearted adventures.This small press publication has a few missing or misplaced commas.

One of Christian's themes is that the world has not been winning against poverty - neither on the secular level, nor through the Church. While many inroads have been made, nevertheless there has been widespread regression as a whole. He casts his net wide in describing ways in which humanity - both secular society and Christ's Church - has sought to remedy the problem of poverty. One wonders whether any options remain to be considered.Throughout the book, Christian builds the argument that poverty essentially has to do with power - the \\"power that keeps the poor powerless\\". However, he does not adopt any of the major theories of \\"power creation\\". Rather, he holds that the non-poor \\"seek to play god in the lives of the poor\\", to form what he refers to as \\"god-complexes\\", thereby systematically excluding the poor from access to education, wealth, and benefits from the system. These complexes are not merely \\"inner spiritualities\\", but \\"principalities and powers [...] considered personal beings that have dominating influence on persons, social organizations and groups, and structures\\".It is through his focus on principalities and powers as \\"personal beings\\" that Christian seeks to integrate evangelism and social action. The mission of the Church is to confront principalities and powers in all their multifarious activities, whether it be to blind the minds of those who do not believe, or to oppress those who are in poverty. This having been said, however, we are only human, and these are principalities and powers. This means \\"humble acceptance of our natural powerlessness\\", and \\"dependence on God\\". It is WE who are the empty-handed. We would do well to note, he writes, that many situations which Christians confront today are not merely \\"rooted in the Fall of humans\\", but are \\"a result of the present working of the Evil One\\", and need to be dealt with as such.This book deserves attention, at the very least to gain an insight into major poverty assumptions and historical responses to the poor. Particularly useful and insightful is Christian's treatment of evangelical Christianity as he traces major developments over the past forty years. For any Christian wishing to understand the \\"big picture\\" with regard to global poverty, this is the book. It is a tour de force."},{"Title":"God of the Empty-Handed: Poverty, Power & the Kingdom of God","review":"For the past 19 years, I have been mobilizing students to serve the Poor. As I read this book I was challenged to understand several keys to ministry among the poor. I'm convinced these key principles are important for most church ministries. That is why I recommend this book to you.Key #1: Knowing Who Are the Poor.Jesus said: \\"The poor will always be with you\\". Jayakumar Christian says that the Poor are caught in a web of relationships. Robert Chambers writes, \\"poverty is entanglement\\". That is to say, they are caught in a web of systems; they have a lack of power, materials, choices, relationships, and influence. Donald McGavran contends that the Poor are exempt from experiencing transformation until they have all been saved: \\"The only place large social action is possible is in countries where the majority of the population are members of Christ's Church.\\" (p. 78) Most missionary agencies today take this perspective into their ministry approaches. What do you think? Is poverty caused by sin? Is it the sin of others? Is poverty caused by the sin of the Poor? At what point are the Poor set free from the cycle of poverty? The Poor are living on bare subsistence; no savings, no investments, no opportunity for technological improvements, and therefore no income increase. The Poor are set free when they gain understanding of their identity in God and discover their calling in God.Key #2: Kingdom View of the Poor.Ministries of the church, whether intentional or not, reflect the church's view of the poor and the nature of poverty. Too often our outreach unintentionally communicates: \\"We are complete, you are not.\\" The goal of outreach should be to recover the identity of the poor in relation to God's creative design and purpose. If our outreach emphasizes the discovery of vocation, for the Christian participant and for the community in which they minister, we will fulfill the commission to preach the good news to the poor. We will set free the poor to enjoy just and peaceful relationships. The way we can reach these goals is by demonstrating a servant heart, the nature of our servant King Jesus. In our outreach to the Poor we must present community demonstrating the biblical story in our relationships. Our outreach can portray the character of God his callings. God is healer, communicator, builder, author, creator, artist, counselor, teacher, etc. Outreach should necessitate a community of servants that represent the character of God and the holistic and interrelated spheres of His ministry.Key #3: Power from the Throne of God.The Poor are powerless in many respects. The Poor are denied access; they are held in powerlessness because of broken relationships. Principalities and Powers, rulers of darkness, lock them out and keep them in the cycle of poverty. Relationship is the key dynamic of the throne of God. The Poor need to be connected in relationship with God and his world. Sin separates us; relationships of all kinds suffer due to sin. The poor are no different from anyone; they need to be connected to others. The connection with others should not be primarily for the sake of provision; providing food, shelter and medicines has often been used as a means of control. The poor need to be connected with the broader community where they have been restricted from access. A kingdom based response to poverty will reverse the \\"process of dis-empowerment\\", \\"confront god-complexes\\" (of the Poor and the non-poor), heal bodies and relationships, teach and model a more adequate worldview, challenge the principalities and powers of darkness (including institutions that are instruments of those powers), establish \\"truth and righteousness\\", and proclaim that \\"all power belongs to God.\\" Poverty, ultimately, is the poverty of \\"being\\" and of \\"purpose\\". Conversely, abundant life is the abundance of \\"being\\" and \\"purpose\\". It is from the vantage point of the throne of God that an individual and a people may find their God-given identity and vocation conferring the essential being and purpose.Key #4: Defend the Image of God in the Poor.The Church is called to define and defend the image of God in the Poor. The Poor are not lazy or stupid. Jayakumar Christian writes, \\"A people so close to the edge cannot afford laziness or stupidity. They have to work and work hard. Most of the lazy and stupid are dead.\\" Outreach should intentionally celebrate and enhance life without limiting access to love, justice, or peace. We should minister among the poor addressing the cultural, social, spiritual, personal, and biological spheres of the community. Through our outreach, we can intentionally affect the whole system of poverty by restoring relationships, including relationship with God (religion, philosophy, theology), Community (political science and economics), the Environment (biology, ecology, engineering), Others (sociology, international relations, justice), and Individuals (psychology, health care)."},{"Title":"God of the Empty-Handed: Poverty, Power & the Kingdom of God","review":"Jayakumar Christian is the Associate Director of World Vision India who has a Ph.D. in Intercultural Studies from Fuller Theological Seminary as well as a few Masters degrees in Social Work, Missiology, and Divinity.In a nutshell, when Jayakumar writes about \\"Poverty, Power and The Kingdom of God\\" (the book subtitle) - he knows what his talking about.His book, \\"God Of The Empty-Handed\\", is divided into three parts:1) \\"Learning for History\\" is a look at the different ways people have defined \`poverty' and the underline assumptions that led to that definition. For example, are those who are poor, poor because of a lack of resources? Training? Maybe they are just backwards?The best part about this selection is Jayakumar analysis of each view - the pros, cons and the real life results. He pulls no punches - tackling views from economists, politicians, relief workers, and theologians with equal vigor and intelligence.2) The second part, \\"Learning from the Poor,\\" is a challenge to the reader to look at reality through the eyes of the poor. Jayakumar draws heavily on the concept of \\"power' - do those in poverty have the power to change their lifestyle? To pursue their dreams? To work?We here in the West might not think about it - but for most of world, their lives are controlled by forces outside of their control: economically, politically, socially, religious....3) The last selection of the book is entitled \\"Learning About The Kingdom of God\\". This is where Jayakumar proposes another way of tackling the issue of poverty across the world. This is a very powerful selection that can not be re-created here...."},{"Title":"The Arab awakening: The story of the Arab national movement","review":"Though not a key unlocking all Middle Eastern mysteries, \\"Arab Awakening\\" effectively traces Arabs' response to the challenges of Western and Ottoman imperialism. Some of the analysis is now superceded, e.g. giving primacy to Lebanese Christians as pioneers of Arabism while downplaying Islamic modernizers. But it holds up remarkably well overall, describing the movement and exposing British double-dealing over Palestine. A Christian Arab and former Foreign Office official, Antonius was perfectly positioned to write this book, though FO ties probably led former colleagues to favor his views. Original research and heartfelt sentiments ensure its classic status, but the revelation is the humane portrayal of all parties involved. This contrasts markedly with the regionwide trend toward confrontation since the 1930s. \\"Arab Awakening\\" displays nationalism at its best, a positive force advocating political rights for the excluded (like Zionism at its best). A much-needed study of Antonius's career is S. Boyle, \\"Betrayal of Palestine.\\""},{"Title":"The Arab awakening: The story of the Arab national movement","review":"This is definitely the classic account of the rise of the Arabic people and the making of the modern Middle East.

Though written more than half a century ago, this book is indispensable and offers fundamental insights on Middle East affairs, and is packed full of historical facts that withstood the test of time. A primary advantage of this book is the part about Palestine, which was written before the formation of Israel in 1948 and therefore reflects the intricacy and complexity of that crucial first half of the century from a unique perspective. A Palestinian himself, George Antonius is not afraid to put his thoughts on Palestine in the open, describing his vision for coexistence between the Palestinian and the Jewish people in one democratic and constitutional state. The only weakness I find in this book is the author's tendency to give too much credit to the Hashemites, overplaying their role in forming Arab events at the turn of the century, and underplaying their role in collaborating with th British and the Zionists to the detriment of their Arab brethren.

Antonius \\"The Arab Awakening: The story of the Arab national movement\\" is a classical book about al-Nahda epoch of the late 19th - early 20th century. In 1939 American diplomats involved in the Middle East strongly recommended the book to their juniour colleagues for deeper understanding of the region. \\"The Arab Awakening\\" is one of the most cited books devoted to the Middle East problems.G. Antonius was one of the founders of \\"standard historiography\\", as well as Colonel T. E. Lawrence, Amin Said, Professor D. G. Hogarth etc. The Antonius' style is beautiful. He was born in Syria, he knew the Middle East very well, and he was acquainted with the main figures of his writing.I have received the edition of 1969 by Librairie du Liban. Although it is not the first edition of 1938 by Hamish Hamilton Publishers (I had studied it previously preparing my PhD dissertation) I also recommend this book by G. Antonius as those American diplomats in 1939 to everyone who wants to know the Middle East better."},{"Title":"The Arab awakening: The story of the Arab national movement","review":"\\"The Arab Awakening\\" by George Antonius was, along with \\"Palestine: The Reality\\" by Joseph Jeffries one of the first books to effectively make the Arab case against their Anglo-French betrayers and overlords following the First World War. The book was widely admired when it first came out and remains one of the classics in its field. It was read extensively by American diplomatic and consular officials in the Middle East before the Second World War. Antonius demonstrates that the Arabs did, indeed, fight on behalf of the British military campaign in World War One, effectively isolating 20,000 or more Turkish troops in the area of Medina and Mecca, away from Edmund Allenby's main theater of war in Gaza. Whether the Turks diverted the troops because of Arab military prowess or the desire to protect the holy places is really immaterial, as the benefit to the British remained the same. Antonius then details the same campaign of sabotage and ambush north up the Arabian peninsula described by Thomas Edward Lawrence in \\"Seven Pillars of Wisdom\\".After the war, the British and French divided the Arabian peninsula into a patchwork of artificial states, betraying the pledges of Sir Henry MacMahon and selling out Palestine to the Jews. Antonius goes into considerable detail on the famous MacMahon-Hussein correspondence, showing that His Majesty's goverment did indeed deceive in its interpretation of same and then deliberately suppress the correspondence until the time of the Saint James Crown Conference of January-March 1939, when Lord Maugham reluctantly admitted that Arab claims \\"had more force than hitherto imagined\\".The various apologetics of Sir Henry, notably that he had made a \\"mental reservation\\" regarding Palestine (English \\"Kol Nidre\\") are properly dismised as self-serving nonsense that no English judge would seriously consider for a moment. (Indeed, the Arabs retained the opinion of a former Attorney General of the British Mandate, Sir Michael McDonnell, who reached precisely the same conclusion. Sir Henry was bound by what he wrote, not by ex-post facto rationalizations of what he supposedly meant to say.)Antonius made his case but was subsequently overruled by the 1948 war and the force of events. His book was published at a time when the Department of Near Eastern and Aftrican Affairs was dominated by American officials like Wallace Murray and Loy Henderson, who were very skeptical about Zionist ambitions in the Middle East. Both the State Department and Antonius lost - and the Zionists no longer have to worry aout forgotten opinions. Still, Antonius book is a reminder of the injustice that was done - and that will not disappear. Those who read \\"The Arab Awakening\\" will gain great insight into what the media cover up - with good reason."},{"Title":"The Arab awakening: The story of the Arab national movement","review":"Written on the eve of World War II, this is a thoughtful, well-researched account of the forces which transformed the Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire into the nation states of the Middle East which now exist. It focuses particularly on the promises which the British made to the Arab peoples and on which the latter had relied in deciding to join the fight against the Turks in World War I, in the expectation that success would lead to their independence--promises that were cynical at the time made and ignored in the peace negotiations. Anyone who still thinks the problems in the Middle East began with the creation of Israel in 1948 would profit by reading this book and getting a longer view of the issues which are still with us today."},{"Title":"The Arab awakening: The story of the Arab national movement","review":"Well,After notifying the publisher of the missing maps, they rectified the problem.

Then I took two 3 credit grammar classes in three months from Dr. Kroeger followed by another class called Advanced Grammatical Analysis. He used a prepublication version of this book in that class. I found his book very easy to follow and very interesting. Of course, I had the advantage of being in a class of only 10 students with almost unlimited access to Dr. Kroeger when I had questions. Even without him in person, I think his concern for students and ability to provide clear explanations without being wordy comes through in this book. I liked the fact that he provides examples from a wide range of languages and many of the examples are entertaining, particularly the \\"durian\\" examples.

The classes were held at Miami University in Coral Gables, Florida. The 44 young men of that first class became known as the Class of 40-A. The instructor for these navigators-to-be was Charlie Lunn.The author, Colonel Whitcomb, was a member of that Class of 40-A. As such, he is uniquely qualified to tell the story of their adventures.Their stories are dramatic. These men were plunged into World War II with a vengeance. Several of them were killed by enemy forces. Those who survived sometimes faced situations worse than death. The men who were caught by the Japanese were often beaten, starved and killed. When American soldiers were transported by Japanese ships, the conditions were especially terrible. No water or air created maddening results.The author describes how demoralizing it was for U.S. troops in the Philippines. With the Japanese forces against them, U.S. forces were constantly attacked by shelling and bombing. Backups for the Americans were promised but failed to materialize.But with the aircraft that survived enemy attacks American pilots and navigators were able to bomb the Japanese. The Doolittle Raid on Tokyo is described in this book. And the later firebombing raids on Tokyo were also very effective at hurting the enemy.Wherever their missions took them, the navigators and pilots often had to contend with antiaircraft fire and enemy fighter planes. They also had to at times deal with their own damaged aircraft, tropical storms, lack of fuel and lack of sleep. In spite of the trying conditions, the navigators of the Class of 40-A were able to guide their planes to numerous successful missions against the enemy. And ultimately, American forces won the war.This book from 1995 is published by Air University Press, Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama."},{"Title":"On celestial wings (SuDoc D 301.26/6:C 33)","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful book!Following the lives of the first class of celestial navigators is an excellent way to approach the subject of air warfare in WWII.

Perhaps as a result, my interest in the history of Colorado in particular, and the West in general, has been increasing for quite some time now, and SALONE ITALIANO provides another small and fascinating piece of the puzzle. History is not so much an epic image as it is more like a photomontage, a whole made up of a mosaic of innumerable smaller images, and Ms. Niemann's tale is a thoughtful exploration of a time and place not really that distant and not that long ago. SALONE ITALIANO is a novelized history of the counterpoised Italian communities who shared Durango and Silverton in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It is a structure well and truly imagined on a foundation of memoir and recorded fact, and its people and events bring the West of our grandparents' time back to new and colorful life."},{"Title":"Salone Italiano: The True Story of an Italian Immigrant Family's Struggles in Southwestern Colorado","review":"In the midst of the steaming immigration issues moving across our nation, I was happy to receive Salone Italiano by Kay Niemann, a timely read with old fashioned ideas about what it is to become an American.The book chronicles an Italian immigrant family during the late 1800's, as they settle in the area of Silverton, Colorado.

Rogers has basically collected some of the accusations in U.S. history where certain figures were said to have \\"black ancestry\\". In some of these cases, the black relative is so far back in the family tree that it would only constitute a very small part of the President's genetic history. But those were also the days when the \\"one-drop rule\\" was the way that most people thought about race, so having a great great grandparent who was half black meant the same thing as having a black mother or father. Keep in mind that each of the tales here use very superficial means for determining whether or not somebody has black ancestry. You simply cannot determine this from examining a skin color or hair texture. This pamphlet is as much a collection of allegations as it is a documentation of the strange understanding of race in America.Abraham Lincoln is an example of someone who was often accused of having black ancestry. He is supposed to have had darker skin than his black servant William Slade. Lincoln also described himself as having a \\"dark complexion with coarse black hair and brown eyes\\". Rogers has included here an old political cartoon showing Lincoln as a sort of Moorish caricature. The most persistent argument so far for the first black president has been for the man on the cover of this pamphlet, Warren G Harding. The primary source of this argument is a book published by William Estabrook Chancellor in which he interviewed Ohio resident who stated that Harding had a black relatives. His \\"grand uncle\\" was Oliver Harding, also shown on the cover. Critics argue that Chancellor was motivated by political and personal reasons against Harding, and that the theory is based on local rumors. The \\"evidence\\" for some of these black presidents is pretty slim. For example, Thomas Jefferson's mother wasn't a squaw (Native American), she was born in England's Greater London area. The last President is not named, perhaps to invite the reader to speculate, gossip or do his/her own research.Two of the people with the greatest evidence of black ancestry weren't presidents, but they were significant historical figures. One was Hannibal Hamlin, the 15th Vice President (under Lincoln). Rogers here reproduces several quotes showing that Hamlin's skin color was quite an issue at the time. Some believed that Lincoln had deliberately selected a \\"free black\\" as his Vice President in order to anger the South. A Union General even stated that he intended to form a military regiment of mulattos \\"about the complexion of Vice President Hamlin\\". Another prominent American named in the pamphlet is Alexander Hamilton, who was born in the Virgin Islands. In fact the section on Hamilton is the longest of them all, and one of the most convincing. Rogers suggests that Hamilton's mother was mulatto, and that his brother (from the same parents) was harassed when he moved to the U.S. because people believed that he was black. Included in this section is an early portrait of the Treasurer which shows Hamilton with wooly hair.Rogers was a very interesting historian, probably the first black revisionist. Recent years would have provided lots of material for his research, for example both George W Bush and Colin Powell are descended from England's King Edward I. With Barack Obama having won the Democratic primary, I'm sure he'd be the first to point out that this wasn't the first time in history a candidate's race was made into a campaign issue!\\"How should I know?

This pamphlet is as much a collection of allegations as it is a documentation of the strange understanding of race in America.Abraham Lincoln is an example of someone who was often accused of having black ancestry. He is supposed to have had darker skin than his black servant William Slade. Lincoln also described himself as having a \\"dark complexion with coarse black hair and brown eyes\\". Rogers has included here an old political cartoon showing Lincoln as a sort of Moorish caricature. The most persistent argument so far for the first black president has been for the man on the cover of this pamphlet, Warren G Harding. The primary source of this argument is a book published by William Estabrook Chancellor in which he interviewed Ohio resident who stated that Harding had a black relatives. His \\"grand uncle\\" was Oliver Harding, also shown on the cover. Critics argue that Chancellor was motivated by political and personal reasons against Harding, and that the theory is based on local rumors. The \\"evidence\\" for some of these black presidents is pretty slim. For example, Thomas Jefferson's mother wasn't a squaw (Native American), she was born in England's Greater London area. The last President is not named, perhaps to invite the reader to speculate, gossip or do his/her own research.Two of the people with the greatest evidence of black ancestry weren't presidents, but they were significant historical figures. One was Hannibal Hamlin, the 15th Vice President (under Lincoln). Rogers here reproduces several quotes showing that Hamlin's skin color was quite an issue at the time. Some believed that Lincoln had deliberately selected a \\"free black\\" as his Vice President in order to anger the South. A Union General even stated that he intended to form a military regiment of mulattos \\"about the complexion of Vice President Hamlin\\". Another prominent American named in the pamphlet is Alexander Hamilton, who was born in the Virgin Islands. In fact the section on Hamilton is the longest of them all, and one of the most convincing. Rogers suggests that Hamilton's mother was mulatto, and that his brother (from the same parents) was harassed when he moved to the U.S. because people believed that he was black. Included in this section is an early portrait of the Treasurer which shows Hamilton with wooly hair.Rogers was a very interesting historian, probably the first black revisionist. Recent years would have provided lots of material for his research, for example both George W Bush and Colin Powell are descended from England's King Edward I. With Barack Obama having won the Democratic primary, I'm sure he'd be the first to point out that this wasn't the first time in history a candidate's race was made into a campaign issue!\\"How should I know?

The section with the prayers were very difficult to readon the Kindle. Looks like someone scanned the pages--the print of the prayers was much smaller than the print of the introduction.

Shintoism is the belief that everything has a spirit and we need to live in harmony with everything. Rocks, trees, etc all have spirits and are important to life. Each of us has part of the god (kami). The Shinto prayers and rituals are one way of connecting to the Divine spirit within.I will re-read this book on my laptop, using Kindle for PC.

In a nutshell, it details the mechanisms by which personal liberty -- accompanied by personal responsibility and a just system of government -- make nations, and the individuals who live in them, wealthy. I had a Marxist professor who did not like Adam Smith because Marxist theory prefers to emphasize class warfare, while Smith is saying that everyone is capable of providing for themselves and the less the government interferes, the better off we all are. Many conservatives, meanwhile, like Adam Smith because they seem to perceive a \\"survival of the fittest\\" philosophy in his works.

This is List's core argument and not to be confused with the &quot;infant industry&quot; characterization. Smith's work is of course a classic.

After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to listen it completely by yourself.

It is not from benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self-love and never talk to them of our own necessities, but to their advantages. The real price of everything, what everything really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the trouble and toil of acquiring it. Smith contends that there are only 2 ways countries can become wealthy: (1). Their citizens being good savers and then invest these savings toward productive ends; and (2). By way of trade. National wealth grows when things and money are circulated and exchanged to the most remote corners of the globe. Finally, Adam Smith believes that nations will become rich only if natural liberty is promulgated for, society has a natural tendency to allocate resources in the best way.

With a little discipline, I think that the erudite reader will take away many enriching (yes, pun intended) lessons from Smith's ground breaking treatise. For me, as a business professional and business student (I have an MBA), the Wealth of Nations was a Damascus Road experience.I think there are several myths about economics that are exploded by a first hand reading of Wealth of Nations. Many supply side economists eagerly tout Smith's \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor in advocating deregulated markets, but in my view, Smith took a balanced and integrated approach in analyzing the supply and demand sides of national economy. In the first chapter Smith notes that national wealth is the production of labor. This has dual implications in that production is the creation of supply, but the labor force consumes that supply by trading the resulting wealth. These are two sides to the same coin, &amp; therefore indivisible. Also in the first chapter, Smith notes that increasingly sophisticated economies will employ a division of labor to increase production efficiency, which is another concept that necessarily integrates supply and demand, production and consumption.Smith devotes quite a bit of time lamenting governmental intrusion into economics by way of regulation. However, he does not condemn government regulation per se, but make very specific criticisms against those state regulatory polices that tend to create monopolies. None of his comments are strictly political in nature. Smith's analysis is purely based on economics &amp; the efficient allocation of capital. He views the enemy not as the King's ministers, but rather the monopolies that were so prevalent during the 18th century mercantile system.On a related note, I think it is clear that Smith would be horrified by the military centric nature of many post-industrial economies today. He notes that a standing army is a drain on national wealth. Essentially the state is paying workers not to work, but rather to stand ready to fight. I suspect that Smith would view large state defense budgets as being most closely akin to a transfer payment made by a welfare state. For those who will scream invective at me for saying this, please remember that the largest item on any defense budget by far, is payroll.Finally, as an amateur historian, I enjoyed the brief glimpse into what life was like in the 18th century Empire from an economist's perspective. Various parts of his book review social welfare systems of his day, as well as international banking, political economy, agrarian systems, and life in general."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Its a bit difficult to make a comment on the writtings for validity of Adam Smith.

This is a review of the Modern Library hardcover edition, which I ordered here at Amazon.com.Let it be said right off the bat that the big thing Marx gets trashed for has roots right here in the 'W of N:' namely, the Labor Theory of Value. Both Volume One of 'Capital' and 'W of N' spend the first 100 pages or so going over it. Both refer back to it constantly in later pasages. And both must be taken off the table without it. The LTV boils down to this: all value is created by people working and producing goods and services that other people need and/or want. Furthermore, they must produce these goods and services at at least the average level of productivity and at the appropriate level of demand. Otherwise you're working either harder or more easily for your cut of the national pie than you otherwise would. The LTV is so straightforward and intuitive you'd think there wouldn't be much of an argument.The one thing Smith stresses throughout the book is the need for what he calls 'perfect liberty,' where everyone is allowed to buy and sell what they want from where ever they'd like. With this, resources would be diverted to where they needed to be as quickly as possible so people would stop wasting their time WORKING (see how the LTV operates here?) on things that should be made elsewhere.It's important to understand that neither the words 'capital' nor 'capitalist' ever occur in this work. This is very important because both words carry baggage Smith would break no bread with. In fact, the main bad guys in this work are the very people we would call 'capitalist' today. They subvert Parliament through bribery and intimidation, protect their own interests at the expense of everybody else in society, and raise unholy hell when workers try to form unions. All the while, of course, they form unions amongst themselves with the express purpose of stabbing the rest of us in the back.Sound familiar?Let me give you a modern example of how desperately we need American economists to actually pick up and read this book, as opposed to just talking about what a good boy Adam Smith was. Contrary to the propaganda we're getting out of our media, alternative sources of energy are now ready for prime time. There's nothing the internal combustion engine can do that hydrogen fuel cells can't do better. The price of solar cells has been dropping like a rock for years. And wind power is now the second cheapest source of energy after dirty coal. All we need to do is divert all that money we use to protect our oil resources into building up the economy of scale for these products (i.e. reducing the amount of WORK necessary to build each unit; this is the LTV lurking around again), and turn all these into cheap bulk commodities. We'll also need to use this money to build up the infrastructure necessary to safely deliver and store hydrogen. Then, after these (admittedly) high entry costs (i.e. expenditures of LABOR), we'll have access to unlimited, clean, and cheap sources of energy. The nonsense we have instead, which came to serious crises in 2001 in California with the impeachable collusion of the Bush administration, has nothing to do with Adam Smith's great work. I don't know about you, but I'm pretty tired of socializing the risk while privatizing the profits for this industry. Our current urge to go to war with Iraq precisely reflects the urge of 18th century statesmen to protect the interest of the mercantilist (capitalist!!) masters. This was a tragedy Smith covers quite extensively.As an added bonus he's a great read. After working so hard on Marx I was very happily surprised.Karl Marx brought the LTV to a fine polish, going beyond Adam Smith and showing how it translates into the average rate of profit, interest rates, standard of living, etc. He picked up where Smith left off. Also, using the weapon of dialectical materialism (i.e. the logic of motion and change -- the true heart of Marxism), Marx was able to show how capitalism, in fact, negates private property. It would have turned us all into slaves decades ago if not for the better angels or our nature."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This book came very fast, was very affordable, and was in great condition when it arrived."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Talk about revisionist history!

Adam Smith's \\"The Wealth of Nation\\" establishes the theoretical framework for Capitalism covering every aspect of an economic system that has created the highest standard of living known to man. Adam Smith shows how the interplay between labor, stock and land serve to generate the wealth of a nation. The keys to wealth are freedom, productive men, productive stock, and productive land. Smith says that the role of government is threefold - to protect the land from foreign invasion, enforce contracts and maintain a physical and legal infrastructure that promotes commerce and investment. Government produces nothing and therefore the expense of government reduces the wealth of a nation. Taxes are akin to a proportional reduction in the productivity of labor, stock and land and so should be kept at a minimum in order to increase the wealth of a nation. Any government role beyond the promotion and protection of investment reduces the wealth of a nation and of its people Adam Smith would oppose the many government programs that litter the landscape of the Federal Government today. Welfare, Social Security, education spending by the government, and other non-defense or infrastructure related expenditures diminish the productivity of the people and consequently their wealth. The majority of the people in the United States would have been much wealthier had it not been for these programs.Adam Smith was also a proponent of free trade. He understood that countries varied in the productivity of the land and the people and that only through free trade could the advantages inherent in different lands and peoples be harnessed to increase the wealth of nations. He opposed guilds and unions which only protected the few at the expense of the many and consequently reduced the wealth of a nation by reducing the productivity of its people.Adam Smith was truly a man for all season and for all time. It's unfortunate that our politicians and educators are more familiar and enamored by the idiot Karl Marx than they are with Adam Smith. For if they revered Adam Smith as much as they revere Marx we would all be wealthier and happier."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"I read this book because I have had the \\"invisible hand\\" concept rammed down my throat since 1974 when I started taking business classes at a local university.

Adam Smith was a very, very smart man for his time (or were people simply smarter back then?), and he makes detailed observations throughout the book that would be considered boring minutia by todays standards. So let me boil it down for you:Adam Smith considered Free Enterprise to be by far the best method of economic interaction possible. HOWEVER, the book is almost completely about collusions or what he often calls monopolies where two or more people get together to avoid competition. He goes on in depth about the sickness that corporations, governments, and even religious institutions can inflict upon free enterprise. See why I say he was so smart? He was a true prophet.It is truly a shame that the \\"conservative\\" right-wing political thinkers of today have adopted this book as one of theirs, because it truly is not. In fact, it is mostly about the dangers inherent in their corporate, deregulated thinking."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Not even Miami Beach could make me enjoy reading this book.This book is over 200 years old and the economic system has changed a lot since then.

It is a fairly aggressive book based on its size with almost 1,000 pages of fairly fine print of which half of it is dedicated to the supply and demand of corn. But it is surprisingly readable and even interesting. And it is the basic textbook of all economics.Wealth is defined as production capability or what we might call GDP.I figure with a changing economy, it never hurts to brush up on the basics. We are in a period of sharp changes in supply and demand. It is important for business leaders to try to understand what impact this will have on them and their companies.One principle that Adam espouses is the division of labour.He also talks about principals, those are the people that supply the capital that is put to use by the agents (people who apply the capital). His view is that people should not do both, they should do one or the other. It is an interesting thought.He is very harsh on protectionism (as am I).I am not going to recommend reading it because the size is too daunting for many people.

It gives a clear, proper - though sometimes a bit long - explanation of the laws of the market and exposes the logical workings of the &quot;invisible hand&quot;.

Outdated and mutated words appear on almost every page and adds to this complicating It seems as if Smith's text was left completely intact. The book is also very long - almost 600 pages - and at times it relatively dull. For these flaws I felt it necessary to remove one star.

Less than a century later, Karl Marx was able to demonstrate, in his book, THE POVERTY OF PHILOSOPHY, how vacuous the ideas of good and bad, as they are usually applied in political economy, turn out to be in practice. Americans have largely accepted the notion of a consumer society totally dependent on copyright and trade laws to protect the value of the entertainment and related therapeutic products which it produces. What might be most upsetting to readers of this book, that someone like myself could use it to reflect on the events of 9/11/2001 as a challenge to such modern assumptions, as if the policing powers which maintain the world financial situation of today have more to fear from an examination of how this book treats consumption than from the usual lessons based on the growth of wealth, might make this an unacceptable view of what this book actually says.When this book was written, Adam Smith was able to combine economic ideas about the distribution and production (which he considered the highest good) of articles of commerce, in contrast to \\"the bad effects of the monopoly,\\" in a way that caused thinking people in Britain to believe that the world would be materially better off if the American colonies were free of rules which required those who produced all the tobacco from Maryland and Virginia to sell it in or through Great Britain. Adam Smith was worried that capital maintained to store this product in London was depriving England of the opportunity to produce goods that would generate more wealth. \\"At the port of London, indeed, it is commonly sold for ready money. The rule is, Weigh and pay. At the port of London, therefore, the final returns of the whole round-about trade are more distant than the returns from America by the time only that goods may lie unsold in the warehouse; where, however, they may sometimes lie long enough.\\" The American revolution was greeted by economic free traders as an event likely to cause a great increase in the wealth of nations, and the normally victorious political element maintains a strong belief in this fiscal ideology.The current situation might be closer to \\"the time only which the goods may lie unsold in the warehouse.\\" Near the end of Book IV, \\"Of Systems of Political Economy,\\" Chapter VII, \\"Of Colonies,\\" there was a frightening example of how bad things might get to be. \\"In Spain and Portugal the bad effects of the monopoly, aggravated by other causes, have perhaps nearly overbalanced the natural good effects of the colony trade.\\" Plenty of things went wrong, causing a large portion of the population to feel that they were victims of circumstances, \\" . . . but above all, that irregular and partial administration of justice, which often protects the rich and powerful debtor from the pursuit of his injured creditor, and which makes the industrious part of the nation afraid to prepare goods for consumption of those haughty and great men to whom they dare not refuse to sell upon credit, and from whom they are altogether uncertain of repayment.\\" Certainly, a great deal of money is in circulation today, and a tremendous amount is considered working capital, capable of producing many things that people might want, but the routine search for contraband includes cash in an amount exceeding $10,000, the amount which might be capable of buying a large amount of illegal substances. Police are actually so unfamiliar with cash transactions that large amounts might be held as evidence, until the police have been convinced that they have no reason to suspect the person who had the money of being involved in any sort of laundering activity. When Adam Smith was writing, his work was as shocking to those controlling the monopolies of his day as radical protests of today rile the police on the beat today, whose confiscation of vehicles, which are sometimes temporary, to see if they were used to transport illegal substances, is not considered in any way similar to hijacking airplanes in order to crash them into buildings which symbolize a violation of the right of the people to personal pleasure in a manner which averts the collapse of society as we know it. This hardly makes more sense than those who expected seizure of everybody's major assets to solve society's problems."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"\\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is written in the manner of one fact following another. It is in this way very much like \\"The Origin of Species\\". It is sometimes said that Adam Smith invented the free market economy and capitalism. This notion is absurd. He no more invented capitalism than Newton invented gravity. To people interested in economics the book will beenjoyable, in part because it does not have all the graphs andmath. I think many people simply interested in Human Nature will find \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" a key work.

In addition, the margin of the pages contain useful notes which summarize Smith's writing. For the price, this is clearly the superior choice.Now, if you're wondering whether you should undertake such an endeavor, let me just say that Adam Smith was a professor of rhetoric.

As a result each individual is incapable of sustaining his basic needs and thus must purchase these using his labour which Smith views as the source of all value. As a result demand and supply is created for such labour.He makes the natural assumption that each individual pursues their best interests.He foreshadows the concepts of marginal utility and scarcity in determining the shapes of demand curves for commodities. ( He never actually mentions curves ).Similarly, he describes the three factors determining supply prices for commodities ( rent of land, wages and capital costs ) and the various factors which influence them ( the equivalent of modern supply/demand curves for each factor ).He puts these together under ideal circumstances to show how supply and demand meet to clear markets ( equilibrium in modern language ).He then turns to macroeconomics laying the foundations for GDP and shows how capital can be distributed to \\"unproductive labour\\" ( that labour used to maintain productive labour ) such as doctors lawyer entertainers etc and \\"productive labour\\" ( that labour used in the manufacture and distribution of raw and finished products ). He explores the consequences of various distribution of each from both the micro and macroeconomic perspective.He concludes by emphasizing the importance of government in providing international and domestic security as well as providing public works and institutions especially education.Naturally this requires state revenue and he devotes almost one entire \\"book\\" to taxes.He delves briefly into political economy especially merchantilism and it's detrimental effects to society at large.A great introduction to modern economics that is often missed in didactic lectures. This book gives the motivation for many modern economic concepts that is often lost in mathematical formalism."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations brilliantly analyzes how a nation's living standards can be raised. In large part his wisdom still applies today. To briefly summarize Smith's thinking:1. Standards of living are determined by the productivity of workers.2. Productivity of workers is greatly enhanced by specialization (see the famous example of the pin factory in the first chapter!).3. Greater specialization is possible only if the market size grows. Thus, government laws that prohibit growth of the market hurt specialization, and thereby keep living standards from rising. This is why Smith opposed laws that restricted trade or created monopolies. Smith actively worked to keep Britain from going to war against its American colonies over trade issues. The Wealth of Nations is a political tract designed to sway the British parliament (obviously it failed in that regard).4. Productivity of workers is enhanced by raising their wages.5. Productivity of workers is enhanced by publicly funded education.6. The role of markets is exquisitely analyzed by Smith. Self-interest leads people to carry out private activities that lead to social betterment, as if by an &quot;invisible hand.&quot;7. It is a serious misinterpretation of Smith to assert that greed or selfishness is the same as self-interest. Smith labored hard to avoid any such confusion. Please see his other book which addresses this specific issue: The Theory of Moral Sentiments.8. Clearly Smith favored limited government. But Smith was NOT a strict advocate of laissez-faire. He ended his illustrious career as commissioner of customs, a job he took seriously, and which he would not have taken had he not thought this level of intervention in the economy warranted.Read the first three chapters of WN: they contain the essence of the arguments above.

(To my knowledge, neither of these editionsis abridged.) In 1904, Cannan, a professor at theLondon School of Economics, did two things that greatlyadd to the value of Smith's book.First, Cannan prepared a detailed index. For example,\\"invisible hand\\" appears in it. Just try to find theone (and only one) appearance of that phrase withoutan index. Most of the non-Cannan editions I've lookedat lack an index.Second, Cannan wrote and added brief marginalia. Hiswords facilitate skimming, something most readers ofthis thousand page book are apt to do. His words andphrases are also easily ignored. They don't get in yourway once you've found the pages you want to read.(Reviewer T. Grimes comments on the marginalia aswell.)Finally, reading The Wealth of Nations shows Smith tobe different from his usual portrayal. He can bewickedly satirical. Anyone who has been to college willrecognize much that is familiar in his thoughts (inBook V) on \\"Education of Youth\\". And he also franklyaddresses the downsides of capitalism. The book beginswith the division of labor as a powerful means ofadding productivity. But later (pp. 839-41 in my ModernLibrary edition), he recognizes the destructive effectsof division of labor and, in response, recommendsgovernment investment in public education.

This model serves as the foundation of the arguments in the entire book; and an excellent guide to analyze our modern market economies. Smith touches on various topics, ranging from market economics, history of colony establishments, state of opulence (briefly describing China in the 18th century), and of human nature and behavior in general.Much of Adam Smith's ideas have been distorted by subsequent scholars, some of whom contorted his ideas to suit their own purposes, while others might have simply misunderstood. For example, in coining the word 'the Invisible Hand', Smith recommended free market competition as the foundation for progressive opulance. However, his implicit assumption was that people seeking their own benefits also embraced compassion and sympathy in their moral values. This 'moral value' part is often missing in contemporary economic analysis. As such, to gain an understanding of his complete doctrine, you should read this economics book together with his other book \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\", which explores definitions of moral values and virtues.Another issue worth mentioning is that lots of people thought that Capitalism was derived from Adam Smith's doctrine, and the current market economies in the USA is a descendent of this ideology. However, if we used his definitions and analysis to compare the current USA market system, you will find that parts of the US system seemed to match closer to the Merchantile System that Smith lambasted as inefficient and short-sighted.A lot has been said about Smith's keen observations and eloquent quotes, however, most failed to mention his uncanny sense of humor. For example, in discussing about labor compensation, Smith remarked that \\"The public admiration which attends upon such distinguished abilities, makes always a part of their rewards; a greater or smaller in proportion as it is higher or lower in degree. It makes a considerable part of that reward in the profession of physics; a still greater perhaps in that of law; in poetry and philosophy it makes almost the whole.\\"; when taken into contexts that Smith is a Scholar in Philosophy, and hence should expect \`public admiration' as his total compensation package, this sentence is almost hilarious.This book is an insightful read, albeit one that requires much pondering. It took Adam Smith ten years to complete the first edition of Wealth of Nations, hence I would strongly recommend taking a slow pace in this exploration of his wisdom.You might ask whether there is an easier way to read this book, perhaps through some summary others wrote.My opinion is really not to do that, because the gist of this book is on the thinking process and good learning does not come easy. Spend the time to reflect on his reasonings and you will gain significantly from his wisdom. Not to forget that you should get a copy of his other book \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\" to fully appreciate the Wealth of Nations."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"I didn't read this exact edition, and I did read an abridged version. I'd also like to add that I'm not a student of economics. That said, I'd now like to unreservedly recommend this book to anyone who wants to get a handle on economics. I thought going back two hundred years might be a dicey move, but Mr. Smith's voice remains perfectly lucid, compelling, and marvelously informative. I cannot praise this book highly enough."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"The Wealth of Nations is an overview of economics by the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith around the time of the American Revolution. At the time of the writing, the popular ideology of economics was mercantilism - that is, countries should export as much products and import as much gold as possible. Hence, the somewhat strange title of the book. (The fact that \\"capitalism\\" and \\"economics\\" were not common phrases at the times doesn't help either)Much of what the book says confirms what any Economics 101 course would tell you - when you try to modify a free market, there are ripple effects. Take mercantilism again, as an example. Countries at the time tried to have \\"positive balances of trade\\", through methods such as prohibiting the exportation of gold, and encouraging exportation of everything else. This supposedly makes a country richer. In reality, all it does is make gold worth *less* in that country, because there are less products to buy per unit of gold available. This also leads to smuggling, where gold is sold to other countries where it is worth more.Smith understands that some government and taxation is necessary - there are some services that the free market cannot effectively provide. Conservatives seem to over-emphasize the famous \\"invisible hand of the free market\\" endorsed by Smith, while ignoring the fact that he endorses the idea of taxing the rich at a higher rate than the poor. (Source: page 1065 of the Bantam paperback edition)What would Smith think about the 21st century? I think he would be disappointed in our politics, both Democrat and Republican. Both Bush and Obama have overseen increases in the size of the federal government. Smith would likely be a conservative, but not a Republican or a \\"Tea Party\\" protester. He probably would've voted for Ron Paul in the 2008 primaries and Bob Barr in the general elections, despite flaws in both candidates. He would be against the War on Drugs, the bailouts, and probably the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He would be just as worried about corporate monopolies as he would government monopolies. I'm not so sure what he would think about healthcare - there are definitely problems with American healthcare, but don't think he'd want a public option or insurance mandate as a reform.Adam Smith is a very clear writer. Despite the book's length, it's not a boring read. I only skipped about 100 pages, mostly numerical data and obsolete information. Definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"The Wealth of Nations handles a lot of economical phenomena in a concrete but sometimes complex way. On one hand the book is filled with ideas, some convincing, some out-dated, some fundamental to the current believe in free-markets. These ideas are combined with appealing (or appalling) examples of the injustice done to people by disturbing the free-market. On the other hand however, I find that certain sections of the book require a lot of concentration. The book is an interesting, but slow and at times difficult, read.Essentially, it is a treatise on the power of individuals to maximise their own wealth and therefor a support for the natural liberty of men and an argument for free-markets. Not as a perfect system in which there will be no misery, but as a system that gives individuals the greatest (and most just) opportunity to gain happiness and which will be the quickest to respond to changes in supply and demand (and therefor decrease the misery which is created when governments ignore gaps between supply and demand).It is not a book that believes in the pure goodness of companies (but explicitly states that companies have a interest which is directly opposite to that of society as a whole. I.e. the interest of companies is to create a supply shortage so they can ask prices above costprice), but says that the best way to break the power of these companies is the allow free competition. It also reveals that political decisions that at fist glance seems compassionate, might in fact be inhumane, cruel and the cause of much suffering (because on the long run they lead to a supply shortage). The examples given here, are still relevant to view the decisions made by politicians in today's so-called free market countries.Comment on review of Micheal Brady, june 13 2005:Brady remarks that Smith was the first opponent of globalization. The (strange) evidence he gives to support this statement is that Smith supports the use of counter tariffs, if (and only if) this might lead to the removal of the initial tariff. This statement clearly shows that Smith was against protectionist measures like tariffs and only condoned them if in the short run they would lead to less protectionism and therefor more globalization! Brady also supports his statement by mentioning that Smith opposed any offshoring if the purpose of such offshoring was to supply the home market. The keyword here again being \\"if\\". Smith was against a nation stimulating offshoring because he saw no national gain.

Their topics are present in the political agenda of our governments right today, and after all other reviewers have written, better than I would do so, i should add four key points:- With no proper political institutions there is no possibility of creating wealth (it reminds me sad examples from today...Argentina?). Smith thinks it is very important having economic liberties, besides independent magistrates, and a national state committed to enforce the contracts privates sign up to make transactions when some party doesn't want to comply them.- Under the right framework of political institutions is posible to have private interests and public interest converging on the same \\"bargain zone\\". Under Smith's point of view is the mercantilism, as a policy of state, policy that picks up the winners since the desk of politicians instead of from the shops of every-day industry and parsimony of workers and entrepreuners what creates the conflict (even though he makes some exceptions, like the Navigation Act, but he regards the need of this monopoly of english navy by national security reasons only).- After the short-run adjustments, the income distribution matters, that are so important for politicians, should be resolved by the market and the entrepreuners whom, by searching opportunities to make more profits, will make converging the prices of land, labour and goods.- The accumulation of capital is the process that lowers interest rates, expands the supply of loans and suports higher degrees of division of labour in the economy. This process should let people have cheaper goods along the time and improve the wages of workers. The tax system should not stop this process, by \\"punishing\\" profits and the letting the remaining sources of rent free (wages, and rent of land).Under Smith's point of view scarcity and poverty are historical and social problems, and their solutions are in history and in social interaction too.There are not worlds beyond every-day reality, as socialists made us to believe some time ago...just trade and division of labour and accumulation of capital, and so on. Let history and people surprise us. They will make the wealth, not the governments. The Smith system is open to history and change, and learnship, and only requires good foundations to secure an historical outcome of wealth.The world of today has institutions that were not in XVIIIth century: global financial institutions and spread trade agreements, that create barriers at some places and open gates at anothers. And now we have new constraints (the environment,..) and new key players (global corporations, ..). But this new scene only makes smaller the room of economic policy choices for latin american governments. At the core of the room which is remaining for them, the Smith's suggestions still have urgent and actual importance.Sad thing to recognize that in XXIst century latin america, we need to read a great book from XVIIIst century to find out solutions."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Adam Smith's WONs should be required reading / course work in high school.Long winded, yes, but also relevant.

But if it is true, do it imply that we could be wealthy by just spend and spend and without further work?It is only after reading the first sentence of the book I remember the only truth that seems also to be forgotten by many people: it is only our labour that determine the wealth of nations, and also yourself. The book use a lot of illustrations to show how the division of labour could increase the production and it is on our self-interest to make exchange that give rise to division of labour, the theme that has mentioned by other reviewers and books.You should have read a lot of quotations from the book but you could not understand fully the central theme of the book by just few sentences. Take time to read the book and I believe that this book could increase your &quot;labour&quot;, or wealth in other words."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"I must take exception to the Amazon review: saying that Smith viewed Capitalism suspiciously is utterly untenable. From the very first chapter, Smith makes clear the genius of markets, the benefits of the division of labor, and how government intrusion upon &quot;perfect liberty&quot; creates economic inefficiencies. As the Industrial Revolution was in its infancy, Smith keenly perceived the theoretical framework for its future development: property rights, markets, free trade, and government non-intervention. These institutions allowed for unprecedented economic growth (there was more economic growth in the 19th century than in the preceeding 4000 years) and thus the sustainability of modern life. We cannot express enough gratitude to Dr. Smith."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Of course this is a classic, and hardly needs my recommendation. My only reason for limiting it to four stars is that it is a difficult read. Smith, an 18th century Scott, doesn't write the English that we speak today. He is extremely detailed, and one must remember he is writing of the English economy of three centuries ago. Some of the analysis is anachronistic, but most remains true to this day."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Though Smith's &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; is a true classic written in lucid English, and the foundation of our modern economy, I cannot say that it is all-too-important for most people to read this book. Weighing in 700+ pages for a typical printing, this work is not a quick and easy read by any stretch of the imagination. Many of Smith's great metaphors are found in the first quarter of the book, and I felt bored reading the latter parts. It is not that Smith was wrong, by any means, but rather that many of his arguments are now well-accepted and can be demonstrated in much more succinct manners. I feel that Smith's multitudes of examples are not particularly important to the average man.With that said, I reiterate that this is an important work that should be understood by everyone - but this does not necessarily mean reading all of it. For anyone studying economics, of course, this work is the bread and butter of your field - and is a must read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Some books have entered so deeply into our culture that they affect the way we think whether or not we have read them. The Wealth of Nations is certainly one of these books. And like most such books - the Bible, Shakespeare, the works of Freud or Jung, the Bill of Rights - the Wealth of Nations does not say what you think it does.The fact is, those who most earnestly revere Adam Smith are not always those who have read his works most carefully. Which is why reading The Wealth of Nations is important for those who think about the role of capitalism and free markets in our nations and in our world."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"I waited until 40+ years after I studied economics in college to get around to reading Wealth of Nations. (It wasn't on the syllabus). Definitely my loss. Is it an easy read? No, but this Kindle edition has modernized spelling and lost the random capitalization. The vocabulary is be a little challenging, but that's why your Kindle has a dictionary built in - and you may also need Google, as I did, for some of the more obscure usages. A little background in 17th-18th century British history also helps. I recommend making plenty of notes in your Kindle as you go.Smith compares/contrasts the economies of hunter-gatherer, nomadic and warrior civilizations, as well as feudal and mercantilist economies, and outlines a free-trade system which he would like to see, which we call \\"capitalism\\". Unfortunately, it seems to me that the mercantile system has prevailed in the long run, at least as far as international trade is concerned. He makes considerable use of historical examples as well as contemporary (to him) events, and he seems ambivalent about the prospects for the American colonies which were then in revolt.Wordy? A little repetitive? Yes, Smith could have used a good editor. But not to be missed.

All I can say is \\"genius.\\" It is of interest not only to the student of economics, but also of history and philosophy. I read this book because I was told that it is widely considered to be the foundation of modern economics. As I am starting a private study in this area, I felt this was a good place to start. If you are starting a study on economics START HERE! Adam Smith ties very abstract concepts to real-life examples that are understandable even today.I read somewhere that this book changed the world. Without knowing more about the period, I cannot say whether it did or not-but based on the magnificence and scope of this work, I believe it could be true. I can see the imprint of Adam Smith everywhere in modern economics-even in Karl Marx cites him! If you read my other reviews, you will see that I have never said this before-so understand, I do NOT say this lightly: This book has truly enriched my understanding of the world around me-and opened my eyes to things that I did not previously understand. Yes-this book changed my outlook on life!You know you are reading a work of timeless genius when you can apply directly what a man wrote in 1776 to the year 2010.If you are considering buying this book be aware of a few things:1) This book was published in 1776-and uses 1776 english. It's a little tough to follow at first, but you get used to it. If you've read America's founding fathers it really constitutes NO difficulty2) Despite the language, this book is VERY readable. His examples are understandable and the structure of the book makes it easy to follow him from point to point.3) This book is HUGE. This version (Bantam Classics) has 1208 pages.4) I wish Bantam would have given more room for notes in the margin.A few other observations about this book-* I was AMAZED by how different banking and financing were in the 1770s.* This book illustrates in SO many ways that people haven't changed AT ALL-very interesting - and amusing to see that illustrated over and over again.* Be prepared for an unrelating (and very convincing) argument for completely free trade.* Some of his digressions (especially the one on corn) were a little tough to get through.* He is SO honest in this book. In a day when pro-business talking heads will excuse any excess-Adam Smith has NO problem taking certain business practices to task. This book taught me, an Unrepentant Capitalist Pig that it is not only OK, but desirable to denounce bad business practices.* I feel a lot of the material in this book shows that a \\"gold standard\\" currency is not the magic bullet that many people today pretend it to be. (not that it's bad-but gold standard has it's own problems)* I feel the material in this book (specifically book 5) could be used to make a strong argument FOR the Fair tax (National Sales Tax)* The arguments he makes about the colonies in North America (us) are VERY surprising. I don't want to spoil it-but I had to re-read it a few times to make sure I understood what he said. - His argument makes sense, but I didn't see it coming.* Being a proud Pennsylvania resident, I was excited to see all the Pennsylvania references.* This book should be REQUIRED reading for any politician who will be assuming elected office. (Especially our current President)"},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This book seems to be the nicest edition i have seen of this classic and proably Smith's most important work.

The footnotes, which appear at the end of each chapter, are all run together in one big paragraph, without any numbers to show where each footnote begins. Moreover, while the footnote references in the text are linked, the links take you only to the start of the footnotes for that chapter, rather than to the pertinent footnote itself. A lesser problem is that the paragraphs in the text do not begin with indents; thus, the only way to tell when a new paragraph starts is if you come to a line that extends only halfway across the screen.On the plus side, this edition does include the explanatory call-outs of the original (in italics at the end of each section they pertain to) and the lengthy 1906 explanatory introduction by Edwin Cannan (though for some reason not the introduction by Robert Rubin to the recent Modern Library paperback).But it's a shame that Modern Library didn't do a better job with the formatting, especially since other Kindle publishers have made TWON available at a fraction of what Modern Library charges."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This book is so widely cited and interpreted contrary to the author's original thought, that every economist should read it completely to avoid being misled by such incorrect interpretations.First, let us take the \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor. When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist. You can get an audio version of this book to avoid lengthy read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Based on his previous writings on human behaviour, Adam Smith shows, systematically and consistently, how a market-based economic system promotes general welfare through the sole maximisation of individual outcomes.

And slavery like it or not is a part of economics. It's a way to get labor for very cheap (like food, water and shelter only). On page 744 he does however call it the unfortunate law of slavery. Slavery is abhorrent and prevents the whole from reaching their great potential for the benefit of a few (the wealthy who have slaves and the consumers who get products much cheaper because of it).On page 110-111 This really stands out \\"No Society can surely be flourishing and happy of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable\\"Adam Smith does however place too much emphasis on Corn being the commodity that everything is measured against. It's just as easy to switch to a different food source like Rice for instance. That if enough people switched to would cause the price of corn to drop or stop being planted.On page 986 He says there is no public institution for the education of women and he talks about not educating the women like the men. He says they are taught only what their parents or guardian judge it necessary or useful for them to learn and nothing else. This clealy isn't good either but I know he was just stating a fact of life at the time.I cry BRAVO!!! for Adam Smith's take on Religion. He got the true religion right! On page 998 it says \\"because in every religion except the true it is highly pernicious and it has a natural tendency to pervert the true, by infusing into it a strong mixture of superstition, folly and delusion. Each ghostly practitioner in order to render himself more precious and sacred in the eyes of his retainers will inspire them with the most violent abhorrences of all other sects. No regard will be paid to Truth, Morals or Decency.\\" The true religion extols Truth, Morals and Decency as Jesus taught us to keep the commandments. This is the whole duty of man. To speak the truth and walk uprightly. To not steal, Not Lie, Not commit adultery, etc. But today's organized religions are more interested in building bigger buildings to get more money collected for the most part than to do good works.On page 1067 Adam Smith says \\"the ground rents of uninhabited houses ought to pay no tax\\". I wholeheartedly disagree with thisstatement. This would allow the very wealthy to own so much land that the poorer people could never own their own piece of property. That's what property taxes are for to prevent this from happening. If the poor abandon all these houses that the very wealthy own then eventually the very wealthy will be unable to pay property tax and the government will take control of their property and put it back into circulation providing their workers places to live. That's why the proper way is the way the government of the the U.S. (or maybe Idaho) has implemented it. You get a tax break for your primary residence for your place to live but none from additional properties. Not to mention another country with a lot of cash could buy up all the property in your country and control too much without doing the labor needed to keep a country functioning properly.But overall it's a very good book.Sincerely,Jon Beckmon"},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Adam Smith's \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is truly one of the most influential books in world history. Published in 1776, it discussed many of the economic ideas of the thought system we refer to today as classical or nineteenth-century liberalism.First and foremost, it enumerated the capitalist doctrines that led to the awesome increase in living standards over the past two centuries--doctrines such as free trade, the importance of economic growth for a society, and the idea that the entire society benefits when the individual is encouraged to pursue his economic self-interest.Smith also examined the topics of paper money and commodity standards and provided examples from the past of when currencies were debased during hard times. Perhaps the most sobering part of the book from the point of view of today is the section that discussed how governments, when they have spent far too much and can no longer service their debt, must either repudiate the debt or incinerate it via severe inflation--we can only hope that the gross overspending in recent years on the part of both parties in Washington will not bring us to that point in the coming years.Some of the other topics on which Smith held forth include apprenticeships, colonies, agriculture, defense, taxes, the differences between public and private sector employment, and fascinating comparisons of wage rates between England and the then-colonies and between parts of Britain.The book is very readable despite the fact it was written in eighteenth-century English, and is definitely worth tackling if you have a serious interest in economics."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Adam Smith, the father of the classical economists (followed by Ricardo and Marx), was also one the first economists to understand the role of the market with respect to understanding the natural price of an object.\\"The natural price, or the price of free competition...is the lowest which can be taken, not upon every occasion indeed, but for any considerable time together...&lt;It&gt; is the lowest which the sellers can commonly afford to take, and at the same time continue their business.\\"It is through free individual selfish actions, Smith explains, as though guided by the famous &quot;invisible hand,&quot; that produces a society with the greatest and most prosperous distribution of resources.Some people call him the &quot;father of capitalism.&quot; What most people may not understand is how Smith unknowing laid the groundwork for Marx's Das Kapital, by wrongly attributing &quot;value&quot; to the labor inputs into a good.

It is for people who have an interest in classical political economy and its relation to the marginalist tradition. What I have attempted to do is take a critical approach toward contemporary mainstream economics based on what is written in the Wealth of Nations. I hope you enjoy it, and I look forward to constructive criticism and debate.Adam Smith has had by far the greatest general impact on the formation of economic theory of all economic thinkers since - it was he who cast the mold within which the future of economic thought would take place. What I believe has been neglected in most accounts of Smith's contributions to economic theory, however, is that in his attempt at establishing a unified theory of political economy he was instead responsible for developing the framework from which two conflicting theoretical approaches towards economic analysis would later be derived - one with focus on market relations and the other with focus on the relations of production. This marks the beginnings of what has been, in my opinion, a major inconsistency in the development of economic thought - the incompatibility of the former tradition of economic analysis, when taken in isolation from the latter, with the main pivot of Smith's theoretical justification for capitalist development in the \`Wealth of Nations'. The separation of these two areas, it will be argued, has been the result of the further development of certain aspects of Smiths core theoretical insights to the exclusion of deeper inquiry into an understanding of his attempted explanation of their origin and nature. Its product has been a superficial understanding of economic phenomena under capitalist relations responsible for the endless stream of conclusions that manage to both be incompatible with one another and claim immutability. Its practical impact has been to legitimize a system of ideas, culminating in the \`discovery' of universal economic laws detached from and functioning independent of social relations, that has fettered the further cultural and political progression of humanity through the intellectual impoverishment of human life.----------The \`Wealth of Nations', though it was overwhelmingly concerned with practical application and the specific policies of its time, has not cast such a long shadow on the progression of economic thought simply by merit of its attacks on the effects of Mercantilist economic policy. There were political economists before and after Smith who had carried out similar attacks, as is shown by the fact that Smith derived his argument against Mercantilist protectionist policy from Hume. Instead, the major impact of the \`Wealth of Nations' on economic thought has been its attempted establishment of a theoretical framework in which individual self interest was the driving force of an economic system that was propelled by its own momentum and functioned according to its own laws. In Schumpeter's words, it put forth the major assertion that \\"the free interaction of individuals produces not chaos but an orderly pattern that is logically determined\\". This orderly pattern was, for Smith, the tendential movement of the market prices of commodities toward their natural values. The major theoretical task of the \`Wealth of Nations' was an unveiling of the mechanisms that function to ensure this continuous movement of all nominal values toward their natural values within the framework of the free interaction of individuals. In this sense, Smith's argument against the Mercantilist system of political economy was, for all intensive purposes, an application ofhis general theory of natural value; there existed a \`natural' level to which any artificial adjustment in the quantity of money would adjust. The thrust of Smith's critiques on the effects of the Mercantilist doctrine are to be interpreted in the context of this distinction between natural and artificial value, within which its effects are extended beyond simple redundancy.Smith began his theory of value and price determination with a distinction between what he called the natural value of commodities and their market price, or their nominal and real price. The market price of a commodity is the price at any given moment of time in which commodities are exchanging for one another. Market prices fluctuate as a reaction to myriad natural and manmade phenomena and are in turn regulated by the interplay of supply and demand. If a drought adversely affects the yield of corn for a given period it would be the cause of a reduction in the supply of corn in relation to the level of effectual demand and a subsequent increase in market price; if it for some reason becomes fashionable to wear pink overcoats, assuming of course that individuals in a given society desire to be fashionable, then the effectual demand for pink overcoats will increase in relation to available supply and consequently so will the market price of pink overcoats. Value, on the other hand, is the point around which these movements, or vibrations, of price gravitate. Smith believed that individual commodities will rarely, if ever, exchange at their value due to constant changes and/or disruptions in the conditions of any given market. The hypothetical; point at which value and price meet may be understood as the more familiar concept of equilibrium; the point that competition would yield in the long run through the interplay of supply and demand on the market.The importance of these two concepts for Smith's theoretical framework was the effect that competition had on individual producers to cause the prices of commodities to always be in tendential movement toward their value. Essentially competition, which was restricted under the auspices of the \`Commercial System', was the force acting on individual producers which would ensure, in the long run, that commodities would be bought and sold at precisely the amount required to produce them - their value. There are two main justifications for the desirable nature of this process. On the one hand Smith believed that when prices were at their value the entire economic system was in turn at the highest point of efficiency and equality it could possibly be. On the other hand, Smith believed that this movement would ultimately benefit the mass of people with lower prices, which would continue to decrease in proportion to the advances in the conditions of production of commodities. Competition would in turn pressure individual producers to apply these cost lowering technical advances to the production process because of the need to reduce the value of their commodities in order to command a larger share of their respective markets, hence allowing for a higher rate of profit and the ability to continually reinvest their capital to repeat the same process indefinitely. Thus, it was on this tendency of competition to move the prices of commodities toward their values, and in time to reduce their values, that Smith's entire justification for the elimination of Mercantilist protection and privilege in favor of a system based on the free interaction of individuals ultimately rested. Not only was the Mercantilist doctrine of money manipulation redundant, but the means by which it attempted to achieve this ultimate redundancy prevented the functioning of extremely powerful mechanisms that Smith believed ensured the long run reduction in values of commodities - the betterment of the masses of people through the further development of the productive forces of society. As Schumpeter described: \\"It is the cheap cloth, the cheap cotton and rayon fabric, boots, motorcars and so on that are the typical achievements of capitalist production, and not as a rule improvements that would mean much to the rich man. Queen Elizabeth owned silk stockings. The capitalist achievement does not typically consist in providing more silk stockings for queens but in bringing them within the reach of the factory girls in return for steadily decreasing amounts of effort\\"Contemporary mainstream economics, a position held by the neoclassical tradition, though seemingly rejecting value as an \`economic' concept, has in fact incorporated selective parts of what has been its derivative into their theory of prices in market economies. This has been accomplished by simply supplanting the tension between value and price with what is their emergent concept of equilibrium, within which the whole of their analysis of price formation takes place. Within their framework, though for all intense and purposes similar, the nature of equilibrium, being for Smith a hypothetical position of the meeting of value and price, thus takes on an entirely different meaning. They essentially adopted a view of equilibrium as being determined by the equalization of the supply of commodities with their respective demand, the signals to which occur in exchange relations on the market. There is no contrast on which Smith placed prime importance between the 'natural' value determined in production to which all \`artificial' prices determined in exchange are constantly tending, but simply \`equilibrium' prices as given by the aggregation of subjective judgments of individuals - thus making the interaction of market mechanisms with man, which Smith attributed solely to the measuring rod of \`market' price, the explanation of value a. In this regard, 'value' is transformed into a function of the influence of demand upon costs of s well production - more specifically on the last fragment of want not satisfied - and ultimately purported to be a subjective calculation of individuals. Prices are now the reflection of the interaction between these marginal rates of substitution of individual consumers and marginal costs of production of producers - Marginal substitution as the demand schedule of individuals which, operating under the \`law' of diminishing marginal utility, decreases for every increase in the price of a commodity and increases for every decrease in the price of a commodity; Marginal cost as the supply schedule of producers which, under conditions of diminishing returns, decreases as more units are produced.The effect of this change, curiously enough, was largely on the classical theories of distribution. By shifting the focus of an inquiry into the forces acting on price away from the realm of production to the realm of exchange, essentially making the regulating force of price the subjective valuations of commodities and their impact on the costs of producing those commodities, it rendered meaningless what was of prime importance for Ricardo, and Marx thereafter - distribution between economic classes and its deterministic effects on the outcome of exchange. Theories of distribution had formerly attempted to explain the division of value between different social classes in a given society. Smith himself identified the \`three great classes' of society to \\"which the price of every commodity ultimately resolved\\" as being landowners, laborers, and manufactures - it was Ricardo, and more extensively Marx afterward, that showed the conditions in which this division of value between them took place was located in the realm of production before exchange took place. Gracious as they were in escaping them, these questions of class and the division of value between them became for economists not so much irrelevant in a greater sense, but \`outside' of what economic analysis set out to answer as they were now \`outside' of the theoretical determination of price. There was no longer a separation between exchange value and use value, but the derivation of exchange value from use value (utility). Distribution therefore became determined not from conditions of production but from exchange relations.This subtle maneuver of redefining equilibrium, or we should say using it for different purposes, served to retain positive aspects of Smith's analysis to the exclusion of what the logical extension of his system by further inquiry unveiled: It ultimately served the exact same purpose of having competition operate to tend prices to a point of efficiency and equality, where things are sold at precisely what they are worth (now subjectively determined by some feat of aggregating what occurs on the individual level of optimizing preferences), thus allowing for the maintenance of the virtuous development that Smith associated with the free interaction of individuals and the discarding of the negative features that became associated with Marx's later \`socially necessary labor time'. Not only were the later logical extensions of Ricardo and Marx that spoiled the virtuous cycle done away with in a single stroke, but extremely important aspects of Smith - from the identification and examination of the interaction between social classes to the objective nature of value existing in production - were all safely brushed aside.The vicious circle, however, eventually caught up with utopia: the attempted formalization of this interplay between market mechanisms and man as both the measuring rod of and the explanation for value brought an inconsistency: initial distribution continued to claim overarching priority in the formation of price. The expression of utility that was the interaction of man with the market could not possibly be based on subjective measurements of value, but on the actual purchasing power which translated into market pull. Thus, the independent postulation of some pre-existing income level or distribution was necessary for the internal consistency of any formal demonstration of price determination based on marginal utility. Essentially, This is the root of what will later be shown to be the major contradiction in the superficial extension of Adam Smith; it essentially revolves around the assumption most fundamental to all conceptual frameworks, that question supposedly \`outside' of the economists' domain - value.--------As Smith believes that the market price of commodities, regulated by their value, is established by the forces of supply and demand, he in turn identifies the natural price of commodities, the actual substance of value, as being equal to the labor necessary to produce them. He holds the latter to be the case because he believes that a commodity is essentially worth the amount of labor it is able to command on the market - if the producer of X enters into exchange relations with the producer of Y, and the production of X requires 10 hours or labor whereas the production of Y requires 5 hours of labor, then, in the hypothetical instance of commodities exchanging at their value, the producer of X will exchange one unit of X for two units of Y. Already within the beginning of his inquiry is the major problem, and what in the end removes all unity from his whole conceptual framework, to be found. It arises from the fact that Smith ultimately merges his explanation of the substance of value into what he before held as distinct, market relations - for what Smith is now basing his explanation of value upon is here the extent to which labor can be commanded in exchange, and not the \\"so much less labour than before\\" that makes up the substance of exchange value, or the labor embodied within commodities in the process of production.Let us examine this issue further. Smith, in holding the labor commanded by commodities as the explanation of their value, is essentially making what amounts to the same claim that it is the labor necessary to produce commodities that is the determinant of their value ONLY under conditions in which the whole produce of labor belongs to the laborer. Under these conditions Smith sees no contradiction because there is none; it is only after the fact that this separation comes to play a destructive role. We can easily see why Smith thought this to be the case - when a producer of a product exchanges this product, in which only his labor was used to produce, with an individual who has done the same, the labor which each of these commodities command on the market is equivalent to the labor embodied within them. There is X amount of labor embodied in the commodity, and the laborer, appropriating the whole product, thus exchanges it and receives X amount of materialized labor in return for it. Confusion sets in on Smith when he attempts to extend the labor commanded theory of value to instances in which labor is not the sole 'factor' ofproduction, but land and capital as well. He runs head on into what is seemingly a major problem - if labor does not appropriate the whole of its produce, but a portion is divided between either rent to a landlord or profit to a capitalist (manufacturer, in his words), then labor commanded is no longer equal to the price of the commodity it produces. The price of commodities on the market will in general be higher than the exchange value of labor. As Smith is well aware that he must have an explanation of value consistent with \\"the three great classes of society\\" for the functionality of his entire schemata, if only because the appropriation of the full product of labor by the laborer was \\"at end...long before the most considerable improvements were made in the productive powers of labour\\", he is now seemingly forced to discard the applicability of the labor necessary to produce commodities as an explanation of value to a society in which labor is not the sole \`factor of production' of commodities.Instead of further unraveling this contradiction, the task of which was left to Ricardo, and, more extensively Marx, Smith adopts what is now called a \`cost of production' theory of value - essentially, as Smith sees the necessity of the incorporation of \\"the accumulation of stock and the appropriation of land\\" into his conceptual apparatus, he simply makes the \\"natural value\\" to which all \\"market prices are constantly gravitating\\" equivalent to the \`returns' to land, labor, and capital based on the observation that it is into these \\"three parts\\" which \\"the price of every commodity finally resolves itself\\". Of course, \`value' is in this sense superfluous - simply identifying that rentiers, capitalists, and laborers all receive a portion of the value of commodities does not serve as an explanation of where the value of these commodities derives; but, then again, this is our problem, is it not? We can now see the starting point of superficial extensions - of profit simply being another form of wages for inspection and direction, risk or abstinence, which becomes plucked out of its proper context as being linked to the value of the stock employed. From whence does this value come - the sky? Thus, we are yet again gifted with another gem in the \`production possibility frontier' of neoclassical economics - in which there can be no mistaking the superficiality of \`switching between capital and labor'. Neither can the perspective required for the exposition of such insight be mistaken.It is in the evasion of one contradiction which Smith naturally becomes entangled in another, his recognition of this being doubtful. The contradiction materializes when Smith moves on to his analysis of the \`Wages of Labour', where he correctly maintains that returns to land and capital are derivative from labor and labor alone. Smith thus becomes his own greatest enemy, for he has now, quite explicitly, singlehandedly refuted both his own labor commanded theory of value and his cost of production theory of value. The only unifying force, and luckily for Smith what remains implicit throughout his whole analysis of the division of labor, is a labor embodied theory of value - that \`returns' to land and capital are not returns at all, but appropriation from the labor which they employ. Thus we have come to one major critique levied against Smith by Ricardo - the division of value between classes in no way refutes the principle that value is derived from labor.There are two rreasons why I believe that Smith did not realize his self contradictions: first, this contradiction was spelled out quite plainly, whereas the former was not. It thus makes little sense for Smith to have not made any attempt to remedy it as he did the former from which it came; second, and more importantly, the so called cost of production theory of value was, for all intents and purposes, consistent with his notion of tendential movements of price toward \`value', much in the same way as neoclassical equilibrium theory is functional solely by merit of the identification of a given supply. What it was not consistent with, which will be shown later, was his theory of the division of labor and the increases in productivity that it allowed as a function of decreasing value. It is from the combination of what Smith, in arguing with himself, found to be dead ends with his concept of the division of labor, on which the development of the former aspect of his inquiry relied, that is at the core my claims.---The Division of Labor---In sweeping away the Mercantilist doctrine, Smith put forth a new answer to the question of how to increase the wealth of nations; that it was be found in the realm of production, more specifically in finding a mechanism the influence of which caused improvements in the conditions of production. These improvements were the development of the productive forces which, by reducing the amount of labor required to produce them, caused a reduction in the value of commodities. Smith identified this mechanism as the division of labor.The division of labor, however, did not serve only to reduce the value of material output - it both fostered the growth and application of specialized knowledge to further innovate the production process. Innovations which were responsible for the introduction of new products and the increased efficiency of the production of existing products were the result of the division of labor. This is because a specialized producer would be more far more likely to posses, or have a much greater possibility of obtaining, the requisite knowledge to improve a product and themethod by which that product was produced than a person who was forced to spread his or her time across the production of many different products. The mechanism of the division of labor, in turn, was identified by Smith as being a function of the volume of exchange between individuals. He believed that when people regularly engaged in exchange relations they would become inclined to specialize in production - i.e. spontaneously form a division of labor. This is because with every increase in specialization there is in turn an increase in the volume of exchange due to a subsequent decrease in the self sufficiency of individuals. If an individual who formerly produced the whole of his or her necessary product specializes in the production of one of these products, he or she must then engage in exchange relations to obtain the rest. The growth in the volume of exchange then served to expand the division of labor, which itself served to expand the volume of exchange as it allowed for the individual the ability \\"to exchange all that surplus part of the produce of his own labor\\" and therefore \\"encourages every man to apply himself to a particular occupation\\".Thus, as exchange gave rise to the division of labor, and the volume of exchange was in turn directly influenced through the division of labor, the result was an increasing hold of the division of labor on society. The division of labor, then, functioned as a positive feedback mechanism. There was, however, a natural limit to the internal expansion of the division of labor. Smith identified this limit as the extent of the market, or the area in which exchange relations were able to occur. The essential notion behind this concept was that the extent of specialization between producers depended on the mass of producers available to specialize. Smith describes this phenomena with an identification of the further integration of the division of labor in areas that contain a large mass of people, such as \` great towns', as opposed to a small population, such as the countryside.IIAs Smith held that exchange was the driving force behind the expanse of the division of labor, and that this exchange was limited only by the extent of the market, he identified the elimination of spatial and temporal barriers - modern day \`transaction costs' - as the means by which exchange was able to be carried out in a widened area, and hence the means throughwhich the division of labor was able to more deeply integrate itself. This is because these eliminations served to open up further avenues of exchange between individuals and, flirting with their propensities to \\"truck, barter, and exchange\\", led to further expanse of the division of labor. Thus, Smith identified the emergence of commercial civilizations, or, as he says, the first \\"civilized\\" nations, in regions that had fewer barriers to exchange than others. As far as how this reduction of temporal and spatial barriers was accomplished, Smith was rather ambiguous. However, it seems fairly evident that he viewed the division of labor itself as the force that would accomplish this task in the long run. This is because Smith identified the division of labor as not only the instigator of increased material productivity but as the force through which innovation was fostered.But had a division of labor not already existed? And if so, why did the division of labor neither perpetuate itself as Smith had envisioned nor serve to harness the application of the creative potential of individuals to widen the market? Smith's answer to this was that the division of labor that existed, because it was not a system of free enterprise but a manifestation of Mercantilist doctrine, created an atmosphere of monopoly and special privilege that restricted or distorted the forces that signaled the spontaneous ordering of production. In a system of free enterprise, competition between individual producers would both incentivize the actual applications of innovations that the granting of special privileges and subsidies deinsentivized and would eliminate monopoly control because any sector with an above average profit rate would attract production that was formerly involved in a sector with a lower rate of profit, and therefore also ensuring the important movement of price toward value. The regulating force of competition was the main ingredient necessary to bring to life the positive feedback mechanism of the division of labor. Protection was preventing the functioning of the division of labor which, per contra to the conscience construction of Mercantilist policy, functioned by merit of a mechanism which was independent of the conscience design of man.It is in this context of Mercantilist protection policies that Smith's remarks on the interests of manufactures being at odds with that of society as a whole should be interpreted 12. For Smith, the secret of the wealth of nations was to be found in the positive feedback mechanism embedded in the link between the division of labor and the extent of the market: an increase in the division of labor lowers costs, raises real income, and extends the market, thus leading back to an increase in the division of labor and an increase in the extent of the market. Smith held that exchange between individual producers regulated by competition would cause the materialization and expansion of this virtuous cycle. It is in this sense that exchange is considered the driver of growth: it enlarges the pool in which the division of labor exists. The entirety of modern exchange based growth theory is thus derived from Adam Smith. Any argument put forth that identifies \`barriers' or \`limitations' on the ability to exchange being the immediate cause of poverty is thus derived from Adam Smith. Not only that, but Smith also implies that technological innovation is a factor endogenous to production based on a spontaneous division of labor. As technological progress is the long run mechanism through which temporal and spatial barriers are eliminated, not only does short run poverty due to the inability to exchange in this way derive from Smith, but the long run increase in the standard of living of the masses as well. The whole of contemporary mainstream economics has been an attempted formalization of the requirements needed for Smith's division of labor to function. This is the power that lies within the first twenty pages of the \`Wealth of Nations'.IIIBut it is precisely in this moment of glory where the disconnect occurs. For the role attributed to the division of labor is inexorably tied to the notion that labor is the \\"real measure of exchangeable value of all commodities\\". Redefining value as being determined in exchange contradicts the whole foundation of the Smith's division of labor: if the functioning of the division of labor is to reduce the value of commodities through paradigm shifts in how they are produced in the long run, in their conditions of production, then it is within the production process alone that an explanation of value must rest. Smith himself, in putting forth the labor commanded theory of value, maintained consistency with his theory of the division of labor to the extent that individual producers appropriated their own product. As this was incapable of being extended to capitalist production, Smith then switched to a cost of production theory of value in order to escape the trap he had laid for himself. However, as we have shown, this theory of value was not a theory of value at all and thus was incapable of explaining anything other than showing a hypothetical point at which value and price would be equal - it was therefore incompatible with the dynamic nature of the division of labor. It is from the latter which contemporary equilibrium analysis has its origins, and, quite naturally, why equilibrium analysis in neoclassical economics had also been doomed to a static existence: dynamics could only be incorporated as an element disturbing equilibrium, whereas within the whole of the operation of the division of labor equilibrium is only a fleeting moment of a vibration which is in ceaseless fluctuation. Smith, despite his fumbling, maintained conceptual unity because the whole of his division of labor was based around an environment wherein labor commanded was for all intents and purposes equivalent to labor embodied - or a world where the laborer appropriated the whole of his or her produce. His inclusion of the pin factory example, while highlighting the increase of productivity it allowed, served to hide the fact that this productivity was a function of a specific explanation of value. This dualistic nature, or perhaps the high degree of ambiguity, in which Smith conducted his analysis of the division of labor therefore turned out to be both his weakest and strongest point.This dualism carried on to his heirs, however it now took different form. In adopting the marginalist approach to value, it manifested itself in an attempt to explain the functioning of an economic system according to individual self interest as a function of profit on the basis, or perspective, of individuals who have left the production process, or left the process in which material objects are produced as a prerequisite for profit. Exchange, without production, yields no profit; no growth. I may trade you nine apples for one of your apples, a deal in which you have convinced me beyond doubt is best for both of us, and in the end we still have between us ten apples. This attempted escape, however, was not an escape at all but instead served to shift the search of error and inconsistency to the confines of marginalism, and, as we have shown that it was a purely exchange driven explanation of value, financial speculative excess naturally became the issue. For where there is no production process, or when value is explained in the ct the value of which is rooted in exchange becomes more a function of the degree to which people are holding it - hoarding it - as concerns scarcity than the aggregation of marginal propensities. The recent popularity of 'behavioral' economics corresponds to this identification."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"ALWAYS GO TO THE SOURCE!!!

If you think you'll get much from this book while lying on the beach or sitting on the toilet, maybe you should be looking at Grisham or People magazine instead :)"},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This book is surprisingly easy to understand, and Smith's insights apply to current issues of taxation, globalization, and the striving of special interests. Reading the observations of someone who was a contemporary of America's founding fathers, but not one of them, gave me a new perspective on the 1700s. Passing references to the vast, but stagnant wealth of China, as well as to colonial enterprises from South America to Asia, add historical flavor to what could have been a dry summary of economic theory, but is instead a rich and colorful exposition of the world as it was.Having just spent some time in Manila earlier this year visiting historical sites and museums, I was intrigued to read about Spain's \\"Acapulco ships\\" that carried silver and other commodities from Mexico across the vast Pacific to the Philippines. Indeed, over and over I found myself putting my finger between the pages so I could daydream for a few minutes, imagining Spanish galleons loaded with treasure, or European merchants bartering and haggling. I suppose a vivid imagination helps to make any book more interesting, but this book in particular lends itself to such flights of fancy.The English of the mid- to late 1700s is not exactly the same as ours today, but it's close enough that few people will have any difficulty with the book. There are a lot of references to weights and measures of gold, silver, corn and other commodities, and their relative value to one another. Frankly, after the first few such references, I simply began skipping over them. Readers who enjoy playing with numbers in their heads may prefer to read those items carefully and playfully -- but I suspect most folks will skip across them as quickly as possible just as I did. It's not the specific values and figures that make this book so important (or enjoyable), but it's ideas about how capital flows, accumulates, is put to productive use and so on.Read this book and gain a new appreciation for the wisdom of the past, and you may also find yourself noting how ideas apply so directly to issues in today's headlines. A masterpiece not only of economics, but of prose as well."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"The Wealth of the Nations is an outstanding work of one of the most important men of the social sciences, the father of economics, Adam Smith.Although the full work is included in this book, including the often forgotten last two books of the Wealth of Nations, this edition has no introduction, and its table of contents has numbers pointing to the wrong pages.

The mind of Adam Smith is incredible, and I encourage an interested reader to duke it out as you'll most certainly come out of the book more informed. I would recommend Wealth of Nations to anyone who has a mild interest in Economics. Brian Oley"},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This book has two massive and core problems, each one of them large enough to make this book incredibly, even dangerously, misleading.The first problem of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations is not to be found in identifying all those familiar, and illogical anomalies that have been proven through experience false, and are well known (the \\"invisible hand\\" and others); nor the fact that Smith completely hides the history of his own country (how after the English civil war the English pursued an incredibly protectionist series of policies); but that all these complaints can be seen as stemming from one underlying problem in Smith's analysis: which was almost exclusively that of a micro-economist. This is highly contrary to how this book is interpreted, yet, if understood, explains many of Wealth of Nation's failings.The second major failing of this book is that through its clever wording and euphemisms it completely changed the language of economics. No longer would the British come out in direct language of their intentions in the House of Lords of the hostility and economic warfare that they were perpetually waging (and continue to wage to this day, albeit in a much different form) in open, brutal and naked language; they would do it through euphemistic and sophistical language. When we observe other methods of modern economic imperialism, the IMF for example, we see that the tools of the language that Smith pioneered have been perfected to a science - just Google the latest IMF policy papers or interviews to see what I'm talking about.To illustrate this fact in summation, rather than in a case-by-case, chapter-by-chapter disassembly that nobody would read nor would fit in this format, I'll turn to Friedrich List who illustrated these problems of Smith's \\"Wealth of Nations\\" brilliantly in his 1841 book \\"The National System of Political Economy\\". For the sake of brevity, I'll only include List shining a light to the later of these two problems, that is, the total obfuscation of the language of economics post-Wealth of Nations.\\"...The ministers of George I in 1721 openly declared, on the occasion of the prohibition of the importation of the manufactures of India, that it was clear that a nation could only become wealthy and powerful if she imported raw materials and exported manufactured goods. Even in the times of Lords Chatham and North, they did not hesitate to declare in open Parliament that it ought not to be permitted that even a single horse-shoe nail should be manufactured in North America. In Adam's Smith's time, a new maxim was for the first time added to those which we have above stated, namely, to conceal the true policy of England under the cosmopolitical expressions and arguments which Adam Smith had discovered, in order to induce foreign nations to imitate that policy.It is very common clever device that when anyone has attained the summit of greatness, he kicks away the ladder by which he has climbed up, in order to deprive others of the means of climbing up after him. In this lies the secret of the cosmopolitical doctrine of Adam Smith, and of the cosmopolitical doctrine of Adam Smith, and of the cosmopolitical tendencies of his great contemporary William Pitt, and of all his successors in the British Government administrations.Any nation which by means of protective duties and restrictions on navigation has raised her manufacturing power and her navigation to such a degree of development that no other nation can sustain free competition with her, can do nothing wiser that throw away these ladders of her greatness, to preach to other nations the benefits of free trade, and to declare in penitent tones that she has hitherto wandered in the paths of error, and has now for the first time succeeded in discovering the truth.William Pitt was the first English statesmen who clearly perceived in what way the cosmopolitcal theory of Adam Smith could be properly made use of, and not in vain did he himself carry about a copy of the work on the Wealth of Nations. His speech in 1786, which was addressed neither to Parliament nor to the nation, but clearly to the ears of the statesmen of France, who were destitute of all experience and favour of the Eden Treaty, is an excellent specimen of Smith's style of reasoning. By nature he said France was adapted for agriculture and the production of wine, as England was thus adapted to manufacturing production. These nations ought to act towards one another just as two great merchants would do who carry on different branches of trade and who reciprocally enrich one another by the exchange of goods. Not a word here of the old maxim of England, that a nation can only attain to the highest degree of wealth and power in her foreign trade by the exchange of manufactured products against agricultural products and raw materials. This maxim was then, and has remained since, and English State secret; it was never again openly professed, but was all the more persistently followed.\\"-Friedrich List, 1841 Political EconomyWe can all agree that certain areas are more suitable to certain types of farming, but what does it mean that \\"England was thus adapted to manufacturing production\\"? As if, while grapes to make wine sprung from the earth in France, fully formed factories were springing from the earth in England and that each nation should therefore simply take what was provided to them. This sheer nonsense was later refined and perfected by such degenerates as J.B. Say and, of course, David Ricardo.As a book that professes to explain macro-economics \\"Wealth of Nations\\" is a catastrophic failure. And this explains a lot of why the modern schools of economics that build their edifice upon this \\"foundation\\" are so worthless at creating prosperity, progress, predicting anything of any merit, etc. This book originated, insofar as I am aware, the idea of looking at The Market and The State as a dichotomy rather than as using an observational and scientific approach, which concludes that looking at Macro-economics with anything other than the role of modern Nation-State at its primary focus is pure folly. Friedrich List defines Smith's work brilliantly when identifies \\"Wealth of Nations\\" as the \\"economics of a shop-keeper\\" - that is, a focus on the exchange of value rather than the creation of value. What a different world we would live in if List was widely read and understood; for List's work is infinitely more adept at explaining how productive forces come into being and how macro-economies function than Smith. Adam Smith's work, the State is giving the far back-seat in favor of The Market that Smith mythologized and the legendary Individual (Man, as such) that Smith makes so popular. There are many books that dispel this nonsensical view from simply observing the historical record, read \\"Debt\\" by David Graeber or Friedrich List's \\"Political Economy\\" (I recommend both, but the latter book much more so). If you accept the major tenants of this book as they have been popularized then you will be yet another anti-historical fool, but don't worry, you'll have plenty of company.However, for many things, Smith's micro-approach is very good and yields usable information and therefore shouldn't be completely disregarded. But drawing the line of what is useful and what is fantasy in this book is no easy task for those that don't read an incredible amount of economics books or who's minds haven't already been turned to mush from an \\"education\\" (indoctrination) in modern economics. It is this very reason that I, reluctantly in spite of this books merits, give it 1 star.If you are going to read this book then you should read the other side of the argument and give it fair consideration. The \\"other side\\" (that is, the objective, factually based one that is derived from historical observation) from what Smith professes can be found with the following authors: Daniel Raymond, John Barnard Byle, Willard Phillips, Friedrich List, Webster G. Tarpley, Ha-Joon Chang, Steve Keen, Michael Hudson, Herman Finer, Heikki Patomaki, John Quiggin, Les Leopold, and of course Alexander Hamilton."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"I ordered this book for my son.

Rodham."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Adam Smith's \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" has led U.S. trade policy for decades, if not longer. Voter thinking 11/03/09 focused on jobs and the economy, and sent a clear message of dissatisfaction with economic progress to-date. Smith's recommendations have had a large role in creating that dissatisfaction. Private sector employment has dropped since 2000, home ownership and median family income are down since 1998 and the proportion living in poverty has risen. The topic's importance was re-emphasized 11/06/2009 with the release of data showing the unemployment rate continuing to climb - now 10.2% (not counting those who have given up looking, or are working only part-time). Adam Smith and Free Enterprise are not working; meanwhile, China's GDP is growing 8.5%.Reinvigorating Main Street America's employment picture, however, will not be easy. Problems have been building for years, long before the sub-prime crisis. Some believe automation is the major source of recent job losses. However, it is difficult to look at the constant parade of long trains carrying shipping containers inland, or the millions of illegals turning up all across America, and conclude that this is the case. Substantial improvement on Main Street will primarily require drastically limiting Smith's 'Free Trade.' Free Trade supporters repeatedly cite the imposition of Smoot-Hawley tariffs as substantially deepening and prolonging the Great Depression, and conclude that we must not turn protectionist. Reality, however, is that prior to Smoot-Hawley, the 1929 Trade Surplus was an insignificant 0.38% of our GDP, and could not possibly have had significant impact even if lost entirely. True, international trade plays a much bigger role than in 1930 - however, the fact that we've run large and increasing trade deficits for decades is prima-facie evidence that eg. no trade whatsoever would at least stop the bleeding.As for Adam Smith's famous Free Trade support, that occurred 200+ years ago - before across-the-board very large and low-cost competitors like China, India, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam, the Internet, jet planes, and massive cargo ships made a much large proportion of economies vulnerable to offshoring than ever before. We need to also remember that protectionism is what allowed the U.S. and its new Asian competitors to achieve their original economic strength. (Smith himself warned against taking Free Trade too far - such that a nation's security was endangered.)Free Trade defenders might assert that manufacturing and IT have borne the brunt of offshoring to date, and their future offshoring is not likely to increase. Recent trends and data, however, suggest service jobs will increasingly also become affected. American firms are already establishing R&D; facilities in China; Asian competitors not only have a cost advantage competing for engineering work, they also have the advantage of greater experience in production gained through producing our manufactures. Unfortunately, this also provides them with a natural lead-in to new areas - eg. offshored CRT-tube manufacturing experience helped Asians in new areas of plasma, LCD, photovoltaic, solar, and LED screen development and manufacturing, and this trend probably will extend into nanotubes as well. Data reported in Business Week's 11/09/2009 issue confirms the shift - over the past year, U.S. employment of scientists and engineers has fallen by 6.3%, while overall employment has fallen only 4.1%.Proposed U.S. economic remedies frequently suggest increasing the proportion of Americans receiving college degrees as a defense against offshoring. Alan Blinder, former Federal Reserve Vice-Chairman and current economics professor at Princeton, warns that the key distinction in whether a job is likely to be offshored or not will be in whether a particular service is delivered in person (haircuts, brain surgery) or not (computer programing) - not whether it is education intensive. (Elective brain surgery can also be offshored.) Thus, a college degree may no longer be a panacea. Blinder also believes it is quite likely that offshoring (unless changed) will depress the real wages of many U.S. workers who do not lose their jobs, the offshoring transition will continue for 2 - 3 decades and bring gross potential job losses in the range of 30- 40 million, and that American standards of living will decline. Proposals by still others to deal with offshoring job losses via more jobs in high-tech areas (eg. biotechnology) become ludicrous when viewed in the light of these numbers. Professor Blinder's suggestion makes much more sense - increased vocational education.Additionally, some Free Trade defenders contend that Chinese labor costs will soon become non-competitive. There are two problems with relying on this 'defense:' 1)Chinese productivity has also increased considerably. Economist Steven Roach (author of \\"The Next Asia\\") lives and works in China and reports that productivity in China's industrial sector surged nearly 20%/year from 2000-2004. Further, even after six years of double-digit increases, average hourly compensation for Chinese manufacturing workers was only 3% that of the U.S. average in 2004. (It's difficult to get reliable up-to-date information on China.) 2)By 2020 it is estimated that there will be 553 million non-agricultural workers in China - 100 million more than in all the developed world, according to Martin Jacques in \\"When China Rules the World.\\"Others contend that China cannot continue its rapid economic growth without Democracy, something it shows few signs of doing. Jacques, on the other hand, provides data showing that most Chinese believe the political climate has improved since 1989 (Tienanmen Square), and 72% of its population are satisfied with the condition of the country vs. only 39% in the U.S. (As for the widely reported large number of civil disturbances within China reported each year, Jacques contends most have nothing to do with the central government - eg. local land issues.)Finally, there is the large and growing problem of illegal immigrants taking jobs from American citizens. The U.S. already has enough problems finding work for its own citizens, and the problems are going to become much more severe via currently unfettered offshoring. It is numerically impossible for the U.S. to also provide jobs for the current number of illegal immigrants from Mexico, Central, and South America - we must sharply reduce the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S.Bottom Line: Main Street America cannot withstand continually losing jobs to Free Trade, illegal workers, and automation. Wall Street, on the other hand, has benefited immensely from these job losses and shows no signs of changing direction. The recent financial crisis clearly demonstrated that financial markets are not self-correcting, and that Adam Smith's 'invisible hand' is not infallible. Immediate government redirection is required."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"I bought this book because it seems like a must read for anyone interested in business and economics.

Penguin splits it up into two physical books; the Bantam edition is only 7\\" tall and over 1200 pages long - not made to hold up to multiple reads. Not that I will be reading and re-reading the book right away, but a sturdy durable binding is well appreciated.

Having read it with great ignorance on the subject was able to learn a great deal about economic principles with more depth than \\"supply and demand dictate price\\". I found the ideas behind taxing to be simple but effective given their presentation as well as Smith's arguements for a free market economy. Reading this historical text has also helped placed into context his arguemnts against the mercantile system and the taxing of the American colonies because the depth that he goes into about said subjects is more than any history class that I have taken has allotted. For some the wording may seem dated or old or borring but for those who enjoy a more analytical style or writing, such as the style used in the translations of Roman philosophy texts, the writing style should not be a problem. The most intimidating aspect of this book is its size, an aspect which can easily be overcome if the reader finds the text engaging for the above reason. While I cannot say that it is a \\"must read\\" or a \\"required read\\" for an understanding of economics simply because of the ignorance which I still possess on the subject, I can say that it is an informative read that explains in depth, using cited examples, areas of economics that are easy to grasp if the reader enjoys the text.

To minimize repetition, the differences for this version: This massive book is complete and unabridged (all five books). There is a great added feature in the form of small summary notes in the margin that accompany each paragraph. Adam Smith was a masterful writer of prose and communicates some of the most important economic and philosophical ideas in the history of western civilization. Economic theory never read so beautifully.An interesting choice for an introduction is Robert Reich. He is one of the few intellectuals from the left, and while I disagree with him more often than not, I respect his thought process. He offers his interpretation of Smith and how the ideas found in TWoN fit neatly with his positions. Selective reasoning or not, Reich does offer a nice summary line: \\"In these times, as when Adam Smith wrote, it is important to remind ourselves of the revolutionary notion at the heart of Smith's opus-that the wealth of a nation is measured not by its accumulated riches, but by the productivity and living standards of all its people.\\" Nicely said and I agree. I just disagree with Reich and his ilk on how the \\"wealth\\" of the modern nation is achieved. Adam Smith offers the roadmap, but it is up to us to keep lawmakers in DC or [insert any central government here] from regulating and taxing us to death --relegating Smith's work to the dust bin."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"\\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is more readable than you probably think, and if you actually sit down to it you'll be repeatedly astounded by Smith's shrewdness.But parts of Smith's original can be tough going in many ways. Why don't publishers acknowledge this by coming out with something more helpful than just the raw text?Unfortunately, finding an edition that will be of great use to you is problematic. That's why I'm giving this book 1 star: not for the text itself, but rather for the paucity of well-done printings out there.Anyhow. I have three before me:1. The \\"Modern Library Classics\\" edition, the one you see on this page. This is complete and unabridged in a single volume, and has a handsome, sturdy feel to it. There is a 4-page introduction and a well-done index, but what irks about this edition is that while it has a plethora of footnotes, all the footnotes are of the \\"textual comparison\\" variety (e.g., \\"12 Car. II., C. 32\\"), rather than the kind that really help you understand antiquated terms and convoluted wordings. In other words, you'll get no help from the editors here.2. Then there is the barrenWealth of Nations (Great Minds Series). There is a 2-page introduction at the beginning and an index, but beyond that it's nothing more than the original text, complete with the original punctuation and spellings (neither of which has been made more merciful for the modern reader).3. The Penguin Classics edition, in two volumes:The Wealth of Nations: Books 1-3 (Penguin Classics)andThe Wealth of Nations, Books IV-V (Penguin Classics). This is probably the least worst edition I have seen, with a superb introduction (nearly 100 pages long), and a glossary, all done by Glasgow's Andrew Skinner. But the only footnotes in the text itself are apparently Smith's own. They appear directly on the bottom of the page in question.So good luck, whichever one you choose.In case you need to know, Smith's original consists of five long chapters, or \\"books.\\"If anybody has a more respectable edition at hand, please comment and I'll incorporate it into this review."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"To be an economist without having read \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is like being a priest without having read the Bible. As is often the case with second hand accounts, textbooks have distorted and watered down Adam Smith. Going back to the original text is both refreshing and enlightening.The \\"Wealth of Nations\\" remains the most truthful defense of the economic science. But remember that Adam Smith also wrote \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\"; for Smith, economics was a search to better people's life rather than simply a quest to optimize mathematical functions or estimate variables using econometric models.To simply associate Smith with expressions such as the \\"invisible hand,\\" does not do him justice. Take, for example, the opening chapter on the division of labor: first, Smith defends the division of labor as being efficient; then, he defends it as an essential component of the freedom to allocate one's labor to one's talents; finally, he links the division of labor to trade: without the freedom to exchange the fruits of one's labor, the division of labor is meaningless. The point is that Adam Smith defends the rationale for the market, rather than just explain its mechanics.Anyone studying economics in school would think that economics is all about efficiency; this preoccupation, inevitably, breeds economists who support the market simply because it works. But to read Adam Smith is to enter the realm of an economic science where the ultimate benchmark is not efficiency but human freedom and welfare. That is, probably, what Smith would remark if he were to sit in an economics class today, and why the \\"Wealth of Nations\\" is as revolutionary today as it was two centuries ago."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Another reviewer is correct in that there are SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS of the book missing in the Great Minds Series (green and black cover). In one instance, I noted that 150 pages were converted into 14! Also, Book IV Chapter VII is missing parts 2 and 3 (also quite lengthy portions of the piece). Go with a complete version if you're going to bother to tackle this book, or especially if you are focussing on one particular idea (since that may be one that they cut out!)...Smith may be wordy, but to cut out such an enormous amount degrades the integrity of the work. Shameful to nowhere state that LARGE chunks of this classic are absent...at least be forthcoming!If you choose a more complete version you'll get to read a classic from a better economist than a writer, but still a fantastic piece of work. Smith does tend to try to overexplain things, but you get use to his style and can appreciate that he just wants to make sure that you get his point.AMMENDMENT:Upon discussion with my Economics professor, it is possible that this green book was one of the author's first versions (which he apparently edited and added to more than once). I still say that the publisher should be more clear about the version, and that if you want his most recent updates and complete work, to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"The Wealth of Nations handles a lot of economical phenomena in a concrete but sometimes complex way. On one hand the book is filled with ideas, some convincing, some out-dated, some fundamental to the current believe in free-markets. These ideas are combined with appealing (or appalling) examples of the injustice done to people by disturbing the free-market. On the other hand however, I find that certain sections of the book require a lot of concentration. The book is an interesting, but slow and at times difficult, read.Essentially, it is a treatise on the power of individuals to maximise their own wealth and therefor a support for the natural liberty of men and an argument for free-markets. Not as a perfect system in which there will be no misery, but as a system that gives individuals the greatest (and most just) opportunity to gain happiness and which will be the quickest to respond to changes in supply and demand (and therefor decrease the misery which is created when governments ignore gaps between supply and demand).It is not a book that believes in the pure goodness of companies (but explicitly states that companies have a interest which is directly opposite to that of society as a whole. I.e. the interest of companies is to create a supply shortage so they can ask prices above costprice), but says that the best way to break the power of these companies is the allow free competition. It also reveals that political decisions that at fist glance seems compassionate, might in fact be inhumane, cruel and the cause of much suffering (because on the long run they lead to a supply shortage). The examples given here, are still relevant to view the decisions made by politicians in today's so-called free market countries.Comment on review of Micheal Brady, june 13 2005:Brady remarks that Smith was the first opponent of globalization. The (strange) evidence he gives to support this statement is that Smith supports the use of counter tariffs, if (and only if) this might lead to the removal of the initial tariff. This statement clearly shows that Smith was against protectionist measures like tariffs and only condoned them if in the short run they would lead to less protectionism and therefor more globalization! Brady also supports his statement by mentioning that Smith opposed any offshoring if the purpose of such offshoring was to supply the home market. The keyword here again being \\"if\\". Smith was against a nation stimulating offshoring because he saw no national gain. This however doesn't mean that governments should restrict labor/capital mobility, because this would go against the natural liberty of men."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Adam Smith's \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is one those great Classics that almost everyone should read.

This version is scanned in using OCR technology (and using pretty poor quality OCR scanning equipment and software from the look of their books), is overall of very poor print quality, uses automated reproduction with no index, no illustrations and an excessive number of typos.Lest you doubt, here's some word for word quotes from the publisher's own web site:\\"We created your book using OCR software that includes an automated spell check. Our OCR software is 99 percent accurate if the book is in good condition. However, with up to 3,500 characters per page, even one percent can be an annoying number of typos....\\"\\"After we re-typeset and designed your book, the page numbers change so the old index and table of contents no longer work. Therefore, we usually remove them. Since many of our books only sell a couple of copies, manually creating a new index and table of contents could add more than a hundred dollars to the cover price....\\"\\"Our OCR software can't distinguish between an illustration and a smudge or library stamp so it ignores everything except type. We would really like to manually scan and add the illustrations. But many of our books only sell a couple of copies....\\"\\"We created your book using a robot who turned and photographed each page. Our robot is 99 percent accurate. But sometimes two pages stick together. And sometimes a page may even be missing from our copy of the book. We would really like to manually scan each page and buy multiple copies of each original. But many of our books only sell a couple of copies.....\\"For the buyer that's not aware of this publisher this can result in a rather unfortunate purchasing decision as General Books LLC are all poor quality, tiny (almost unreadable) fonts and they don't bother to reproduce little things like Table of Contents or Indexes.A good rule of thumb for these Print on Demand publishers is to take a look at the cover - if it's a good quality illustration that reflects the content, there's a table of contents, and when you do the Look Inside thing there's no disclaimer saying you're looking at another version of the book, and they've stated that they used facsimile reproduction technology (rather than OCR), it's usually a pretty safe bet. Conversely, if any of these are missing, you're taking a chance on the quality. I've bought a few based on my selection criteria above and they've been good quality. General Books LLC however, is a publisher to steer clear of at all costs.If you have been unfortunate enough to buy the General Books LLC version by mistake, you can return to Amazon for a full refund (but check Amazon's return policy and process first)."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Indeed this is true, [200 year old economics books are still relevant], but we miss half the value of the Wealth of Nations, if we do not also struggle through the turgid prose of the book he wrote 10 years before, The Theory of Moral Sentiments -- both of which of course are available for the Kindle for $.89 each.

A must have for any autodidact or college student."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"I chose this edition after checking out three at the bookstore because:* Ingenious editor Edwin Cannan (God bless him!) was well-versed in each of the five editions that were published while the author was alive. Cannan treats us to a lengthy (63 page) introduction which includes a feisty justification of why this edition is put together precisely the way it is, including an authoritative history of those first five editions, with comparisons and contrasts. Once the book itself starts, Canaan's input is non-invasive; I felt that he was sitting silently and attentively in the wings, like a stage director overseeing a play.* The original wording is preserved, augmented by explanatory conventional bottom-of-the-page footnotes. Cannan's edits (mostly to correct typos and make clarifications) are most welcome, and even the typographical errors are preserved verbatim in footnotes. An example of a clarification: the author's mention of a \\"fire-engine\\" had me thinking of a horse-drawn vehicle for putting out fires. Cannan's footnote: \\"I.e., steam engine.\\"* The English usage of two centuries ago is a novelty, and much easier to follow than I had expected.* The author's original footnotes are exactly where he placed them: in little insets around the page.As for the content itself, the prevalence of Smith's ideas in modern treatises such asBasic Economicsis startling! (I recommendBasic Economicsas a first book on Economics, by the way.) I got MANY insights into the beginnings of America and what was going on in the world at the time this was published. I now understand why towns formed along sea coasts and waterways: it was much more efficient to transport goods via water than by land. Forget Economics for a second: any general historian would be remiss without reading this."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Alfred North Whitehead famously stated that all of Western philosophy was merely a footnote to Plato. It seems to me one could say the same thing about economics in regard to Adam Smith. There were certainly economists before Adam Smith (just as there were philosophers before Plato); and there are some, I am sure, who will claim that some of the economists writing before Adam Smith were actually superior to Adam Smith in some ways (just as there are philosophers who prefer the pre-Socratics to Plato).But Adam Smith, like Plato, was able in his work to define a relevant set of problems which to a large degree are the same problems that are still being dealt with, and debated, within economics today; and, like Plato, the work of Adam Smith has been the source for various strands, or schools of economic thought, each of which finds its ground in a different aspect of Adam Smith's work. Adam Smith's analysis of the division of labor (the productive forces of society), his adherence to a labor theory of value (at least in part) and his distinction between productive and unproductive labor have been sources for the tradition of economic thought following Ricardo and Marx; while Adam Smith's analysis of the benefits of laissez-faire economic policies, his analysis of exchange, and determination of price through supply and demand, have been sources for the Neo-classical, marginalist, and free-market strands of economic thought.Adam Smith sees the wealth of a nation as consisting in its annual produce (what we today would call GDP). This is the central idea behind the whole book and is Adam Smith's major innovation in regard to previous economic thought (as I understand it). Adam Smith will evaluate the harm or the benefit of various economic policies by attempting to determine the over-all effect each policy will have on the annual produce of society as a whole. If a policy increases this annual produce then it is beneficial to society as a whole. If a policy decreases this annual produce then it is harmful to society as a whole. This is still, to a large degree, the measure we use when evaluating the effects of a given economic policy, though we are perhaps beginning to see that the benefit or harm of a given policy cannot be reduced to its effect on annual produce or GDP (environmental effects, for instance, effect society as a whole and have to be measured against effects on GDP in determining the costs and benefits of any economic policy).With few exceptions Adam Smith believes that laissez-faire policies are the best policies for increasing the over-all wealth of a nation and he bases his argument on his notion of the \`invisible hand'. This is another one of Smith's important theoretical innovations; the notion that each individual, by pursuing their own interest, without any thought or conscious plan for society as a whole, does not lead to chaos but tends, as if guided by an invisible hand, towards a maximization of the yearly annual produce of a nation. It is not necessary for society to \`plan' for this outcome in a conscious way; in fact, no amount of conscious planning could improve on the outcome produced by simply allowing individuals to pursue their own interests unfettered by government. This has been one of the most influential ideas ever put forward by anyone since the beginning of human history, whether for good or ill.So there are a number of reasons why anyone who is interested in economics should study The Wealth of Nations. First, Adam Smith defines a common set of problems which to a large degree are problems that economists are still trying to solve to this day (in the same way that Plato determined a common set of problems that still occupy philosophers to this day). Second, some of Adam Smith's ideas have been extremely influential on all subsequent debate and are still used in policy debates to this day. People still use the notion of the invisible hand to argue for the benefits of free-trade for instance. It is important, therefore, to understand how the invisible hand is supposed to work and what the benefits of allowing it to work are supposed to be. And third, Adam Smith is one of the most accessible and readable economists who ever wrote. You do not have to be a trained economist (I am not) to benefit from reading this work.So I fully recommend this work to anyone interested in economics or social and political philosophy."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"\\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is a big book of economics, history, philosophy, and social criticism. It is much more than Adam Smith neckties at GOP conventions. It is much more than a reverential nod or two in modern econ textbooks. Econ students need to read it to see where their discipline came from and what it could be again.Dickey's abridgment reproduces enough of the text (about 25 percent) to convey the depth of Smith's erudition and the diversity of his interests. Unfortunately, the editorial apparatus is weak. The Comments are few in number and incredibly brief, and the short Preface fails to put the book into historical and intellectual context. Dickey does offer four appendices but these deal with specialized topics rather than the big picture.Bottom line: this edition is inexpensive but is probably not the best one for students."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"The Scottish Adam Smith is certainly the most important economists of all times and is the founder of modern economic thought, being &quot;The Wealth of the Nations&quot; his major work, where he introduces to the general public of his time - the book was first published in 1776 - new concepts and ideas as &quot;competitive advantage&quot;, &quot;divison of labour&quot;, &quot;the power of the invisible hand&quot;, and many others still powerfull today, even accounting for the changes happened in the world economy and politics. From this starting point, a crucial juncture in the world economy, that is, the beginning of the industrialisation in England, many renowed economists and social scientists construed their theories. To name a few? Karl Marx, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill and many others acknowledge the importance of Adam Smith's work to their theories. Besides this opus, he did a lot in the field of philosophy, but was to become known as the father of the Classic school of economics. One of not so many Economics excelent Classic books to read. Enjoy it."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This book is so widely cited and interpreted contrary to the author's original thought, that every economist should read it completely to avoid being misled by such incorrect interpretations.First, let us take the \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor. When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist. You can get an audio version of this book to avoid lengthy read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Hello,I made the mistake of buying a differnt kindle version of this book.

Thank You.Joe"},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"The Wealth of Nations is one of the most important books ever written. In some respects the Wealth of Nations was a tract for the times. Smith penned a crippling critique of the mercantilist \`Policy of Europe'. Smith, along with David Hume and David Ricardo, refuted the mercantilist case for protectionism. Much of what we read in this book is still taught in modern economics classes. Modern day protectionists still have no answer to the principles of absolute and comparative advantage, and for the basic logic of Hume's specie flow mechanism.Smith was more than an ordinary economist. He was a visionary who saw some of the potential for progress through Globalization. Perhaps the most important concept of this book is the dynamics between division of labor, labor productivity, and the extent of markets. Smith conceived of Globalization as a process that would raise productivity as local markets expanded to national and then international scope. His example of division of labor in a pin factory is simple, but illustrative.The most widely known part of this book is that part of the \`invisible hand of markets'. Invisible hand reasoning still pervades modern economic theory, though there are some variations in how economists interpret this concept. Smith does differ from Modern economists on certain issues. Smith thought of competition as a process and of monopoly as a government grant of privilege. In these areas Smith was ahead of many modern economists. Smith also explained market prices in terms of labor content. Here is Smith's great error. Labor value theory set economics on the wrong course. Labor value theory served as the basis for Marxism. This, of course, indicates the great influence of The Wealth of Nations on world history. Without labor value theory the Marxist idea of exploitation falls apart. Smith therefore played a posthumous role in twentieth century history, especially from 1918 to 1991. Of course, we cannot blame Smith for the misuse of his ideas. Smith would have surely opposed Marxism, had he been alive to do so.What we have in this book is a tremendous effort at discovering the proper limits between private and public institutions. Better still, Smith thought about society and institutions in evolutionary terms. This is another reason why the Wealth of Nations is preferable to modern economics texts. Smith understood the dynamics of capitalism better than many modern economists- who focus on static math models. Smith also influenced Charles Darwin with his ideas of social evolution. There is much evidence indicating that Darwin got the idea for the evolution of species by reading The Wealth of Nations. Smith therefore had great influence on the biological sciences.Modern economists reject Smith labor value theory (ever since Menger refuted it in 1870). However, there is no denying the influence of The Wealth of Nations. All members of the educated public should read at least part of this book. The question then in which edition should you buy? The Liberty Classics edition is unabridged. The Modern Library Classics edition has margin notes that could be helpful. Given the affordability of these editions, you might consider have both on your bookshelf (I do). I would avoid the Great Mind Series altogether. The Wealth of Nations should be read because it is both a book of great historical importance and a good source for understanding modern Globalization. The labor value theory part precludes a five star rating, but anything less than four stars would be absurd."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"I have read WoN in three different editions and undoubtedly the best was the definitive version in the Glasgow edition of his Collected Works. This is cheaply and conveniently reporinted in the Liberty Fund edition which I recommend to anyone who is actually *studying* the text. It notes variations between different editions and has extremely useful notes which are helpful in understanding Smith's relations to his predecessors.It's an interesting book, over-quoted and under-read. Read it - all of it - and you will find a rather different argument and conclusions from that bestowed upon this classic by partisans of untrammeled free markets who trumpet some sound-bites from the book but reject Smith's underlying argument."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Adam Smith's \\"An Inquiry Into The Nature And Causes Of The Wealth Of Nations\\" (often called simply \\"The Wealth Of Nations\\") is one of two great works from the Scottish economist and philosopher, the other being the lesser known \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\". \\"The Wealth Of Nations\\" was published on March 9th, of 1776, but there were additional editions in 1778, 1784, 1786, and 1789. I read the free Kindle version of \\"The Wealth Of Nations\\", and while I do not recommend that version I do recommend the overall work.The issues with the Kindle version are that it is poorly formatted, and it is painful to attempt to read the numbers in the tables at the of Book I. You are much better off getting a hard copy so that you can more easily flip to the section of interest, and to read the information in a better format. As for the rest, the content is all there, once you get past the poor formatting.The work contains five books within. The first is \\"Of the Causes of Improvement in the productive Powers of Labour\\". In this book he discusses the benefits of the division of labor, the origin and benefits of using money, a section on the \\"real\\" price of commodities (i.e. how much toil it takes to produce them), a discussion of the natural and market prices of commodities (the forces of supply and demand), the effect of controlling a commodity can have on the price, the wages of labor (again a case of supply and demand with the commodity of labor), the profits of stock, a discussion of the ill effects of groups who use their influence to manipulate the government (this would include banking conglomerations, trade unions, etc.), and closes with a section on rent.The second book is \\"Of the Nature, Accumulation, and Employment of Stock\\" which deals with accumulating wealth which lasts a longer period of time. This book starts with how one divides their stock into what they need for personal use, and what they can dispose of in exchange for others available stock. He then moves into a discussion of money as a type of stock, and then how to use their excess money/stock to gain interest.The third book is \\"Of the different Progress of Opulence in different Nations\\", where he talks about the balance between the inhabitants of towns and those of the country areas and goes into how agriculture is discouraged over time, while cities and towns prosper.The fourth book is \\"Of Systems of political Economy\\" in which Smith discusses the commercial system, along with importation which contains a detailed look at the effects of restraints on importation/exportation. Smith also discusses commerce treaties, and the role of colonies. This book also has a brief section on the agricultural system, but here he is referring to a specific system where the produce of land is the sole source of the revenue of a nationThe fifth book is \\"Of the Revenue of the Sovereign or Commonwealth\\" in which Smith deals with taxation. This is an important area to read and understand, as it is the one which many ignore when using Smith to try to support other areas. There are hints here of the progressive tax, as well as a discussion of the expenses of the nation, an important acknowledgement that the poor spend the greater part of their income on the fundamentals, such as food, and so he suggests luxury taxes as not unreasonable. Smith then closes the final book with a discussion of the costs of war, both for the actual fighting, and in terms of the loss of trade."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"while there are a few tpyos here and there, the text is both readable and compelling.

Smith has written much better in 1776 than nearly all economists do today.The marginal notes are good too. This book is a great book because it argues for some iron-hard economic rules in a way that Centre-left people, such as myself, will listen seriously to. Smith is not a neo-con by any stretch of the imagination. He speaks of employer combinations openly, whereas most economist writers won't talk about them, and he notes that combinations of employees (unions) are, in 1776, banned by the entire world. He also approves of regulations when they improve the safety of working people, something management still has a problem with.So Smith is more even handed than the right wing voices who cite his economic principles constantly, and deserves reading and citing by Centre-Left people."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Reading this reminded me of my Latin classes many years ago, trying to decipher the likes of Cicero.

Although the announcements as to the current book, volume, and section on LibriVox are tiresome, you know where you are. Tantor's edition contains absolutely no index or printed table of contents for a 29 CD set. The current location is neither announced at the beginning of each CD, nor printed anywhere on the CD. So if you were reading the book and want to listen to the rest on audiobook, you have to listen to the whole thing from the beginning. :(The reader has a nice accent though. He delivers Smith's sarcasm and indignation very well. Contrary to popular belief, Adam Smith was a bit of a radical. He adamantly reiterates that of the workers, the landowners, and the merchants (read business people), the latter are the only group who should not lead a nation because their priorites will always lead it into ruin. Based upon his theory, which is still valid, the only reason the United States' economic system has not tanked is the petrodollar.As the book progresses his radicalism becomes increasingly apparent as he expresses his low opinion of the efforts to block free trade and posh schools like Oxford University, as well as his list of alternatives of what should be done with the new American colonies. He even declares that the missionary campaigns by the Catholic church during colonialism were only a pretense to get more gold--and this was in 1776!There are also miscellaneous digressions on the history of liberal education, banking, currencies, and organized western religion. All in all an excellent way to absorb a classic while your body is occupied, but your brain would not have been doing anything productive.

There are a lot of references to issues that were occurring during Smith's time that may not seem to be pertinent to the reader, but can still be applied to modern times. I most enjoyed the last sections of the book on taxes and public debts. His 4 maxims of taxes are that they should be- equal, certain, convenient, and beneficial. He viewed inflation as \\"extremely pernicious\\". The book contains ideas that Americans should possibly revisit in the near future."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This book is so widely cited and interpreted contrary to the author's original thought, that every economist should read it completely to avoid being misled by such incorrect interpretations.First, let us take the \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor. When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist. You can get an audio version of this book to avoid lengthy read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This book is filled with great information you will find useful as well as having to find new things you never knew about.

For this reason I have marked it down to three stars. Smith is necessary reading for anyone interested in the history of Western thought, the Enlightenment or economics, but it must be said that it is dry, if admirably clear, reading and difficult to chew and swallow. For that reason, it is disappointing to get so far in and then find that one is not getting the complete work.There can be few books that have had such lasting influence on the cultural milieu. Unlike Marx, Smith's ideas seem to have stood up to the tide of history without being washed away, although I write at a time when the finance system appears to have just collapsed, so who knows how a little more history will judge it. At any rate, the correctness of Smith's ideas is perhaps of less import for the student of Western thought than its place in the emergence of a rationalist, secular culture. For Smith was part of the conscious project of the Enlightenment to introduce naturalistic models of our world in place of the magical thinking, in the form of divine providence, which preceded it. Smith was building a model of economy which did not rely on an external, disembodied agency but which emerged deterministically and reached equilibrium through the rule-based interactions of its component parts. His \\"invisible hand\\" replaced another.At the same time, he was making a case for personal autonomy and the right of economic self-determination. As such, Smith combines the two most salient threads of the Enlightenment project - liberation from authority and liberation from magic. More than perhaps any other Enlightenment figure, Smith has shaped the way we think as a political culture today. As such, one must read this book to understand the legacy of the Enlightenment. It is hard going, as he was a very thorough worker and this is economics, the most dismal of sciences, but indispensable.There is one misconception that this reading corrected for me which I ought to share, and that concerns Smith's alleged scepticism about \\"corporations\\". For Smith, and presumably for his contemporaries, this did not, as I thought, indicate opposition to public companies and multinationals in the way we would currently understand it. Rather, he referred to, and condemned, the system of closed trades and apprenticeships by which the market for certain trades was until recently widely protected from competition. I demur from taking sides in this, but it is important to mention the misunderstanding which arises out of the word \\"corporation\\", incautiously read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Buy the Liberty Fund Glasgow edition instead of this.

Adam Smith did not found economics, and The Wealth of Nations is not a must-read. It is not the first or best case for economic liberalism, or even the best case of its time.While Adam Smith's work was a much-needed rebuke to mercantilism, it was in many ways a step back from what had already been written on economics by the School of Salamanca in the 16th Century,Richard Cantillonin 1730, andAnne Robert Jacques Turgotin 1766. It was even a step back from his own previous work, including theLectures on JurisprudenceandThe Theory of Moral Sentiments. Smith's analysis contains many serious errors that would lay the foundation for Marxism, notably his crude labour theory of value (as opposed to marginal utility), his exaggeration of the importance of the division of labour (putting in the shade such critical factors as capital accumulation and the growth of technological knowledge), his identification of some innate \\"propensity to truck, barter and exchange\\" as the cause of the division of labour (rather than differences in ability), and his adoption of the dubious Physiocratic concept of \\"unproductive labour.\\"An economist won't benefit from reading Adam Smith any more than a physicist would benefit from reading Aristotle.

He explained that all work had to behighly organized in order to be productive. In addition, herecognized that machinery facilitated work. This notion servesas an important foundation for more modern patent practice.He praised the ingenuity of inventors and makers of newmachinery. The author spoke of increased production as acondition precedent to enhancing the power of labor. From thisprecept, he explained that the size of a market would dictatethe division of its constituent labor. For instance, a smallcommunity in the suburbs might be serviced by a local&quot;General Store&quot;; whereas, a county in a large city would beserviced by a retail chain store with hundreds of employeesand a highly sophisticated management structure.In Adam Smith'stime, metals were popular in the manufacture of commodities.Problems were encountered in weighing the metals and arrivingat a uniform system of metrics. The theory of pricing wasa function of the toil needed to purchase a good. For instance,the price of an auto was a function of the many hours of labornecessary to earn the money to buy the car. In addition, the price of an item was related to its constituent parts.For instance, the price of linen was a function of the laborof the flaxdresser, spinner, weaver, bleacher and overallemployer. The natural price varied with the price of componentparts. For instance, if the semiconductor was reduced significantly in price- then the overall price of an electronicappliance would go down. Adam Smith saw labour as a functionof national wealth. He recognized that laborers had to earnmore than a mere subsistence in order to live dignified lives.He told a story of a mother in the Highlands of Scotland whohad to raise 20 children so that 2 would survive. Presumably,18 children would die from various diseases and poverty.The interest rates at the time were low. In England, rateshovered at 5%. In France, the rates were 3-5% . The governmentcould borrow at 2% in Holland.Adam Smith defined a wage as a function of the following:o the ease or hardship to do workConsider the case of a diamond cutter. The art of cutting adiamond is a precise process which requires extensive trainingand expert worksmanship. The demand for precious stones was afunction of their inherent beauty, scarcity and workmanshipinvolved in polishing them and preparing them for commercial use.o the difficulty and expense of learning a tradeA skilled surgeon required years of medical training and along apprenticeship in anatomy and surgery.o the constancy of employmento the trust reposed in the workpeopleConsider the case of a landowner who took a year-long vacationto the Orient. He/she would leave behind a manager to run theentire business on a 24/7 basis. This high degree of trustreposed in the workperson required a commensurate compensation.o probability of success or failure of the ventureConsider the effort required to cross the Atlantic. The tripwas lengthy, dangerous and prone to failure due to the vagariesof nature, pirating on the high seas and disease. Naturally,a worker had to receive a greater compensation to take thesefactors into consideration.o the danger inherent in doing the workConsider the danger inherent in entering a diamond mine.The possibility of collapse was a constant threat. Accordingly,workers were compensated commensurate with the threat level.Adam Smith explained that fear of misfortune dampened the takingof risks. He knew (intuitively) that investors were risk averse.In addition, there was a restriction on training new labor.In Sheffield, no master cutter could train more than a singlecutter . Apprenticeships were lengthy. i.e. 7 years in lengthAdam Smith explained that food was a source of rent to thelandowners. The pricing of metals was a function of the pricein the most fertile mine in the world. Whatever increased thefertility of the land increased its value by implication.Markets in foodstuffs were restricted because refrigerationdid not exist until motors and condensers were perfected.Essentially, there were no operable refrigerators until thefamous Clausius statement was perfected in the engineeringsciences.Accordingly, the market for butcher's meat was confined to thecountry of origin. Wool and raw hide could be transported;however, meat was consumed locally as its shelf-life was limited.The value of money was a function of the value of annual produce.Accordingly, increased quantities of commodities raised thevalue of money. Low fixed rates of interest promoted businessand discouraged usury. Riches were a function of the annualproduce which created the wealth and supported the tax base.High duties were enforced to protect the local markets. Treatiesbetween countries helped local merchants to craft meaningfultrade sequences. Exports were encouraged . The expense oferecting public works was a function of the taxes raised on theland and the proportion of yield from the crops.Governments granted bounties to merchants who wanted to selloverseas in order to assist them in making a profit anddefraying costs/risks. This work is a classic in theoreticaland practical economics.

That tradition later found expression in Adam Smith's \\"Wealth of Nations\\" in which is posited a \\"rational self-interest\\" operating as an \\"invisible hand\\" upon \\"free markets\\". Recent accounting crimes and corporate scandals, however, amount to enormous empirical evidence that \\"laissez faire\\" capitalism is a myth and the \\"invisible hand\\" is mere \\"wishful thinking\\".It is obvious that there is no \\"invisible hand\\" which militates against crooks, charlatans, and fast buck artists now seen to have firmly ensconced themselves as much in the board rooms as among sleazy fly-by-nighters.Markets left to their own devices trend toward oligopoly in which oligarchs effect political plutocracy through the exercise of sheer political muscle, intimidation, fraud, and outright bribery.If there is an \\"invisible hand\\", it has never moderated the rich and powerful. If a ruling cabal is to be moderated it must be done by political action.This is less a criticism of Smith himself than of modern economic conservatives and/or 'supply-siders' who find in Smith --ex post facto --a rationalization for rapacious and monopolistic behavior. Smith is no more to be faulted for this than Darwin should be faulted for the excesses of \\"Social Darwinism\\" --neither Social nor Darwin. \\"Social Darwinists\\" are most often associated with the age of the Robber Barons, providing them an ideological bias that justifies all manner of corporate crookedness and sleazy practices.To his credit, Smith himself feared the rise of monopoly power --a fear which modern conservative commentary either does not understand or omits entirely.The picture is complicated, however by Immanuel Kant who assailed the pursuit of self interest in favor of \\"good in and of itself\\" --a \\"categorical imperative\\". It is a moral standard that no one, of course, can live up to. Nevertheless, Kant became the other great influence upon American conservative thought --though I cannot give most contemporary conservatives credit for having actually read Kant or, for that matter, understanding him.Yet --Kant may be found lurking beneath the ideological surface of the extreme right-wing and the religious right which seeks to impose upon us a \\"transcendental\\" reality and morality whether we like it or not.It is unfortunate that Kant himself defined this \\"transcendent reality\\" --which he calls the noumena --as being unknowable. If follows, by definition, that one cannot make meaningful statements about it, but that has not kept righteous ideologues from deducing from this \\"unknowable\\" value judgments and imposing those values judgments on others. By definition, nothing meaningful can be said about whatever is \\"unknowable\\"!We are given a choice of two mutually exclusive alternatives: \\"selfishness\\" or \\"selfless transcendentalism\\". Neither position, however, is entirely true and neither is completely understood even by the conservative mentality that espouses them. Adam Smith's \\"invisible hand\\" is no more valid than Laffer's \\"trickle down\\" theory and it is highly doubtful that even Kant lived up to his own moral dictum --though I credit Kant with sincerity but doubt it among his followers. I rather think that \\"mankind\\" is neither entirely selfish or entirely selfless.The truth is most likely found in the middle. The work of mathematician John Nash, celebrated of late in the motion picture \\"A Beautiful Mind\\", wrote a brilliant paper on \\"binding agreements\\" that casts grave doubts upon many \\"conservative\\" fables, shibboleths, and fairy tales --including those whose origins lie in \\"mutually exclusive\\" intellectual traditions.

Truly, &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; is to economics what Newton's Principia is to physics. It is not perfect, but considering the time in which it was written it was an amazing accomplishment.The reader will find discussions on a great many topics, but what is especially fascinating is the insight into 1700's Britain that is provided. Remember, this book was published in 1776. Smith even discusses the &quot;recent troubles with the colonies&quot;--America.It is emminently readable, though it becomes less so in certain sections--the digression on silver, for example. However, if one takes it slowly, then one can easily digest this feast of intellectual achievement in a relatively short time.

This is the source. Adam Smith lays the groundwork for the study of Economics in this very readable treatise.Though he is discussing 18th century Britain, the topics he discusses have direct analogs in the modern American economy. Taxes, trade, money, monopoly, tarrifs, and international trade balance are all tackled with aplomb.He really lays into Mercantilism and blasts the protectionism it engenders. Never anything less than a champion of the common man, Smith decrys monopolies and other taxes on those most unable to afford them. Though he seems to be a total free marketeer, he takes great pains to examine the types of taxes which would be useful and prudent for a government to levy.Once or twice may be fine, but Smith uses this construction for almost every sentence in the book. It is just a stylistic gripe, but the length and complexity of each sentence make digesting the information quite a bit more difficult than it otherwise could have been. I would not be at all disappointed to see this book translated to a more modern style.Again, if you're interested in Economics at all, this book is the place to start.

This classic is a pragmatic and accessible milestone in the history of economics. Its author, Adam Smith, is woven into every economics textbook. However, Smith's theories, which today often are recounted mostly in fragments, frequently incorrectly, reveal their entire social and economic innovative power only in context. Smith burst onto the scene at a time when absolutist national states monopolized the world's precious metal reserves and tried to increase their own wealth through stringent export policies. These states were motivated by an entirely new concept about national wealth: that it stemmed from the work of the country's people, not from gold. Based on that idea, economic markets should balance themselves as if guided by an \\"invisible hand,\\" impelled by each individual's self-interest. The state has to provide only an orderly framework and specific public goods and services. Even though Smith's image of idealized economic and social harmony may have developed a few cracks over the course of time, his ideas have inspired many well-known economists during the past 250 years, including David Ricardo, Vilfredo Pareto, Friedrich August von Hayek and Milton Friedman.

The reason that it usually comes in two volumes is that it is a very, very long work, totaling over 1000 pages, and abridgement is apparently so common that it isn't stated directly by publishers. So, if the edition you're considering buying has less than 1000 pages, it is either only one of the two volumes, or it is abridged. It doesn't help that Amazon often provides the \\"inside pages\\" of a different edition from the one you're viewing, so if you want to check the table of contents to see just what's in a particular edition, you may be misled.

Start with Adam Smith. To be clear, Adam Smith is writing about capitalism, but how many of us know what that word means? Adam Smith is a good place to start learning before you start opining.This is not a simple read. The style is not as dense as was typical in 1776 but it can be just as elliptical.Interesting, although tangential is that the book mentions the American Revolution but only as an incidental backdrop to the more import issue of how and why money is created and moves. How well Mr Smith understood the then nascent industrial revolution is a hypotheses for a more learned reviewer than myself.Over all there is a great deal of repetition, and repetition with slight variation , punctuated by a scattering of tables, none of which printed as readable in my e version. This being said, Mr. Smith writes with a power granted to those who first encode a new world view. His is the more powerful because most of this work consists of a logical argument laid out in simple words.While many of us were exposed to the basics, capital, land labor, lowest cost, investment seeking the highest return, taxes bad (although not always) and so forth, I was struck by some of the lessor taught observations.Written in a time when there was no functioning concept of labor union, Mr. Smith warns that labor will loose against owners. The law (then) tended prevent labor from organizing and owners frequently socialized together, had common interests and therefor could be expected to overpower the labor virtually at will.Perhaps the single most telling comment, and the one most significant to today is his comment that when business interests attempt to make or influence public policy it is best to assume that they are lying or seeking action at the expense of public interest. Mr. Smith gives no third possibility.This is a great classic in western thought. I am tempted to say it should be mandatory. E editions certainly make it affordable. But For all you Wall Street occupiers and big wigs, Greek protesters, and Tea Party literalists, Obama haters, and anyone with a loud opinion on economics, this is a good place to start educating yourself.

Famous classic of economic theory though it may be, this is no dry academic tome to be read only by people with a scholarly interest in economic history. There are no detailed tables of statistics of the sort one might expect to find in a modern book on the subject, and no mathematical analysis, indeed not very much quantitative information at all. Instead there is a long series of examples to explain such ideas as why it is more efficient to divide work among several specialists rather than have a complete task fulfilled by one person, or why slave labour is ultimately more expensive than paying free workers, even workers in cities like Boston or New York, where wages were far higher in Smith's time than those in his native Scotland.To illustrate the principle of the division of labour Smith discusses the manufacture of nails. Even a blacksmith -- skilled in working with a hammer but with no special training in nail making -- could not make more than a few hundred nails in a day, and those of poor quality. A specialist nail maker could make more than two thousand, but much greater improvements, both in quality and quantity, come from recognizing that even a task as apparently simple as manufacturing a nail can be broken up into smaller tasks: maintaining the fire at the right temperature, hammering the nail into the right shape, using a different tool to form the head, and so on.A popular edition of Wealth of Nations is inevitably abridged, as one can hardly expect to buy a complete scholarly edition for a price not much more than that of a novel. Complete editions are available as well, but they are much more expensive. With sensible editing, however, an abridged version can include as much of Smith's writing as the ordinary reader is likely to want, together with notes to explain points that will be obscure to the modern reader. In the Oxford World's Classics edition Kathryn Sutherland has made an excellent job of this, with notes that fill around a fifth of the length of the book."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This is one of the truly great books produced by the Western world. Although much has been written on economics since, it considerably broadened my perspective to read it in the original.I can't help feeling that those who pan Wealth of Nations as an apology for exploitation simply haven't read it. That&#65533;s simply not what the book is about. For if you really do care about the underpriveleged masses -- and it's imminently clear that he really does -- then you better consciously organize your state in such a manner that money will flow naturally where it's most needed.I'd been told before I read it by several people that AS was, for example, apologizing for the East India Trading Company? Does his apology for EIT include the lengthy chapter which discuss in full detail how and why the East India Trading Company was responsible for an wide array of abuses in the Far East, and why no similar company would be legal if a society were fully moral and knew its own best interest?Nor is it a blind apology for laissez faire economics, though it does recommend non-intervention by the government insofar as that is possible. Still he fully recognizes the need for social services, rightly understood and rightly executed.In fact, I can't see how anyone who reads it could view it as an apology at all -- it's simply a statement of fact. Adam Smith is not the one carrying an ideology around on his shoulder. You may not like it that the world works this way -- that's another matter. But that IS the way it works... you are made to see that for yourself. It is not imposed on you as dogma.And after reading AS, I'm left feeling very happy that that's the way the world works.I think the most fundamental idea I am left with after reading all those pages, is that wealth is a verb, not a noun. Land and labor (i.e. food and farming) are the bottom line of economics. Treat your farmers well. Unjust practices in trading will ultimately backfire.The dynamo which runs the machine that creates wealth lies within each individual - it is the individual&#65533;s will to better his or her condition. To the degree that this aspect of human nature is given the power to express itself , the nation will be vitalized internally."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This book is so widely cited and interpreted contrary to the author's original thought, that every economist should read it completely to avoid being misled by such incorrect interpretations.First, let us take the \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor. When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day. Just don't start reading economic books from this book. It would be hard to understand. It assumes that you already have economics background, i.e. have studied economics for a few years.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist. You can get an audio version of this book to avoid lengthy read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"It has all the original writings of Adam Smith but Book 5.

It is worth reading, but for those with less time, I recommend \\"The Essential Adam Smith\\"The Essential Adam SmithContent Summary: The \\"Wealth of Nations\\" contains Adam Smith's classic defense of free trade, and his simultaneous attack on the mercantilist system of his day. Mercantilism was a policy favoring exports and discouraging imports, while trying to maximize the silver and gold coins brought into the nation. Smith points out that this policy was self-defeating, that trade barriers invite retaliatory trade barriers. Mercantilism actually discouraged greater economic growth. Smith further argues that free trade, with a focus upon producing commodities and commanding more productive labor, is actually the more prosperous alternative. Besides many other things he says, he was in favor of an inheritance tax for the wealthy, opposed to taxes on wages, for generally minimizing all taxes as much as feasible, and repeats the idea that the wealthy have some greater responsibility to give back to their country in proportion to their wealth. In fact, it is in their self-interest to do so, to assure a prosperous and secure nation that protects their own wealth. The \\"invisible hand\\", which people are so fond of quoting - appears only once in this book (and thrice in all Smith's writings). It does suggest that it is through pursuing their own free, self-interest, that men render a greater prosperity to society.Analytical Review: Smith's argument, that free trade renders a more prosperous economy, is probably a good one. Capitalism has been a vehicle for generating greater wealth, but not always generating greater equality. It must be pointed out of course, that there rarely if ever has been a completely free market. I believe Marx's Communist radical alternative has not and will not supplant capitalism. What Marx understood, however, was a greater sense of social justice. Marx's writing is loaded with justified sentiment for the oppression of the working poor, and his labor theory of value in \\"Capital\\" goes a long way to augment and correct (but not entirely substitute) Smith's omissions. Smith had absorbed the very hierarchical, class-based values of his time. In several passages on slavery, for example, Smith's strongest condemnation is to call it an \\"unfortunate\\" institution. What Smith understood better was that humans are self-interested and will prosper more generally through a free market. But Smith also opposed the power of monopolies, and believed some provision should be made for the poor, and that plays into Marx's thought. Marx had greater insight into the abusive dominance of monopoly capitalism, and its often cold-shouldered indifference to the inequities it produced. In a nutshell, Smith gave us the wisdom that the free market is better, but Marx has given us the corrective that a fair and just use of capital is a better (and yes - you might add even democratic of Christian) ideal. A free-market economy, with some corrective for social justice and common welfare, is my view of a compromise between them. My advice - we have much to learn from both Smith and Marx, if only critics would often read them before speaking too brashly."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"Out of necessity, whenever an original work is \\"abridged,\\" the abridger must make a value judgment regarding what in the original work is worthwhile (and will be preserved), and what is not of relevance, and will thus be discarded and placed beyond your view. So \\"abridging\\" really means \\"editing,\\" which means running the original work through the \\"value filters\\" of the editor/abridger. Unfortunately, much of the inspired and inspiring wisdom that Adam Smith toiled long to place in \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" has been edited out in this abridgment, to the point, at least in my opinion, where much of the real meat has been removed and much of what remains is merely milk, that is more appropriate for the simpler mind of a suckling child.Opting for an audio book, rather than taking the time to read the real thing, in and of itself is a significant compromise that forgoes the greater value of being able to pause and contemplate what you have read, and to then do whatever rereading is necessary in order to really evaluate and grasp what is being said.I realize that our lives are often so busy that we feel a legitimate need to make these kinds of compromises whenever we can. Although you can probably get away with a compromise like that with your recreational fiction, believe me, this is NOT the appropriate time or place to do that! If you are going to opt for the audio version out of necessity and convenience, then don't also opt for the cliff notes version that has already had much of the meat taken out of it by an editor/abridger that thinks he knows better what you need to learn from Adam Smith.

Not to detract from an excellent book, but you must have good working knowledge of economics before reading it."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"This is the best release of \\"Wealth of Nations\\" for several reasons. First, it is truly \\"complete and unabridged.\\" So, you get the real deal, all thousand pages of it. Second, it includes Edwin Cannan's summaries in the margin that assist in reading this thick tome. Cannan also provides an enlarged index that serves as a quick reference. And third, the Introduction by Robert Reich and the Commentary at the end by R.H. Campbell and A.S. Skinner are very helpful in better understanding this work. You may get more out of those two sections than Smith's thousand pages of writing.This book was written before the field of economics theory existed. As a result, Smith's writings do not include such common words as: economics, recession, expansion, contraction, inflation, GDP, common stocks, and securities. Thus, his writings has no resemblance to modern economics commentary. Given that, it is challenging interpreting what he is saying in modern context.Smith could not be an economist since the latter profession did not exist he had to be something else: a moral philosopher. In the 18th century if you studied hard sciences you were a natural philosopher. And, if you studied anything else you were a moral philosopher. Such a broad base binomial taxonomy of all intellectual scientific fields had great advantages. This is because moral philosophy included all the fields that today are pretty separate such as: logic, rhetoric, psychology, sociology. On a more granular level moral philosophy as advanced by Smith included microeconomics, macroeconomics, international economics, behavioral finance, international economics, etc... Nowadays, all those fields are fairly demarcated.In view of the above, Smith's intellectual legacy is in part timeless. This is because he was concerned about the speculations that went inside individuals' minds just as he was concerned about the productivity of labor, small businesses, and the economy at large. His cogitations covered the entire fields of behavioral finance, macro and macroeconomics.Smith's thinking was far more complex and nuanced than the ones of his libertarian followers such as Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, and Alan Greenspan. They all missed more than half of Smith's message. That included Smith support for labor unions (at a time when labor abuse was rampant), government regulations including very tight regulation of banking. Smith also was opposed to the might of large corporation as he was suspicious of their collaborating to depress wages and their colluding on prices before laws banned such practices. Thus, Smith was far more the precursor of Keynes than Milton Friedman. Yet, this is not what the economic profession conveys to the outside world.Smith's posterity and prescience are second to none. Unfortunately, his writing in a contemporary setting is unreadable. For my part, I got a lot more about Smith's thoughts from reading digested modern interpretations from others than from reading Smith's own writing. In this regard, I recommend three books. James BuchanThe Authentic Adam Smith: His Life and Ideas (Enterprise)is excellent and solely focused on Adam Smith and his writings. Arthur HermanHow the Scots Invented the Modern World: The True Story of How Western Europe's Poorest Nation Created Our World & Everything in Itcovers the entire Scottish Enlightenment. And, John CassidyHow Markets Fail: The Logic of Economic Calamitiescriticizes the entire field of economics. Yet, he describes Adam Smith as a far more balanced and complex thinker than his modern followers."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations","review":"In his day monarchies, emerging democracies, business people and government employees were profoundly inept in the affairs of economics, trade and taxation. We have come a long way. Now governments are simply inept including the USA government. When you compare the errors in governmental affairs that he reviewed more than two hundred years ago to the mistakes and wrong governmental policies of today there is considerable reason for optimism.What a damning review of governmental affairs he wrote. This is the predominant reason for reading this book. Secondarily, to trace the development of economic thought. Adam Smith was one of the greatest pioneers in the science of economics. There are areas where we now know he was in error. Science content of modern economics is more profound than most observers are willing to admit. If you just want to learn about economics you would be well served to first read more current economists. In modern times, Milton Friedman has played a similar role. Again there is that radical urgency to place Friedman in the conservative pile before they decide the correctness of his thought. The legacy of critically reviewing the errors of democratic governments as well as repressive governments will hopefully be kept alive and well. Much is left to be done-- even in the USA. A very exciting question remains what happens when the repressive leaders of China realize that good economic policy and political freedom are so deeply intertwined that there repression is truly doomed. Will the end be destructive or positive. It is surely coming.Similarly in the USA and other developed nations, as more people learn economics on the path to greater involvement in business, investing and entrepreneurship one would expect increasing rebellion against the reckless of policies by politicians and the uninformed contentions of the media. There are many helpful books some I have recently reviewed that can broaden ones understanding of governmental failings in economic policy.While everybody would benefit from more knowledge about economics, the basic shortcomings of the media and politicians is of critical concern. It is no surprise that reviewers of economics related books have to rush to place any book either in the conservative pile or the liberal pile. Why or how one decides to place Adam Smith in the conservative pile, is surely the sickness of political views over logic.

Unlike some of his other works such as &quot;Decline and fall oft the British Aristocracy&quot; where he allows bittersweet emotions such as nostalgia to be evoked at the passing of an era, or the undisguised glee of an outsider indulging in schadenfreude in &quot;Aspects of Aristocracy: grandeur or decline&quot; this book presents a much more balanced analysis.His thesis is that there was a complex interplay of class and race in the Empire, but in most cases class trumps race.The defining example from the book is an exerpt from the &quot;Raj quartet&quot; where the british aristo identifies more clearly with his Indian counterpart who went to public school than to the uncouth white police constable. However the police constable viewed himself as superior to the Indian because of his race.Its thesis accords well with my experience in public school at Winchester College in England where I felt accepted as a peer despite being Asian. But my same peers were openly disdainful of poor uneducated Pakistani and Bangledeshi immigrants. (They welcomed the educated Indians much more easily)Perhaps these sentiments were what prevented mass support for Oswald Mosley and Fascism in the 1930s despite prevalent anti-semitism. It has been argued by John Lucas that Nazism as an ideology failed because Hitler had made his elite too small. The British extended their elites to the sultans, nawabs, emirs and kings all over the Empire and used them to bind the Empire together.This book provides an interesting contrast to America where race is so much more important. Black and white interracial marriages are quite commonplace in Britain. In my opinion it better to recognize nobility in another person and disdain the baseness in another person regardless of the colour of their skin."},{"Title":"Pilgrims to Palestine,: And other stories,","review":"Let's keep it short. The title is more than a cute pun. Old Boney once said, no doubt in fine French, that a man would do things for a piece of yellow ribbon that he would not do for all the gold in the world. This scholarly, but not too much so, study is about British uses not of glory but pomp: the deliberate distribution of honors neatly packaged by class; indeed, neatly packaged by the rank of various colonial states somewhat in the pattern of elborate dinner seatings of the middle ages. &quot;I say is Fijii above or below the salt?&quot; In an age of &quot;postcolonial/subaltern/otherness&quot; studies this is a readable guide to events and behaviors of our British cousins that those of us on this side of the pond sometimes find rather mysterious. It is a good addition to the personal library of anyone doing serious literary/social analysis."},{"Title":"Pilgrims to Palestine,: And other stories,","review":"David Cannadine supposes that there might be more to the British Empire than simple racism. The reviews here at Amazon neatly prove his supposition to have been true. The critiques offered are all of the 'you did not pander to the antiracist ideology; you are an evil racist supremacist and you write badly, too' genre.Well, Cannadine writes superbly, in the detached manner not of a 'child of the empire' but of an Englishman who wonders whether, indeed, he was one, and, if so, how much?His argument apparently has taken his PC readers so much by surprise that they cannot comprehend it, but to someone, like myself, who lives in Hawaii, it is a commonplace. Hawaii was colonized by Americans, not Britons, but they behaved exactly the same -- despising, or at least keeping their distance from, the commoners; but happily intermarrying with the 'natural' aristocracy. Once Hawaii became a republic and the aristocracy was extinguished, they stopped intermarrying with them, as all natives were then 'common.'This little story from the islands was written large in the British Empire. Cannadine does not pretend there was not a color line, but he notes -- and any Australian would say, 'Right, mate!' -- that the elite in the metropole despised the white colonists more than the black elites they chose to cosset and use in the policy of indirect rule.Britain was becoming an urban and more democratic place, but the men who ran it were not, as Arno Mayer described (for Europe as a whole) as 'The Persistence of the Old Regime.'The proconsuls of empire and the men who selected them in London were devoted to a rural, hierarchical, anticapitalist society; some explicitly yearned for 'feudalism.' Cannadine shows how they allied with rural and traditional hierarchs, or, in southwest Asia, invented them. They ignored or suppressed the modernizing, urban, educated -- and often, equally anticapitalist, though Cannadine does not point that part out -- rising classes in the Empire.That one can speak of 'rising classes,' as even the Marxists do, proves that Cannadine is on to something when he speaks of the class-based, rather than race-based empire.The contradiction brought down the empire in a short time, but, ironically, the inheritors were often more racist than the British and decidedly less progressive. Cannadine wrote this book in 2001 and includes a memoir, 'An Imperial Childhood?' (note, as other reviewers did not, the significant ?) in 1997, when Hong Kong was absorbed into a new, more savage empire. Now, five years on, it becomes less and less possible to deny that the former 'victims' were unable either to be governed or to govern themselves. Cannadine does not ruminate on this striking effect.'Ornamentalism' is not meant, as some reviewers here suppose, to be a history. It is an extended essay on an aspect of empire that has been overlooked. But not the least of the book's many joys is the appended memoir, which, along with the clever title, skewers the turgid, lying, fake memoir of the sweetheart of the orientalists, Edward Said. There's no doubt that Cannadine was really a Birmingham boy, while Said was never a Palestinian.Lastly, for an American reader, immune to the claims of aristocratic privilege, part of the joy of this book is the pictures of self-important men in funny hats."},{"Title":"Pilgrims to Palestine,: And other stories,","review":"This volume serves as an extension of Cannadine's earlier book Class In Britain. In Ornamentalism, Cannadine takes a different approach in looking at the driving force of the British Empire. It was driven not by race, but class, a traditional-hierarchical one, with the Empire being \\"the vehicle for the extension of British social structures, and the setting for the projection of British social perceptions, to the ends of the world and back again.\\" This in turn means that \\"it was about antiquity and anachronism, tradition and honour, order and subordination, about glory and chivalry,... processions and ceremony, plumed hats and ermine robes... about thrones and crowns... dominion and hierarchy, ostentation and ornamentalism.\\" It was thus also concerned in the constructions of affinities rather than otherness, as one of the ways to civilize the places they had taken over.Indeed, social ranking was the result of the Enlightenment's way of looking at people, races, and colour, a concept that transcended the three dynamics. And the British were far more welcoming than the racist Germans. An example was the invitation to England of King Kalakaua of Hawaii, who took precedence before the crown prince of Germany, the future Kaiser Wilhelm II, who took offence at his being ranked lower.A lot of focus is given to the nobles of other countries, as the image formed by these well-dressed personages created a dignified image of order and authority. These sultans, pashas, shahs, etc. were the apex to their own people, but formed a lateral relationship to the British dukes, princes, and marquesses. They were also important in keeping order after uprisings such as the Sepoy mutiny of 1857. India with its castes was the perfect example. Rudyard Kipling himself observed the fixed order of obedience, pack animals obeying their drivers, drivers their sergeants, sergeants to their lieutenants, lieutenants to their captains, all the way up to generals obeying their viceroy.The monarch itself symbolized the semi-divine aspect of the empire/territory/kingdom. For Queen Victoria, the number of places named after her, the buildings, statues, stamps, honours, correspondence envelopes, were all manifestations of the omnipresence of empire and thus of class. This is where Edward Elgar's \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\" marches came in, in honour of the queen's Diamond Jubilee (sixtieth anniversary celebration) in 1897. Critics saw them as \\"glittering gaudy toys.\\"Also, the creation of honours to promote the imperial hierarchical vision is discussed, such as the Order of the Garter, Order of St. Michael, all these medals, which became a status symbol, leading to officials proudly displaying their array of orders like a peacock, \\"the accoutrements of hierarchical display and imperial ostentation.\\"And thus did imperialism and classism, seen as one interconnected world, lead to ornamentalism, defined as \\"hierarchy made visible, immanent, and actual. Small wonder that was the way the ordinary British citizen related to the world. Abroad, \\"they saw what they were conditioned, what they wanted, and what they expected to see.\\"In the end, it was nationalism, attacks from the urban, intellectual, and middle classes, technology, and the perception that hierarchy was unchanging that brought down the empire.Cannadine doesn't take the neo-conservative, imperial apologist position, nor does he take the post-colonial and post-modern perspective in writing this book. Rather, he neither defends nor criticizes it, but tells the facts plain and simple, using the \\"entire interactive system\\" approach and giving a wider perspective of what the Empire looked like. He succeeds in breaking new ground, away from the ancient master narratives, by addressing the issue of class and hierarchy."},{"Title":"Pilgrims to Palestine,: And other stories,","review":"David Cannadine has added another well written volume to his studies of the British aristocracy, the British class system in general, and other related topics. Ornamentalism covers the British attitudes towards their Empire during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.Cannadine argues that the British took a hierarchical view of their empire, ruling it on the basis of what they supposed to be traditional English government, which devolved from the monarch to the local nobility and gentry. In the empire colonial governments made use of local grandees, such as the numerous Indian princes, so that Britain ruled not so much over them as through them. Thus Cannadine disagrees with prevailing historical opinion, that the Empire was based on race, by demonstrating its basis in existing class structureAs always, Cannadine writes clearly with few wasted words. He continues to be a master of the short biographical/historical sketch. A short but fascinating read."},{"Title":"Pilgrims to Palestine,: And other stories,","review":"Let's start off with the title. Unlike the book, which does not mention the term until page 122, simply put it is an explanation of the method by which Great Britain exercised (indirect?) control over its Empire. Cannadine argues that the Empire was governed using a theatrical form of social elitism which interpreted local societies as a reflection of the multilayered and tightly ranked home society in Britain. What this meant was that local aristos were sought out by the British (eg Maharajahs, Sultans, Nawabs, tribal chiefs, Bedouin leader/kings. In the settled dominions these were drawn from settled grandees - especially and initially in Ireland) and placed alongside the British colonial regimes to lend legitimacy and local control. Why ornamental? Because an elaborate system of rewards based on the award of (colourful & ornate) honours within a structure of conspicuous display for those of local & British high rank (Indian durbars, investitures, \\"plumed hats\\") bred a form of upper class bonding that crossed caste & race differences to create a ruling class that controlled one quarter of the globe in the interests of Britain.In a way this was no more than Louis XIV's use of Versailles court procedure - making up grand offices/titles/costumes for the upper nobility in return for a superficial court task, but this kept them quiet and allowed Louis to rule absolutely.Everyone, local dignitary or colonial official, knew their place in the hierarchy and energies focused on climbing up the decorative ladder and not falling out with the fount of promotion - London. Hence colonial government was carried out as London wished, and the plumed hats and fancy awards poured out to those in government, especially the local royalty. Reading this it struck me how this concept had survived even to the Scottish public school I attended in the 1960's where everyone had a defined role, ornamentally visible and so enforceable to everyone else (under 13 years old-short trousers, aged 14: uniform jacket had to be closed at all times using the middle button; aged 15: jacket could be open; aged 16: hands could be put in pockets; aged 17: could wear a non uniform jacket. Prefects: could wear special ties, Team players could embroider teams in gold thread on jacket. Everyone then policed the system to ensure no younger boy could exercise their \\"privilege\\". Indeed this was control on the cheap for the school!).Cannadine's is an interesting idea but there are several issues:* There is too little on who actually perceived the Empire in this way at the time and more importantly who cultivated it.* What was the role of the new \\"yellow press\\"?* How conscious a process was it? This is especially significant when the book shows how even the British ruling classes were so ready to get rid of the ornamental Empire and betray its colonial collaborators during decolonisation.Nonetheless there is much to this work, most perhaps in its final sections where it is clear that ornamentalism was no preparation for independent nationhood - once Britain left and deserted those it had previously been happy to collaborate with, the new regimes put in place by the departing British came from those (lower) social classes previously excluded from government. Lacking experience or traditional supporters, the outcome in most ex colonies was to be instability and long term chaos.Another salient point to emerge: the crucial role played by Britain's Irish experience: first colony where ornamentalism was practiced and model for elsewhere, then the first post 1776 colony to break free and then serve as a model for independence from London for those colonies seeking independence. (See casahistoria Ireland site)Finally, my edition has an interesting personal essay (An Imperial Childhood\\") as an appendix, and if the author ever reads this then let me say that yes, I have similar recollections and am of a similar age. But on the other hand, I am a historian too......."},{"Title":"Pilgrims to Palestine,: And other stories,","review":"Cannadine does an excellent job of presenting an alternative view point to the typical historiography of the British Empire. Race has always been considered a vital component of Britian's empire. However, Cannadine demonstrates the role class played in the Empire.While Cannadine may have over played the role of class; he does present an interesting theory. This text is well worth a read. It is concise and may give you a new perspective of the British Empire."},{"Title":"Pilgrims to Palestine,: And other stories,","review":"This is a much better book than I had originally expected. It is also a much easier read than I had anticipated. It's certainly not dry-as-dust narrative history. I had first read a review of the book in History Today which suggested that Ornamentalism by David Cannadine cast a new light on the importance of rank and ceremony in binding the British empire together across the globe, especially during its peak from the mid-nineteenth to early twentieth centuries. This was enough to whet my appetite. That, and an interesting reminder in the title that Edward Said had already written in his book Orientalism about the fascination that the East (Near, Middle or Far, depending on the distance from London as the epicentre) had for British empire-builders, and a suggestion that the ideological traffic of empire was more than just a one-way street. Ornamentalism certainly delivers on its promise in painting a complex cultural picture of cultural and ideological interchange between ruling hierarchies throughout the British Empire. The author shows how this order was identifed and then explicitly sustained through mechanisms such as the British peerage system (think about all those thousands of OBEs). Cannadine also shows how order abroad confirmed and upheld order at home. This &quot;Burkean&quot; view of society bolstered (even upholstered) the fortunes of conservative British politicians from Disraeli to Churchill. As this world view dissolved through the twentieth century, so did British support for carefully constructed local elites overseas. In my own country, small conservative New Zealand, attachment to the Mother Country died hard. British titles were only abolished in New Zealand in 2000. Ornamentalism argues its own corner. It doesn't pretend to be a comprehensive history of the British Empire (go to the Cambridge History series for that). But it is an enjoyable read, and provided (at least for me) a different, richer way of thinking about empire. The book is also entertaining (some great anecdotes of the Raj in India); insightful (nice distinctions between the different experiences of the Dominions, the Colonies and the Mandates); idiosyncratic (the author provides a personal perspective of empire in an unexpected epilogue); and credible (check out the great notes/bibliography). If you are even vaguely interested in the British Empire, Britain in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, or your own country belongs to that odd international club called the British Commonwealth,do yourself a favour and read this book. You'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"Pilgrims to Palestine,: And other stories,","review":"Monarchs and aristocrats are not very pleasant people. Rulers like Wilhelm II, Victor Emmanuel III and Hirohito have all played their part of making their country safe for fascism and dictatorship. Even the British ruling house are not a nice lot; more often than not they are philistine, reactionary and unimaginative. But the historian of aristocracy-AH, there's a different subject altogether. David Cannadine in his various books and collections of essays have portrayed in subtle, mordant detail the world of the declining aristocracy. Whether it is discussing the inability of Winston Churchill to get off the London Metro, or George V's inordinate admiration for shooting small birds and collecting stamps; whether it is the fact the George VI had one of the five greatest art collections on the planet but was too dull to appreciate it, or whether it is how the British monarchy moved from the amateurish funerals of George IV and William IV to the top notch rituals of the Late Victorian era, Cannadine provides a humorous sceptical eye on the world of monarchist kitsch.Cannadine's latest book is fundamentally flawed, but it is based on wide reading, is gracefully written and contains many fascinating details. The book has been advertised as a new approach to understanding empire: instead of it being based, as Edward Said supposedly argues, on racial hierarchy, it was really based on class superiority. Actually Cannadine argues that class &quot;was as important as (perhaps more important than?)&quot; race. And so Cannadine discusses how in the &quot;white dominions&quot; the British sought to ensure strong governor generals, aristocratic upper houses, and elaborate new orders. We go to India where the British treat the hundred or so princely states with elaborate tact and generosity. We see the British working with local princes and rules from Fiji to Malaya to Zanzibar to Ghana. In the twenties and thirties we see the British prop up new quasi-independent monarchies in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. All over the world we see among the British officials and the local rulers the world of the countryhouse, the fox hunt and the cricket match. Naturally enough this imperial order was obsessed with giving itself honors and glories, such as the Irish Lord Dufferin, who eventually got a &quot;proper&quot; English peerage, as well as the governor generalship of Canada, the viceroy of India and the knighthoods of six separate orders. There are no fewer than six Lake Victorias, while cities and towns and every conceivable form of geological and geographical body was christened after the queen from British Columbia to Belize to Rhodesia.This effusion of monarchist kitsch is very interesting, but what is its larger significance? Cannadine himself has to admit that despite their endless appetite for royalist cant, conservatives in Canada and Australia never gave their aristocrats more than an ornamental position. He also admits that in the &quot;white dominions,&quot; including South Africa, there was no pretence of any arrangement with the indigenous population, who were dispossessed and disinherited. He also agrees that the British exaggerated the effects of caste, that many local rulers were venal puppets. But the major flaw with Cannadine's argument is that Said and his colleagues will not fit into Cannadine's misleading race/class dichotomy. Said focuses as much on religious, technocratic and Zionist prejudices as much as race. And as Barbara Fields has pointed out in two brilliant essays (which Cannadine has mysteriously ignored) &quot;racism&quot; is not something separate from class. After all, what unites the subordinate status of African-Americans in pre-1865 law is not their skin colour, which varies considerably, but the fact that they are almost all slaves, ex-slaves or the descendants of slaves. The development of racist ideology cannot be viewed separately from the class struggles of the past. As Fields puts it, the English were not enslaved in the 17th century because they benefited from centuries of previous struggles. By contrast Africans could claim no such benefit. Racist ideology is as much a mutation of class ideology than it is an alternative.And so larger questions of the effect of Britain on their colonies and the effect of colonialism on British life and society are not really developed. In order to do that, we would have to look at the overwhelming colonial majority, not the small elites that the British flattered. And we would have to look at racial ideologies, the economic impact of empire, and the &quot;wages of whiteness.&quot; Some imperialists may have preferred the &quot;stability&quot; and &quot;organic&quot; nature of colonial India. But most Englishmen viewed this stability as stagnation and treated Hinduism and Islam with contempt. Why else would the British churches concentrate so much on missionaries? And Cannadine makes no mention of miscegenation, a taboo that has been a theme of Forster and Scott and many others. The British may have admired their puppet monarchies in the Middle East. But the most important effect of their mandates was, as Tom Segev has pointed out, to insure the formation of Israel, whose socialist and nationalist ideology was as far from Ornamentalism as one could get. Edward VII, as Prince of Wales, may have stood up for the King of Hawaii, but that did not prevent the King's sister from being overthrown in a vulgar coup by the Americans. There are some errors in the book. Kwame Nkrumah was not a Marxist, South Yemen was not a Soviet satellite, and Canadine refers to &quot;pre-1776&quot; Ontario when he obviously means &quot;post-1776&quot;. The ending, however, is interesting as Cannadine discusses what the empire meant during his childhood, less a home of racial others than as an abstraction of power that was slowly dissipating away into irrelevance."},{"Title":"Pilgrims to Palestine,: And other stories,","review":"This book presents a clear and concise perspective of the British empire. Not only does the author give a good general overview of this huge topic, but his views are clear and to the point. The empire meant different things to different people. What the author has tried to show is that the British did not base their empire on race, but class. An important distinction which balances many of the anti-empire racial perspectives that politically correct historians have been so fond of pointing out recently. Cannadine agrees that there was a racial element for sure, but that class hierarchy and ceremony were the predomenent factors involved. Seen in this way we get a much different idea of what the Empire was to different people. It is less a Black and White view which may not be popular to those who like to see things in more simplistic terms. Still, a nice read, with clear and concise writing. It will deffinitely stimulate your thoughts on the topic."},{"Title":"Pilgrims to Palestine,: And other stories,","review":"This is a good, but not great, work. For a more thorough investigation of this topic, read \\"The Decline and Fall of the British Empire\\" by Brendon."},{"Title":"Pilgrims to Palestine,: And other stories,","review":"Cannadine, as I see it, is the British equivalent of of the American Paul Fussell. He is a great popularizer of a rather elitist fascination with aristocracy. Cannadine, again like Fussell, writes well. His prose flows without academic jargon. He really belongs to the old Barbara Tuchman school of historiography which demanded clarity of expression with fascinating but apt stories to illustrate complex events and ideas. This excludes about 99% of American academics who have chosen instead to follow the now-defunct school of Stalinist academic obscurantism. Be that it may, Cannadine has something vital to say. His point is that while the English may indeed have been racist, they conducted themselves above all as snobs, who rated people according to their social standing. Afghan princes got the royal treatment, and it was on the basis of this age-old custom and brilliant insight into human frailty that the British Empire flourished. After all, everybody likes to be decorated by the Queen, and are perfectly willing to give up power as long as the pomp and circumstance never dies."},{"Title":"Pilgrims to Palestine,: And other stories,","review":"Professor Cannadine has already produced several loving portraits of the British aristocracy and a biography of one of its earlier chroniclers, G. M. Trevelyan. Now he adds a celebratory image of the British Empire, puffing it as the greatest show on earth.But there is nothing original in this book. It is based entirely on secondary sources and anecdotes; for instance, he recycles the ancient jokes about the CMGs, KCMGs and GCMGs of the hugely tedious honours system.This is an imperial-minded study of the Imperial mentalite. He displays (and himself clearly shares) the British ruling class's hierarchical and rural fantasy world, which they clung to in fear of the real world of industry, cities and democracy. He tells us of the British-imposed Viceroy of India, who in the 1930s had no fewer than 6000 servants! Like all too many historians, he indulges in abject hero-worship of Churchill the bugler of Empire.In an extraordinary passage he writes, \\"For as the British contemplated the unprecedented numbers massed together in their new industrial cities, they tended to compare these great towns at home with the \`dark continents' overseas, and thus equate the workers in factories with coloured peoples abroad.\\" So \`the British' observed the workers in Britain's factories, who in the eyes of Cannadine, and of the ruling class, were obviously not British at all!In a book about Empire and class, Cannadine manages to write the phrase \`ruling class' just once, and avoids the term working class altogether. As active subjects, he much prefers terms like \`the British' and \`the official mind'. The word \`domination', when he uses it - rarely - is always in inverted commas.Cannadine's October 1998 article in the Financial Times showed what a Blimp he is. He claimed that England - he meant Britain - was not \`a particularly unequal society', and seriously suggested that \\"the best way to make our nation a classless society\\" would be \\"that we all stop talking about class.\\" This book reveals the same crass idealism; not surprisingly, the Thatcherite bigot Niall Ferguson praises it fulsomely!"},{"Title":"The conservation of orbital symmetry","review":"this book is a classic. it is written by 2 nobel laureates in a readable style. the key principles are clearly conveyed and illustrated with many relevant examples from the literature of the period. a must read for any organic chemist!"},{"Title":"The conservation of orbital symmetry","review":"When \\"Conservation\\" was published, I was an undergraduate chemistry major, but even then understood that this was a seminal work destined to affect many chemists' ideas about concerted reactions.

Time to spread your wings :)."},{"Title":"The door of everything","review":"I had read this outstanding book a few years ago and it's message resonated with me at that time. Recently, I had a thought that said to go back and re-read it. It was just the message that I needed at this point. The main idea here is to affirm the fact of non-separation between each of us, our creator, and all that is around us. This is a concept that is central to many spiritual works and beliefs.It is the idea that we are all intimately connected, we are not contained in our body but our body is just a manifestation of the one \\"life energy\\" in all. When we identify with the grandeur of who we are, all things are possible. They are made possible by the realization of the power we inherently have by the very nature of who we are.This divine connection to everything, and the limitless possibilities that go with it, can only be experienced if we grasp the fact that we are connected. If we identify with the idea that we are separate and who we are is completely contained in a body, then our experience will be one of separation. Separation is a painful road of disappointment and lack. Love can be equated to oneness, and the ego can be equated to separation.So, all things are possible when we realize who we are. We are but love, and love is but what is. The Door of Everything opens with this understanding. This book will help you open that door. Here's wishing you much happiness in your journey to and through that door."},{"Title":"The door of everything","review":"Got this after reading reviews on amazon. Panned out great.

To get into the right frame of mind (spiritually), it is best to read the book over and over again so the message can penetrate the deeper levels of being.The Door of Everything clearly indicates that the life force or God is within everything, and that this force is with us all the time, whether we are aware of it or not, makes no difference.This book should be in every home, for one can find in it inspiration, hope and guidance for almost every situation in life.Ruby Nelson makes the reader aware of the need to change their outdated ways of thinking and doing, if they seriously want to awaken the Christ within.

It offers a fascinating perspective on what one's life force is and the true meaning of light. Ruby Nelson, the author, refers to cosmic particles permeating everything -- life force energy as it were--not unlike recent writings from the scientific community on quantum physics.

It is part of a literature base of what can be called \\"Immortalist\\" writings. These are books that believe that it is possible to conquer aging and death as part of a long term healing and enlightenment process. THE DOOR OF EVERYTHING is an ideal example of this literature and is very poetically written. It talks about the Ascension attitudes of gratitude, faith, and devotion (a channeled being added \\"humor\\" to the list to make it more complete), the importance of forgiveness as a gift to yourself (so that resentment does not eat you up), and about going beyond limiting beliefs and opening up to the full abundance of what Divine Grace wants to give us, even on this physical plane. The book is perfect to read when one is doing the first ten rebirthing sessions, which tend to bring up the \\"death urge\\" (the sum total of all the thoughts we hold that make us believe that life is not worth living) which is locked into our chronic muscle tensions and which is charged with anger, fear, and sadness.

First Mr. Snyder contrasts the church as an \\"institution\\" marked by the characteristics of status, status quo, principles of human organization, etc. versus the divinely led \\"kingdom of God.\\" This is a place that is both promised in our future (heaven) and present in our world today (the Church) offering redemption and reconciliation of people to God. He calls this understanding \\"kingdom consciousness.\\" An excellent example of this contrast is summarized in this quote from Easum's book, \\"The Church too can be merely smooth-running machinery with a veneer of personalism. Or it can be a radically biblical, caring community of believers totally sold out to Jesus Christ.\\"Snyder approaches the problems of today's protestant church from two fronts. He addresses the change in our world society that marks the end of the Modern Age. Like Easum (discussed later) Snyder challenges the Church to examine our paradigms and discover what prevents us from being relative to this generation.The second front is really a different perspective of the first. First churches must separate what is the Biblically sound, mandated mission, values, and strategy of the Church (Kingdom of God) from the \\"sacrelized\\" institutions made by man. Then institutions, which serve a purpose for the church, may be created and maintained so long as they are relevant and useful.

I preferred Kid Sister but both were great stories. Kid Sister is about the narrator's younger sister getting an abortion and he recollects how she has affected his life. Wild Child is about a young boy that has a wild side that leads him to the wrong place where he ends up on a destructive path. Both stories examine the narrator's family life, inner problems, issues, how society affects people and relations with others. Neither of the stories flow in a conventional manner, jumping from different events while intertwining thoughts and recollections of childhood memories. The story still does not lose you and keeps you engrossed to the end. I definitely reccommend this book."},{"Title":"The Restless Flame : A Novel of St. Augustine","review":"As a home educator, I read this book with the intention of screening it for my teen for a school assignment. In no time at all, I found myself unable to put the book down. I read it in just three nights - quite an accomplishment for a mother of five. Louis de Wohl presents the life of Augustine in novel form and makes it very interesting. The reader participates in Augustine's transformation from pagan to Christian. I can't wait to share it with my teen, I think that he will like it as much I did. (note: Before his conversion, Augustine and his friends speak very poorly of women. If sharing this book with a teen, use the opportunity to discuss Augustine's error in treating women as inferior, having a child out of wedlock, etc.) I am glad that there are books such as this one available that make learning history exciting."},{"Title":"The Restless Flame : A Novel of St. Augustine","review":"Louis De Wohl does an excellent job telling the story of the life of Saint Augustine. This novel is a wonderful book for any reader and if you are a catholic looking for an introduction to Saint Augustine you should read this book. The novel shows us the errors of Saint Augustine's youth and how he became one of the great doctors of the church. We can relate many of the issues Saint Augustine dealt with to issues we all deal with in the world today. I believe the strength of this novel is how well the author shows us how Augustine felt about his life and why he made the decisions he did.

I admit I was much younger then but I seem to remember that I had a very difficult time understanding his story.That's why I was so happy when I discovered Louis De Wohl's version of this great saint's life story.It is not only a story that tells of Augustine's conversion but shows that the prayers of St. Monica, his mother, finally payed off after many years of praying for him.But even when he came to believe he still fought the call to convert. As I remember it he told God he would convert but not just now. He was enjoying his life too much to rush into making any changes.Thankfully for the rest of us when he did become Christian he became one of the greatest theologians and saints of all time.Don't miss this one!

The story of St. Augustine has always intrigued me since he was certainly not a saintly person when he was young. Reading Augustine's autobiographical work,The Confessions of St. Augustine (Dover Thrift Editions)I learned a lot about him, but I felt that I really knew him after readingThe Restless Flame. This book covers Augustine's journey to find God. The more Augustine learned about Christianity, he realized one of the greatest obstacles for him was that for Christians their religion is not just faith and not just knowledge either,it is a way of life.The author has a great talent for bringing the characters in the book to life. After I finished the book I wanted to know more about the man who could write such an incredible story and did a little research on de Wohl. I found that he began writing at the early age of seven. His early books were all adventure stories, but during WWII he became very religious and decided to start writing about the saints. Cardinal of Milan, Ildefonso Schuster, came to de Wohl after reading some of his writings and told him \\"Let your writings be good. For your writings you will one day be judged.\\"If you would like to know a little more about St. Monica, Augustine's mother, I recommendSt. Monica: The Power of a Mother's Love, another great book."},{"Title":"The Restless Flame : A Novel of St. Augustine","review":"Inciteful read into the mind of a great Christian thinker and an early Church Father.

It is a great review for the MCAT organic section which seems to be undergoing constant revisions by the AAMC. I am happy to say that examkrackers tries to keep up with the changes and accurately reflects them. This is in contrast to a lot of the other books put out by Kaplan and The Princeton Review who republishes the same edition with a new cover and that's it. The contents barely change. Just take a look at any Kaplan organic review book and you'll know what I mean. Organic has always been my strong suit and I can easily deduce a lot of the reactions. But I needed to touch up on isomerism which is a critical portion of the MCAT for which I used this book. The book is straightforward...has 4 chapters (100 pages) with four 30 minute exams and practice questions pertaining to each section in between. For those who live by flash card or index cards...this book comes with a bunch of them which covers everything from IR specs to the pinacol rearrangement. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Organic Chemistry","review":"I was disappointed in this book. I stopped using this book early on in my preparations because I kept finding typos as well as factual mistakes.

And I could only guess but most will never be the same again...just to realize the vast scope of despair that has affected the human condition for centuries along with the differing cultural and religious viewpoints on the subject. Not a book for the faint at heart. But a book that provides the other side of what many believe (still) is an assumption that to live - is all there is. The meaning of life itself is the issue and this book tackles the subject as no one else had done for decades."},{"Title":"History of Suicide: Voluntary Death in Western Culture (Medicine and Culture)","review":"To form your own opinion on a subject, particularly if it is controvesal, it it wise to study the origin of the standpoint in question. . Arguments against voluntary death like : \\"Life is a gift of God, you should respect and leave it to him to end it\\" look good at first sight. But then you remember that the church used the same argument against birth control. In this matter almost everybody in the western world has accepted that the size of your familiy is your own responsability.The book 'History of suicide \\" shows that the taboo against voluntary death is heavily influenced by the wish of the Roman empire and the early christian church to try and stop the decline in population. The economy in that period was very dependent on slaves and serves. A quotation: \\"The Council of Arles in 452 condemned the suicide of all famuli ( slaves and domestic servants). the servant who kills himself robs his master and his owner. His suicide is an act of revolt\\".The book of Mr Minois gives plenty arguments for the statement that a responsable and free human being may find it justified to end his life.

He was convinced that she was a lying, scheming manipulative 18 year old hoping to gain money from blackmailing one of his good friends. Of course she was released and her step brother, Phil, the true culprit was jailed for four years. Leonie has since moved on w/ her life, but she carries around a lot of hate and dislike for that barrister. He ruined her life and embarrassed her when she had simply been taken in by a shark! Leonie never dreamed that she would come in contact w/ the sleazy attorney ever again. . . but she does!John Giles Noble was convinced that his friend told the unvarnished truth about Leonie all those years ago and he truly believed that justice had not been carried out then. He felt she should have got life! Now he finds her staying w/ his elderly aunt as the illustrator for her books. Giles wants Leonie and he sits out to get her at any cost. He knows all about her and her crazy bedroom antics all via his good friend. He means to have her at any cost.Loved the set-up, loved the by play, I even enjoyed the first kiss - to me it showed her loathing of Giles in that instant. Of course it was later played out differently as she remembers it. (she asked if he believed what OM told him about her and he says he didn't think he ever did. Oh but since she responded to his kisses . . . then -sorry the first time wasn't a response.) She constantly fought him and then she finally set her price to what she thought he wouldn't meet . . . marriage!He is mean to her, insults her, calls her names, never believes her, he actually threatened to break her wrist (\\"I can break this as easily as you broke that china figurine.\\"), twists her arm behind her back, tells her he will hit her and actually does later! She even feels that he would hit her - nice so she knew deep down that he is an abusive man.Giles isn't a very good attorney he believed his friend over her even when he is around her for a while he still believed the sleaze - oh well sleaze must stick w/ slime! Giles also claims that he can admit when he is wrong - he just isn't wrong about her.The way she loved this guy or realizes she loves him - OTT; the way the OM blackmails her. Seriously what happened to all of her hate? Oh yeah she suddenly love this sadist or is it masochist/wasn't buying the OM's blackmail but of course she gives in because she loves the beater! This guy truly loves her as well! Is there anyone who doesn't? I half expected her step brother to do some duplicitous activities against her as well.Leonie does exactly what he tells her to do, but then he changes his mind. She actually grew a neuron or two when she did, but then I think they rolled out of her head shortly after. I couldn't believe how quickly Phil tossed her under the bus either. Oh I guess he suddenly couldn't trust her just like Giles couldn't so . . . heave ho! Giles had loved her all along - I couldn't tell maybe you can. He says that everyone is entitled to one mistake - but NOT her. Those that he loves don't get to make any mistakes!Way OTT soap opera! Angst galore but I not sure I believe in romance. The ending was a big clincher too! Poor baby! NO WAY!! This abuser never showed that type of emotion before and I'm guessing he still didn't trust her until he discovered that little thing!!"},{"Title":"LOVE'S DUEL","review":"Leonie's character is besmirched, the attorney who ruined her reputation is Giles Noble. I liked Leonie to the end, then I was furious with her at how quickly she forgave him. He made her look like floozy and she just forgives him? Although I love the fact that she doesn't succumb to his advances and she rejects him numerous times and lays an offer in front of him knowing he'll refuse.Giles should have had more remorse and when you love someone you don't make them suffer. He really should have had more regret and Leonie should have put him in his place after he discovers the truth about her. I loved the heroine, she was a strong character.Carole Mortimer is an interesting author, I do wish she should had kept Leonie's attitude the same throughout the book- all the way to the end. The end seemed abrupt and how does someone fall in love with someone who ruined them? Plus, the guy should have grovelled. Yet unlike other HP books, this heroine, Leonie has a spine and doesn't really care if she angers the hero.

Now working as an illustrator of children's books, she's living a quiet life and sharing the cottage of the book's author. Emily's in her sixties and much prefers to have the illustrator of her books reside with her while she's writing. This suits Leonie perfectly, until the she meets Emily's nephew. Giles Noble is the prosecutor who tried to have her convicted of larceny. He brutalized and ruined her reputation on the witness stand, and though he succeeded in convicting her brother, the jury had felt that Leonie was innocent. Seeing the con artist living in his Aunt's home is enough to make Giles see red. And just as it was four years ago, he can't deny that he still desires her. It was his strong attraction to Leonie that had made him attack her so forcefully, with such bitterness, after all she and her brother had set his best friend up for blackmail. He believes Leonie uses men to get what she wants, and when he proposes that she become his mistress she insists that if he wants to bed her he must wed her first.Ah, talk about chemistry! This book was published 26 years ago, and though some of the behaviour on Giles' part would not be acceptable in a Presents today, the story itself holds up quite nicely. And although we aren't given Giles POV (as was the norm in 1982) we do get to see how very much Leonie affects him. They can't seem to be in the same room with each other without sparks flying, be it bitter confrontations or sizzling sexual tension. Leonie is at first terrified of Giles, but later she realizes she just doesn't give a damn what he thinks and she gives back just as good as she gets. Though Leonie could quite easily prove her innocence, she wants Giles to believe in her for herself and not on evidence. The ending is extremely well done, and the scenes where Giles realizes his mistakes are quite poignant. Bravo to Ms. Mortimer.

The cartoons pit him in a constant battle with Sergeant Snorkle and together with the supporting cast they make up Camp Swampy.

This is a book that will inspire readers again and again."},{"Title":"Baba: Autobiography of a Blue-Eyed Yogi","review":"I found this at the library, was skeptical, had no notion of what might be lurking between the covers. This is a treasure. Rampuri is not only a unique being with a star-blessed journey that most of us who are interested in such things can only dream about - he also writes beautifully. This unfolds like good novel, and even if only a fraction of it is true (I suspect all of it is), the story is amazing on a host of levels. I have been to India several times, lived in ashrams, studied Yoga there, been with great masters, but this - my God, what an adventure, it makes my pilgrimages seem like they were taken in an armchair. The ending reminds me of one of my favorite books \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" - an unexpected, shocking and enlightening BOOM! Great job, Ram Puri-ji, thank you."},{"Title":"Baba: Autobiography of a Blue-Eyed Yogi","review":"A tour de force spiritual adventure! Rampuri's journey to India and his eventual acceptance into the esoteric tradition of the Naga Babas is extraordinary given the exclusivity of the tradition. In an unprecedented occurrence, a foreigner was allowed into this highly ascetical tradition in which he (Rampuri) undertook a strict discipline( interestingly, part of this \\"discipline\\" is the use of ganja) of spiritual practice and study. This lifestyle of a Hindu ascetic is a a radical departure from the affluent lifestyle he knew in his home of origin, Beverly Hills, CARampuri candidly describes his struggles as a spiritual seeker and Westerner seeking acceptance among these radical Indian sanyansins (renunciates).Readers unfamiliar with Hinduism--particularly the Shiva worshiping sects like the Nagas--may struggle a bit with this book.And there are several transliterated Sanskrit terms that may slow an unfamiliar reader down. Still overall, the book is an easy read unencumbered by heavy theorizing or philosophy.I highly recommend this book. It's a beautifully told account of spiritual transformation in extraordinary circumstances."},{"Title":"Baba: Autobiography of a Blue-Eyed Yogi","review":"Rampuri grew up in a moderately affluent Beverly Hill's household and like many well off Americans felt something was lacking. This was also the time when America was experiencing a strong counter-cultural element. Rampuri, the American, decided instead of just being a hippie or preaching free love he wanted the real authentic experience. The only way to get this was to travel to perhaps the most sacred and spiritual land the world has ever known. India.After arriving in India, Rampuri wanders a bit till he finds his guru Hari Puri Baba. Hari Puri decides to try and initiate Rampuri into the strongly traditional mystical order of yogis. In other words, Rampuri would become a true sadhu. However, during the book there are some obstacles to this initiation. One is that despite other sadhus supposedly being spiritually evolved they tend to be judgmental to a foreigner. Some of these sadhus cannot stand the thought of an American yogi or sadhu. A whole plot of contention and animosity develops between Rampuri's guru and another spiritual guru. This strong tension is what makes this book read somewhat like a story. Elements of evil and suspense linger till the end of the book.During Rampuri's spiritual discipleship he learns many things. He learns languages like Hindi and Sanskrit and also traditional yogic practices dealing with herbs, medicines, and just a whole different way of looking at the world in general.For the most part I enjoyed the book minus a few rough areas. One problem is that a lot of the terminology is not very clear. You can, of course, understand many things from context but if a person had no previous exposure to Hinduism or its beliefs they would probably have trouble deciphering some of the text. There is no glossary at the back of the book to help with this problem either. Another problem I had is that sometimes the book seemed to wander a bit without any sense of direction. Lastly, the biggest problem I had was that this book was too brief. I was hoping for something more rich and in-depth. At only a little over two hundred pages Rampuri has only revealed very limited aspects of his experience to make them entertaining to the reader. He admits to having thousands of pages of notes so why skimp? Despite these few drawbacks I believe most people interested in the spiritual side of things (especially concerning Eastern traditions) will enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Baba: Autobiography of a Blue-Eyed Yogi","review":"Rampuri has touched my soul and enliven my heart center.A most book for any spiriutal seeker of any nature or culture.Rampuri has illustraeted what I feel internally in his book.

There are lots of details and interesting stories, and some self-reflection. But in the end, I just don't get it. The connections, the analysis, the context just isn't enough to make this story captivating to a person who hasn't had this sort of experience. Which would be most of us. Perhaps after 30 years as a yogi, the author no longer hs much connection to the boy who left home and moved to India and became naked. But in order to understand his story, we need to be able to understand who that boy was and how he changed. Though the surface story is here, the true inner depth seems gone, maybe erased through spiritual practice or ganja, or maybe just not clarified through careful enough writing. It's hard to put my finger on what's missing in this book, but something just isn't there."},{"Title":"Baba: Autobiography of a Blue-Eyed Yogi","review":"Wow! A fascinating and informative account of one man's spiritual and physical journey into a closed world.

A book for everyone - not just the yogis!"},{"Title":"Baba: Autobiography of a Blue-Eyed Yogi","review":"I loved this book. The author has as good a knack for telling stories as he has for taking on great adventures. The subject of the naga babas of India is fascinating enough to fill volumes. And that's just the problem with this otherwise wonderful book -- there's so little of it! I don't know why the author chose to tell his story \\"once over lightly.\\" I found myself hungering for more detail every page of the way. And he skips over large periods of time where I would love to know what he was doing, experiencing, and learning. The years in Kashi, for example -- and so much more. So for all the enjoyment and inspiration I got from reading this book, there was an equal measure of frustration over what was missing. I hope there will be many more volumes to come. This slim offering is delightful, but it's just a teaser."},{"Title":"Baba: Autobiography of a Blue-Eyed Yogi","review":"Rampuri's colorful and inspiring account of his spiritual journey to becoming an enlightened Baba was a wonderful gift to read. Through his words he evoked vivid images of India and the experiences he encountered that few know. I often felt I was in his presence experiencing the same challenges and wonderment of the divine spirit. Some still linger in the mind when he cared for his beloved Babaji in the hospital; and when he journeyed to Gaumukh, the source of the River Ganga and his encounter with the Goddess. As a seeker I was grateful for his authentic and honest account of his sufferings, fears and doubts as he was being pulled toward something far beyond his current comprehension as a young initiate and evolving yogi. There were times when tears came to my eyes knowing his same confusion when doubt enters the mind and his great joy when enlightened moments and the mysteries of life are revealed. Rampuri's words have life and hold a deeper meaning then just the written account. Well worth reading for those seeking, on the path, or have already found. Thank you for this book."},{"Title":"Baba: Autobiography of a Blue-Eyed Yogi","review":"An easy-to-read, life-changing book that brings one considerably closer to understanding the soul, the role of spirit guides, the purpose of soul and their mates and the nature of spirit in general. It is essentially a autobiography of one man's journey through India and of his trials and tribulations of becoming at one with the Naga Babas. It is one of those rare books on the subject that is likely to appeal to skeptics and the metaphysically inclined alike. Its style naturally lends itself to challenging one's beliefs and helping one to better understand the purpose of life's hardships. This book leaves one asking many questions about one's own life and path in this world, many of which he tries to answer. The best part - he encourages us NOT to buy into pseudo-spiritualism in the West. Bravo baba!"},{"Title":"Baba: Autobiography of a Blue-Eyed Yogi","review":"Blending Indian mythology with illuminating insights into the nature of astrological destiny and spirituality, BABA bridges faith and reason, mysticism and the internal struggle of surrendering. The journey of one man's quest for the truth and how it relates to him role in this realm is nothing short of miraculous.This fascinating, eye-opening book dares to explore both the miracle and traditional Indian folklore of our enduring relationship with God and the beyond...Rampuri excels sharing descriptive tales of Indian gurus and his experiences with the country's mystical people and places.Surprisingly, he almost alludes to telling the reader that spirituality is not something to buy or read. If so, this goes against everything New Age, and thus becomes a must-read for spiritualists."},{"Title":"Baba: Autobiography of a Blue-Eyed Yogi","review":"Rampuri succeeds here in doing what so many spiritual teachers have not been able to accomplish finding the words and images to convey that we all cannot escape the play of the universe in an unfolding story orchestrated by the gods above. As characters in the divine drama, we make mistakes but keep persevering as we try to do good and open our hearts to others.This is a very inspiring work on a subject that deserves more exploration. Rampuri has given us much to think about with his rich reservoir of fresh images. His advice is simple and sound: \\"God is living His secret life through you. Take a moment to contemplate, feel, and taste this delicious truth. Take a lifetime to live it and celebrate it.\\" I saw him speak inBend and was amazed to see a Caucasian man sitting among ash covered sadhus, who revered him with as much respect as each other. The video of initiations gives us a rare peek into their lives that should be shown on PBS, not at a yoga center."},{"Title":"Baba: Autobiography of a Blue-Eyed Yogi","review":"BABA details the importance of both personal and community spiritual and religious practices in India. Composed of Rampuri's personal experiences, stories, and thoughts interlaced within his life in India for the past 35 years. Though we have all read about Hindu faith traditions, this is the first time I have read detailed accounts of the Naga Babas, whose amazing lineage gives us a glimpse of Vedic times in India.Written in an easy, accessible style, Rampuri presents his experience and understanding of things in a very forthright manner, without judgment; be it condemnation or praise. He simply shares.Rampuri differentiates between religious and spiritual practice in a way that, at first, seemed a bit odd to me, as I'm generally used to hearing the distinction expressed in terms of group and solitary practice. But, what it most interesting is that he describes this distinction from a non-egocentric view. Highly recommended easy reading for both the Indian and non-Indian reader."},{"Title":"Baba: Autobiography of a Blue-Eyed Yogi","review":"There is something heartbreaking and life-changingabout the stories Rampuri tells, something sopassionate and questing that it is impossible not totake notice. In his debut volume, Rampuri sets out forthe steaming cities and seaside villages of India insearch of answers about the elusive truth in findinghis spiritual self. It's about his inner sanctum aboutwhich he knows little-despite growing up in BeverlyHills along the priviledged and wealthy. A rebel atheart, his rallying cry for the \\"truth\\" leads him toIndia at 18. With an remarkable spirit and passion athis side, Rampuri travels through marketplaces andjungles, and fearlessly faces down the babas andsadhus India's oldest order of yogis. This is abeautiful and important book-exhaustively lived,persuasively presented, poetic and vital. Rampuri'ssizable but eminently readable biography of hislarger-than-life experiences give us a taste of whatIndia is really like, from the inside out. An easy toread book, it earns its keep from start to finish. Hiswriting remains so deliriously rich in ideas andentertaining in its stream-of-conscious descriptions."},{"Title":"Baba: Autobiography of a Blue-Eyed Yogi","review":"The light shines in this narrative of the uplifting story of the strength, power and resilience of an American learning about the Indian culture and spirituality. From its opening lines until the final chapter, the reader is standing in triumph of how wonderful Indian ideologies help us learn about ourselves. BABA engages the reader with quips that inspire, empower and strengthen the soul from within as Rampuri sheds his Western self for selflessness.All the chapters are wonderfully written and felt so timely in that they convey feelings of strength that one would garner from experiences that relish in our inner soul and strength. BABA builds upon the foundation of strong, resilient and purposeful people. It illustrates that the Indian continent's strong groundwork has helped to make Babas the people that we wish to see, touch, and feel. Through poverty, discrimination, and mysticism that have perpetuated many of his goals, Rampuri still perseveres and this book reinforces the realness of the culture. The Naga gurus will be proud of his perspectives and no matter what race, everyone will gain a little light of understanding from a group of strong people whose souls have been enriched from the past, present and future."},{"Title":"Baba: Autobiography of a Blue-Eyed Yogi","review":"If you have been to India you can relive the smells and sights of that phantasmagoria in Baba.

Without it, folk music as you know it would be different. Seeing in 1908 that the cowboy's way of life was dying, John Lomax went out into the field and onto the range recording and transcribing This collection became the backbone of American folk music and its traditions. Theodore Roosevelt, who wrote the preface, was so impressed with the result that he created the Folk Song Dept. of the Library of Congress and made John Lomax its first curator.Many songs first saw print here including &quot;The Chisolm Trail&quot; and &quot;The Zebra Dun&quot;. Were it not for this book, &quot;Home On the Range&quot; and &quot;Down In the Valley&quot; would have passed into the ether and out of the collective conciousness.The only flaw is that of the 200+ ballads collected here, there are tunes provided for only 50. This was somewhat remedied by the second edition, same title, by John and Alan Lomax (his son, who succeded his father at the Library) published in 1938. And while many of the ballads are now familiar, many are not. Add the fact that each song is likely to have many more verses than are found in modern songbooks and you have a valuable reference work as well. Balladiers are still mining the treasures. The knowlege that these verses were published in the waning days of the Wild West,before the first cameras rolled in Hollywood, makes for insightful reading about a life which is no more.Collectors and folk enthusiasts no longer have to pay exorbitant prices to obtain a copy of this important volume. I won't say what my copy of the 1910 printing (the only other available!) cost me, but I can assure you that $75 is a bargain by comparison."},{"Title":"Cowboy songs and other frontier ballads","review":"Contrary to the first review, Theodore Roosevelt did not create \\"The Folk Song Dept. of the Library of Congress\\" or appoint John Lomax its \\"first curator.\\" (The Archive of American Folksong was not founded at the Library of Congress until 1928, when TR had been dead nine years, and its first curator was Robert Winslow Gordon.) Otherwise, the review is entirely correct in its assessment of the importance of COWBOY SONGS and the role that John Lomax played in preserving an important element of our American culture.

The code examples seem to have been cranked out from templates and not proof-read (specific example: the multi-line ubiquitous comment about saying Hello to Chuck the cat appears stating that int21h is used, even though the code uses int10h). INVOKE is introduced, with 'USES' appearing in the code but not explained anywhere. I had a couple of questions as I read about reserved words of MASM, like DGROUP and SEGMENT, but the scanty index showed nothing for these words. The index for a 258-page book on an assembler was only two pages.These are only the examples that come to mind as I write; almost everything I have tried to read in the book has contradictions and raises questions whose answers cannot be readily found. It makes me wonder how many outright errors are in the code. The only reason I'm getting anything useful from the book is that I have to dissect each line to determine if it is correct, so that effort creates some learning.

Brutal atrocities by members of armed forces of questionable pedigree and dubious professionalism have been the stuff of numerous front page stories since the deconstruction of the Soviet empire. The apparent intransigence or inability of particular governments to punish genocidal rapes and murders, reprisals, and pillaging have prompted collective reaction in the call for establishment of an international court for the trial of war crimes. To the consternation of our friends and the comfort of our enemies, the military establishment of the United States has opposed such a tribunal, asserting ,on the one hand, that our domestic military law affords sufficient deterrence for U.S. forces, while, insisting on the other that an international court offers too great a risk of railroading innocent Ameican soldiers, sailors, and aviators.For the contemporary study of these issues, Gary Solis offers an excellent historical lesson in Son Thang: An American War Crime. He recounts the story of the killing of several women and children during one night operation by a small band of U.S. Marines in Viet Nam, not long after the more notorious massacre of non-combatants by Americans at My Lai. Within earshot of their commanders, the Marines pulled women and children from their homes, gunned them down, and then tried to cover it up. From the story of the atrocity, he unfolds the story of its exposure by other, relentless Marines, and then the story of its legal accounting, in a series of courts martial right there in the field. When Solis has finished his report, he leaves readers to judge the effectiveness of the American process of military criminal justice for the prosecution of war crimes. For a former Marine with combat experience himself, Solis the story-teller excels in making the context intelligible for the rest of us. He seems to know just what needs explaining, from the art of night patrolling to the atmosphere of the ramshackle huts in which court was held so close to the continued fighting. He tells a gripping and tragic story clearly. Having heard it, we are the better to judge whether even as distinguished and professional a fighting force as the U.S. Marines can be left to police its own. Son Thang: An American War Crime is not only a fine read, it is an excellent lesson."},{"Title":"Son Thang: An American War Crime","review":"&quot;Son Thang&quot; is both an important work of legal scholarship and a compelling, well-written story. Col. Solis documents, step by step, exactly how the Marine Corps treated its own suspected of war crimes in Vietnam-they were quickly tried, and if convicted, imprisoned. There were no coverups and no excuses. Marines accused of killing non-combatants were swiftly brought to book and the chips allowed to fall where they may. Here, it appears that several of the Marine Corps prosecutors were out-lawyered by civilian attorneys. That doesn't matter; a trial is, after all, a contest. What matters is that the Marine Corps had-and has always had and will always have-the will to try those accused of atrocities."},{"Title":"Son Thang: An American War Crime","review":"Professor Gary Solis' \\"Son Thang: An American War Crime\\" is an excellent account of the courts-martial of four Marines for the murder of 16 Vietnamese civilians during the Vietnam War. Drawing from the transcripts from the courts-martial, the appellate record, the historical record, and interviews with many of the participants, Solis - a Vietnam veteran who served as both a military prosecutor and military judge in the Marines and who now teaches military law at West Point - gives a complete picture of the story as only a true insider can.Although this book is history, it reads like a novel. Solis brings the tension of the battlefield and the drama of the courtroom alive in this book. And he also brings alive the legal maneuvering before each court-martial as the prosecutors, defense counsel, and - in some cases - civilian defense counsel, all \\"prepared the battlefield\\" before each court-martial.As a former practitioner of military justice, Solis understands the nuances and intricacies of military justice, staff work on a division staff, and the actual role of commanders in the process. He methodically explains how military justice works in a deployed environment (the rules are the same, but there are many \\"real-world\\" problems such as witness production and transportation that can threaten an otherwise sound case).Finally, Solis also gives glimpses of the bigger picture of the Vietnam War in 1970: the USMC manpower problems with Project 100,000, law of war training issues, the moral problems dealt with by Marines facing women and children fighters, etc. And, after telling the full post-trial stories of the convicted Marines (that went on for over 10 years), Solis wraps up with some conclusions about what went wrong, what went right, and suggestions for improving the military justice system (which are especially relevant now that we are again trying important courts-martial in deployed environments).\\"Son Thang\\" is an outstanding book and a very easy read. Anyone interested in the Vietnam War, military justice, or in trial work in general should read it."},{"Title":"Son Thang: An American War Crime","review":"The reviews of Gary Solis's SON THANG are entirely accurate: the book is a masterpiece of historical research and sharp, incisive, nuanced writing. A gripping and depressing read, the book examines not only the singular horror of the Son Thang massacre (and in that it is a refreshing alternative to the incident as presented in Oliver North's white-washed memoirs, and Randy Herrod's self-serving BLUE'S BASTARDS), but also the decline in morale and professional standards during the waning days of the Vietnam War. That this decay almost overwhelmed the draftee-filled U.S. Army is an accepted fact. That an institution as proud as the Marine Corps (an institution which had upheld its highest traditions at places like Con Thien, Hue, Khe Sanh, and Dai Do from 1965-68) was also dry-rotting during the 1969-70 period is not as well known.

Since leaving the Marine Corps he has had a distinguished academic career as a professor specializing in military law in both England and the U.S., including a teaching appointment at West Point. With thjs uniquely oriented background he is superbly qualified to relate the story of the atrocity killings in the Vietnam village of Son Thang in 1970, and to explore the age old dilemma faced by highly trained and aggressive troops in the middle of an extremely dangerous combat zone. When is the killing of civilans a part and parcel of the conduct of war, and when is it premeditated murder? He particularly focusses on the ability of the U.S. military fairly and professionally to administer and enforce the U.S. Code of Military Justice in a politically overheated atmosphere. He carries out this mission by telling the fascinating story of the Marines involved in this only major atrocity in the history of the Marines, and their performance, both heroic and disgraceful in turn, And even more dramatically, he tells the story of the Marine officers and lawyers who discovered the crime, investigated the facts of the matter while at times exposed to enemy fire, and who, with great integrity, dedication, and skill, sought justice in the face of career threatening political scrutiny. For those who savor courtroom drama, and have an affinity for military history, and the principles of justice we treasure in America, this volume is a fascinating, and an elevating example demonstrating that these principles are strong and safe in our military justice system. The young officer/lawyers seen performing their profession in the middle of the war zone are a little noticed and rarely celebrated part of the the finest and most just military in the recorded history of civilized man. The quality of this book is confirmed by the fact it is still considered the authoritative study text for West Point cadets, and is recognized throughout the military justice system as a great story exemplifying those who serve in combat."},{"Title":"Son Thang: An American War Crime","review":"The reviews of Gary Solis's SON THANG are entirely accurate: the book is a masterpiece of historical research and sharp, incisive, nuanced writing. A gripping and depressing read, the book examines not only the singular horror of the Son Thang massacre (and in that it is a refreshing alternative to the incident as presented in Oliver North's white-washed memoirs, and Randy Herrod's self-serving BLUE'S BASTARDS), but also the decline in morale and professional standards during the waning days of the Vietnam War. That this decay almost overwhelmed the draftee-filled U.S. Army is an accepted fact. That an institution as proud as the Marine Corps (an institution which had upheld its highest traditions at places like Con Thien, Hue, Khe Sanh, and Dai Do from 1965-68) was also dry-rotting during the 1969-70 period is not as well known. Though a proud Marine veteran himself, the author is willing to look such ugly truths square in the eye, and SONG THANG is all the better for it. The Foreword by BrigGen E.H. Simmons, USMC (Ret), is also fascinating."},{"Title":"Son Thang: An American War Crime","review":"I Just got through reading the book for the second time,and itwas just as good to me the second time as the first.I will never understand the disparagey in the verdicts.To me the one that was most guilty got off scott free, while the leastguilyy got the worst punishment.That militarry justicefor you though."},{"Title":"A Photographic Guide to Tracks and Tracking in Southern Africa (Photographic Guides)","review":"This book is extremely helpful for interpreting a clean set of tracks, or getting a handle on a more challenging jumble of older and/or windswept tracks.

I have been once to Southern Africa, I would welcome opinions from those more experienced with tracks, and especially with books upon tracking, for recommendations of other books as well.No, as a beginner, you won't be able to necessarily separate out different zebra at first, or tell a black from a white rhino, or juvenile males lions from a lioness from tracks alone, however you'll use other clues to get there!

Royal Escape, written in the early-middle of Heyer's career, falls somewhere in the middle; it is definitely better than her earliest books, but definitely not as good as her later books.Royal Escape recounts a six-week period of the life of King Charles II of England, from the time when he was defeated by Cromwell until he escaped to exile in France. As with all of Heyer's books, the detail is meticulous and reflects her prodigious research and dedication to fact; her bibliography is impressive. Most, if not all, of the characters in Royal Escape were actual historical people, and Heyer depicts their personalities and characters with a great deal of detail. In particular, we are given a close-up view of Charles, his personality, his looks, his charisma and his charm. Heyer reminds us numerous times that, not only was Charles uncommonly tall, but he was uncommonly ugly. In fact, it was stated so much that I felt like I was being beat over the head with it.The problem with Royal Escape is that it drags on and on. Charles narrowly escapes Cromwell's forces, finds shelter with a family sympathetic to the Royalist cause, is in danger of discovery and therefore forced to move on (in disguise) and find shelter somewhere else. This basic plot is repeated over and over (I lost count of how many times) until it is monotonous. I thought he was NEVER going to get to the coast and escape to France. But finally, after 440 pages, he did.Although Charles experiences many narrow escapes, there is nevertheless a lack of spine-tingling or hair-raising (regardless of what the blurb on the back cover says). However, I was ok with that; I don't expect those qualities from a Heyer book. What I was not ok with was the lack of climax, or conflict or resolution which are essential to the structure of a novel. Although I am sure Heyer's account is true to history, I would have enjoyed it much more if she had used more of her novelist's skills rather than just recount history in a rambling, never-ending narrative."},{"Title":"Royal escape","review":"I love Georgette Heyer's books, particularly her later ones. This book was such a disappointment. It was tedious, with unlikeable characters and no romance. The book never seemed to build to a climax just dragged on. Do not buy this book - look for The Grand Sophy or The Reluctant Widow."},{"Title":"Royal escape","review":"I've read as many of Heyer's novels as I can find and there's something to like or love about every one EXCEPT for \\"Royal Escape\\". The characters are flat and there is no plot!! I only finished it because I hoped that it would get better and Ms. Heyer's wit would shine through. No luck- I didn't even like the character of the King. please, don't spend time on this when you could be reading the Alastair Trilogy (These Old Shades, Devil's Cub, etc.) or \\"The Masqueraders\\", all of which are absolutely marvelous."},{"Title":"Royal escape","review":"If you love Heyer's light-hearted romances, or her mysteries, this may not be for you. It is more history than romance, and as the former reviewer stated, it's a little hard sometimes to distinquish the \\"good guys.\\" Nevertheless, it is reasonably true to the period and the events. There were then, as now, Puritans and Puritans. Not all were exactly blameless - the \\"Roundhead\\" forces were guilty of as many atrocities as the other side. Incidents such as the one the former reviewer finds so objectionable did happen. To the Puritans, these people were Satan's tools as well as traitors. Many of the Catholics felt the same way about the Puritans, and Heyer does favor that side.As for the Stuart immorality - none of the royal houses of Europe of that period (or any?) were known for their blameless lives where the opposite sex was involved."},{"Title":"Royal escape","review":"Those who pick up this book because of the author's name and the romance-novel cover will probably give up on it after the first few chapters. There's no romance, though a couple of the young women involved in helping the embattled king to get from hiding place to hiding place have strong affection for him, and he'll flirt with any woman who gives him a smile. The history, I'm sure, is authentic, and quite interesting, for someone like me who knows little about the period apart from the fact that Charles II does eventually take the throne. As for a previous reviewer's comment about the king's Catholicism, I didn't see that at all; he was willing to listen thoughtfully to Catholics and was embittered--with good reason--by Puritan attitudes, but unlike so many of his predecessors, he wasn't into taking passionate sides and persecution of the Others.It's not your usual Heyer, but it's worth a read if you're interested in English history."},{"Title":"Royal escape","review":"Heyer's historical novels are typically not my favorites, but this one--possibly because it's so accurate and well-paced--was fascinating and fun. Even had I no knowledge of the events, it would be a great read. But Heyer's able to flesh out the facts of the well-known story. Since, as her husband boasted, her research is thorough and flawless, I never had to wonder (as one must with so many authors of this ilk), \\"Did it really happen like that?\\" That's one of the things that makes Heyer such a comfortable author: she's trust-worthy."},{"Title":"Royal escape","review":"I have been a Heyer fan for many years and read all her Regency books over and over...sort of like the books equivilent of \\"comfort food\\"!But she also wrote several books which were set in other time periods. Some are set in the late 1700's, others: her mysteries, are set in what was to her, \\"modern times\\", from about 1920 or so onward....these are not my favorites.She also wrote a few books set in the Middle Ages, or in times far earlier than the other books. \\"Royal Escape\\" set in the 1700's, and based on a famous true story, is actually a pretty good book. Its not like the Regency books in that it has more to do with young King Charles II (age about 20 or so) trying to escape from England after his army was defeated by the Puritan dictator Cromwell. If he'd been caught, he'd likely have been beheaded as his father, King Charles I, was, and several of his friends and supporters who were caught after the battle was lost...Therefore most of the book follows history and the many adventures young Charles had in getting away from the troops pursuing him and the high price on his head which would have encouraged many people to turn him in.As mentioned, its based on the true story and well told by Heyer. I don't want to give away all the story for those who have not read it, but I found it interesting and enjoyable though not up to the level of the better Regency books.Another excellent book on young Charles II, isThe Child from the Seaby Elizabeth Goudge. This is based on a true story: the love affair of young Prince Charles, before he became king, with an island girl who gave birth to his son. It is a very good, very moving story that will stay with you. The events in it occur PRIOR to \\"Royal Escape\\"...."},{"Title":"Royal escape","review":"Georgette Heyer is a writer unparralled today in her descriptions of England and the social practices of the day.

They are a delight."},{"Title":"Royal escape","review":"I love this book. Charles II is one of my favourite real people in history and this book creates him as a real breathing person. The events of this book were true and most of the story is the one that Charles himself told on the boat as he returned to England as king, 9 years after the event of the book and Samuel Pepys recorded. Because the tale is Charles own story the detail that Georgette Heyer puts in the book are often the king's own memories and the lightheartedness of the character relects his own descriptions of his actions.Charles certainly was an unusual man for his time and the story of his escape may be one of the explanations of why he was a man who wore his kingship very lightly yet valued it above all. It was hard won.True there is no suspense, anyone who reads history knows Charles did escape but if it were not a true tale it would be one which was described as an historical romp.The book does lack the romance of other books but the fact that Georgette Heyer found enough drama in the tale without rewriting recorded history adds to the bookHe was also the protype for the lovable rakes and rogues that Georgette Heyer often made her heros."},{"Title":"Royal escape","review":"Charles II, a king with a price on his head must flee England so as not to lose his head as was the fate of his father in Georgette Heyer's THE ROYAL ESCAPE. The story lacks the bounce and style of her wonderful Regencies, but then it is an often told true story. When everyone knows the story it does not have the spice of fiction and yet this is a beloved story of a young man who would later regain his thrown.Not the best of Heyer's works, but it is worth a read to explore other aspects of her writings.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS and HAINTS."},{"Title":"Royal escape","review":"I have just discovered Georgette Heyer and find most of her offerings to be absolutely wonderful! I bought this one because of the author, having enjoyed quite a few of her other titles. To be fair, she researched this one out very well, as the bibliography attests (though it is a fictional work), and the main characters, King Charles and his consorts, are probably depicted true to how they themselves saw the situation (??). Given the very real roguishness of the real King Charles historically, perhaps this is the best can be done with the subject material.The storyline and characterizations I think most Heyer fans would find objectionable. The setting is England and the main character is King Charles who is trying to regain his throne after being removed from it by the Puritans (the same kind of persons who came to America because of religious persecution). King Charles is owned to be a rogue, womanizer, and bawdy, though with gentlemanly manners and a nice sense of humor. He is portrayed as a strong Catholic, and after his bitter defeat at the hands of Oliver Cromwell, he flees through the countryside trying to make for France. His advisers attempt to gain him places to hide and safe passage, drawing upon the favor of various Royalist Catholics loyal to the crown to hide the ex-King from his enemies.The Puritans are portrayed as immoral, \\"Bible-mad\\" (this term is used extensively in the book) and enemies of the King. The one-sided way the Catholics are portrayed as good and the Puritans as evil is calculated to make you to hate all Puritans. But you wonder if the portrayal isn't wrong. The characterizations of this enemy are neither believable, balanced or logical, and the \\"good\\" side isn't good. For instance, in searching for the King, the \\"Bible-mad\\" \\"Pious\\" Puritans come to a goodman's home and search it. Not finding the King, they accuse his most lovely daughter of being the King in disguise. The King is known for being a huge man, much taller than most men, hulking and dark, with an ugly, repugnant face and they take this lovely, young and small statured damsel and insist on her being stripped naked in front of the troops to prove she is not the King. When the King and his people hear of it, they are much amused by it, but nothing is said of the poor girl who was stripped and what she endured, nor of the inconsistency of people who claim to be piously Bible-oriented and at the same time filled with lust (after all, they are the enemies in the novel). This appears to be calculated to prove that all Puritans are wicked people, but I found her characterizations of the King and his company and their amusement at the tale even more so.The novel is tedious, and I almost put it down for good several times. Other than asking, 'Will he get away?' the only other side interest she develops is King Charles' penchant for bedding females, one case being developed quite strongly when a willing female presents herself to him. He owns he has fathered several bastards quite cheerfully and encourages others in his company to take females to bed, saying in one instance he would not pass up the opportunity to bed one willing woman were he in their place. The fact the woman he is speaking of is the wife of one who is hiding them doesn't seem to phase the King and we may presume that adultery was not a moral problem to the King. Noting the character of Charles as objectionable, his own morals as low, the lengths to which Heyer goes to characterize the other side as being morally evil may have been seen as necessary to make the King's side look \\"good\\". But it falls flat, with neither side being seen as genteel or worthy of approbation (admiration). Unlike her other characters in her other novels, where the main characters are very worthy gentlemen of gallantry, chivalry and worthy morals and manners, who show a sense of class, this man is not someone you would want to emulate or admire, or even associate with. Though born a King, you feel you have associated with a person of low degree bordering on the morals of a brothel by the end, not a man of dignity and grace. I found it difficult to wish he would regain his throne, since that position of power obviously afforded him many opportunities to indulge his lascivious appetites.(...)"},{"Title":"Royal escape","review":"Readers of this book may be interested to know that the Royal Escape is commemorated each year by a huge offshore yacht race that retraces the route Charles took when fleeing for his life.

If you like history, this is a fun read. How anyone could expect to pick up any book about Charles II and find a romantic relationship with a happy ending is a mystery to me.Charles II was more of a degenerate than a rascal, but he did provide some beneficial governance when reigned in by Parliament. For those who were shocked by this portrayal of the Puritans, yes, they were the ancestors of the people who founded our country. However, they were far from all good. Their actions during the English civil war included banning music and destroying many great works of art. As their movement escalated, it devolved into a brutal dictatorship. When Charles returned to power, he was welcomed back by most--that's why it's called the Restoration. Some of the Puritans who couldn't take it did indeed set out for America. On the one hand, they were protesters who wanted religious freedom; on the other, they were misfits who had to leave because they could no longer impose their religious beliefs on everyone else. So they sailed off to do good, although they mostly did well. Trading land for beads was mighty profitable, slaves were good for the bottom line, and accusing someone of witchcraft so you could take their property was another way to get ahead. I think Heyer was trying to tell us that there were no purely good guys in this conflict. For those with such unrealistic expectations, I recommend more history books along with the romance novels."},{"Title":"The United States and North Africa: A Cognitive Approach to Foreign Policy","review":"Dr. Layachi is a specialist on the Middle East and North Africa. He is the most knowledgeable scholar about the economies, culture and political systems of the regions. Journal editors and journalists seek his wisdom because he is the most articulate scholar in town. This is what Dr. Layachi thinks of himself. The truth is: Dr. Layachi is neither an economist nor a capable political scientist. He is 'sought after' because journalists and scholars, journal editors for example, think he is North African so they must be getting knowledge from its primary source. This is probably the reason he is hired in the first place. My impression is that Dr. Layachi writes in a rather boring style, his essays and books are too wordy even though he is now accustomed to using little tables. He basically copies and pastes (with some modification) from newsgroups - the main source of his knowledge. Apparently his teaching is as boring as his writing.

Kessler jumps around a bit and often spends too much time making a single point with multiple examples, rather then providing any real depth into one case. Ultimately a good read, but the lack of structure doesn't make it a page turner."},{"Title":"The FBI: Inside the World's Most Powerful Law Enforcement Agency","review":"By reading this book, I was hoping to get a better knowledge of how the FBI works. That included how the FBI interacts with local police forces as well as international countries about major cases.Kessler's case examples were boring. There was nothing suspenseful or interesting in the stories he chose to analyze. Perhaps he would have been better off saving more time to analyze Hoover's FBI as well as post Hoover FBI. It would have given the reader a more in-depth understanding and appreciation for how much it's improved and how we should be proud of the FBI."},{"Title":"The FBI: Inside the World's Most Powerful Law Enforcement Agency","review":"I am impressed with &quot;The FBI: Inside the World's Most Powerful Law Enforcement Agency.&quot; Kessler explains the workings of the FBI in great detail. He stays on track most of the time, although rambles now and then. His story is very intersting."},{"Title":"The FBI: Inside the World's Most Powerful Law Enforcement Agency","review":"I read the whole book even though it appeared early on that Kessler is a stooge for the FBI. If you want to know about Session's wife FBI pass or the fact that his assistant flashed her FBI badge at a state trooper to talk her way out of a ticket or how she failed to properly register her car in Virginia to avoid state income tax, THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU.If you want to know about the abuses of Hoover or Waco, forget it. Ruby Ridge is not even mentioned.I bought this book based on the Amazon recommendations. They are usually good. This is the first book that I have read that has prompted me to post a review. Any review that says this book is good must have been written by a FBI agent. DONT BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The FBI: Inside the World's Most Powerful Law Enforcement Agency","review":"I thought this story was very good except for one little thing, and that would be how they kept jumping from different people to different jobs. I would recommend this story to anyone who is interested in New York, New York's FBI, or just the way New York's FBI handles themselves as agents. BALTIMORE I thought this story was very good as well. The reason why i thought this is because Baltimore was the first city to have a female on thier force. I thought it was great to see how men as well as women have the courage to stand-up and fight for others."},{"Title":"The FBI: Inside the World's Most Powerful Law Enforcement Agency","review":"This is another around the world in 8 days tour of an American institution by Kessler. The author is presenting a book that is billed as basically an overview of the FBI as it is today with some history through in to give it some background and a few real life cases peppered through out the book for spice. The author has always done a good job in these large overview books and he has maintained that level here.He has been working with contacts from this agency for years so there is some interesting inside info that will be new to the reader, but a lot of the really interesting stuff has been spelled out in an number of other books or TV programs. The book is a well written and constructed story with a good road map though the years and departments. The reader does not get lost in a jumble of department abbreviations. A good overview book that is probably what most readers are looking for."},{"Title":"The FBI: Inside the World's Most Powerful Law Enforcement Agency","review":"When reading books on law enforcement, one has to be careful to avoid those which only glorify an agency, or only villify it. Mr. Kessler was granted an unmatched access to FBI agents for writing this book, and has chronicled the many successes of the agency, as well as some of its most public embarrasements.He pulls no punches when describing the shortcomings of agents and past fiascos, he names names and assigns blame. The final chapter of the book goes into detail about the previous director, William Sessions, his successes certainly, but also the abuses that he uncovered during the research of his book. His revelations led to Sessions' firing.He describes with a great deal of detail the workings of the agency on the street level, in the field offices, and at headquarters. One gets a good look at policies, procedures, training, and special ops. But most especially, he talks about real agents, men and women who deserve our respect for the jobs they perform.! The human interest in this book is very good, making it an easy book to read, and leaving one with a sense that the FBI is in fact the greatest law enforcement agency in the world."},{"Title":"The FBI: Inside the World's Most Powerful Law Enforcement Agency","review":"The FBI is one of the most respected yet least understood agencies in the federal government. Given it is frequently misunderstood, this is an excellent book to inform the public about the FBI's history, the good and the bad.The book focuses on an important concept, and that is the difference between the occupant of a position in the government, and the position itself. While past directors of the FBI may have had questionable integrity (Hoover, Sessions), this does not cast a negative light on the institution itself. People are corrupt, not institutions. No one is above the law, and yes, the author makes a good point that everyone who works for the FBI should be subject to the same rules and regulations that any common citizen does. That means off-duty speedy FBI agents must be subject to the same traffic rules as anyone else. No one is above the law, not even the president, as Mr. Clinton learned.I especially enjoyed learning about some of the past techniques the FBI used to shut down major criminal organizations. As Kessler makes note, many criminal enterprises work similar to businesses. One method -- creating shell companies, including cell phone companies and bars -- to meet and get to know these thugs -- is an incredible idea. The FBI's surveillance techniques are second to none, and while the author was able to discuss some obvious ones, the FBI's true secrets are left unmentioned, a good thing for Joe Citizen who just wants criminals taken off the street.An excellent book."},{"Title":"The FBI: Inside the World's Most Powerful Law Enforcement Agency","review":"This is an excellent well-written book covering various aspects of the FBI. As a law enforcment officer, this book has enlightened me to apply to the FBI. They are a remarkable organization making grand changes in law enforcement nationwide. This book is recommended to anyone in law enforement. Once you read this, you'll want to be an FBI agent."},{"Title":"The FBI: Inside the World's Most Powerful Law Enforcement Agency","review":"This is an excellent book about the recent history of the FBI and a good look at how the FBI operates. Kessler not only praises the FBI when it is warranted, but he also critiques it and exposes some problems. The book alternates chapters between looking at various field offices; ie Baltimore, Dallas, and others; with a look at the various departments within the agency; ie criminal profiling. It is informative, easy to read, and fun. If you want a look inside the FBI, read this book."},{"Title":"The FBI: Inside the World's Most Powerful Law Enforcement Agency","review":"This book provides a comprehensive look behind America's premiere law enforcement agencies. It goes into detail about the history as well as the major cases which have changed the FBI into what it is today. What makes the book nice is the way it is divided among the major offices in different cities which the FBI serves. Moreover, the author not only praises the work of the FBI but also takes a look at the misfortunes and mistakes the FBI has made which helps to humanize the agency. The book can at times get mundane as the author uses too many names of different people and of different cases. Overall though, this book was very well written and the interviews and excerpts given are unmatched."},{"Title":"The FBI: Inside the World's Most Powerful Law Enforcement Agency","review":"there is scarce mention of the Cointelpro program, or of some of the seamier sides to the agency as has come out over the past 6 years in the James &quot;Whitey&quot; Bulger case. there is something scary about this agency and its ability to surreptitously monitor us with little oversight. This book does a good job of showing the training and background of the agency and no doubt there are many fine people in the agency. However, it does not discuss how working in the agency affects its employees and i suspect there are more than a few stresses on the home life of people who work for it. It is also apparent that the agency is highly controlled and that field agents and the like might have a lot of restrictions in truly seeking justice. And the intrusiveness into one's personal life by the agency is something that cannot be understated."},{"Title":"The FBI: Inside the World's Most Powerful Law Enforcement Agency","review":"If you want to know about what the FBI does, this is a must read. Ronald Kessler is an award-winning journalist and he does an excellent job of taking the reader inside the most powerful law enforcement agency on earth.Kessler was granted extraordinary access to the FBI and he does a masterful job of revealing the way the FBI works. Forget what you see on television and in movies; this book provides a real look at this cryptic agency.Some of the findings during Kessler's &quot;investigation&quot; even led to the dismissal of FBI Director William S. Sessions.Though this book was published in 1993, I feel it is a must read for anybody who wants insight into the real FBI. It is also a great book for potential FBI candidates.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"The FBI: Inside the World's Most Powerful Law Enforcement Agency","review":"When my spouse applied for a position with the FBI, I immediately began researching the agency. I found Kessler's book to be the most informative. Much of what he wrote about the agency, we have since found to be true. Although Kessler gives a broad overview, his anecdotes are personal and insightful. Does the FBI have too much power? Kesslers objective account of the agency truly allows the reader to form their own opinion. A must-read for any potential Special Agents!"},{"Title":"The FBI: Inside the World's Most Powerful Law Enforcement Agency","review":"Prior to reading this book, you may want to establish your own idea of what it means to be &quot;inside the world's most powerful law enforcement agency.&quot; Does this mean having a privileged view into the FBI's remarkable crime fighting facilities and techniques, or does this mean knowing some of the sordid details of its bureaucratic infighting, botched operations, and office gossip? This book provides a bit of both, and perhaps leans more heavily toward the latter. Although Kessler does a good job of documenting some of the operational aspects of the FBI, he has given this book something of a tabloid feel, focusing more on the people and the myths than did his book &quot;Inside the CIA&quot;. Given the misconduct Kessler discovered while writing the book, and the comparative openness with which FBI (as opposed to CIA) employees can speak to the press, a greater focus on personas and storytelling does seem natural. Whether that focus is particularly useful in terms of understanding the day-to-day operations of the Bureau is doubtful, which is why you should know what you want by letting an author take you &quot;inside&quot; the FBI. Much of the latter portion of the book is devoted to a detailed account of misconduct under former FBI Director William Sessions. The account is painful to read, both because the details and character of those involved are so outrageous, and because Kessler documents it so convincingly. Insofar as opening up the Bureau as a whole, Kessler does take the reader inside various divisions (e.g. criminal, training, profiling, laboratory, etc.) and to various field offices across the nation. While some discussion is provided on how the FBI solves cases, the book tends to focus on office politics and on how the Bureau functions as an organization. Sometimes fascinating, sometimes tedious, this book is good reading, but not spectacular. It provides numerous anecdotes and a twist of irony: Director William Sessions was removed from the Bureau for the sort of exploitation which was commonplace under the original headship of J. Edgar Hoover."},{"Title":"From Eve to Esther: Letting Old Testament Women Speak to Us","review":"This book is geared toward women seeking spiritual maturity and is lined with the sound truth provided by Mohney's biblical examples.It is an easy read, motivating, and instantly applicable to one's life.

I thought that perhaps it was actually Dostoyevksy's personal diary. In fact, it is a journal Dostoyevsky wrote entirely himself and put out on a monthly basis. He muses on variety of subjects such as social-political issues of Russia at the time and criminal cases that have attracted his interest. In addition, he includes a few skeletons of short stories he is working on. Highly recommended for Dostoyevsky fanatics; newcomers would be better off reading Crime and Punishment."},{"Title":"A Writer's Diary Volume 2: 1877-1881 (Writer's Diary, 1877-1881)","review":"This book and its companion volume present the contents of a journal written, edited, and published by Dostoevsky over a period of eight years. It is a fascinating collection. There are stories; there are literary discussions; there are commentaries on current events, especially court cases and international developments. There are jaw-drop-inducing vamps on the harmful effects of the Jews on decent Christian people. As time passes and Dostoevsky grows older and sicker, most other topics are abandoned in favor of eschatological Slavophile ruminations on the &quot;Eastern Question&quot; and the coming triumph of Russian Orthodoxy. All of this will be much more than the casual reader will want to wade through. Yet for the serious student or fan of Dostoevsky's novels, the diaries provide a unique and amazing window into the author's thinking. For the student of 19th century history, they are an unforgettable presentation of one side of the passionate arguments over the future of the Balkan countries. For the student of Russian history, they provide eyewitness commentary on the struggles that accompanied the introduction of Western-style legal reforms, such as trial by jury. They are unique and amazing volumes, enhanced by a superb editor's introduction and useful endnotes."},{"Title":"A Writer's Diary Volume 2: 1877-1881 (Writer's Diary, 1877-1881)","review":"This is a book (actually the first volume of a 2-volume set) forDostoevsky aficianados. There is some very interesting and varied material in this large volume -- essays, imaginings, journalism, polemic, short stories, propoganda, rants, etc.. A kind of 'Fyodor Unwrapped.' It helps to have read other books by this great Russian Master, particularly his 'Big 5': Crime & Punishment,The Idiot, The Devils, A Raw Youth, Brothers Karamavoz. The translation by Kenneth Lantz is excellently done; the extensive Introduction by Gary Saul Morsom, is helpful, butdefinitely 'over kill.'The book, in fact, is a microcosm of Dostoevsky himself: plenty of flaws and foolishness, but always worth plowing through. He is, after all, probably the world's greatest novelist, and I recommend this book highly to those who agree with that assessment."},{"Title":"A Writer's Diary Volume 2: 1877-1881 (Writer's Diary, 1877-1881)","review":"All the elements of Dostoevsky's genius come through in this hodgepodge of literary forms.

Sakai's book, or maybe expanded pamphlet, \\"Settlers: The Myth of the White Proletariat\\" has had very little attention in the mainstream discussions and publications of race and class history in the United States, its impact being limited to the small numbers of 'Third Worldist', mostly (post-)Maoist, radicals in America. But this is undeserved, for despite its somewhat provocative and 'raw' style (including the annoying use of 'alternative spellings' such as \\"Afrika\\") Sakai's thesis is well worth reading.\\"Settlers\\" chronicles the history of race and class in America and the way in which they have historically intertwined. Sakai, himself of Japanese-American descent, traces chronologically the entire laboring history of the United States from Plymouth to the 1970s, in order to establish his radical and provocative thesis that the white workers in the US have always been a primarily exploiting, labor-aristocratic, parasitic settler class, living off the labor of blacks, Mexicans, Asian coolies, Native Americans, and so forth, whom he considers the true proletarians of American history. Sakai takes pains to emphasize that this is not a racial question, but a class question, where 'white' is whoever joins the settler class in exploiting the rest - the history of Finnish and Italian laborers, as first being non-white and then over time becoming white as they shared in this exploitation, being the proof. He goes through the whole sordid history of the US organized labor movement, its almost complete degraded corruption and racism from the start, its support for US imperialism, its opportunism in the South, its support for racial exclusion, and so forth, to show that all these infamous phenomena peculiar to American labor come from its position as the organized force of settler labor, above and against the labor of the wholly exploited classes.The Settlers thesis is well-argued and defended by many historical examples and evidence, mostly in the historical parts chronicling the pre-WWI history of the US. As such, it provides a highly interesting and useful theory that, unlike the rambling and opportunistic efforts of the American intellectual left, can actually explain the eternal question of why the US has lacked a coherent political force for the workers. Sakai's booklet is however marred to an extent by his sometimes overly sectarian and hateful approach, as well as by his failure to overcome the pointless and outdated ideas of secessionism on the part of the exploited minority 'Nations'. The developments in American politics of the last 25 years or so have decisively shown that American imperialism will always rather choose to unite its member ethnic groups to share the spoils of exploiting the rest of the world rather than risking an internal war that weakens it, and the laborers of this American imperial power will also prefer this, also when they are black or hispanic - Sakai is here clearly inferior in understanding to H.W. Edwards, who analyzed the power of social-democracy as based on the labor aristocracy created by _internationally_ exploitative relations, a pattern which can be viewed in America as much as anywhere else (e.g. Obama's run for the Presidency).That said, Sakai's thesis is absolutely important as a heuristic for understanding the complicated and idiosyncratic relationships of race and class in America now and historically, as well as for any attempts to build a serious working class movement there. Moreover, with the current tendencies relating to immigrant 'guest labor' and their descendent generations in the European continent, a sort of reverse \\"Settlers\\" may well come to apply there also, and Sakai's analysis can be of use in understanding this from a left perspective, without illusions.This essential book can be found online at http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2005/10/28/17790131.php.Be sure to also check out the later accompanying interview on the subject of this book, which clarifies and contextualizes much: \\"When Race Burns Class\\" at http://www.kersplebedeb.com/mystuff/books/raceburn.html.

Nietzsche identified so much that had to be rejected in human life and affairs, (and so much that constituted greatness), which is the reason for the sheer scope of &quot;Human, All Too Human&quot;. In 638 short aphorisms it covers politics, warfare, ascetics, morals, art, poetry, marriage, crime &amp; punishment, the soul, and the gamut of human feeling, emotion, motive, instinct, will to power, habit and need.In Human, All Too Human&quot;, Nietzsche outlines the basis of his later, more focused works. It is distinguished from these by its lack of arrogance, lack of aggression and its lack of real direction. Chapters are harnessed together by titles such as &quot;A Look At The State&quot;, &quot;Man Alone With Himself&quot;, &quot;Signs Of Higher And Lower Culture&quot;, Man In Society&quot;, and &quot;Woman And Child&quot;.The book was written just after Nietzsche gave up his professors chair at Basel in Switzerland, and around the time of his break from his erstwhile father-figure, Richard Wagner. Nietzsche had now lost the shackles of youth and employment and was at his most free-spirited and this book is testimony to that fact: &quot;Human, All Too Human&quot; is dedicated to deliciously-malicious free-spirits everywhere.Less intense than some of his later work, this book evokes a walk in the mountains enjoying pleasant conversation with one of the most penetrating and enlightened minds in history. Less intense perhaps, but no less compelling or unsettling."},{"Title":"Human, All Too Human: A Book for Free Spirits","review":"There are two readily available translations of Friedrich Nietzsche's \\"Human All Too Human\\". The first is a reprint from some unknown earlier translation, and there is no clear statement of who it is who did the translation. Had the translation been done by Walter Kaufmann or R. J. Hollingsdale, it would probably have been prominantly advertised. As it is, it is probably reprinted from the old, original translation, most of which Kaufmann and Hollingsdale have improved. But neither translated this book. The volume announces that it contains Parts One and Two, but this may be a slight misnomer. Part 2 of the volume is \\"Assorted Opinions and Maxims\\" and \\"The Wanderer and His Shadow\\". This may have been how these works were originally published in German, but if a commentator is referring to \\"Human All Too Human\\", they are referring only to Part One. One serious drawback of this edition is the unnamed editors have removed Nietzsche's paragraph numbers. For a work which will be cited in scholarly works, this borders on being unforgivable. There are several German and English editions of Nietzsche's works, all with different paginations; however, the paragraph numbering will be constant across all editions. This is why classical works such as Plato's dialogues have paragraph and line numbers, so texts can be found regarless of translator or if one is looking at the original Greek. Another absence which reduces the value of this edition is that there are no footnotes. Nietzsche never footnoted his references, so one has no clue, when he refers to an expression by Keats or Horace, where that expression may have come.The second edition (this one), a new translation by Mariaon Faber and Stephen Lehmann, with introductory notes and an introduction by Arthur Danto, is far superior, if what you want is the work entitled \\"Human All Too Human\\". It has all the original paragraph numbers and Ms. Faber has added plenty of footnotes to indicate the source of Nietzsche's references, even when they are obscure, as when he refers to a \\"Homeric laugh\\", she comes up with one reference in The Iliad and two references in The Odyssey. There is an especially important footnote at the beginning, showing a quote from Descartes (in both English and French) which Nietzsche had in a German edition of the book. The English edition cited above has nothing of that. The most important difference may be that Faber's edition translates all the items Nietzsche cites in French, Latin, Greek, or what have you. Nietzsche did not translate them into German, and the unnamed translator did not bother to translate them into English. It too me hours to track down the source of a quote from Horace in Latin. Faber has it right there, as plain as day.On the basis of a cursory look, the two translations are very similar. The main difference I could see is that Faber points out where Nietzsche invents words (an ever so easy practice in German, which so commonly makes up compound words at the drop of a hat.) If all you want is \\"Human All Too Human\\", and especially if you need it for some research, do yourself a big favor and get Faber's University of Nebraska Press edition."},{"Title":"Human, All Too Human: A Book for Free Spirits","review":"Friedriech Nietzsche lends some profound insights to the human psyche. His \\"will to power\\" idea is very compelling indeed. I liked this book much better than \\"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\\". In \\"All Too Human\\", Nietzsche is more direct, less thick and more clear. His ability to know the human soul makes this work almost as much an outstanding work of psychology as it is an outstanding work of philosophy. Sometimes, it is almost scarry how much Nietzsche probes into the dark reccesses of the human mind. Certainly Nietzsche's psychological ideas are as valid as Freud and Jung's rather far-out notions.In some ways, Nietzsche's ideas are close to William James' theory of \\"habit\\". In other ways, he is close to Alfred Adler's \\"striving for superiority\\".It is power at the base of all things: power over nature; over others; over even ourselves. I don't know if I agree but it gives a person a lot to think about.This book is written in the form of 638 commentaries on various subjects. Some commentaries are in the form of one sentence; others are up to a few pages. These commentaries can be read in sequence or in random order.I would say that this book is a useful addition to anyone's psychology library."},{"Title":"Human, All Too Human: A Book for Free Spirits","review":"I am a yogi from an educated family, and my parents gave me this book when I was 12. Nietzsche's presentation is typically unsystematic and he was a pioneer ensuring that we could view philosophical beliefs in a non-linear manner. The dichotomy of his unstructured book organization and his clarity and precision of thought create a tension that can break through many Western Black/White, Right/Wrong thought patterns to see deeper truths. When he says \\"our humanity is to be overcome\\" - some have used this to justify eugenics, nationalism, and seeing others as \\"less than.\\" If you read his entire thoughts (get the book!), it is more about overcoming the fragmented aspects of the self that weaken us, so we can be stronger and more pure. This is a spiritual thought from the man heralded as atheistic. Dig deep, and you will find that Nietzsche is beautiful. Yoga community friends - Neitzsche did not justify atrocities. He challenged us to grow and become better than our base qualities. He paved the way for Deserida's gloriously independent thoughts, and was an inspiration for the pop philosopher Ayn Rand's radical worship of the individual over \\"the masses\\" (which can be viewed as \\"cultural conditioning\\" in our times. This text is applicable to our lives today as the Tao Te Ching. For a completely different perspective (for balance of thought) read about Jainism as well. Then find your truth.

Their numbers, addresses, and prices are up-to-date, something of which other guides such as Lonely Planet would do well to take note.Descriptions of hostels provide contact information as well as candid observations about the clientele, room quality, and quirks, such as resident dogs and friendly staff members. I found it particularly helpful since there were so many hostels in major cities - the descriptions give you more to go on than just the price and location.I spent six months travelling around Australia, and the binding on my book was broken within several weeks. I always consulted it before hitting the road and found so much useful information. I later loaned it out to a friend who found it equally helpful. I always carry at least two guidebooks to a destination, but can honestly say the Let's Go guide was sufficient on its own to carry me through my travels. Australia is a wonderful country with much to see and do. I highly recommend this guide for getting around, particularly if you are travelling on a budget."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Poor Mrs. Quack","review":"This book is wonderful. It is completely told from the duck's point of view, which coincedently (surprisingly) is thick with anti-hunting sentiments. Nearly every page has one reference or another to how hearltless, cruel, unfair, etc that hunters are. Whether you agree with this sentiment or not, the blatant one sideness of the story makes this a very amusing book (I first read this when I was 7, now I'm 21 and I still love it, as a child I loved the plot and the characters, as an adult I love how Burgess is able to convey his beliefs and naturalist knowledge into a children's story)"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Poor Mrs. Quack","review":"The stories of life in the green forest are timeless. Bed time has needed to be streached so that an extra chapter can be read. Mrs. Quack is one lucky duck, and this is the story of how she comes to the smiling pool. Very well written, it kept the attention of both father and daughters. If you are looking for a way to spend time with your children, I highly recommend this book and others in the series."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Poor Mrs. Quack","review":"Very true, and honestly told, this book is a rare find in the genre of children's books. This story is about a duck that loses many of her friends to hunters and their guns. I would like to point out that due to the multiple mentions of shooting and killings, this book might not be appropriate for very young children, but the writing is excellent and along with Burgess' heart felt moralistic stand, I can't justify not giving this book anything less than a five star review.Two of Burgess' classic characters: Peter Rabbit and Jerry Muskrat happen one day to find somebody new in the smiling pool, Mrs. Quack. When asked why she was there, she explains of having to flee her home on account of multiple human hunters. Mrs. Quack's two new friends along with Sammy Jay and Blacky the Crow try their hardest to help Mrs. Quack find her husband and a new place to live. The overall spirit of giving is very touching, especially while amidst a negative side of humanity: hunting for sport, not for food.Darien Summers, author ofThe Mischievous Hare, a children's book."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Poor Mrs. Quack","review":"My kids love it! They constantly ask for more. The book teaches them about nature in a delightful and often funny way. All books in this series are not at all moralistic but kids learn common sence wisdom, good behavior and morals any way. Living books at their best. Very Much recommended. (My children are 5 and 7)"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Poor Mrs. Quack","review":"amazing very creative inspiering i highly recomend this book it has great things in it its a book that you say mom can i go and read now please! i was disapointed when it was over but im shure that you will like it!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Poor Mrs. Quack","review":"This review applies to the edition published by Dover. Unfortunately all reviews show up under all editions, regardless of publisher.Thornton Burgess' animal stories are wonderful and I highly recommend them. However, the prospective buyer should be informed that the illustrations in this Dover edition of this title are NOT by the original illustrator, Harrison Cady. Instead, they are crude redrawings by another artist, Thea Kliros. Although they are better than the illustrations in the Dover titles for which artist Pat Stewart did the crude redrawings, they are not as charming as Cady's work.Some of the other titles in this Dover series of Thornton Burgess books do have original Harrison Cady illustrations.To get real Harrison Cady illustrations of this title, you'll have to buy a used book. There were two sets of original Harrison Cady illustrations for this title:-- Published by Little, Brown, with 6 full-page grayscale illustrations.-- Published by Grosset & Dunlap, with 14 full-page line drawings, including line-drawing versions of all 6 original grayscale illustrations in the Little, Brown editions, plus many smaller line drawings.The redrawings in this Dover edition are of the 6 Little, Brown illustrations.I recommend the Grosset & Dunlap editions. Cady did them decades later, after he had grown as an artist. Even though the Grosset & Dunlap line drawings are simpler than the Little, Brown grayscale illustrations, they are more charming. On the other hand, the Little, Brown grayscale illustrations better show Cady's remarkable vision for Burgess' creatures, so if you can get both, that's ideal. But either one is better than the drawings in this Dover edition.Regarding the story itself -- Burgess was strongly anti-hunting, and while that comes through in most of his books, it's really heavy-handed in this one. So much so that it's essentially a polemic. I'm reading it to my kids now -- their choice -- and it gets a little embarrassing sometimes. I like that it's making my kids think about what life is like for the hunted ducks, but Burgess really laid it on thick. Overall still a good book and well worth reading, but if you're deciding what Burgess book to read next, I'd suggest leaving this one for last."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"This is one of Ms. Deveraux's earlier books and while it does demonstrate her potential, I would not recommend reading it. The beginning was engrossing and then it starts to fall apart. You're cursing the hero and the heroine and trying to keep track of all the new and &quot;cliffhanger&quot; characters that are randomly thrown in every few pages, and after a while it's like....who cares anymore? I didn't."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"It is very unrealistic. In the past, I have found Deveraux's books to be average but they keep getting worse. I have a relative that keeps giving them to me. I don't think I will waist my time reading the ones I have left. I didn't even finish this one because it was so bad/silly. There are some very good authors that I have been descovering lately, Madeline Hunter being one. These good authors write at a high level of intellectuality, and know how to tell/depict a love scene that really moves the reader. I really wouldn't even give Deveraux's book one star."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"After reading Judes Sweet liar, which is a wonderfull book,I bought Counterfeit lady. I am sorry to say, that I regret that now. After promising start book turned out to be very borring. Reading 150 pages about two people who gave up and now feel sorry for themselves is not my idea of having a good time. I do not recommend this book. But if you want to read one of the best romances ever, read Judes Sweet liar. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"Clay is okay, but Nicole is is strong young lady. Bianca I don't like her but I the same time I feel sorry for her."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"My review is going to sound much like the other reviews, so I'll keep it brief.I've read nearly every book written by Jude Deveraux. Some of her novels are wonderful and beautifully written with deep, loveable characters. Others are just so-so, that linger too long on the annoying shallow characters and too many sex scenes. This is one of the so-so ones. The depiction of the south during the late 1700s is wonderful, richly written, and spell-binding. The characters are shallow, superficial, oftentimes extremely stupid, and just really annoying. I'm not going to tell anyone not to read it because if you are a true Jude Deveraux fan, you can't NOT read it. But, just keep all of this in mind when you do. By the end of the book I was rolling my eyes at the fact that someone else was plotting to hurt/ kidnap the main heroine for the THIRD time....really? It could really happen that many times to the same person in the span of 2 years?? It just got annoying. Just let the couple supposedly \\"in love\\" (although they spent much of their time having sex rather than getting to know each other), be together already! And yes, as almost all the other reviews mentioned, Jude definitely mentioned the fatness of the other main character WAY too many times; we got the picture that she was fat after the first time she mentioned it. So, if you are going to buy this book I would suggest not spending $7.50 for it on Amazon, go out and find it on EBay or a used bookstore, it's definitely not worth that much. And enjoy the description of the south and the clothing, that's pretty much all that's historically correct."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"Great book, love the author, can't wait to read the next book.... I love that her books all sort of tie together somehow."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"This book starts out in an interesting fashion. Unfortunately, it quickly becomes a mire of dysfunctional people caught up in unbelievable situations. While the story line could have some potential, and the historical line should be interesting and exciting, it does not come together to be a good evening read."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"I love Jude Deveraux's books ~~ and this one is no exception. I love the main character, Nicole ~~ a strong woman who loves just as passionately as her loyalty is. She flees to England to be a maid to a woman named Bianca, whose delusions of grandeur is only a Baron in her past and her dreams to attain her family land that has been sold off in the past. Little does anyone know that Nicole, a French refugee, is actually a member of one of the oldest families of France ~~ her ancestors intermingled with kings and queens and married them. Throughout this book, Nicole is reminded of her mother's gentle admonishing to always be a lady. And she is.Nicole stands in for Bianca when a gang of ruffians chased them in the park ~~ and Nicole gets kidnapped in place of Bianca whom they really wanted. Married by proxy to a man she has never seen, Nicole is on her way to America. Clayton Armstrong is a plantation owner by default ~~ his brother and sister-in-law died a few years back and Clayton has taken over the plantation. From the beginning, Nicole has declared her love for him ~~ even though he has treated her horribly. Eventually, they both fell in love and then Bianca comes to America and wreak havoc in their lives .... will true love ever come for them again?It is an entertaining read ~~ in spite of the horrible things that Clayton did to Nicole. It was a glorified soap opera and and very entertaining. I know it's fiction and it's fun to escape into someone else's problems! Deveraux always manage to get me to read more of her books ~~ this one is no exception!9-26-04"},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"I am a big fan of Jude Deveraux, but unfortunately this book did not live up to my expectations, it started off wonderful and I really felt captivated by the refugee Noblewoman Nicole and had been reduce to working for a snobby english woman, but frankly after having that man threat her so horrible all those times I just wanted to reach in the book and slap her silly! I was routing for Wes to get her in the end! Now that would of been a twist!Not Jude's best work but its still worth reading"},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"I cried quite a bit in this book. I thought it was one of Deveraux's better books. I can't wait to read Lost Lady and River Lady. As far as what others have wrote about the weight issue.

I would recommend this book to anyone and I have."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"Nicole Courtalain is the daughter of a French aristocrat who is forced to flee France to escape the French Revolution. She is all alone. Her family, as far as she knows, has all been killed. An English gentleman and his daughter, Bianca, take in Nicole to serve as Bianca's maid. Bianca is a spoiled, self-centered girl who is engaged to an American, Clayton Armstrong. Despite Clay's pleas for Bianca to travel to America so they can be married, Bianca offers excuse after excuse to delay her travel plans. He finally hires men to kidnap her but the kidnapping plans go awry. Instead of Bianca, Nicole is taken. She is put on a ship sailing for America and also forced to marry Clay by proxy. Once Clay discovers the mistake, he, of course, initiates plans to have the marriage annulled. There are some twists to the plot that will delay the annulment plans, but by that time, Nicole is more than willing to put the marriage behind her and forget about Clay.This was such an excruciating book to get through. Clay and Nicole go through such a difficult time that I was hard-pressed to rush through the book and get to the end. Bianca is a memorable villain. She is clever, manipulative and conniving and there is no end to the lengths she will go to in order to keep Clay and Nicole apart. The story is beautifully woven but I didn't like the ending. Because of the intensity of the story, I would've preferred a gradual winding down to the end. Instead, the ending was abrupt, a lot like watching a movie at the height of its climactic intensity and then suddenly the electricity goes out."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"I had been looking really hard at the James River series before I decided to take the plunge and by _Counterfeit Lady_. A friend's recomendation is what finally pushed me over the edge, and I have been asking myself why I didn't do it sooner. This book is just plain fabulous. I was emediatly swept up into the book, and had a hard time leading a normal life. Jude Deveraux is a master at her genre, and sure knows how to write! This book reminded me of why I love romance so much. I can't wait to read the rest of the series!Nicole Courtalain was part of the French aristocracy when the Revolution broke out. Her family was slaughtered, and she fled to England. Bianca Maleson found her and decided to take Nicole in as her maid. Not wanting to be an object of charity, but not wanting to have to make it on the streets, Nicole accepted Bianca's offer. Over the months that Nicole lived with the Maleson's she decided that there had to be a better life out there for her. When one of her cousins aproached Nicole on the street with an offer to become a partner with her in a dress making shop, Nicole gladly accepted, working hard to get the money to become partner. Bianca is an obeese woman who is terrified of men. Unfortunatly, she is engaged. While Nicole is taking Bianca for a ride in the park, kidnappers come to take Bianca. Never before having met her, they take Nicole by mistake. Although Bianca has treated her badly, Nicole still feels that she must protect her, so she doesn't tell the men of their mistake right away, planning to let Bianca get back to safety. But, the kidapper's drug Nicole, and by the time she wakes up, she is on a ship already well on it's way to America. The captain is greedy and because Bianca's fiance is paying him much to abduct a woman from England and marry her to him by proxy, he is not willing to turn around, and figures that Nicole will do just as good as Bianca did. Forced into a proxy marriage, Nicole is now Mrs. Clayton Armstrong.Janie, a woman sent to help Bianca on the trip to America, is furious with Clayton. Over the long trip, she and Nicole became very close, and now she is going to give that stubborn man a peice of her mind. But, Nicole and Clayton are stuck with each other as the only way to get their marriage annuled is if they can prove that Nicole was forced into the union, and the only sound witness was on his way back to England.Nicole falls in love with Clay right away, but he is blindly in love with Bianca (for a reason that will only be revealed to you in the book). When it becomes apparent that the marriage could possibly be permanent, Clay starts letting his affection for her out of it's iron clasp, and there may be a chance at happiness for the two. He thinks that although Bianca would have been ideal, Nicole may not be a bad second choice. But there is always the threat of Bianca hanging over their heads, and when she comes to America, things are turned upside down. Can Clay and Nicole learn how to be together, or will two greedy people tear them apart?I can't tell you how wonderful this book was. I was pulled into it as I havn't been before. I could see the American wilds, and had a picture of each character made up in my mind. Jude Deveraux perfectly described everything to me, and I was so involved in the world of Nicole and Clay that the book was finished far too fast for my liking. _Counterfeit Lady_ is not your typical romance. It is the story of two people who fall in love with each other and then have to overcome many, many obsticals to be together. The majority of the book is not about them falling in love and living happily ever after... they fall in love and have to work HARD to be together. Nicole was the perfect heroine. She was petit, smart, beautiful and faithful. You know that she is going to be with Clay, but it is something that she will have to work very hard for. Clay was a very interesting hero. Sometimes I felt like he was sweet and kind, and other times, well... I would have liked to kill him. His blind love for Bianca made him rather anoying, but he got over that (but, a little too late). Now, Bianca was a character I really hated. Jude Deveraux made her so real to me that if I walked out onto the street and saw Bianca, I would have smacked her one right on the face. I thought I would hate her throughout the book, but I did feel sorry for her. Jude Deveraux is quickly becoming one of my very favorite authors, and this book is one of my very favorites. Read it, it's garunteed enjoyment."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"I genreally like Ms. Deveraux's work and picked up Counterfeit Lady expecteing another sucess. The book started off pretty good and I began to like Nicole, however it droned on and on, never really picking up, Clay treated Nicole horriably and she still loves him etc. It was painful to read because I just wanted Nicole to see the light and get over the egocentric Clay. And then there was Bianca who seemed to be trying to be a minor charcter but failed because she took up too much of the plot. The love between the two main charcters was so phony, and I kept reading it because I had hope it would pick up, however I was let down with the incrediably random and easy way out ending. I came to like Clay's friend Wes more than Clay himself. The book had good parts where Nicole shows her strength as a proud woman, but it wasn't enough to make up for the rest of the wasted space."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"I haven't finished this book yet, but I find it so annoying that I want to warn other readers to avoid it. The characters are not believable; they are all too often clumsily portrayed in broad strokes of black and white. The depiction of Bianca is an insult to all overweight women. Apparently her weight is indicative of her villainy. (...) Nicole is too sweet and virtuous to be true, not to mention being something of a doormat. And if she is part of the former French aristocracy, how is it that she knows the recipes for so many complex dishes? Aristocrats didn't cook for themselves; they had servants. There are so many other holes in the plot that they distract from the storyline. If you're considering purchasing this book, please don't waste your money. If you want to read a really entertaining romance, try \\"The Thin Woman\\" by Dorothy Cannell."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"This book was passionate, and full of romance. I rate it *****. The way Jude Deveraux writes is just breathtaking. She can make you cry, laugh, jump for joy, or fill you with hatred toward the villian. She is truly gifted especially in this mini-series, The James River Trilogy."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"I'd originally skipped over this one, even though I was trying to read all of Deveraux's books in order, due to negative reviews. I liked it and wished I'd read it before reading Lost Lady and River lady as it introduces characters from those books. Lots of great sex.My only complain is that there is no excuse for continuously harping on how fat the \\"villian\\" is, no matter how much of a b1tch you make her out to be. Seriously, we know she's a glutton and overweight, but I couldn't stand to read the word fat one more time."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"The premise for this book is what caught my attention but the story itself disappointed, especially as a huge J. Deveraux fan. I liked Nicole's character and the contrasting view of the very bloody French revolution with 18th century revolutionary America and, because of it, I think this story could have been something so much more... but the character development and the relationship development was uneven AND voluminous... sometimes less is more."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"I love Jude Deveraux, however this one is missing the usual Deveraux flair. The main characters were weak and confusing, the heros' friend was stronger and much more likable than the weak-willed, wimpy, main character- and the plot almost predicitable, this is the first book of Jude Deveraux's that I WAS able to put down."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"I have to say that I enjoyed this book for the most part, especially the first two-thirds, but I found the last third too complicated and too contrived. It was almost like Ms. Deveraux didn't want to stop writing about Clay and Nicole. I don't blame her; they were a magnificent couple. However, I was not too thrilled with the ending of this book. Ms. Deveraux took a long while to get to the end and to resolve the complications between the lovers, but when she did, she did it too abruptly and unrealistically. I was rather disappointed with the ending. I am, though, hoping that the remaining two books of this trilogy will mention what happened to Nicole and Clay."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"Very entertaining, clever plotting and memorable characters. Nicole Courtalain, a traumatized aristocratic refugee from the French Revolution, is kidnapped by mistake by agents of Clayton Armstrong (a strong minded American plantation workaholic who controls and manipulates everyone around him.) Finding himself married by proxy to the wrong bride (but emotionally and erotically drawn to her), is Clay's first lesson in life-doesn't-always-go-as-planned. (Nicole, having escaped the arrest of her parents, burning of her ancestral home, living as a commoner and learning a miller's trade, narrow escape to England, and working as a maid to an arrogantly unhappy Englishwoman--has already learned this lesson.) Nicole falls in love with Clay early and is torn and humiliated by Clay's slow warming to the idea that Nicole may not be such a bad &quot;second choice.&quot; Every time it seems like the two may have achieved a &quot;happy ending&quot; an unexpected twist appears to tear them apart. It is not until Nicole grows in strength and confidence and Clay hits rock bottom and learns that love, loyalty and friendship (not things, control or set plans) are the foundation for lasting love and happiness, that the final &quot;happy ending&quot; occurs."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"This is another keeper from Jude Deveraux, but personally its nowwhere near as good as AKISA, but oh well...we can't paint the Mona Lisa more than once or something like that...I like the leading lady: she seems cute and adorable, strong-willed and passionate...the hero is not too happy to find her in the place of his fiance but things heat up anyway...its got witty dialogue, sizzling sex, compromising situations, and well passion...it keeps me up at night :)"},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"I read this book years ago and recently re-read it.

It was very easy to get into.

I was drawn to the heroine but not so much to the hero. While I was reading, I kept wondering at Clay's stupidity where he had this incredible once in a life opportunity to be with a woman who loved him at the depth that Nicole did. It was obvious that Nicole loved him from the beginning but Clay in response did not appreciate her as say his best friend and everyone else. And his dog in the manger attitude annoyed me to no end. But thankfully, he came back to his senses at the end although he almost lost Nicole."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"_Counterfeit Lady_, the first of the James River Trilogy of books is an engaging story, one that will keep you preoccupied until you reach the end. Searching to reclaim the happiness he's lost, Clay Armstrong plots to have the woman he loves, Bianca, kidnapped and brought to him in America. Plans go awry and he's met by Nicole Courtalain. A turbulent romance begins between the two, with Clay fighting his supposed love for Bianca and Nicole fighting to show Clay that she's the one for him. You'll find yourself almost screaming at Clay's absurd stupidity and hoping that Nicole will punch Bianca. You'll feel the desperation, the love, and every other emotion in this book as if you're living them yourself. The book and characters are so well written, you'll even find yourself feeling sorry for Bianca. Ms. Deveraux really outdid herself with this book and the others that follow in the series. The perfect book for those wanting to experience the magic that is Jude Deveraux's writing."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"I thought this book was a DISSAPOINTMENT.NEVERMIND the predictable and at times boring plot, Ms. Deveraux doesn't seem to know any other way to describe Bianca other than &quot;fat&quot;, &quot;plump&quot;, &quot;swollen&quot;, &quot;so fat when she sits, she can't get up&quot;, &quot;her eyes were lost in her fat swollen face&quot;...etc. I don't know how many different ways Jude Deveraux feels the need to describe Bianca as overweight or how many different characters needed to tell her so. Wherever the name Bianca was, there was an insult to her weight and she eventually took on name &quot;The Fat Woman&quot;. It was unneccessary and took over the whole story. Instead of spending so much time on describing how repulsive Bianca was because of her weight, Ms. Deveraux should have been developing a stronger, more meaningful plot with likable characters."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"I have mixed feelings about Counterfeit Lady -- the first installment in the James River trilogy. On one hand, this novel is very emotionally moving with lots of twists and turns coupled with beautiful descriptions of late eighteenth century Virginia. On the other hand, the hero got on my nerves and Jude Deveraux throws political correctness out the window big time here. But more on that later. The year is 1794. Plantation owner Clayton Armstrong is madly in love with an English young woman called Bianca Maleson. Tired of her excuses for not marrying him, he hires men to kidnap her and arranges a marriage by proxy during the long voyage to America. Imagine his surprise when instead of getting plump, blue-eyed blond Bianca he gets a petite, beautiful and exotic Frenchwoman named Nicole Courtalain. Clayton is outraged when he learns that she was forced to marry him during the voyage and he agrees with Nicole to have the marriage annulled as soon as possible. It appears that his men kidnapped the wrong woman. A refugee from her homeland during the French Revolution and daughter of aristocrats, Nicole was Bianca's personal maid before she was kidnapped and brought to America. Her attraction and feelings for Clayton grow deep in a matter of days and she hopes that he will soon see her as more than just a second choice. But Clayton's feelings for Bianca run deep, for she reminds him of an old unrequited love. However, he may be in for a very rude awakening. There are many twists throughout the novel.As said earlier, I have mixed feelings about this first installment of the series. The story is riveting and moved me to the core. I felt Nicole's sorrow of having endured the pain of losing her family during the Revolution and then trying to pick up the pieces in England. I also felt her pain when her love for Clayton wasn't reciprocated. Clayton irritated me big time. As other reviewers had stated, he was too stupid to live at times. How could he \\"love\\" a spiteful, hateful creature like Bianca? He makes Nicole miserable whenever she witnesses his blind, undying devotion to Bianca. I wanted to strangle him at times. He reminded me of Gavin Montgomery from The Velvet Promise, for he also fancied himself in love with another woman. I know that is the whole point of the novel and that this is the central plot and intrigue, but I must say that it is my least favorite. Anyway, one thing I loved about this novel was the backdrop of late eighteenth century south. I pictured the beautiful plantations, the clean air, the high-waist dresses and parasols, and all of the other wonderful descriptions Deveraux provided for us. This is a beautiful time period and I look forward to reading more novels set during this period. One thing I found unnecessary and no doubt offensive to many readers was the emphasis on Bianca's weight. For a while I thought, \\"Okay, she's fat, I get it. Now let's move on.\\" I thought Bianca was a horrible, spoiled, self-centered, unredeemable villainess and I hated her. Her hefty figure was the least of my problems with her. I appreciate any author's attempt at realism (because making fun of a fat person, regardless of his or her personality, is an unfortunate common thing), and Deveraux does have a wonderful sense of humor, but not when it's gratuitous, and I thought it was definitely gratuitous here, not to mention excessive. And so, I give Counterfeit Lady three stars. I both loved and hated this novel as I read it. Novels that move me while reading it is definitely a good thing, but I nevertheless cannot overlook the faults in this effort enough to give it a higher star rating."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"The story starts out well with Nicole, a French refugee and aristocrat, being kidnapped in a case of mistaken identity instead of her English employer, Bianca. Nicole is shipped to the colonies to marry an affluent plantation owner. Clay has gone through a lot of trouble to get Bianca, the object of his odd fixation and worship, to America and is furious when he discovers that the wrong woman has been brought over. For a while it looks like it may work out for them as they begin to understand and respect one another. Bianca soon shows up to completely douse the rest of the story with misery. Clay cannot decide who he wants Nicole: who loves him or Bianca: who reminds him of a past love. The rest of the book is simply one after another of the most unfortunate and frustrating series of circumstances that any author anywhere could ever hope to imagine. There are ruined parties, more kidnappings, attempted rape, adultery, dead characters coming back to life, annulments, and the list could go on and on.The story line is not very good and I could've perhaps over looked it, though all the sub-plots and annoying secondary characters could have been thrown out with no complaint from me, but what truly ruined the book were the characters actions or lack thereof. Nicole and Clay demean there beautiful relationship by cavorting in caves and across the countryside as if they are ashamed by their love - they are MARRIED for goodness sake! It is unfortunate that they could not have claimed all the rights that this entailed them instead of sneaking around. Because of their separation they would just fall all over each other and two paragraph later it would be over and it might be months before the saw each other again even though they were husband and wife.Nicole refuses to trust him, not that I blame her he had done little to stand up for her or protect her from Bianca, however this time she should have urged him to fight for them instead of kicking him when he was down. By lying about her true feelings she only prolongs both their agony and ours another 100 pages.Clay becomes a flaming drunk who lets his beloved plantation fall to ruin when he thinks he's lost Nicole. Emotion is fine and being devastated over a break-up is understandable but the author lets him wallow this way for over a year and during this time he never does one thing to try and change the circumstances. To me this depicts a strong character as a weak and manipulated drunk who will not fight for what he loves.Finally the author fails in her depictions of Bianca as an evil woman. She is selfish, self-centered, and unwise but not really evil. It is more like she is a spoiled child that has never been told no and lacks any form of self-control. Clay in return for her ruining his life treats her terribly calling her awful and degrading names and even turns a little violent with her on occasion. I understand that she had put herself into this situation but there is never an excuse for someone stronger to abuse someone weaker no matter how nasty they are. Again it made me lose respect for the main character and when the convoluted plot was winding down to the predictable happily-ever-after I was more excited that the book was over then I was that these two miserable lovers were finally going to be together again.Have liked this author is previous reads but would not recommend this particular book to anyone not even her fans."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"Waste of paper and ink. I ended up using it to line my bird cage and feed a cozy fire in my fireplace.I felt the characters had no depth and the writing had no richness at all to it. It read like \\"Jane ran to catch the ball. Run Jane Run!\\" Also there were long episodes filled with nothing of any importance. The love scenes were entirely uninspired.I was also insulted by her portrayal of Bianca, the constant references to her weight as if it was of any pertinence to how evil and childish the character is. Very stereotypical: Bianca is fat, lazy and bad, Nicole is thin, hard working and good. Jude also seemed to waste what little sense of humor she has on describing how fat Bianca is and begins to sound like a kindergartener teasing a classmate. That alone would make me hate the book, but there's also the [disappointing] writing and meandering, predictable, boring plotline.I'd only use this book to prop up a broken table leg."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"I found myself speed reading most of the time. It started off quite well and I thought that I would enjoy it. But there was no sparkle between the 2 main characters. There is no depth to the characters.

I found it annoying that so much emphasis was put on Bianca's weight, as though it made her a more evil character."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"Many other readers have written reviews so this will be short. I found Clayton to be just plain stupid, weak, and an all around jerk. Although I know this is just a story it's totally unbelieveable.

I love Jude Devereaux's books, but I hated this one."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"I read this book years ago. It had a great plot but it got a bit silly in parts. Read it if you don't have anything better on hand. It was okay."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"I read this book more than a decade ago, and most of the plot has faded from my memory. The only plot detail I really recall is that the last third of the book isn't as well done as the first two thirds of the book.What I found unique and precious in \\"Counterfeit Lady\\" is that the main couple are happy together. For the middle third to half of the book, the couple are happily married and enjoy each other's company -- no arguments, no strife, no misunderstandings or secrets, no one out to kill them, just happy. After all of those other Romance novels filled with misunderstandings & strife, this pleasant atmosphere is refreshing and quite enjoyable. \\"Counterfeit Lady\\" conveys that joyful feeling of being in love.With that said, the objections raised by other reviewers are valid. I simply liked it anyway."},{"Title":"Counterfeit Lady","review":"Maybe it's just me but doesn't the main character lack any heroic qualities whatsoever. I never fell for this guy. He was weak and kinda sick in the head. This weird fixation (Bianca) on the image of his past weird fixation (brother's wife) really seemed on the verge of insanity. The only one who I was endeared to was Nicole. She stayed strong and in most cases wore the pants in this book.I truly felt sorry for the spoiled, Bianca. Nobody deserves to be treated so nasty but most especially it should not be made out to be a good thing to call people some pretty aweful names. In the beginning of the book she was just a spoiled, pampered brat but after being ridiculed and verbally abused. Even the children were allowed to treat her badly.I just didn't care much for this book. I can honestly say it was not a bad read but I felt I was disagreeing with the author the entire time."},{"Title":"Handbook of Relational Database Design","review":"In the still relatively young disciplines of logical data modeling and relational database design, this excellent text stands as an emerging classic.

As we see in this book, Marc Simmons takes us way to 1883 to a remote corner of the then-New Mexico Territory where a husband and wife were killed and their son captured by members of the Chiracahua Apache tribe on an old dirt road between Silver City and Lordsburg.The author's story reveals three salient points. The first was that the attack by the Apaches came at such a late time in the period of the Indian Wars. By this time, all of the plains Indians, including the hardy Comanches, had been relegated to reservations for almost ten years. Most of the remaining tribes were either on reservations, on the run or located deep inside Mexico. The second fact was that the victims were prominent citizens of the Silver City community and that the deaths and their child's capture was broadcast via telegraph from coast to coast; this was a shadow on things to come in terms of publicity and sensationalism which revealed itself in the numerous speculative stories on where the child was located. The last point was that this incident spelled the end of the Chiracahuas as an effective fighting force. The hostility towards this group was so strong that the Army, after the tribe's surrender was obligated to ship most, if not all of the men, women and children of this tribe to Florida. Some were transferred to Fort Sill, Oklahoma and by the time they were moved again to the Mescalero Apache reservation in New Mexico, only a handful survived.The author admits that much of the early record of the lives of the victims was missing and the first chapter was full of speculation. The other thing that stands out is the speculation on what happened to the child Charley McComas. The author generally accepts the story that the child, who was taken by the Apaches, was taken into Mexico where he died some time later after the tribe's encounters with U.S. Army general George Crook's forces. The final chapters are essentially an epilog on what happened to main characters in this story, both white and Apache. I recommend this book highly. The book contains 205 pages of text, end notes, an index and a bibliography."},{"Title":"Ironman's Ultimate Guide to Bodybuilding Nutrition (Ironman Series!)","review":"This book basically is one long justification for taking lots of supplements. I've been down this road, and at some point started to ask myself -- do the guys writing this have a reason to want you to buy supplements? Of course they do. Ironman is a muscle mag. Its revenues come from advertisements from the people who sell supplements. If Ironman starts dinging the idea that supplements work, its revenues dry up and it goes out of business.

The contrasting scenary ranges from the urban areas around Dublin and Cork to the wilds of West Ireland. A series of captions and miniature maps describe the subjects and the general locations where the photographs were taken.The photographs are a reminder of how varied the Irish landscape can be, and how beautifully green it looks from the air (and from the ground). Lighthouses, farm fields, sheep pastures, and small villages mingle with old forts and modern port facilities.

This book got so many great reviews---and why?? I am shocked at how horrible it is! It is full of ridiculous-looking make-up concepts (like one with a girl wearing a vertical line of blue eyeshadow drawn down the center of her eye on the lid and underneath the eye!) that looked like something out of a 80s music video! There is maybe ONE picture of a young girl who looks fresh and pretty. I looked at the copyright because I thought maybe I had just purchased something outdated--2004--so, that wasn't the problem! If you are looking for how-tos on make-up and skincare for young skin, this book is NOT it! Most of the girls looked like they were going to a Halloween bash or auditioning for a part in \\"The 80s Movie.\\" I hope the return shipping is free. I am annoyed---and annoyed at those reviewers!

Apparently that's not what Linda Mason thinks of when she hears the word. The book is well-written, with detailed descriptions of all makeup application techniques and makeup items, and she assumes nothing of the reader. The techniques she demonstrates are useful for everyday wear and perfect for anyone that's had trouble coordinating their eye and lip makeup without looking like a clown. Moreover, Mason includes girls of many races, with different facial structures, hair and eye colors, and recommends makeup techniques for almost all of them. Overall, this book is perfect for teens and adults alike - the only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is that she sometimes assumes that consumers have more access to professional makeup than they do (she advocates mixing primary colors in addition to using pre-mixed ones, etc).

The students she describes are college undergraduates. Target audience: parents and anyone who works with LD students.Dr. Cordoni addresses what she calls the &quot;social skills&quot; deficits of LD college students. In fact, the book deals with certain personality traits that seem to accompany LD; their effects on the LD student's social interactions with others; and what the student and his family, friends and educators can do about them. What can and should be done about undesirable behavior is emphasized throughout the book. Some behaviors (e.g.insensitivity to body language) appear to be symptoms of LD. Others (e.g. unwillingness to accept responsibility) may develop as defense mechanisms. Regardless of the causes, Cordoni believes: (1) that the student is often unaware of it; (2) that the student can be made aware of the behavior so that he can correct it; and (3) that tutors and parents have the responsibility to address and correct these problems.There is little discussion of younger students; what there is, is provided by Cordoni's observation of her own children.Reviewed by Stowe Davison"},{"Title":"Love Me More: An Addict's Diary","review":"It is easy in a first novel to fall into the trap of preaching, or manufacturing drama. It is easy to create a main character who is, even in her struggles, perfect and saintlike.Goska creates a character whose journey is sometimes hard to watch, sometimes painful to read. It is not as neat and warm and fuzzy as, say, a pleasant afternoon read for the Oprah crowd. Sometimes her main character is open, honest and giving-- in other moments, she can be a self-ceneterd jerk.But at all times this woman is real and believable and completely absorbing, and her struggles to find a love and purpose and hope that can fill her up are moving and touching and altogether real.This is a challenging work, but it is a challenge worth meeting."},{"Title":"Love Me More: An Addict's Diary","review":"Why read this book? This beautifully written story is compelling and yet thorny, like a wild rose, with all the lingering after-taste of great poetry. Danusha Goska somehow hammers nails into places in my mind that I never knew I had; yet in other places she plants healing kisses. Nothing is predictable, not the main character, not the plot, not the time progression. This book is a roller-coaster of emotion and experience and thought that you will never forget.Miraswava had me angry enough to throw the book down, aching enough to pick it back up, and laughing hard enough to draw stares. I am placing &quot;Love Me More&quot; among the Keepers on my shelf. This is definitely a book you will want to keep, because portions of it will haunt your thoughts and force you to go back and read it all again."},{"Title":"Love Me More: An Addict's Diary","review":"I first heard of Danusha Goska when she asked if I could set up a reading for her at Boxcar Books, and dropped of a copy of her book to sell on consignment. I was happy to set up a reading for any local author, but after reading Love Me More, I was thrilled!Love Me More: An Addict's Diary is not at all what it may seem from the title. When I first picked up the novel, I expected, at worst, a self-help book, and at best, a dreary memoir about a woman whose boyfriend doesn't pay enough attention to her. Don't be put off by the title; the book is miles better than those six words could ever express.Instead, Love Me More is a very multidimensional, far-reaching novel about the healing journey of a complex woman. It is the story of Miroswava Hudak, daughter of Slavic immigrants and survivor of child abuse, and her transformation from an insecure, unmotivated woman to a brilliant teacher who changes the lives of her students.The first question that any reader of this book will ask is this: to what addiction does the title refer? At first, it seems that Mira's addiction is food, or conversely, dieting. The novel is written as a collection of diary entries, and the diary begins with Mira's diet. At the beginning of the book, Mira thinks and writes about food (\\"Food is the problem\\") and her body image (\\"And so, I am a fat woman\\") quite a bit. But as the novel progresses, Mira gets a job that she truly loves, teaching a class called \\"Summer Session for Non-Traditional Students\\" at Tillman College, and it becomes clear that her real addiction is caring for her students. After her class begins, she writes less and less of food.One thing that the book made me realize is the universal truth that every person harbors insecurities and ideas of themselves that may be completely different from the reality of their lives. For instance, in the beginning of the book, when Mira is between jobs and spends most of her time alone or with self-righteous, condescending roommates, her diary reflects her as insecure, lonely and somewhat pathetic. But once she moves into her own apartment, makes new friends and begins teaching again, it is clear that she is in fact confident, personable and an inspiration to her students.Mira's job makes her contemplate the differences between those students classified as \\"Non-Traditional\\" (read: non-white, from a different country, not of normal college-age, etc.) and the \\"normal\\" students at the college. She even goes as far as to list off historical and fictional characters, and whether or not they would be placed in the SSNoS program: \\"Mao Tse-tung? Yeah. I think mostly just because he was so fat, and he had rotten teeth.\\" She acknowledges that she herself would have belonged in the program. Often she feels just as lost as her students, as they grasp for the words to translate their thoughts onto paper, and struggle with grammar. Though Mira mentions several times that she has a college degree, at one point she claims to be illiterate. As she witnesses the beauty and depth of her students' writing, she realizes these qualities in herself.Throughout Love Me More are excerpts from Mira's childhood, which shadow her present life with a sense of inferiority. It is clear that Mira strives to \\"save\\" others - animals, children, her students - as a way of healing her childhood self. As she remembers and records more and more of her past, she begins to question the reality of her memory, and of the words she writes on the page: \\"What I know is true is different from what the page tells me.\\" This explains a lot when applied to self image. What we know is true, the reality of our lives, is sometimes very different from our own negative self-image.I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, and was very impressed by Ms. Goska's reading at Boxcar Books on February 6. It's wonderful to be able to read such an amazing book written by someone in my own community!"},{"Title":"Love Me More: An Addict's Diary","review":"Let us now praise famous authors--and those authors who deserve to be famous, particularly Danusha Goska, author of \\"Love Me More: An Addict's Diary\\"! This novel-as-diary is about Miroswava Hudak, daughter and sister in a struggling, troubled Polish family, still new to America and about her direct, prolonged and courageous examination of her past and present. This novel doesn't follow familiar, expected formulae; it is more complex than any of them: the good guys may not always be so good and the bad guys may not always be so bad and maybe a little more effort all around at trying to understand other people would be a good idea. Though not everyone has Miraswava's experiences of world travel and of being a teacher, her diary deals with subjects and experiences many readers will recognize and recall from their own lives and readers can gain new insights and outlooks for themselves. Goska's novel is mainly about a specific character's experiences and responses but they will be of interest to readers of different (or not so different after all) backgrounds. \\"Love Me More: An Addict's Diary\\" lends itself exceptionally well to the medium of motion pictures and it is hoped that a film maker of respect and integrity will eventually translate Danusha Goska's book into a movie. Apart from Miraswava herself there are other characters that would be \\"dream roles\\" for many actresses and actors. \\"Love Me More: An Addict's Diary\\" is not short nor is it casual reading but it makes the reader think and consider and while it is an engrossing book it is also edifying and ennobling."},{"Title":"Love Me More: An Addict's Diary","review":"This remarkable book signals the entry of an extraordinary new talent in contemporary fiction. Goska has given us a fresh and honest perspective on class and ethnicity in the United States -- one of the most powerful explorations of these issues to appear since World War II. Her views are all the more remarkable given the prevailing piety about these issues at present. Along the way, she tosses off fascinating asides on the case history as a literary genre, popular tv sitcoms, sex, food . . . you name it. And she does it all in dazzling and madly inventive prose. This book is nothing short of amazing."},{"Title":"Love Me More: An Addict's Diary","review":"Fiction is sometimes needed to tell the most difficult truths. This book does that. It is a rare piece in that it describes the academic setting, and life within it and its value systems, from the perspective of a working class Slavic American. It also gives most first generation college students an idea of what life at the university might be like. While it probably would speak most strongly to a female reader, it still has a lot of value to the male reader. It also offers a view of what teaching might be like to prospective teachers. It would be great if there were more books out there that depicted life all of the various careers a kid could imagine doing, if only to let them know beforehand where they'd end up."},{"Title":"Love Me More: An Addict's Diary","review":"Goska is a writer possessed of (or maybe by) an enormous talent. She can be searing or funny or gentle, but her words are always compelling. This book sucked me in almost from the very beginning and it never turned me loose.Even when the material itself is painful or difficult, the book's an easy read because it's so arfully handled that you don't want to put it down. It is an astonishing, powerful work."},{"Title":"Love Me More: An Addict's Diary","review":"I first read Danusha Goska's Love Me More when it initially came out in 2003, and what excited me about the book then was its energy. It reminded me of the writers I read and loved growing up, Jack Keruoac and Saul Bellow and Nelson Algren. It had that same sort of high-octane energy that drew you along and made you want to listen to a voice alternately whispering and screaming and laughing in your ear. I couldn't stop reading. Her voice was a Roman candle lighting up a night that sometimes was desperate and battered, and sometimes was as lonely and dark as a cold desert on a moonless night.It was a book I admired and one that I've recommended to my friends.Coming back to it after four years, I wasn't sure what I would find. The novel that goes off like a Roman candle seldom does it twice. You go back to Kerouac's On the Road after a handful of years and you wonder about who you were and why you responded so strongly to a novel that seems to be moving too slowly to finish. I imagine we've all had that experience, but I was happily surprised that Ms. Goska's novel is still the same strong and compelling and unique novel it was when I first read it.It's the kind of book that's always surprising, full of insights and feelings and observations that always seem new."},{"Title":"Love Me More: An Addict's Diary","review":"I received this book for my 51st birthday. I kind of scoffed because one review said that she writes like James Joyce and the greats. Ha, I thought, such hyperbole.Now, three days later I eat my words and my scoff. I couldn't put this book down. I am amazed at the power of the writing on a topic that I wasn't particularly interested in reading about. The images and words drew me in to a web of human understanding and drama. The writing is so seamless that I feel as though I learned a great deal about perspectives of ethnicity and teaching and addiction and pain and humor and abuse and overcoming and living essence v. triviality while swept up in the honesty of Mira's life but all the time I was entranced with the original style and incisive use of language.In Danusha Goska we are witnessing one of the best writers of this generation. She has an authentic and artful voice that I hope will lead us as writers and readers to a new standard."},{"Title":"Love Me More: An Addict's Diary","review":"As I read Love Me More: An Addict's Story, I couldn't help but think that Knopf, St. Martin's, and A-list agents don't know what they're missing. They should be lined up, clamoring to represent Ms. Goska. This book is packed with exquisite prose, uniquely written.Miroswava Hudak is a young woman of Polish descent, floundering to gather shattered remnants of herself into some understandable whole. Mira is sick to death of donning masquerades to survive, weary of pretense. All her life she's seen herself as others see her, been defined by cruel words and brutal actions. Regardless of her true size, she sees herself as fat. As a child, food fed the craving space inside her. As an adult, she denies that starveling child and searches for less fattening means of gaining nurture. Healthy sexuality is smothered by her fear of being seen for what she imagines her appearance to be. Exercise is helpful, but how much is too much? And then she finds her answer.Words. Language. Thoughts and the expressing of them in her diary begins the reformation. Mira learns through writing to know, accept, and understand herself. And more, she learns forgiveness of past wrongs. In her role as instructor to low-functioning college students, her view of humaniity is enhanced and enlarged. The strength and understanding she gains feeds her students, and vice versa.Miroswava Hudak is a delicious heroine. Her students are endearing - even the unappealing ones - and her family is sympathetically drawn despite their faults. Not every writer could pull off a book like this. Danusha Goska did, in spades, because she's an accomplished and intelligent wordsmith."},{"Title":"Love Me More: An Addict's Diary","review":"Is this book about addiction and abuse?

YES!If you've ever felt like an outsider, like someone who has had to struggle to overcome those odds that have been randomly thrown at you (and maybe, especially, if you haven't), then you should read this ultimately uplifting story.With brilliant prose and brutal honesty, Danusha Goska skillfully weaves together many layers in this compelling story of one woman's search for love, acceptance and meaning.Trust me, you will be moved."},{"Title":"Love Me More: An Addict's Diary","review":"&quot;Love Me More: An Addict's Diary&quot; is a powerful and enthralling novel. Danusha Goska possesses the rare ability to not only see humanity - but to understand and record it. Her sensibility and awareness enables her to express the delicate shadings of pleasure, pain, loss, love, lust, loneliness, and so much more in a refreshingly honest and insightful manner. Her language is moving, her style facinating. I could not put this book down. Danusha Goska is one of the most exciting authors I have come across. I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Love Me More: An Addict's Diary","review":"Ms. Goska writes extraordinarily clear, fresh prose. She brings me along with her descriptions of her life. The only problem I have is that I'm just a bit tired of this view of life - the one held by 99.9% of the population.It's a perception of reality where it all happens out there, rather than in the specific past each of us brings to life. Perhaps I am misunderstanding (bringing my past to her writing) and if so, please forgive me. I would love to hear her words from another interpretation - standing in life as choice - generated or lived from past interpretations. I would love to have her paint that world!

Some are using &quot;wastelands&quot; and, more recently, the term &quot;brownfields&quot; has emerged in large scale in US, both under academic and institutional approaches.But, the pioneering approach on this kind of contemporary metropolitan situation came with accuracy in a text, currently classic, of the Catalan architect and critic Ignasi de Sol&agrave;-Morales under a more cultural context: &quot;terrain vague&quot; is an area without clear boundaries, without current use, vague, of hard understanding on the collective citizens perception, constituting normally a tear in the urban fabric. But is also an available area, full of expectations, with strong urban memory, potentially unique, the space of the possible, of the future.This new book offers us a collection of some intriguing articles produced by Sol&aacute;-Morales.

I've bought and sold scores of companies, products and licenses. While I've done an awful lot of negotiating, I always want to learn how to do it better.Unfortunately, this book didn't help me very much.The book is extremely boring. It goes on an on, yet never lays out a coherent negotiating strategy. Every 20 pages or so, it lays out a complex chart that is impossible to follow, let alone understand. It provides many negotiating examples. But, most of them involve Purchasing Departments or country-to-country foreign policy-related negotiations.In an attempt to make credible points, the author often quotes negotiating \\"research.\\" Many of the research designs he cites are so subjective and uncontrolled that no reputable business journal would want to report on them. It doesn't really matter though since most of the conclusions the author pulls from this \\"research\\" are very obvious. The few ideas from the research that sound genuinely new and intriquing are rarely developed adequately as the book meanders on.In its favor, the book stresses the need to aim high when negotiating. That's great advice. The book also notes how confident people usually make the best negotiators. The book also made an inriguing point about negotiating with aggressive parties. You want to alternate between being tough and soft, not just one or the other. That's a great point and, in a rare moment of glory, the book does a very good job of developing this point.However, if you're gearing up for a big negotiation and you want to get some useful negotiating advice beforehand, you won't get it from this book.Jeff"},{"Title":"The Negotiating Game","review":"This book does not present a \\"foolproof\\" way to negotiate.

In combination with the tapes, he portrays real-life examples of how he discovers the true motivations behind a sellers' needs, helps the seller reach those needs, and get a better all-around deal for himself in the process. Mr. Karrass truly seeks to improve the deal for both parties involved.I highly recommend this book to everyone. The techniques apply to both personal and business life."},{"Title":"The Negotiating Game","review":"This book does a good job covering the strategies that can be used (and are used) in \\"hard-ball style\\" negotiation. I've read Bargaining for Advantage as well and I think it gives a better overview of the different types of negotiation/bargaining that people encounter in their every day lives. It more or less groups the types of negotiations into 4 main categories (personal relationships, business relationships, casual encounters and business transactions). The Negotiating Game covers the strategies that are used in business transactions, where the stakes are very high and there is unlikely to be a long term relationship.I did find this book quite useful as the explanations are very clear, the writing is smooth and interesting, and the examples are good. I would recommend this book after reading Bargaining for Advantage to get a more in depth understanding of the kind of \\"I win, you lose\\" negotiation that people are likely to encounter not only in business, but also in negotiated personal purchases and the like (think: used car purchase)."},{"Title":"The Negotiating Game","review":"The author makes the point that negotiation is not just for the buyer and/or seller. It is for everybody. Husbands negotiate with wives. Children negotiate with their parents. Workers negotiate with their bosses. To be an effective negotiator, you need to know yourself and your wants, your opponents wants and needs, and organize and plan your negotiation. In this way, you can learn to have negotiations and agreements that satisfy the wants of both you and your opponent. Ineffective negotiators will not meet their needs and become unhappy.This is a great book to read to learn more about yourself and how you rationalize your decision making. Negotiation is indeed a great tool in everyday life (home and business). I commend the author for writing on this topic. This is a rare book that will help the reader with both his family and business. The only negative is the author putting much too much focus on theories when simple stories would suffice. This is why I gave this book a four star."},{"Title":"The Negotiating Game","review":"In this book Dr Karrass is discussing the principles of negotiating. There many things to take into account other than just power, even though power is obviously the most important single factor. Topics include the results of some experiments in negotiation, analysis of factors like who makes the concessions first, the role of motivation and sef-esteem, the importance of preparation, sources of negotiating power, perceived power vs real power, basic principles and some special cases of power, etc. The author has obviously given much thought to what makes a good negotiator.

There's just one catch ... the Boltons' new house, located on the dividing line between the upper and lower class sections of the city, seems to be haunted - perhaps by the ghost of its former owner, a mysterious old woman with a criminal past.How Judy and her brother Horace track down the mysterious apparition that keeps making startling appearances in the attic window and uncover a dark secret hidden in a packet of old letters found in an abandoned trunk makes for fascinating reading. And Judy's struggles to fit in to the sometimes cruel social cliques she finds at her new school in Farringdon remain as fresh and timely in the world of today as they did when Margaret Sutton wrote this wonderful volume so many years ago.Highly recommended, especially for those who have been introduced to the characters through \\"The Vanishing Shadow\\"."},{"Title":"The Haunted Attic: A Judy Bolton Mystery #2","review":"I love these old pre-WW II mysteries for teens. I have read almost every series available and the Judy Bolton series is among the best.I have a First Edition hardcover of this one (with a beautiful dust jacket illustrated by Pelagie Doane -- that's the facimile on the paperback version) which I bought at a junk store in Kentucky for a dollar! The work was originally written in 1932 and the First Edition features an arty black-and-white Frontispiece and has 212 pages (not counting the four pages of advertising for other girls' series books at the end.)The story is that Judy's dad (a physician) is given a free house in Roulsville subsequent to a flood where their own home was lost -- the hook is, the house is haunted! Judy and her brother, Horace, set out to solve this mystery along with a recent rash of robberies in town. Sub-plots include Judy's troubles with new friends at school and she also trys to help an adopted friend learn more about his parents.This book was written for a completely different generation of teen girls so this work is probably best for fairly young gals (10-11?) who have yet to have their minds polluted with contemporary fare. There is a strong ethical flavor to the story that really comes off today as somewhat unrealistic but it still makes for interesting reading. One will also encounter dialogue which comes off as a little incongruous today:\\"Aw, it'll queer the whole party if we don't hear the love letters,\\" sighed Sally Belaski,\\" (Page 203-4).This entry is not as good as another in the series, The Ghost Parade: A Judy Bolton Mystery #5, or even Sutton's first entry,The Vanishing Shadow (Judy Bolton Mysteries), the latter of which was based upon an actual incident.

We lived in Freeport, NY, a boating & fishing village of about 52,000. To my amazement, the writer whose home I visited was THE Margaret Sutton of my childhood, and Margaret and I became friends.

It is clear from the opening pages that the author is writing from a position of immense knowledge on the subject matter and what is essentially a critical reading of Plato is, in itself, almost as intellectual. It is a book that requires every single line to be read and even re-read to understand what is being intimated. The opening chapter on the Eidetic and the Genetic draws on the conversation between Clinias Megillus and an unknown Athenian.. Where it immediately becomes difficult is in comprehending the smenatics behind the author's statement that if Plato's Laws is a prelude to laws then the first three books are a prelude to the laws of Magnesia and the Athenian's initial proposal is a prelude to the prelude that is Plato's Laws. You see how precise the language becomes and how clarity of meaning is essential to undestand the book as a whole, as it continues in the same vein.The author has produced a work of astonishing intellectual depth and, as such, it is clearly intended for the classical philosophical student of Plato. It is a book that will become a reference text, for to read it in one go would invariably mean losing the true meaning of the critical work, in the same way you shouldn't attempt to read the Laws in one sitting. Highly recommended for any Platonist."},{"Title":"Plato's \\"Laws\\": The Discovery of Being","review":"Before you make the mistake of thinking this is one of Benardete's literal translations, be warned it most definitely is not! After buying this book I was horrified to discover as I flicked through the 400 pages that it's nothing more than a commentary which is not what I wanted nor what the other reviews here made clear. What a dreadful waste of money and time.If you want a literal translation of Plato's Laws try Thomas Pangle at this amazon link:The Laws of Plato"},{"Title":"Plato's \\"Laws\\": The Discovery of Being","review":"When one thinks of Plato and his ideas of politics, one naturally gravitates toward his best-known work, the Republic. In that book, Plato set up the ideal city-state, with classes born and bred to specific functions and roles in society, and a sense of philosophical outlook consistent across the board. However, such a society was unlikely to be brought out, in Plato's time and, as it turned out, in any other.Plato tried at different times to persuade rulers to become his envisioned philosopher-king; the last attempt was with a tyrant of Syracuse, who in the end imprisoned Plato rather than following his directions. Plato wrote this work, 'The Laws', as the last of his dialogues. Its difference from the Republic is immediately apparent in the absence of Socrates as a character - Plato at the end of his life has finally taken to working in his own right and not through a proxy.Just looking at the contents will show the breadth of this work - it involves practically every aspect of civil society: legislative bodies (and Plato has some scathing commentaries on some that he has known); education and its proper role and method (including even drinking parties as part of the educational process); ideas of monarchy, democracy, and the balance of power (some American constitutional ideas were generated from a reading (and occasional misreading) of this work); civil administration; arts and sciences; military and sports training; sexual conduct; economics; criminal law, torts, and judicial process; religion and theology; civil law, property and family law; Plato even argues for the need of a 'nocturnal council', one that delves not only into the practical aspects of the law, but also their philosophical bases.According to translator and editor Trevor Saunders, 'The reader of the Republic who picks up the Laws is likely to have difficulty in believing that the same person wrote both.' Saunders speculates that Plato in his older years changed from optimism to pessimism, from idealism to realism, but that this is not all there is to the assumption, because in actual fact the transition from the Republic to the Laws involves transitioning unattainable ideals to attainable realities.Plato describes the construction of a utopian society in great detail, down to the number of citizens permitted to live in the city (5040) and the length of time foreigners might reside in the city (20 years). This shows that Plato considers politics to be an exact science (indeed, despite the inclusion of the 'nocturnal council', he did see his system of laws being essentially unalterable through history). Plato is not averse to the use of force and coercion to set up and maintain the utopian society. Finally, Plato sees a self-contained kind of society that is likely to become xenophobic to the extreme, with less tolerance toward its own citizens than toward those foreigners permitted to live and work in the city. Indeed, for the virtuous citizens to be free to pursue their virtue, the majority of the manual work and crafts must be done by a worker class composed of slaves or immigrant workers, or both.Plato's Laws suffer from much greater criticism in the modern world than the Republic, in part because it is a more 'realistic' work, with a reality that no longer applies. However, many of his insights are worthwhile, and the overall structure of his society reflected in the Laws is worth discussion as much as is that of the Republic. One of the problems with this work vis-a-vis the Republic is its length (the Laws is considerable longer); another problem is that it lacks the dramatic reading possible from the Republic, rather the difference between a political debate and a legal seminar. Still, it is an important work, showing how Plato's thought had shifted in his lifetime."},{"Title":"Root Causes of Suicide Terrorism: The Globalization of Martyrdom (Political Violence)","review":"A top 10 of many of the most influential books on suicide terrorism.

Stylistically, she is a lyrical, image-driven poet, often focusing on small details to create the overall picture, as in &quot;My Father Perceived as a Vision of St Francis.&quot; Much of Meehan's writing is influenced by her early childhood spent in a neighborhood north of the Liffey. In an interview with John Hobbs which appeared in Nua: Studies in Contemporary Irish Writing (web site), she said, &quot;The area I grew up in had all the attributes of a village. It was a fairly close-knit community, the last of the working class. All the traditional industries were in decline, so we were about to enter a world of no work and no hope. I don't want to romanticize it, because there were dark sides to the culture as well, but it was the end of this community as a stable, self-sustaining unit within the greater city....That village had an incredibly rich culture, at least in terms of the oral tradition....it's the context for many of these poems.&quot; This awareness of place and community can be seen clearly in many of Meehan's poems. For example, in &quot;A Child's Map of Dublin,&quot; she writes,I walk the northside streets / that whelped me; not a brick remains / of the tenement I reached the age of reason in. Whole / streets are remade, the cranes erect over Eurocrat schemes / down the docks. There is nothing / to show you there, not a trace of a girl / in ankle socks and hand-me-downs, sulking / on a granite step when she can't raise the price of a film, / or a bus to the beach.This sort of writing appears often in Meehan's work. It roots her work very much in the present and conveys the impact of recent changes in Irish political, economic, and social life."},{"Title":"When the Stars Danced","review":"Many readers are familiar with Crying Wind's first two books, Crying Wind and My Searching Heart. This volume continues the story of her life. Crying Wind is a master story teller who uses her Native American background to bring truth and beauty to a story of laughter, pain, joy, adventure. Crying Wind's story is witness to the way God spans time and cultures with His love. Parents and children alike will enjoy this account of how Little Antilope, Lost Deer, Snow Cloud, and Spring Cloud grew up in their dual world with their parents Crying Wind and Don Stafford. Crying Wind tells her story compellingly, beautifully including how she adjusted to life afer Don's sudden death. This is a book for those who have seeking hearts, and all who enjoy beauty.

Evan with the help of Manny, Kalila and a Mossad comando destroy the complot but once in USA the congressman is launched as a favorite by a secret society called Inver Brass to the candidature of the vice presidency of United States and again Evan is involved in another trama, this time one of corruption in the highest spheres of Washington.A very well written novel and very actual, some personages, like Mahdi has a clear resemblance with Osama Bin Laden, the Inver Brass Club as the &quot;secret establishment&quot; or the so called power behind the throne which indirectly govern in Washington for generations, the arab-israeli conflict or the nowaday international terrorism histeria. A story that has a little of everything, espionage, terrorism, action, romance, intrigue, policy and philosophical point of views."},{"Title":"The Icarus Agenda [Paperback]","review":"The reason I decided to finish this book is because by time I had read to page 400, I figured I might as well keep going. This book is a real drag. The 700 pages are a classic Ludlum example of 'Quantity, not quality.' This book easily could have been 300 pages less. Most of it is political talk in which Robert tries to keep your attention by adding exclamation points or italics within every sentence.After reading the Bourne series and Matarese Circle, this was way too long. I can't believe other reviewers when they claim this was 'action packed' and a 'page turning thriller'. One review said that the rescue in part one was so exciting they couldn't stand it.I am still waiting for this book to pick up and take me away with all the action that most reviewers have proclaimed, but it's too late for that because I have finished. Not even enough substance to keep my interest. I just wish I had it in me to take a book and stop reading it after I've gotten 2/3 of the way thru. The reviews that raved about this Kendrick guy being the next Bourne and that this book could have been 3 exciting books... One, not even close. Two, sorry but one drag is enough. One star because it has some similarities to today's war on terror in America and one star to me for somehow surviving this one= 2 stars."},{"Title":"The Icarus Agenda [Paperback]","review":"I've read a few of Robert Ludlum's books over the years. Many of them were quite good. At his best, Ludlum's stories are fast-paced, action-packed and entertaining. They're hard to put down. Unfortunately, while THE ICARUS AGENDA has these elements, the story doesn't come together well and it suffers from weaknesses less obvious in Ludlum's better books.The story is in the form of two sub-plots. The first, which encompasses the rescue of American hostages being held within the US embassy in Masqat, is the part I found most engaging, although the ending is too clean and easy. Fleshed out and given a better ending, this story could have made a good book by itself.The second sub-plot finds the hero of the first part back in his remote Colorado home. His cover from the first operation blown, his home is under siege by Arab terrorists seeking revenge. At the same time, he is caught between two domestic political cabals, one seeking to push him into running for national office while the other wants to prevent his candidacy. This plot was a bit too much. One or the other of these storylines could have made another good book. Together, the situation just feels contrived. Moreover, Ludlum's domestic political plot comes off heavy-handed and nieve.The characters ultimately come across poorly, too, and stereotypes abound. The hero, Congressman Evan Kendrick, spends the entire book professing his desire to be left alone, but always allowing himself to be drawn in. He's just too good to be true. In addition, there's the obligatory gorgeous and extremely available woman, as well as an ally in the first plot who just happens to be a wealthy old Jewish guy whose health is represented as fragile. He becomes an immediate and important character in the second and, despite his age and frailty, he survives all of the madness and mayhem of the second half of the book intact. It's all pretty fluffy stuff and, while there's plenty of action throughout, THE ICARUS AGENDA becomes increasingly difficult to swallow as it progresses.THE ICARUS AGENDA isn't really a BAD book, but neither is it terribly good. As Ludlum's books go, it's a letdown. If you've read some of his other works, don't take on this one with high expectations. If you haven't read any of Ludlum's other books, find a better one than this."},{"Title":"The Icarus Agenda [Paperback]","review":"Robert Ludlum is one of my 3 favorite authors. He transcends the gender factor in all of his books. I got my son (33 years old) reading his books and even he enjoys the little bit of romance Ludlum puts in his books.The suspense of the plots keep me on the edge of my chair. I work 8-5 Monday through Friday and have often still been reading when my alarm would go off.

I kept waiting for it to pick up, but found that it never really got off the ground.This book is a rarity, a Ludlum novel I wouldn't recommend."},{"Title":"The Icarus Agenda [Paperback]","review":"This novel is frustrating, insubstantial and very very improbable. A caucasian US Congressman dons dark makeup to pass for an Arab, infiltrates a terrorist organization in Oman, convinces them he is a fellow terrorist, and somehow foils their plot. All this despite his obvious non-native accent which isn't even mentioned by Robert Ludlum. He then keeps the entire caper a secret until one covert agent recognizes him from a photograph.The only interesting plot involves a secret star chamber-like organization scheming to select the next US President. Once again logic holds no sway in this universe because the secret organization is apparently risking their lives and reputations for entirely altruistic reasons, with no personal benefit expected or desired from the new administration.Please stay away unless you enjoy smacking your forehead with the palm of your hand every 20 pages."},{"Title":"The Icarus Agenda [Paperback]","review":"Fast moving, intricate plot, and above all good time pass reading.

I have read 12 or more of Ludlum's books. They have always satisfied. This latest one however is just too rambling.

Sorry, it's just not up to his usual high level."},{"Title":"The Icarus Agenda [Paperback]","review":"This wasn't that good. I don't know why I kept reading it. I suppose I wanted to know what would happen. The character is unbelievable. I was wondering how they could sneak up and take pictures of someone out kayaking in the wild. I think about that sometimes when I'm in the wilderness. There were some other parts that were better. If it wasn't so long it would have been good. Having long laughable love scenes with Arab women is like a bad romance novel. I wonder if Ludlum wrote this himself or if he was using a ghostwriter already, possibly coming up with parts of it and passing off the rest like Tom Clancy does."},{"Title":"The Icarus Agenda [Paperback]","review":"A shocking tale of how a government can have many offshoots that can manipulate an entire nation. It's a bit drawn out, and the insertion of Arabic dialect disrupts the flow of the story, but it still grabs you by the throat. Twists and turns and overlapping situations leave you on the edge of your seat, wondering when everyone will realize they are working against and sometimes with each other. Even the denounment has shocking revelations and references to The Chancellor Manuscript are obvious. The ending leaves you wishing for a little more (if it wasn't so long-winded with the Oman connection, a lot more)as a new development sets your mind racing. This book has sequel written all over it. Sadly, with Ludlums' passing, it won't happen. I hope reincarnation is true in this case."},{"Title":"The Icarus Agenda [Paperback]","review":"This novel is related to The Chancellor Manuscript in some ways. There is another secret cabal at the heart of the USA, but this one is not so crazy as some of the other terrorists, crazy generals, or whatever.They are looking for a man with integrity, but the man they want they suspect may be involved with dodgy goings on to cause big problems in the Middle East.

It has probably the best hero in all of Ludlumville - Evan Kendrick. The story of the Middle East is intriguing and the action and conclusion are near perfection.This is one of those books in which I enjoyed the changing of the settings with the chapters. Also, as another reviewer has written, it is really more than one book - each of which could have been flushed out to a story of its own. There is not a lot of fluff in this one despite its size."},{"Title":"The Icarus Agenda [Paperback]","review":"I've read everything Ludlum wrote, and this is the only one I couldn't finish.

Every one of them keeps me up far past my required midnight bedtime.Robert Ludlum has this habit of writing a novel that moves, moves, surprises you, then moves again, and you almost feel breathless waiting for the next crisis to happen to the protagonist and what on earth will the protaganist do to get out of this mess!I sure do wish that Robert Ludlum would write a story about a female heroine that is just as wonderful a protagonist as his male characters, though."},{"Title":"The Icarus Agenda [Paperback]","review":"Ludlum didn't know military aircraft and rank very well, but aside from those small glitches, the story was highly entertaining."},{"Title":"The Icarus Agenda [Paperback]","review":"In his prime, absolutely nobody could touch Ludlum's sheer plotting brilliance when it came to the international thriller, NOBODY. 'The Icarus Agenda' is a great example of his style, and the ONLY thing that kept this book from 5-stars was that it slightly dragged in a couple areas...but remember, Ludlum at his worst is still better than most authors at their BEST.As another reviewer mentioned, this book was more like 3 books-in-one, and I agree. First we have Evan Kendrick making a daring rescue. Next we have his being identified as the person responsible -- which is exactly what he DIDN'T want. And finally we have the real meat of the story: the ultimate action of who is REALLY responsible for the whole thing, and how Evan goes about handling the situation and solving the problem at the same time. Action on top of suspense on top of even more action. Aside from the small tedious slow writing in the middle, this book has about as much action as a novel can possibly have. If you are searching for a James Bond meets Die Hard meets True Lies type book, trust me, 'The Icarus Agenda' most definitely fills the bill. I have heard rumors for years how Ludlum was going to try and turn Evan Kendrick into a series similar to Jason Bourne, but unfortunately, he passed away, and that remains one of the greatest losses in the literary world in a very long time. He will be sorely missed."},{"Title":"The Icarus Agenda [Paperback]","review":"ICARUS AGENDA has all the hallmarks of a typical Robert Ludlum thriller - suspense, mystery, surprises around the corner, memorable characters and well-researched locales - also, the elephantine narrative which in this case unfortunately seems to go nowhere, particularly in the midsection. Hence a 4 star rating. However, the book's finer points are many. The story concerns Evan Kendrick, a quiet, mild-mannered Congressman who becomes an unlikely hero when over two hundred hostages are held by Islamic terrorists at the US Embassy in Muscat(spelt MASQAT in the book), Sultanate of Oman. Kendrick dares to avert the crisis by using his work experience in the Middle East and the deaths of several of his employees as a platform for vengeance against the Arab terrorists. He infiltrates an Omani prison to gather information, but when he is hailed a hero for bringing the hostage situation to an end, Israeli Mossad agents seek revenge as his intervention has prevented their rescue of a Mossad agent, Ben-Ami, who holds a secret. Someone is controlling both sets of terrorists, and who is the Mahdi? One year after the Oman affair, Kendrick's life is shattered again as the Arabs come after him, corruption in the White House and CIA is rife as his past is revealed, then his home is attacked. Events lead to a massive arms dealing ring. Can Kendrick save the day in 808 pages time! This Ludlum monster is well worth a read, but I'm surprised his editor didn't do any more cutting and editing, in my view. A lot of the political White House talkative scenes could have been cut down . . . obviously Ludlum's not renowned for the KISS(keep it simple stupid) approach! So, summing up, a great and susupenseful(in most parts) read, but if you're new to Ludlum, THE AQUITAINE PROGRESSION or MATARESE CIRCLE are the best ones to read first.Nick Warren."},{"Title":"The Icarus Agenda [Paperback]","review":"If you like the nonstop action of James Bond's movies, then you will instantly be lured into any of Robert Ludlum's books. Ludlum inserts life into the most thrilling and twisting plots in such a compelling way that you believe they are true. All good books make you want to keep reading; however, in each of the many Ludlum novels I have read there is simply no stopping. Ludlum pulls his readers into his stories and gets them hooked in a way few authors can. The Icarus Agenda by Robert Ludlum is no exception and will leave even the most read Ludlum fan intrigued and involved. Once you start this book, you go from interested to absorbed in about two pages. The scenario involves hundreds of Americans being held hostage in an American Embassy in the Middle East. All divisions of the government are desperately trying to free the hostages; however, only one man who bid farewell to the Middle East long ago after a tragic accident can truly save them. Behind the somewhat simplistic terrorists is a group of wealthy and powerful individuals who will stop at nothing until they have complete control of the region. Ludlum takes us through a heart-pumping journey of one man's fight to save the hostages and break the mysterious group of individuals fueling the terrorism. After what must be one of the most intense struggles for freedom ever put on paper, the reader is only done with part one of the three-part book. The first part of the book could be a novel in itself and if it were, I would still be writing its praises; however after the roller-coaster ride of the first 200 pages, the reader learns that this is only the beginning. The man who rescued the hostages took neither credit nor praise for his heroic accomplishments because he did not want anyone to know what he had done. \\" No one's to know I've been here. I never talked to you or anyone else.\\" (pg.11) One reason that he did not want people knowing his identity was that he did not want people thinking that he saved the hostages purely for his own well being. He did what he did because the people that were holding the hostages were the same people that had killed his friends years earlier. Out of a desire for revenge, he had performed acts of heroism unseen in the world today. He then disappeared back to his normal life, or at least he tried to. This is where Part Two takes over. The courageous hero's identity is revealed and he suddenly becomes the most hunted man in the world. He is the target of every terrorist organization because of his daring rescue actions at the embassy. The question is though can those around him and those whom he helped by freeing the hostages save him, or are the people that he helped the ones he should be truly concerned about. Compelling twists and turns leaves the reader zealously searching for answers like a mouse in a maze frantically searching for the cheese. One of the only bad things about this book is that it is well over 600 pages long. However, the length of the book is only a bad thing if you don't have a lot of time. Despite its length, the author fills the whole book with action and never makes you question its length once starting reading it. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes action filled books and once reading wants to become part of the book. The Icarus Agenda envelops the reader into the story and makes them feel like they are a part of the action."},{"Title":"The Icarus Agenda [Paperback]","review":"I read my first Ludlum book when I was 11. Needless to say, I wasn't ready for it and it didn't make any sense to me. The next book I read by him, however, was when I was 14 and hooked me on him - The Bourne Identity.Since then, I've enjoyed reading Ludlum when I'm able to. I read a lot of different things, and he's got so many books out that it's hard to make any real effort to read them all, but when I can, I get into Ludlum.A long time ago I read The Chancellor Manuscript and was fascinated by it. So it struck me as really weird that The Icarus Agenda somehow reminded me of The Chancellor Manuscript - till I got further through the book and discovered it's connected. Not directly a sequel, mind you, but there are ties.OK, The Icarus Agenda. Certain elements in the USA have a vested interest in keeping the Vice President in his position in an upcoming election - he can be controlled, allowing them to work through him to keep money flowing into Defense contracts and make new laws that work in their favor. Allowing, essentially, rich people to get richer at the cost of American stability and world peace.These elements have a counterpart - a small group of people dedicated to finding a different candidate for Vice President, one who can't be bought or controlled.So there's 2 opposing parties, both manipulating behind-the-scenes elements, one operating for personal gain, one for the good of the country.Stuck in the middle is going to be Evan Kendrick, a Congressman who sought office in his district solely to oust a representative who was for sale.Kendrick used to be a bigshot in the turbulent areas of the middle EDast and southwest Asia. After losing a lot of his people in what was marked up as an accident, he sold his company. While bouncing around without a course, he found the above-mentioned for-sale representative and decided to do something about it, as the guy represented Kendrick's area of Colorado.While he takes off for a while on a rafting trip, a hostage crisis occurs in Oman. Upon finding out what's going on, he volunteers to help - he has influence and contacts in that area that the US government does not. His only condition - that no one know of his involvement. This is a mission of revenge as much as conscience - the \\"accident\\" that killed his people was no accident, and Kendrick is certain the one behind is has also engineered the current hostage crisis. Kendrick wants to expose him. After that, he plans to begin rebuilding his company, and he can't do that if he and by extension everyone he cares about are targets because of his involvement in the crisis.With help, Kendrick succeeds in his mission, and thinks he can now finish his term as a Congressman and begin rebuilding the life he wants.Think again. He's now caught in the struggle between two opposing factions. He's placed in a couple situations that put him in the eye of a lot of people, then comes the coup de grace - his involvement in the Oman crisis is leaked.Suddenly he's a target of a hidden faction within the US government as well as terrorists. The only people he's sure he can trust are an eccentric old friend and a woman who saved his life in Oman. He didn't ask for this, but the only options he's got are to rise to the challenge, or die.This has one of my favorite Ludlum trademarks - take an ordinary man and place him in extraordinary circumstances, and watch the resulting fireworks.The book's a tad long. The Oman hostage segment is virtually a book unto itself and could have been taken off and had a few things added to it to make this tale into 2 separate books. But even with the length, I found myself really drawbn into it.Nothing can top the Bourne books, but I REALLY like this one. It makes me wonder if there are any real-life Kendricks, and made me ponder the rightness of operating outside the law, however good the intentions may be."},{"Title":"The Icarus Agenda [Paperback]","review":"Ludlum's books always start slow and lure you in. Icarus is no exception. I only wish that he made this novel the first of a series (like Bourne). The main characters are more believable. I suppose, however, that he may have overfed us Kendrick, as he did Jason Bourne. This book only lasted me a couple of days."},{"Title":"The Icarus Agenda [Paperback]","review":"I only give this book one star since I can't rate it at no stars. I have read several Ludlums in the past and have enjoyed his writing but after reading this book I'm sure I won't read any more Ludlum. Ludlum books frequently start slow and start moving after a few pages but the writing in this book is unbelivably dull. Although there were some parts where it looked as though the story was going to pick up the pace, he managed to quickly turn the story back to absolute drivel within a page or two. Apparently this book was a platform for him to bore the reader rigid with political ramblings. I suggest any other Ludlum but this one - Apocalypse Watch was my first Ludlum and I enjoyed it, a first rate, tense thriller. Best thing to do with this book is to prop up a table leg with it."},{"Title":"The Icarus Agenda [Paperback]","review":"Having loved the Bourne series I was eagerly looking forward to reading this book, but it was almost painful to read. The story was boring, the language was pretentious and constantly mentions the various wars and skirmishes which, although relevant to the story in the broader sense, left me lost in all the details as I am not a Middle East expert, neither do I want to be. I could not get into the story and imagine the scenes. I was completely aware that I was reading a book, and not a good one at all times.Ludlum is trying too hard to write a good book and it's very contrived."},{"Title":"The Icarus Agenda [Paperback]","review":"The plots are good, the characters are well defined and fleshed out, and the ending is spectacular. There is excitement galore as Evan Kendrick, the protagonist, takes on several Herculean tasks and performs them all very well. Throughout the book there is suspense everywhere, making for good reading.Kendrick is a successful engineer, having worked principally in the oil-rich mideast, making a lot of money before he sold his business, following a terrible \\"accident\\" which left most of his company dead. Coming back to the USA he decides to start a new life and run for Congress to oust a corrupt incumbent, and he is successful. While on a solo whitewater rafting vacation, a hostage crisis developes in the mideast, but he is incommunicado with civilization, and only finds out about it when he gets back. At that point he decides to volunteer to attempt a rescue, but insists on doing it anonymously as he disguises himself as an arab terrorist. With the help of Israeli commandos he pulls it off, but after he returns home his cover is blown and he becomes known as the \\"Hero of Oman\\". His celebrity and heroism is noted by a small elite group of very prominent people who do not wish to be identified in their relationship to each other. It is a secret group that seeks to propel the hero into the limelight and get him elected to the Vice Presidency, and this activity is the height of intrigue and suspense. The elite group makes the decisions that they hope will push Kendrick to the highest ranks of government, and for this they enlist the expert work of an \\"aide\\" who can do anything and everything, and it is amazing what he can accomplish.Because of his successful mission in the mideast, Kendrick finds himself and his friends assailed from several groups, and there is plenty of action in his effort to stay alive, as well as protecting the lives of his friends.His love interest is an Arab-Westerner women, an agent he met while on his hero mission in the mideast who was responsible for saving his life. Back in the USA she is very involved in helping him find and identify those that are trying to kill him. It is she who provides the \\"happily ever after\\" part.The ending is too good to give away, but I can tell you that it involves the President and Kendrick and the elite group.It is a very good story from a writer who knows how to write this kind of thing, and is certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"The Icarus Agenda [Paperback]","review":"I'm a bit surprised at the high ratings by the other reviewers. I've read eight other Ludlum novels, enjoyed them tremendously... then the Icarus Agenda happened. This was an awful yawner. All the minor irritating ticks of his other novels become the focal points in this one simply because of a lack of sustained action. You get the worst of Ludlum, namely his political navety and stereotyped ethnic characters. And let's not forget his tendency to reuse canned personalities - a drinking, smoking Johnny do-gooder who has a drinking, smoking do-gooder girlfriend, with a crotchety sidekick doing the grumpy old man schtick. Our heroes go on endless rants about greed and corruption in the US government, while somewhere in the story our do-gooder friends somehow end up with millions in their laps from the same government and live happily ever after (in this case, our protagonist keeps the 50 million dollars with which the government/lobbyist villians attempted to bribe him).It took me 3 months to get through this one. A word of advice: Ludlum fans don't let future Ludlum fans read Icarus Agenda.Recommend instead: The Bourne Identity, Apocalypse Watch, Gemini Contenders, The Sigma Protocol"},{"Title":"The Icarus Agenda [Paperback]","review":"I am a fan of Ludlum and have liked a number of his books but this one is -1. too predictable not only on story line after the 1st book but also what the characters are going to say next.2. too long.

The \\"Rosary for my child\\" offers a short scripture passage and reflection for each of the 20 mysteries. There are prayers for children in myriad phases and circumstances; for example, potty training, loss of a pet, driving, choosing a college, and a first job interview.

Ricardo also revealed interesting insights on the subject of value in chapter 1.To understand the text fully,it would be advisable to have read Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, another book in the Great Minds Series, which I had also painfully digested.Like other books in the Great Mind's series, have a good cup of coffee ready. It is a very challenging and difficult read. Nevertheless, it is a worthwhile read for those serious in understanding the foundations of the present economic systems."},{"Title":"Principles of political economy and taxation","review":"Some authors you read, and perhaps think, &quot;I wish I'd written that!&quot; Ricardo, like Adam Smith and John Locke, are in another league altogether. The originality of mind is stunning. Smith, Mill, Malthus and J.B. Say are all more readable, which I fear sounds like a very poor recommendation for Ricardo! Still, I was so bowled over by the originality of his theoretical line, that I forgave much slow slogging through a difficult text. His theory of rent is I think quite misguided, but is so powerfully presented that I was hard put to think how I might argue against it were Ricardo to appear before me in person. I took this book about ten pages at a time, and found it well worth the trouble."},{"Title":"Principles of political economy and taxation","review":"Along with Adam Smith, the Englishman David Ricardo is one of the fathers of the so-called Classics school of economic thought, and the Principles is his major opus, one he was very much reluctant to write, but only did so at the urgings of James Mill and his son John. Written in the first half of the 19th victorian century, he was nonetheless, a very freed mind, who did not accept or indulge in the extravagancies of the beginning of the industrialization proccess in England. To David Ricardo, Karl Marx owes a good share of his theory of labour, something essential in the labour movements of then. The concepts adapted and created by David Ricardo is transported to the text in a dry and concise style, not too much worried in polemics, but only interested in address the topics he raises in a very precise way. IF you are a student of Social Sciences, this book is a must."},{"Title":"Principles of political economy and taxation","review":"I got this book, well frankly because I wanted to read John Maynard Keynes' General Theory. I got 2 pages into it and realized that I needed to do a little more background work. Keynes referred to Ricardo a bunch in those first few pages, so I skipped to this book.I am VERY glad that I read Adam Smith's \\"Wealth of Nations\\" before I read this book. Ricardo constantly refers back to it. He also refers to Malthus, Buchannan and Say alot. I did learn a great deal in this book-and he proved very effectively some points that seemed counter-intuitive to me. There are a few things that I still don't agree with, but I recognize this as a the next step down the road to modern economics.The language in this book was more \\"modern english\\" than \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" but still not what I would consider entirely modern. Another thing that made this book a little more readable was the lack of long digressions on various things. Ricardo's examples were short and very illustrative. \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" was laced with Enlightenment philosophy which really made my little libertarian heart flood with joy. There was none of that, here. Very much more like a text book.The reason I knocked off a star was Ricardo's habit of taking great pains to explain in great detail how this or that would happen under this or that circumstance...and then in 1 paragraph at the end explain why this would never actually happen, or explain why he didn't really mean what it sounded like he was saying. Frustrating.Overall, a good and very worthwhile read. Don't expect to be entertained-but expect to learn something."},{"Title":"Principles of political economy and taxation","review":"This work is a masterpiece of economic theory only second tothe Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith. Ricardo states that valueis a function of effort and not the price paid for labor. Hereminded us that labor plus the tools to assist labor affectedthe creation of value. Therefore; increases in value were indirect proportion to increments in labor. Value was also afunction of the time it took to bring the goods to market.Surprisingly, the cultivation of inferior land resulted in ahigher exchangeable value of raw produce because more laborwas required in its production. If we become more efficient inland cultivation, rents will go down because more can becultivated with less land. In addition, the exchangeable valueof commodities is undisturbed by natural or accidental causes.Laborers derive their greatest pleasure when the market priceof labor exceeds the natural price. Therefore; wages willincrease in response to increases in the demand for labor.Rises in rent are accompanied by increments in the share ofproduce because landlords want more rent when harvests aregreater. Accordingly, the price of corn is a function of the labor to produce it. If wages go down, then prices must fall.As the price of labor goes down, profits increase but theprice of the commodity may not go down. Taxes on profitstend to increase the price of a commodity . If money is nottaxed, then all commodities will be subject to price increases.Ultimately, a tax on land begets a tax on produce. In addition,a tax on labor will raise its price. In addition, the price ofprovisions determine the price paid to the worker. If moneydecreases in value, all commodities will be subject to steepprice increases. This was seen in modern times with thefluctuation of the Russian currency. Ultimately, bountylowers the price to foreigners because the government subsidizesthe bounty paid to the local merchants to stimulate trade.The theory of rent transfers value but does not create it.Ultimately, wages are determined by the price of food andcost of production.This theory of wages differs from Adam Smith who said thatwages were a function of the ease or hardship to do work, thedifficulty or expense of learning a trade, the constancyof employment, the trust reposed in the workmen, the probabilityof success or failure of the venture or the fear of misfortune.David Ricardo's work is an important milestone in the theoryof economics and comparison to the work of Adam Smith."},{"Title":"Principles of political economy and taxation","review":"David Ricardo played a crucial role in developing Classical Economics. Ricardo was prompted to write on economics by reading The Wealth of Nations. As luck would have it, Ricardo knew James Mill (father of JS Mill) and was soon in contact with TR Malthus. The debates between Ricardo and Malthus produced a paradigm that lasted only a half a century. PPE+T is a central part of the Classical paradigm, it is Ricardo's definitive statement on economics.PPE+T is perhaps the most tightly reasoned book written by a Classical economists (JS Mill is a close rival here). This is not fun reading but it is important as a piece of history, and elements of Ricardo's analysis remain relevant today. Given Ricardo's razor sharp intellect, one must wonder why he did not develop modern value theory himself. The tight reasoning of this book is, ironically, the source of much criticism against it. Joseph Schumpeter (among others) has lamented \`the Ricardian vice', by which Ricardo arrived at policy conclusions through flawless but restrictive logical reasoning. Ricardo is hard to argue against, given his assumptions, but what if we alter these assumptions?While Classical Economics is dead, some of its Ricardian elements live on. The Principles of Political Economy and Taxation remains relevant today largely because of Ricardo's concept of Comparative Advantage. Comparative Advantage is one of the most enduring ideas in economics. The development of the Comparative Advantage concept set Ricardo ahead of all but a few of his contemporaries. Economists still speak of Ricardian Equivalence and The Ricardo Effect. While some might object Ricardo's logical-deductive approach to political economy, few economists have stood the test of time so well. PPE+T is a timeless classic. This is not fun reading, but it is important none the less."},{"Title":"Principles of political economy and taxation","review":"I don't want to insult Ricardo. He was unequivocally brilliant.

Everyone likes to advertise their sites are designed with the user in mind when very little usability testing is truly done.I had the pleasure of attending a conference where Jared was speaking and listened to him for a day long lecture on usability. It was the first time I had thought about the &quot;usability&quot; of a web site.This book covers much of the &quot;research&quot; UIE has done on usability. The problem with the whole concept of usability is, does it really matter? People tend to adapt to what they are given. If you give them crap and that is all they know, then they will adapt to it and use it.This is how many badly designed pages are successful. This will probably not last (can anyone say boo.com). Eventually people will want good design.Jared's book opens the door, but I don't think it is the answer (nor do I think Jared considers this the answer).

Happy reading!!"},{"Title":"Web Site Usability (Interactive Technologies)","review":"When Jared Spool's Web Site Usability: A Designer's Guide was published, I was so interested that I packed it as carry-on reading for my vacation. I had found very few published accounts of empirical studies of web usability issues, and was anxious to compare notes with a fellow professional's web research methods and findings. The book is a quick read, so by the time the plane landed, I was thoroughly disappointed. Mr. Spool sets high expectations in the early pages with these three humble claims: that his book presents &quot;groundbreaking research on web site usability;&quot; that this research &quot;provides actual data - not opinions - about what makes web sites usable;&quot; and that his results are &quot;really cool scientific findings.&quot; But the book fails on all three counts.Because the authors neglect to describe their research methods up front, the first errors the reader will notice are problems of logic, definition of terms, and overgeneralizations based on limited observations. The first chapter presents a set of &quot;major implications,&quot; each of which is meant to debunk some common-sense idea of web design; for example, Implication 1 is &quot;Graphic Design Neither Helps Nor Hurts.&quot; However, the reader who tries to follow the logic behind the titillating assertions will find it mortally flawed. In this example, a little digging reveals a misunderstanding of the meaning of graphic design, which the authors interpret as the quantity of picture elements in a given web page or site. This misinterpretation leads them to conclude that if a site with few pictures (described as a &quot;nearly 'design-free zone'&quot;) fares better with subjects than do other sites with many pictures, it is because graphic design is unimportant.Some of the conclusions are directly contradicted by reported results. The authors conclude, for example, that &quot;The more white-space there was on a site, the less successful users were at finding information.&quot; Yet Edmund's, which uses white space very effectively for visually separating the various informational categories, was ranked best for ease of finding information.The research methodology is mentioned only very briefly, toward the end of the book. Even then, the little information offered is enough to raise serious questions about what is not revealed. Here is a sampling of the facts I could glean: The researchers did not consider the sites' intended audiences when selecting subjects to evaluate them. The sites examined were aimed at vastly differing audiences ranging from kids (Disney) to durable-goods comparison shoppers (Edmund's) to small business owners (Inc.). Yet a single group of subjects was chosen to represent all the sites' users in the testing.Test tasks did not necessarily resemble likely end-user tasks, and the purposes of the sites were disregarded. Obviously, the effectiveness of a site should be evaluated in the context of the reasons for the site's existence. One site may be designed to facilitate the users' speedy navigation to information the user is seeking out, while another may intentionally divert users to certain pages to attempt to sell impulse items. It is not meaningful to compare these two types of sites on the same criteria.The test data are a sloppy combination of between- and within-subject ratings. The authors explain that &quot;...each [subject] tested as many web sites as possible in [the three-hour time allotment] (no [subject] tested all the sites).&quot; The ratings tables do not include the number of observations used to calculate each &quot;average&quot; rating score. No variables were held constant across sites. Therefore, the reasons asserted for any differences between sites' ratings are strictly conjecture on the part of the researchers. Even more distressing than methodology described are the questions left unanswered. These include some as basic as: How many subjects participated in the testing? What incentives were used to motivate the subjects' participation? What were the demographics of the subjects?The most valuable piece of information in this book is the one uncharacteristically candid remark tucked away in the Foreword: &quot;...no one should accept our reasoning without question.&quot; Subtract the two final words of this statement, and you will have a pithy summary of my review."},{"Title":"Web Site Usability (Interactive Technologies)","review":"This book is a very poor attempt to provide advice on designing web sites. Right up front you should note that although this book has a publication date of 1999, the research was done in 1996. In Internet time that is a lifetime ago. A typical user in 1999-2000 is much more experienced using the internet than a user from 1996.None of the web sites that they used for their study look anything like what they did at the time of the study. In fact, they failed to get pictures of one of the web sites (from the 1996 Olympics) which was no longer available when they got around to writing this book. In most cases, the problems that were found at web sites were corrected long before the results of this research were produced which shows that this book may have been needed in 1996 but is useless today.No information is given to us about the people who participated in the study. Were they novice users or well experienced in using the internet? We will never know. That information, however, can be critical when trying to design a web site. The study also examined one small part of usability of a web site. How easy was it for the participants in the study to find a particular piece of information at a particular web site? But is that really the only reason that we visit a web site? Is that the only aspect of usability? And does any of this mean anything when we don't know who the participants were?In short, this book might have been somewhat useful had it been published in 1996 but it is useless and a complete waste of money in 1999."},{"Title":"Web Site Usability (Interactive Technologies)","review":"One of my challenges in dealing with clients is convincing them that design solutions for one medium rarely apply to another.

It's quite possible to have a wooden frame, but they look *nothing* like the steel frame.&quot;Web Site Usability&quot; is excellent source of material for me when I'm trying to explain and/or justify differences in design approaches based on functional requirements. This book, which makes no pretense of being a comprehensive, academic review of theoretical methods instead presents a broad variety of *real world* attempts to solve web UI problems and then describes both the strong and weak points discovered. It is, if you will, a narrative approach to understanding the issues involved in usability design, and to a lesser extent, user interface design.This narrative approach has proved far more helpful in dealing with the increasing numbers of non-technical folks who're being given the problem of creating interesting, usable, *and* attractive web sites than the typical academic approaches couched in jargon and steeped in rigid methodology.Regardless of your degree of technical knowledge, reading this book will help you in establish a strong foundation for understanding usability in all its contexts."},{"Title":"Web Site Usability (Interactive Technologies)","review":"As a long-time web developer and interface designer, I liked this book a lot. It challenges a lot of the assumptions (dogma?) of the web &quot;design&quot; community by taking the approach that end-users are the ones who have the most to tell us about good and bad design, not creative directors.I had a recent experience with a designer who was invited to observe a focus group of prospective users of a large commercial real estate she had designed. She declined the invitation to attend with the following statement: &quot;I have no need to know what people think of the design. I designed it with a specific purpose in mind, and I believe I achieved my goal. What could I learn?&quot;What arrogance! Well, guess what folks? The users testing the site found it confusing, hard to navigate, difficult to search, and therefore not something they'd be likely to use. I guess if her purpose was to drive people to better sites, she succeeded.I've used techniques similar to the ones described in this book to test sites I've designed. They work! It's not always fun to hear users tell you what you've created is clumsy, confusing or downright stupid, but if you don't listen to your users and design for them, you are doomed!

Many statements like &quot;We do not know what this means,&quot; littered the book with useless, inconclusive babble. The studies were purely linear in nature and provided no valid conclusions or insights into usability. It was almost as if the researchers were afraid to admit to drawing any conclusions from their findings. They also neglected to actually capture the content they were researching, the 1996 Olympic site for example, and could therefore not present pictures of the site when it went offline. Their painful admission of this fact only strengthened their lack of credibility. Read it if you'd like a good laugh."},{"Title":"Web Site Usability (Interactive Technologies)","review":"A useful book, if only because it challenges some shibboleths of design - for example, their conclusion that graphics have no measurable impact, adverse or otherwise, on site usability. They unfortunately offer up such gems ( and there are some very thought-provoking conclusions they reach) with insufficient methodological rigour to convince me that the conclusion is justified from the data.I would dearly have liked to have known some demographic info about their sample of test subject - or even the sample size, which remains a complete mystery.Other reviewers have pointed to the poor layout and design standards and I have to agree. It reads and looks like a corporate-commissioned report puffed up into a book-like object.Notwithstanding all of the above reservations, I still rate this highly for its attempt, however flawed, to bring some numbers to bear on the mythology of web design and also for turning some conventions on their heads - even if we only end up admiring them better from that angle!"},{"Title":"Web Site Usability (Interactive Technologies)","review":"I appreciate the research of Jared Spool et al at User Interface Engineering, and have consulted it often as I review and design user interface elements.

Now my gut feeling about that site's good usability is backed up by a usability-study report.But wait! Edmunds.com has been redesigned since 1997, which is when this usability study took place. So have most, if not all, of the other sites. This book's screen shots of the sites in the study make the book look like a museum of the 1997 World Wide Web.

The content is about how people succeed or fail, when they try to find information , on web pages. It uses real web sites as examples and explains how users rated them. The section on how to regard images and animation is crucial information for beginners to web design. The authors' scientific approach to evidence is honest. If they feel that interpretation is uncertain they say so. Overall, the book contains solid workable solutions for building effective and sensible web pages. I would recommend this book to anybody who is thinking of putting up a web site and is not sure of what approach to take."},{"Title":"Web Site Usability (Interactive Technologies)","review":"This book is a definite MUST HAVE for any website designer, newbie to web design and anyone and everyone who has an online business. Simple, easy to understand visuals compliment the text, which is written in a very simplistic manner. This book is wonderful - magnificent - excellent, and will help you greatly understand the elements of successful web design. I've used it to consistently update my own website, at:http://www.aei.dli.comIf you don't have this book, you're missing out on your single-most-important investment in your professional life!"},{"Title":"Web Site Usability (Interactive Technologies)","review":"I found this book to be quite helpful in preparation for designing a website. Since the website I am designing is strictly informational in nature, I learned many new concepts not only about the basics of a good informational site, but also about the &#147;cruising&#148; habits of web readers.The book is a quick read and I took many notes, but the important thing that I gleaned from this book was how to make my site informational, easy to navigate through and what works and does not work as far as design and color are concerned. As a cruiser myself, I know what bores me, irritates me, frustrates ma and what appeals to me when I am on a mission to find information and when I want to find it fast. The information contained in this little was quite valuable in that regard.This is NOT a book about design and the use of color, etc., but instead a book about making a site usable to the &#147;cruiser&#148; and then giving you, the reader, the information on how to attract users to your site, so that they won&#146;t get irritated or frustrated. Admit it, we all have been to those sites!!I think one might be surprised when reading this book, that color, tons of pictures and graphics are not key elements in an informational website, and our preconceived notions will quickly be laid to rest!Very good book for a &#147;newbie&#148; starting out on the road to web-design as well as seasoned designers."},{"Title":"Web Site Usability (Interactive Technologies)","review":"I found the idea for the book good, but the execution VERY poor. Their methodology was poor at best and they jumped to conclusions with very little to back them up.Here is an example of their questionable methodology: They ranked the web site based on three data points which they choose AFTER they gather a bunch of data and did some analysis.Here is an example of their jumping to conclusions: They concluded the user don't form mental models of web site solely based on the fact that they didn't use the Go menu to return to previously visited sites. I can think of many, many reasons why the users would not use the Go menu and it has nothing to do with the absence of mental models. Besides, you try to form a mental model on up to 9 sites within a maximum of 3 hours while doing a goal-orientated task."},{"Title":"Web Site Usability (Interactive Technologies)","review":"As a Usability professional, this book dealt with Web site Usability in a fashion that I can understand as well as in a fashion that the average person that uses web sites can understand. It opens the door and shows the methodology that is used. This is the kind of exposure all testing should be given, but is rarely offered because of the potential for criticism. Unfortunately, sometimes with this type of testing, as happened here, you gain more questions than answers. But very good questions!One important thing the book brought home for me, was that a webpage is not a document. Over and over again, the testing shows here that people do not use webpages like books or documentation.Also an interesting thing that was brushed on was the separate uses of a webpage: Surfing versus information gathering. These are definitely different tasks and it was particularly useful for this report to be published to provide the preliminary information for us to start with. You really have to consider these as different applications, and test your site accordingly. You also have to ask yourself which of the uses is more important to you, if a tradeoff needs to be made.One concern I had with the testing was the task list. In each site there was specific tasks the user was assigned to do. If I were given these I would dive right into Cnet and Edmunds and stumble in all the rest. Why, because they are interests of mine. I have been to those sites and the information is familiar. However, if I were given the Fidelity task set, not only the site but the task would be unfamiliar to me. I wondered how much that played in the user's preference and usability of those sites. That is a tough thing to balance for, but may be a real factor in a user's experience in a site. Future testing (if it was not here) should probably account for the user's experience in the subject field. This I don't recall being directly addressed in the book.This book was wonderfully written, very conversational in style and lots of graphics. I learned a lot and will be reading more from these authors in the future."},{"Title":"Web Site Usability (Interactive Technologies)","review":"This book is the first coherent documentation of the application of usability testing to the web that I have seen. Although I tend to question the validity of some of the statistical methods employed and the sample that the researchers used, this book is important because it addresses the need to develop a set of tools for making the web a usable place, not just a place to &quot;surf&quot;; it also makes the important point that the rules for usability are vastly different for web documents than any other medium tested so far.I would caution the readers that, rather than blindly apply the findings presented in this book, they should take the principles of usablility testing that are presented and develop their own tools for usability testing.All in all, I believe that this home-brewed book (it looks like it was produced on a Xerox Docutech or similar device) is a worthwhile addition to the web developer's library."},{"Title":"Web Site Usability (Interactive Technologies)","review":"False assumptions, questionable methodologies. Not an academic study? Does that excuse the authors lack of rigour? Just another example of wishy-washy muddle headed thinking masquerading as a &quot;study&quot;. One of the worst books (quite a dubious distinction, given much of the crap that is out there) I've read. Fraudulent."},{"Title":"Web Site Usability (Interactive Technologies)","review":"The authors claim that their research &quot;provides actual data -- not opinions -- about what makes web sites usable&quot;. (Page 1). Unfortunately, their research is so poorly described that their claims are as good as opinions at the very best.To illustrate, we have no idea how many participants were tested in their study (1,2, or 200?) or who they were (college students, web designers, retirees?).In the whole book (all 157 pages of it), we were able to locate only 2 figures (one figure is repeated several times) and 1 table reporting any research findings with data. Various claims about correlations or lack of thereof are not substantiated by any presented data.In our opinion, the book is not worth 2 cents. Your money is better spent on Jacob Nielsen's &quot;Designing Web Usability&quot;."},{"Title":"Web Site Usability (Interactive Technologies)","review":"There are a few good things in this report, but many more bad and misleading ones. It is not a very good &quot;Designer's Guide.&quot;The main problem is that they haven't done any comparative studies. They can't say that whitespace isn't important or that graphics don't matter, without doing some controlled studies. They should have created the same sites with and without graphics and compared them. (This would include making sure that some of the alternatives really depended on graphics. That might be clothes shopping or map reading.)It's hard to believe that hundreds of years of graphic design suddenly goes down the toilet just because we have a new medium.You also can't say anything about graphics or graphic design when you don't have the terms straight (p82: The Edmunds site is not &quot;design-free&quot;. Everything has a design, even if it's limited. It is &quot;graphics-free&quot;, however. There is a BIG difference.)There are some important observations, like the idea that users skim rather than read on the Web. Unfortunately, the rest represents poor science and will lead people down the wrong path."},{"Title":"Web Site Usability (Interactive Technologies)","review":"Although this book will not appeal to anyone studying graphic design, it sure appealed to me. Basically it supported the fact that people don't care about your spinning, flashing, logo in the upper right hand corner. They care about content and usability. I'm a beginning a web page for my office. It will be for information extraction only. This study changes the way I think about user habits and preferences. If you are interested in creating an informative web site you should read this book. Don't listen to the folks who bash this book, they probably have degrees in Graphic Design....."},{"Title":"Web Site Usability (Interactive Technologies)","review":"I am a beginner and this book definitely helped me learn many important things. I particularly appreciated the practical aspects, the good and bad examples and the way the authors always invited to more research into one topic/issue/field rather than going ahead and assuming they know everything thanks to the research they did."},{"Title":"Web Site Usability (Interactive Technologies)","review":"If your thinking style if that of a pragmatist and you are more concerned with what works at your website, versus being either idealistic, analytic or artistic about it, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Web Site Usability (Interactive Technologies)","review":"The authors work for User Interface Engineering and this book documents the results of Web usability tests conducted in 1997 but the results are equally valid today. Rather than measuring the &quot;coolness&quot; of a site, this report rates the effectiveness of Web features in helping visitors find information on a site. This is particularly important in business-to-business sites where visitors are searching, not surfing. This book is very readable and gives quantitative data that should be of great interest to anyone building a Web site. A fast read, you should burn through the 150 pages in less than two well-spent hours."},{"Title":"Web Site Usability (Interactive Technologies)","review":"Save yourself hundreds of dollars by buying this book. No, that is not an offer, but if you were to pay a consultant for this good advice, it would easily cost hundreds of dollars (I know, I am a consultant). The advice is good and concise. Much of it is counter to conventional wisdom, but is in line with more experienced Web designers."},{"Title":"Web Site Usability (Interactive Technologies)","review":"There are several primary sources to study Web usability. Jared Spool of User Interface Engineering is one of them. Among technical communicators, &quot;Web Site Usability : A Designer's Guide&quot; is mentioned often in the same sentence with Jakob Neilsen and his work. From the standpoint of communicating information, everything Jared and his team has put together has been validated over and over in my experience designing sites with very technical content. Spool (et al) takes into account all the idiosyncrasies human beings bring to their Web searches, whether for information or entertainment, and makes consistently valuable comments about users and how they behave when using the Web. This book is a jumping-off point for Web developers and not intended to be a sole reference. However, Spool remains one of the most important people in Web usability and development today."},{"Title":"Web Site Usability (Interactive Technologies)","review":"I'll make this short. Here's a quote from this book:\\"Of course, graphics may be important in other ways, such as for conveying marketing messages, making users more willing to return to the site, or selling products. We didn't measure these, so we don't know. But as far as we can tell, graphic design is completely unrelated to success in finding information on web sites.\\"This is the problem with simple-minded HCI-centric nerds without a sense of design. They often come to conclusions based on poorly designed tests. For example, these same fools might have nixed the iPhone's pinch-to-zoom feature because it's truly not discoverable (discoverability being a major metric in usability tests). However, obviously the issue is much more complex than that. One must weigh the costs of messaging (instructing) the feature against its benefits. I could go on for hours..."},{"Title":"Web Site Usability (Interactive Technologies)","review":"Some web sites are for fun, to imprint branding, or to show off artistic talents. This book would not be particularly helpful in designing those sites.This book helps design sites which provide information. All factors were considered in the context of getting the site visitor to the information they need. A massive usability study was undertaken on about 10 big-name sites. Records were kept of how difficult it was for motivated users to answer specific questions for which the answers were contained in the sites' content.Many different design factors were the tested for significant correlations and the results reported.As other reviewers have reported, tables of correlation coefficients are not presented, and some of the specifics of the study are not outlined in detail, and yet given the experience of the authors and the nature of the study they conducted, I am disposed to use the results.The book also provides enough information to guide the reader in conducting their own studies, which is even more valuable a tool than any book.The study itself may have been conducted in 1996, but in the new millenium we are still interested in providing a design which gets people to the information they need as efficiently as possible.

With this technique, the authors arrive at interesting points, which (surprising- and sadly) they fail to dig into. So the reader gets confronted over and over with sentences like: &quot;This was an interesting idea, but as we didn't contact the designers, we can only guess&quot; WHAT? WHY didn't they contact the designers of the site? After all, in Cyberspace, they're only a click away!Or: &quot;We think this helped the users, but we didn't explore further&quot; WHY not?So, to wrap it up: nice comments, some of them quite interesting, often the right questions in hand, but the authors didn't dig deeper. And at that price I expect them to.Oh, and the comment of another reader (&quot;it looks like it was produced on a Xerox Docutech or similar device&quot;) is sadly correct.Hopefully the authors will take the ideas and techniques they developed for this book an explore further in subsequentials works.
