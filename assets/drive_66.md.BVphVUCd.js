Loaded with simple many simple spells that are easy to do, do not require many materials and do not call any deities specifically. The Spells conver a wide range of areas that include love, money, home, spells for children ( that even adults can do), spells for health, luck spells, spells for lean times, creativity and business, home selling, travel etc. In a second part of my review which will not go on Amazon or Goodreads I will jot down the spells that I found worth keeping in my book of shadows. Part 2 will be posted on my blog Granovitch.blogspot.comThe first part of the book covers Wiccan basics. Chapter 1 discussed the concept of witches and the concept of magic. Witches are practitioners of magic and have been around for ages. Just because one is a witch does not mean they practice Wicca. Magic is basically energy directed towards a goal that is empowered by belief, intent and emotional content. Some witches like to do the heavy rituals and others like to do very simple spells . Both are Ok. Wiccans since they have to work with nature normally have a special relationship with nature and are intent on working to help the environment.Chapter two covers internal dynamics. Our beliefs effect our magic and if we believe we are competent, deserving and magic is real then our magic will be effective. Spells ar done to acquire things that we want and the main tools are intent and desire. The natural world assists us our desires. Waxing to full moon are used for manifesting something. Waning to dark for banishing. Dark moons are for divination and planting seed. There are various times of day that are beneficial to magic. Certain days of the week are good for certain types of magic. Night time is the usual best time for magical work.Chapter three talks about circle casting and creating sacred spaces. In this chapter the reader learns how to cast circles and call quarters. After the ritual you can release the space. The book also teaches about how to find power spots and how to build altars.Chapter four discusses tool. Now witches do not have to use tools but they can be helpful. The use of the athame, wand, cauldron, candle, chalice and costumes are discussed. Chapter five talks about different types of magic especially sympathetic magic by using like to effect like. There are instruction how make knots and other magic. Verbal spells, Written spells, amulets and talismans are discussed.For the beginning and intermediate witch this is a great book. For the advanced witch well you are probably making your own spells by now."},{"Title":"The Only Wiccan Spell Book You'll Ever Need: For Love, Happiness, and Prosperity","review":"This book is filled with all kinds of great information to get you going on your qwest for knowledge of the art of magic.."},{"Title":"The Only Wiccan Spell Book You'll Ever Need: For Love, Happiness, and Prosperity","review":"Being new ti the wiccan community, i found this book to be very educational and detailed.

This is greatly to her credit. LIFE ON THE LINE does all readers the service of allowing them to make up their own minds. The author's point of view develops in the text at the same pace as her time passed on the line.Crisp and insightful, this book can stand with the best of writing on the subject. The twofold treat is that those with no &quot;shopfloor&quot; experience may come to value more highly those who toil, and those who work on the line may be able to understand that they can be recognized and appreciated by ones not standing next to them in the heat and din.Brava! From the author's brother."},{"Title":"Life on the Line: One Woman's Tale of Work, Sweat, and Survival","review":"How many Ivy-League educated journalists would be willing to break their backs and go work on the assembly line to relay this story authentically? Very few! This writer does, and so gets to know the tasks, the workers and the business of making vehicles from the most telling perspective of all. Thoroughly familiar with the corporate point of view from years of business writing, De Santis joins those people whose sweat and toil actually build our world. She gives us the private musings and dreams of hardworking folks who didn't get all the breaks in life that she did, and shows their courage and determination to survive the brutal decisions of an unfeeling corporation. It's sad that management just can't understand the rage of these people whose jobs have been given a death sentence for the sake of higher profits, yet who are expected to give 100% down to the last day. But their voices need to be heard."},{"Title":"Life on the Line: One Woman's Tale of Work, Sweat, and Survival","review":"June 12, 1999 Title: Life on the Line Author: Solange De SantisAfter graduating from the highly touted Ivy schools with her master's degree in journalism and a BA in English, Solange De Santis toiled in a very successful white collared workplace. Her fascination though, with \\"the other side\\", \\"the blue collar workers\\" would somehow overpower all sanity and she would seek out employment in the bowls of the workforce. Her dreams of writing a book and her journalistic past are her rational for exploring her curiosities. Hiding her outstanding employment credentials, she lands an assembler job with General Motor's lisping Scarborough Van plant. Solange, nicknamed Sally by her line mates, would now have 18 months in which to \\"spy\\" and compile enough material on life within the plant, before being laid-off, along with its 2,700 strong population. This fascinating account of Sally's perseverance, and demanding requirements associated with manual labor, are truly astonishing. Pushing herself beyond physical limits she thought ever existed, she finds herself becoming attached to her co-workers, \\"a cog in the wheel\\". A strong bond develops with her work mates through common hardships somewhat like a \\"boot camp\\". Her vivid descriptions of the sites and sounds within the plant and the people she works with have clear images and sounds popping into my head. Her circle of friends, \\"from all woks of life\\", are so typical of the many groups within the plant. Reading through her book I find Sally dredging up raw nerve endings I thought were buried long ago, for I am one of the 2,700 employee's of the Scarborough Van Plant that devoted the better part of my working life, along with so many others, to that job, as one of Sally's co-workers, on a different shift, with a different circle of friends, only to find myself one day, writing my resume. This book should appeal to anyone looking for a realistic account of life within those \\"dark window factories\\", and the typical \\"labels\\" these people are saddled with. Bravo Sally, an outstanding read in contrast to your Wall Street journalism."},{"Title":"Life on the Line: One Woman's Tale of Work, Sweat, and Survival","review":"Ms.De Santis begins with the valid premise that the gulf between white-collar and blue-collar workers in widening, and that it's important for one group to understand the other. From there, she walks her readers through that life with an authenticity that only her real-life experience could provide. Interesting reading for anyone who cares about the present and future of manufacturing in North America."},{"Title":"Life on the Line: One Woman's Tale of Work, Sweat, and Survival","review":"De Santis brings to light a working world too often dismissed as &quot;low class&quot; or alien, but full of real people.

I would have liked to hear more about her personal life among the blue collar folks though, and to get to know her coworkers better. But a very great idea well-written.

However, it turned out to be interesting. For those of you who wonder what it's like working in a car assembly plant, this is for you. It's even better that it's from a woman's point of view. Really hits home now that the Big 3 are going through such bad times."},{"Title":"Life on the Line: One Woman's Tale of Work, Sweat, and Survival","review":"Solange de Santis' account of life on a car assembly line is a well-written, informative, page turner, albeit without the edge or the humor of Ben Hamper's \\"Rivethead.\\" Her drive to understand the lives of people who did not have the privilege of growing up in the middle class is commendable. There is, however, one consequence of her actions that she never seems to contemplate: by choosing to take a job on the line, she in effect took it from another person who did not have the same options and for whom it would have been the best economic opportunity.

He's almost two now and I'm always complimented on his behavior, and this is one of the books (and authors) who stands out in my mind. The book is readable and his case studies are helpful, if not hilarious sometimes (see: the dog who became agressive towards husband after baby was born). I didn't have a lot of confidence in my training at first, but I realize that he's not a person nor should I expect him to be. This book reinforced that. A good read."},{"Title":"Think Dog!: An Owner's Guide to Canine Psychology","review":"I found this to be a fascinating book on dog behavior and understanding of their psyche.

I have a pointer mix(40lbs), a boxer(75lbs), two Dogo Argentinos(both 120lbs) and a Great Dane Puppy(110lbs still growing) If it werent for this book Stella(great dane) would probably have been put to sleep for being very aggersive. I met her when she was a young pup and her human family(my mother in law) had come to me for trainning. I saw how dominate she was at only 8 weeks old and told the family the do's and dont's. Unfortantly they didn't listen. I told to never allow her on their beds or furinature of any kind. They soon after stopped coming to training. About 4 months later I had recieved a call from them saying she was attacking them when they tried to get on the bed. They said she was showing teeth and snapping at them. I went over got her off of the bed. She was in dominace mode as I like to call it. I told them the things they need to do to change her behavior. But of corse they didnt do them. And when she was 1yr old they decided to find her a new home. Her new home only lasted a couple of days as she attacked the new owners sister. They called the dane rescue to see about giving her up but they said she would be put to sleep. I decided to take and see if I could get her back on track.

This book, however, was disappointing. He begins with the assumption that most dogs owners not only don't know how to train a dog, but actually seriously mistreat their dogs. He presents techniques in two veins. Some involve scaring the dog into doing the right thing by throwing things at him/her or by making a loud noise. Others are reasonable, positive, reward-based strategies, but he presents them as if it were some great, original idea that no one had ever thought of before.

She tries her best to fight back but fails to save Anya's sanity. The Shevvington's have the power to turn her own parents against her and seem innocent the entire time. Christina is the only one who knows and believes that they're evil . This is the first book in the series of three (the other two are The Fire and The Snow).I personally thought that this was a very suspensful and page turning book. Nowadays it's hard to find books as good as that with out the nonsense. This was honestly one of the best books I have ever read. I know that I'm defenitly going to read the other two, probably multiple times. So, if you want a good read then read The Fog by Caroline B. Cooney."},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"If you haven't read this book, I urge you to do so!!! This is the first book of an awesome trilogy that you must read! This is the first Caroline B. Cooney book I read and it got me hooked! Christina is an extremely brave and determined 13 year-old that refuses to give up, even after being wrongly accused of unimaginable things. No one believes her, not even her friends. She's on her own in an intense battle against the Shevington's (teachers at Christina's school and the people taking Christina and her friends in for the school year). The Shevington's are minipulative, so minipulative that even Christina's parents believe their wild accusations!!! The Fog, The Snow, and The Fire is a GREAT trilogy! This book is definately worth your time!!!"},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"I guess I'm the only person that really liked this book. This book is not your typical &quot;R.L. Stine&quot; fair. It's not that *easy* to understand (on a low scale sense). This book is more like a psychological and intelligent thriller--pretty rare consider what type of Young Adult novels that were published when this book was came out. I recommend the whole trilogy (that is, if you can find it). Even though I read this book many years ago, I still remember Christina and her dept and strenght.And, no, the Fog was *not* actually talking to Christina."},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"Christina is thrilled. She's spent her entire life on Burning Fog Island, off the coast of Maine. With an extremely small population, the island only has an elementary school.

She is going to live with the Shevvingtons, the principle and his wife. Anya, Michael and Benjamin are also returning, in older grades. Once they get there, Christina senses something is wrong. Anya, the island's prodigy, is acting weird. She is having nightmares, waking up screaming that the ocean wants her...she's having eerie visions, and sleepwalking. Christina is terrified. She knows something evil is happening, and she thinks its the Shevvingtons. There's something sinister happening....but no one believes her! Whats happening to Christina?"},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"When I requested this book from NetGalley in exchange for an unbiased review, I was not aware that this was a re-release from 1995, nor that it was previously published as a Point Horror book. I have enjoyed many Young Adult novels but would not knowingly choose to read Point Horror. Having said that, I decided to give this a go and I have to admit, there were parts of the book that I did really enjoy. On the other hand, some aspects didn't ring true and unfortunately detracted from my enjoyment.Christina lives on a sparsely populated island, known as Burning Fog Isle, off the coast of Maine. Children are schooled on the island until the age of 13, at which time they move to the mainland school. Christina moves to the mainland to join the three older island children who had moved on in previous years. They are all to board with the principal and his wife at the Schooner Inne, perched high on the crags by the sea.However, their hosts appear to have a spooky agenda and we fear for the safety of their charges.I loved the descriptions of the sea, it was like another character in the book, surging and churning in the backround throughout. Christina was feisty and outspoken and did a great job of holding the narrative together.On the downside, I couldn't quite grasp the motivation of the pricipal and his wife, perhaps I have to read the other two books of the series for the answer to this. Christina's friend Anya's drift into blankness also puzzled me from a psychological point of view.I enjoyed the added photos of the author as a child, teenager and adult that are in the back of the reissued version of this book. The new cover art is also much more apealing than the dated 1995 cover.Personally, I feel that if this book is being re-released to today's young readers then it should have modern ammenities added, such as mobile phones etc. To add to the cut off feeling they could be missing their chargers or have been dropped in the sea, but the book needs a nod to the modern era. Not a book for older teens but good for slightly younger readers and it's breath of fresh air that there's not a vampire to be seen."},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"Christina is excited because this year she is 13 and she gets to leave the island she grew up on and attend junior high on the mainland in Maine. Despite her excitement, she is torn by worry about whether she'll be bullied by the mainland kids, who think islanders are stupid and poor. But those worries soon take second place when she realizes that the owners of the bed and breakfast that she and her islander friends lodge at are using psychological torment to suck the souls out of girls. She's terrified as she watches the beautiful and brilliant senior Anya fade away. And soon the psychopaths are after her own mind.When I was pre-junior high I used to gobble up these Point Horror books like a turkey dinner. (haha. ok, I know that wasn't funny. Just work with it.) There are very few of those books that I actually remember liking though. This is one that has really stuck with me through the years. When I found it in the library recently I thought: \\"I wonder...\\" And I'm glad I did, because I found this book terrifying. When I was a teenager, I think I found the spooky psychological aspects of going insane scary. Now, the book is even more terrifying, but for a different reason. Those psychopath adults who have FULL control over those poor children were horrible! They were charming, and fantastic liars, and those kids' parents weren't around to see what was going on. They just believed whatever the adults told them rather than believing their own children. And the things those psychopaths said to the kids! Ohhhhh shudder. Yes, the book lacked subtlety. But the fact that it terrified me even now gets it four stars in my blog! My only complaint (besides the lack of subtlety - which is really due to it's target audience) is that it ended in a cliffhanger. This is a trilogy of short books. It really should be one longer book. Even combined, I think the book would still be reasonably short. But it WAS Point Horror, after all. They had to be short."},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"Christina lives on an island in Maine. She and her sister, Anya, are going to be shipped to the mainland for their schooling. Before their trip they run across a horrifying woman who forces an eerie poster of the sea on them. When they arrive, Christina is horrified to see that she'll be living with the principal, whose wife is creepy and domineering.At school Christina is made fun of because of her lack of wealth, clothes, and island lingo. She suffers in the hands of the principal, counselor, and teachers. They accuse her of being difficult when she's merely requesting normal things and standing up for herself. The biggest problem is Anya, who seems to be losing her sense of self as well as her mind. Anya talks of the sea and how it's out to get them. Christina has to find a way to save her sister and herself from the madness of the water and their new household.When I read this novel, I could smell and feel the sea next to me. I normally enjoy the water, but this novel made me fear it while I read. It's atmospheric and haunting. Christina is thirteen and the style was simplistic, so this can be considered middle grade or early young adult. I received the galley from NetGalley, courtesy of the publisher."},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"Once a child reaches 7th grade, they are sent from the island to the mainland for schooling. Christina just turned 13 and is looking forward to life on the mainland. However, things aren't quite what they seem. The Principle and his wife seem to exert eerie control over both students and parents. One of the other island girls seems to be deteriorating mentally right before Christina's eyes. Plus, Christina is ostracized at school, finding it hard to make friends.Overall, I enjoyed this story, right up until the ending. The author left the book hanging, without any conclusion. Looking back, it is just a set-up for a sequel or a series. I have read other Cooney books, and have noticed that her storyline and writing are great in the first book and deteriorate as the sequels stretch out. Christina was also an awkward character. She was overly defiant, when she should have been meek or timid. I think she was overly dramatized, when a more realistic character would have worked better. I probably won't pick up the next one."},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"Christine is excited to be leaving her island home to attend school on the mainland. Her companions, including her friend, Anya, are older and don't share her enthusiasm. They tell her that the mainland kids hate islanders and will make her life a misery. But Christina will let nothing dampen her spirits - that is, until she meets the Shevingtons, the couple with whom they will be staying. He is the principal at the school and she's an English teacher and, to everyone else, they seem perfect. However, Christine immediately feels that something is not right with them. Unfortunately, if anyone else shares her suspicions, they aren't saying.Soon Christine finds herself in a battle of wills with the couple while Anya appears to be losing both her sanity and her sense of self. As the fog rolls in and the waves threaten to knock down the inn where they are staying, Christine must find a way to fight this evil while saving Anya from suicide or worse, disappearing into herself.Fog is, simply put, a classic tale of good versus evil and the only word to describe it is CREEPY. Originally written in 1989 as the first of a trilogy aimed at a YA audience and re-released this year by Open Road Media, Fog has most of the ingredients of the best slasher films like Scream and Halloween but without the sex and gore. Although, there are a few things which date the novel (eg VCRs), still it is guaranteed to send more than a few chills up your spine."},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"I enjoyed this series of books and I look foward to reading more titles from this author. I always enjoy books that jump right into a story and that are actually proof read prior to being published!"},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"Good vs. EvilThat is the idea behind this incredible story. Christina is a 13 year old girl from an off coast Maine island (Burning Fog Island) who, along with some other children, must move to the mainland for school. They must all board at the lovely Schooner Inne. Seems great, but things are not as they appear. To begin with, The Shevingston's are just a little off. Strange. Things go from bad to worse for Christina, and soon she is accused of being an unreliable, unpredictable problem child. (not true). I loved Christina's spunk, and her unwillingness to follow the pack. She questions everything and rarely falls prey to the mind games thrusted upon her by the Shevington's Anya, Christina's roommate and fellow islander, is losing herself. She is slowly becoming a shadow of the person she once was. The boys appear to be unaffected by the evil that surrounds them.The book is eerie, spooky and fun all at the same time. The ending is unfullfilling but leaves the way open for book two...I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves strange and unusual stories."},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"Losing Christina is about a girl from a small island in Maine who moves to the mainland with three other students, Anya; brothers Michael and Benji Jaye. They live with a strange couple, Mr and Mrs. Shevvington in Schooner Inne. Once there, Christina realizes that island kids like herself are bullied, teased, embarrassed, ridiculed at school and even at home.Christina's life at her new school and new home is not ideal. Mr. and Mrs. Shevvington who both work at the school are odd and never really explained. That's my disappointment so far with the novel. I don't know what to make of them. Mr. Shevvington is the school principal and Mrs. Shevvington is an English teacher and unlikable parent at the inn. They treat their guests like second class citizens.The book is fine but the end is a bit foggy for me. I don't understand what happened to cause such unusual events with Anya and Christina's suspicions of her guardians. All I know is that the ending leaves me asking more questions and I'm not ready to read the sequel."},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"I LOVED this trilogy when I read it as a teenager; I cannot understand why it is out of print now. I own a used copy of the three-in-one volume and it still does hold up when reading it as an adult. Christina is an excellent role model for young women reading this book. She is not conventionally beautiful but is unique, magickal, determined, sure of herself, and stronger than most other men and women in this book. In the end the story is about her saving her self and other young women through her own determination. There is some romance in these books but that is not the point; the point is Christina's growing strength and self-actualization. I think a LOT of contemporary YA literature for young women (such as, I'm sorry to say, the \\"Twilight\\" series) could take inspiration from this trilogy! I have recently given my 13-year old stepsister this book as a present; I just hope she likes it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"Caroline B. Cooney, Fog (Scholastic, 1989)Fog, the first of the Losing Christina trilogy of novels, is somehow my first exposure to mega-bestselling kidlit author Caroline B. Cooney. Probably not the best place I could have started, as the novel gets off slow, slow, slow. Since it' the first in a trilogy, though, I cut it some slack. This turned out to be a good move.The story centers on Christina, a girl from Burning Fog Island, off the coast of Maine. The one-room schoolhouse on the island only goes up to sixth grade, so Christina is headed for school on the mainland at the end of the summer. All seems well and good-- Christina has been dreaming about getting off the island-- but when they get over there and move in with the principal and his wife, an English teacher, Christina finds that all is not nearly as well as she had imagined it would be. In fact, if she turns her head and squints just right, it seems quite like the couple are trying to drive Christina's friend Anya insane. And if Anya succumbs, might Christina be next?A great deal of setup at the beginning for such a slim novel, but once it gets going, it gets going good. The characterization is a bit shallow, but I'm always willing to give a little leeway to series novels where this is concerned, as the author has a lot more room to build complex characters than we see in one book. Not a bad start; I'll certainly be reading the rest of the trilogy. ***"},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"Christina has lived her entire life on a tiny island off the coast of Maine. She loves it there and is happy with her life. This year she is especially happy, as it is the first year she will be able to attend the junior high and senior high school on the mainland. She will travel there in September with eighteen-year-old Anya, sixteen-year-old Benj, and fourteen-year-old Michael, the only other island children old enough to need to go to the mainland school. All four will board at an inn that has recently been bought by the new principal of the school and his wife, the seventh-grade English teacher.Things are bad right from the beginning. The principal and his wife seem needlessly cruel to the children, especially Christina who can't seem to do anything right and who argues with rules she thinks are unfair. Little by little she notices, though, that there is something truly sinister about the couple they are living with. They seem to take pleasure in humiliating children and breaking their spirits. Christina suspects that they are behind Anya's mental collapse, and she feels she may be next unless she can convince someone of how dangerous these people are.I liked the strength of Christina's character. She said what was on her mind, stuck up for herself and for others, and was never afraid enough to give in. I didn't like that Christina's parents didn't believe anything that she said. It seemed as though they should have at least listened to her and thought about her point of view."},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"In the world, the greatest evil is the one in people you think you can trust.

The poster in their room is very mysterious, and it is like a story all it's own. The Shevvingtons are very different people, so it makes the book interesting. There aren't many other characters in other books that are like the Shevvingtons. Their house is also a very interesting part of the story.

So for you people who think this book is boring make sure that you keep reading and finish the whole thing. If you would just finish it you would luv it. I KNOW YOU WILL! I think that it is a good buy too. I read the next two in the series and they are all really (...) extrememly good.

I can't wait to read Losing Christina #2!"},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"I almost had a hard time believing this could be possible. It's actually a good sense of horror as it shows the influence whether good, or bad adults have on children. Parents the fact that you're doing everything possible to have the best for you children doesn't necessarily mean that they will have the best. We as parents can only remember to look within ourselves, and make sure we're doing everything to let our children know we love them, and want to do right by them. This shows parents looking outside of themselves by sending Christina to school on the mainland of Maine, and entrusting the Shevvfords to care for her while she goes to school there on the mainland, but as soon as she gets there weird things begin to happen. Christina is with 3 other children, and they are 17 year old Avra, 16 year old Benj, 14 year old Michael, and Christina's 13. Avra's almost convinced the the sea wants to take one of them, and Christina's convinced that Shevvford's are up to no good, but due to New England stoicism, and the fact that the Shevvfords are that good at convincing the world that they have nothing but the best intentions for the children Christina has a hard time finding an audience, and for the most part not being able to fit in. It's not that they don't believe her it's just that they're so busy with thier own lives that they don't want the stress of finding out the truth, or if that was true about the dead bodies, and disappearance of 2 other students, and not to mention getting people to believe what's being said. I know that children getting to get parents to slow down, and realize that everything is not all black and white, but more complex, and children need to be believed when they speak the unbelievable, and etc. etc. I just look back on this, and can certainly feel the parents were in the wrong by not listening to their children. This is something that all parents can take n note of."},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"Fog is one of my favorite series!! After reading this book you will see that Caronline b.

Do not waste your time or money on this book."},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"Losing Christina: Fog is the reissue of Caroline B. Cooney's original book The Fog. Why they decided to retitle the three books I have no idea, but the pages are set up just like they were in the original versions, so really the covers just look a little more slick. The Losing Christina trilogy details a year in the life of thirteen-year-old Christina Romney from Burning Fog Isle, who moves onto the mainland of a small town in Maine so that she can continue secondary school. She and three other students board with the Shevvingtons, the school principal and his wife, who delight in destroying the souls of young women. Christina has no choice but to fight the Shevvingtons, which isn't easy when she has no friends and her parents believe the Shevvingtons, not her.Fog, as well as its counterparts Snow and Fire, is a chilling story because it presents a child's worst nightmare: for adults to ignore you when you're telling the truth. The Shevvingtons' evil power lies in the fact that they are the adults in charge whom everyone believes, rather than Christina. Their actions will make your blood boil because it is so easy to see how wrong, and how sick, they are, but it is also easy to understand how the townspeople would believe the polished faces they present.Caroline B. Cooney's gothic horror trilogy is not just about evil, though. Christina experiences all kinds of emotions that most people can relate to: the fear when she has to move away from her family and friends, being nervous about making friends, wanting a boyfriend, facing unfair teachers and assignments. She is a normal, well-drawn thirteen-year-old who unfortunately has to face something that most thirteen-year-olds do not.The age range in this book would probably appeal most to people between the ages of 10-15, but the fight between good vs. an unconventional evil is something that everyone should learn from."},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"This book I picked up from Netgalley because I remembered reading it when I was in high school. I was curious if it underwent any major changes to modernize it or if this beginning book of the trilogy was identical to the one I enjoyed so many years ago. I'd like to say that yes, this is the same exact book. And it brought me the same amount of thrills reading it now as it did in high school. I'm happy to say that the characters are as relevant and believable now as they were when the book was first released.This is a horror book perfect for MG readers and the lower end of YA, as it has a 14 year old protagonist. The main character, Christina, is also bullied throughout most of the novel, and because she never gives up, even when everyone is against her, I think she is a good role model and someone that kids can look up to. Now, I did get annoyed by Christina because of how self-centered she was, particularly in the beginning of the novel, and she treats Jonah like crap.I think that MG readers would be able to better believe the position of absolute power that Mr. and Mrs. Shevvington hold over the students. As an adult, it's hard to suspend belief of the situation and believe that the entire town is bewitched by this couple. And, the dreaded instant love does pop up late in the novel. But besides that, this was a very enjoyable read. Even as a re-read for me (10 years later), I never grew tired of the story and I still was surprised by the many twists of the book.From what I remember, Fog was my least favorite book out of the trilogy. I can't wait until they re-release Snow and Fire, so I can have this trilogy again in my collection.(I received a copy of this book from the publisher/Netgalley in exchange for my honest review.)"},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"Caroline B. Cooney has a certain eerieness to Fog. The book grabs you in the first chapters and relates you to the main character, Christina. While following the life of an island girl named Christina on her first year attending school on the mainland of Maine, the author reveals an evil in her boarding house. This evil does not come from an usual source but, rather, the warm caring arms of her boarders and also her administraters at school. Christina is in a frantic struggle to overcome all odds and break the hold they have on her friend, Anya, as well as on her community. This novel, written for young adults, has a sense of suspence that keeps the young reader interested. It has fancinated me and I can't wait to read its sequal Snow."},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"Carolyn Cooney's FOG combines the richness of a Maine island with the psychological violence of a shore school guidance gone very bad to achieve a page turner of subtle but mounting horror - the terrible aspect of this fine novel is that too often schools turn kids from spontaneous creativity to empty shells, as happens here."},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"The book Fog, by Caroline B. Cooney, is about a group of kids, Christina, Anya, Ben, and Michael,that are taken up by a mainland principal to go to school. They are from an island on the coast called Burning Fog Island. The mainland kids don't like islanders very much. Everything seems to be going well until Anya starts to lose her mind. Christina knows that the principal and his wife are behind it. They try to force Christina towards the same fate but they fail. Christina also saves Anya from her mental and physical death. She convinces Anya, at the last second, to turn away from the principal and come towards her friends. This book was great because of its very suspenseful pages, perfect story, and very realistic characters.This book was extremely suspenseful and seems to beg you to turn the page. Every word seems more grabbing than the last. For example, when Anya is about to jump off a bridge to \\"sacrifice\\" herself to the sea, which is also an example of how she almost physically died and how she is going insane, you couldn't wait to see what happened next. Another example, is when you actually discover that Anya is going insane. You are so interested that you want to read what her fate is.This book, also, seems to have a perfect storyline. Everything molds together when you discover that the principal is behind all of this. It also leaves you wondering how they did it. This encourages you to read the next book. The storyline, also, is very interesting. Especially at intense parts, such as the bridge scene.Lastly, I liked this book because of its very real characters. It almost seems like the characters are popping out at you because they do realistic things. Another thing, is that the setting blends with the characters' personalities. For example, the main characters are from an island, so they are very tough and stubborn. Some kids from the mainland seem to get everything they want so they are mean to those who don't. Even the kids that are teased are always depressed and don't talk to others.My final reason for liking this book is because of its position in good versus evil. It shows this when Christina ruins the principal's plans and \\"defeats\\" them. It also shows this when Christina \\"handles\\" the bullies at her school. I would recommend this book to anyone. I liked this book because of its position in good versus evil, realistic characters, suspenseful pages, and almost perfect story.C.

Christina is a very likeable main character; not overly whiny and girly, or too &quot;nice&quot;. You can really identify with her, and you can imagine how she feels in most of these situations (her first day at the mainland school, having nobody believe her, etc) and I was impressed by how strong she remained. The Shevvingtons are very evil; and both in different ways (Mrs Shevvington is visibly evil and her true personality is more or less out in the open, and Mr Shevvington acts very kind and everyone loves him, when really he's just as evil as his wife.)People who liked Face on the Milk Carton shouldn't just pick up this book because it's by the same author; the story is very different (I read the first FotMC book and was very bored; this girl was kidnapped, GASP, we've established that, get on with the plot!) and while FotMC is more of a mystery, this series is more of a horror/suspense series, with some supernatural elements in it (the &quot;evil&quot; of the Shevvingtons, etc). I don't think you should judge the Losing Christina series after only getting through half the book (like that one reviewer did), because it is kind of slow at the beginning, but then the story gets much faster (that WAS my hope for Face on the Milk Carton, but sadly it remained boring the whole way through).All in all, &quot;Fog&quot; is a wonderful beginning to the story, though my personal favorite is &quot;Snow&quot; (the second book). &quot;Fire&quot; was also a good ending."},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"Fog is the first book of the series Losing Christina.

That is, until she meets her guardians--Mr. and Mrs. Shevvington--, who also work at Christina's school as the principal and her English teacher. Not only are they sadistic and manipulative, Christina is certain they're trying to play mind games with fragile Anya by fixating on her fear of the ocean. What can Christina do to help her friend? And what will she do next when they decide to focus on Christina instead?I had started this series years ago when I was in middle school, but, even then, I couldn't finish one book. I decided to try them now--more than ten years later--mainly out of curiosity. I wanted to see if I reacted to them the same way.Well, all I can is that I wanted to like &quot;The Fog&quot;; I even got myself psyched up for it. But it just didn't happen. I was expecting a tightly written suspense/horror story, but there's hardly anything fear-inducing in this book. The older teen (Anya Rothrock) who is supposed to be psychologically damaged by the evil principal and his wife was already bonkers to begin with. So no suspense there when her sanity starts to slip. And how or why this couple preys on young women is never thoroughly explained. Maybe--hopefully--that will be discovered in the following two books.The one thing I did like in &quot;The Fog&quot; was the main character, Christina Romney. She was strong and made of &quot;granite&quot;, as she put it--and she would have to be to survive the Shevvingtons.If you're a Caroline B. Cooney fan or a Point horror fan, you might enjoy this trilogy: &quot;The Fog&quot; (#1), &quot;The Snow&quot; (#2), and &quot;The Fire&quot; (#3). However, I'm both and I was still disappointed in this book. I'm hoping the other two books are an improvement over this one."},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"When I started to read this book, i was like, &quot;okay...this is a weird book.&quot; But then I started to really get into it, and now i am happily reading the sequel: The Snow. So basically, I think you will like this book if you just stick with it for a couple chapters. See you L8er!!!"},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"This book is the best book in the whole wide world! Christina is a 13-year-old girl named Christina going to the mainland for the first time in her life. She and her friends stay at the Schooner Inne, but after a while, one of them is slowly losing her mind, and Christina knows the owners, the Shevvingtons, have something to do with it. Then they start doing it to her. They tell her she is a very disturbed child and that she doesn't know herself. Christia is getting very, very scared. . .Thumbs up for Cooney! This book is TOTALLY AWESOME!!"},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"I have read Fog, Snow and Fire in this past week. I could not put the books down. Caroline B. Cooney's writing is addictive like no other author's is. All of Cooney's books that I have read I have loved but these are probably 3 of the best. I would describe them but theres no way I could give a qualified description. You'll just have to read them for yourselves!"},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"I'm in college now but a few years back &quot;The Fog&quot; &quot;The Snow&quot; and &quot;The Fire&quot; were some of my favorite books. I read and reread them probably 3 times. They aren't like those horrible goosebumps books or other &quot;scary&quot; series they are more drama than horror. I'd recommend them to anyone but I think girls in the fourth grade through the seventh grade would probably enjoy the series the most."},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"OK, I'll admit it. I am addicted to Caroline B. Cooney. I have read at least 10 of her other books before this one, and I have loved each and every page of every single one of them. This is no exception.Fog is the first book in the Losing Christina trilogy. It tells the story of Christina, a thirteen-year-old seventh-grader who is coming off of her Maine island, Burning Fog Isle, to attend school on the mainland. She along with 3 other island natives board on the mainland with the school principal, Mr. Shevvington, and his wife, an English teacher.Fog tells of Christina's self-proclaimed war with the Shevvingtons. They seem to hate her from the start. And to make things worse, slowly, slowly, slowly...another island boarder, Anya, seems to be losing her mind. And Christina knows who is behind it- the Shevvingtons.This story is fantastic, page-turning, and, I must warn you, addictive. I finished it in only three or four days, and I loved every minute I spent immersed within its pages. I have not yet read the next two books in the trilogy, Snow and Fire, but they are sitting in my bedroom, awaiting me. I would wholeheartedly reccomend this book, and any of Caroline B. Cooney's others, to anyone wishing for an excellent, suspenseful read!"},{"Title":"The Fog","review":"When I was younger (i'm 20 now), I couldn't get enough of those three books.

I have even recommended the books to some of my 20 year old college friends, just for a couple hours of fun reading! Caroline B.

The author has particularly good information on Yellowstone Lake, which has a reputation for being a nasty bit of water with very unpredictable weather. Nelson explains the risks and rewards of traveling on these high altitude lakes. This book is a must read for anyone wishing to bring a canoe or kayak to Yellowstone or Grand Teton."},{"Title":"Paddling Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks","review":"If you're planning to canoe in Wyoming Don Nelson's book \\"Paddling Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks\\" is a must. My husband and I found the information extremely helpful when we canoed String Lake in the Grand Tetons in the spring of 2008. Nelson's guidebook provides maps and descriptions of 20 paddling trips in Yellowstone National Park and 18 trips in Grand Teton National Park. These include day trips and multi-day trips. His chapters on water safety, permits and regulations, equipment, backcountry etiquette and natural and cultural history are invaluable. Although the parks are busy in the summer he shows that a remote, secluded wilderness experience is possible for those willing to travel on their own power."},{"Title":"Paddling Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks","review":"I was hoping there would be options for river floating. The book is mainly about open water canoeing and some small stretches of rivers that connect two lakes. But it is a National Park, so lots of land/river management is expected to protect the rivers and habitat. Don Nelson does an excellent job with his descriptions, day or extended trip itineraries and maps. However, the crowds and fees would make me think again about choosing Yellowstone as a canoe trip destination (only a personal decision). One more thing, there are grizzlies there if you didn't already know!"},{"Title":"The North Korean Revolution, 1945-1950 (Studies of the Weatherhead East Asian Institute, Columbia University)","review":"In The North Korean Revolution 1945-1950, Charles K. Armstrong argues that North Korea was not simply the result of an externally imposed communist system strictly controlled by the Soviet Union - and that Kim Il Sung was not a hand-picked Soviet puppet. Instead, he argues that North Korea, though created under the umbrella of the occupying Soviets, developed a uniquely Korean form of communism forged from the experiences of the various Korean communist groups that returned or re-emerged after liberation. Throughout the book, Armstrong strives to demonstrate the uniquely indigenous Korean aspects of the social formation of North Korea into a communist state - particularly those that contrast the Soviet national model and the type of socialism imposed more strongly on the Eastern European states.Armstrong begins his argument by discussing how socialist endeavors at land reform in Manchuria amongst the large populations of ethnic Koreans directly influenced subsequent land reforms in North Korea after Soviet occupation. Armstrong uses this one example to illustrate that an indigenous communist movement not only existed in theory in colonial Korea, but also actually put their theories into practice amongst the ethnic Korean population of Manchuria. Armstrong also notes that this nascent Korean communist movement, that existed to a limited extent within Korea and also in other countries where Koreans emigrated to or fled, was neither created nor controlled by the Soviet Union. In fact, when Soviet forces occupied North Korea, they had no known communist groups with which they had contact. Also, Armstrong makes the claim that the Soviets did not necessarily plan on creating a communist state in the North - only a state that would be friendly with the Soviet Union and open up its economic resources. Further, the various communist groups that eventually poured back into Soviet-occupied Korea did not all have the same agenda and competed amongst each other for influence. Armstrong also strongly emphasizes in this book that Kim Il-Sung was not the hand-picked puppet leader of the Soviet authorities, but was rather a leader of one of the several returning communist factions who had to compete for his ultimate leadership of the North.After making these significant points in his argument, Armstrong spends the rest of the book demonstrating how the communism that developed in North Korea from 1945 to 1950 was more a result of both traditional Korean Confucian traditions and the complex influence of oppression under and resistance to the Japanese colonial system than a result of an implementation of Soviet-style socialism. Armstrong also notes that North Korea had no real exposure to Western liberal ideals since it moved \\"directly from neo-Confucian monarchy to Japanese colonialism to Stalinism virtually without a break (6-7).\\" Finally, Armstrong shows throughout his book, and especially in the last few chapters, the influence of the anti-Japanese struggle on the formation of North Korea's unique brand of communism. With the rise of Kim Il-Sung's Kapsan guerilla faction to power, their experiences of continuous and desperate struggle against an almost omnipotent Japanese surveillance and security force directly informed their own policies of continual mass mobilization for war and the development of a widely-pervasive national surveillance infrastructure.Armstrong bases his argument primarily on his research of North Korean documents covering the period 1945 to 1950 captured by American forces during the Korean War. According to Armstrong, more than 1.6 million North Korean documents are currently stored in the United States National Archives. While the use of these captured documents provides a level of insight and detail impossible to obtain from sources within North Korea itself, there are limitations to using these types of documents as primary sources. First of all, having been written by North Korea communists themselves, these writings undoubtedly strive to portray the Korean communists as having a great amount of political autonomy from Soviet occupation authorities - if for no other reason than nationalistic pride. Armstrong himself notes in his appendix on sources that he did not use any Russian-language sources from the same time period. This is a shame, since these documents could just as well have supported his argument - but they may also have contradicted it by revealing a more powerful and influential occupational authority than envisioned by Armstrong.Therefore, Armstrong has probably painted an overly optimistic portrait of the \\"North Korean Revolution.\\" But, this criticism aside, this book is a worthy addition to the library on modern Korean studies. I respect Armstrong's willingness to challenge traditional wisdom on the formation of the North Korean state and the true value of this book is found in this challenge. However, his reliance on captured North Korean documents as his primary source, without contrasting Russian-language sources from the same period, weaken his overall argument of the purely indigenous nature of North Korea's development into a communist state. With this said, I believe that Armstrong successfully demonstrated that North Korea was not simply a Soviet-created and supported puppet state - but he did not demonstrate well from his sources that, beyond just being there and allowing nascent communism to flower, that the Soviet Union did not have a more direct influence on the style of communism that developed in the young North Korean state."},{"Title":"The North Korean Revolution, 1945-1950 (Studies of the Weatherhead East Asian Institute, Columbia University)","review":"When the history of North Korea is discussed, the focus is usually on the division of the peninsula, the installation of a pro-Soviet regime, and the application of communism. But Charles K. Armstrong went far beyond this approach in this work.Armstrong went through several aspects of North Korean society, touching upon even art, to show how the government's authority and ideology touched upon every aspect of daily life and every imaginable segment of society. To his credit, he highlights the communists' significant overturning of traditional Korean classes, as the communists placed the peasantry on top.A sound work free of political bias which examines what the North Koreans did between August 14, 1945 and June 25, 1950, in their attempt to revolutionize their half of the peninsula."},{"Title":"The North Korean Revolution, 1945-1950 (Studies of the Weatherhead East Asian Institute, Columbia University)","review":"Completely by coincidence, I finished this book one day after the 60th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War on 25 June 1950. It is an appropriate coincidence, however, since Armstrong (who completed the first version of this study as his dissertation under Bruce Cumings at the University of Chicago) lays out the development of North Korea as an increasingly separate state and society right up to the eve of the war. In Armstrong's description, \\"Korea's sudden liberation from Japanese colonialism in 1945 created an enormous space for politics, releasing a cacophony of contesting voices claiming to represent Korean society\\" (p. 47). Armstrong traces the early development of several of those voices, eventually narrowing his focus to Kim Il Sung and the people surrounding him--primarily allies from his days as an anti-Japanese guerrilla fighter in Manchuria. Indeed, one of Armstrong's purposes is to demonstrate that the experience of living and fighting in exile in the hinterlands of China had far more to do with shaping Kim's thinking and politics than any adherence to a Soviet-inspired system. He convincingly demonstrates that the development of North Korean politics, society, economy, and culture in these five crucial years immediately after Liberation were a combination of the legacy of colonial rule, influence from the USSR and China, and a bedrock of enduring Korean culture. Especially valuable is Armstrong's extensive use of North Korean documents captured by US forces during the Korean War--an enormous archive which scholars have only begun to mine. Armstrong concludes that Kim Il Sung gained power not because he was anointed by the Soviet Union but because he skillfully manipulated internal political alignments and understood the strength of Korean nationalism. He rose to power through internal politics, and could only be recognized and supported, not selected, by the USSR. Equally important, he shows that for all its outward adherence to many of the forms of a Soviet system, in its content the North Korean state developed essentially as a nationalist, and not a Soviet-internationalist, construction. It remains so today, dependent still on the rhetoric of external threat, a unitary people and culture, and the need for a strong leader to manage the constant crisis. It is a very good study, and did much to enhance my understanding of this crucial period."},{"Title":"IPv6: The New Internet Protocol (2nd Edition)","review":"OK intro for technical readers, but there is a lot here that is completely out of date since the book was written in 1997.

To my pleasant surprise I found that the book offered fresh new ideas regarding both medical and psychological aspects of the cause and treatment of hypertension.Dr. Mann's viewpoint differs in many ways from traditional mind/body views. He emphasizes that hypertension is linked to emotions in some people, while it has nothing to do with emotions in others. He discusses how hypertension is linked more to the emotions we have hidden from ourselves than to the emotions we feel, which affect us only temporarily. People who never feel distressed about anything are more likely to develop hypertension than people who do. Traumatic events from the past can affect our blood pressure even decades later. Understanding this, and getting in touch with hidden emotions can then lower blood pressure. Dr. Mann makes his points using many very interesting and quite persuasive case histories and also discussion of many studies. I was very surprised at the considerable evidence that argues against the traditional mind/body concept.Dr. Mann also discusses how to pick the right blood pressure drug, depending on whether the hypertension is linked to emotions or not. Having felt like my doctor has been picking drugs without any rhyme or reason, and having found little information anywhere on how to pick the right drug, I found the chapter on drug treatment very important.Healing Hypertension is a fascinating book. It conveys a great deal of new information and yet reads more like a novel than a medical book. I highly recommend it to anyone living with the mystery of hypertension."},{"Title":"Healing Hypertension: A Revolutionary New Approach (Health)","review":"I have had a problem with white coat hypertension for a long time.

Four stars for me is a really, really good rating.)This book has a great story to tell about how many instances of high blood pressure are attributable to repressed emotions. The author is a careful scientist, and clearly identifies how his conclusions arise from information that is in some sense anecdotal. He also is careful to note that only some hypertension can be so attributed, and how drugs are still a very important tool in regulating this problem. I was pleased to read a down-to-earth book on hypertension that did not pretend to have all the answers.Having said all that, it turns out that the main hypothesis presented in the book did not apply to me, so the book did not provide a non-drug solution for me. Though that's not the fault of the book. The book did have an excellent section on the drugs that are used, what they do and how they work (to the extent we know), and what considerations are used in selected drugs. I use one of them now (lisinopril), which easily and completely controls my hypertension with a relatively low dose and no apparent side effects.The writing at times can be redundant and repetitive, but the good parts are the actual case histories that are described.

I consider this an anavoidable book for those who pursue un understanding of educational research.2. To facilitate such understanding, I suggest that this book should be clearer about its relationships with the previous &quot;International Encyclopedia of Education&quot; (Hus&eacute;n &amp; Postlethwaite, 1985 and 1994) and with &quot;Educational research, methodology, and measurement: an international handbook&quot; (Keeves, 1988). The insights brought by the changes and the constancies in each entrance in any of this volumes constitute another, non worthless way of understanding such sinuous field as educational research seems to be. What I mean are simple things like the indication of the references of those entrances that are not new, some information about the changes, if so, and the indication of topics that are a novelty.3. Although the constancies (eg. Walker &amp; Evers, or Guba &amp; Lincoln) and changes (eg. Hus&eacute;n, or Kemmis) in the entrances in Parts I and II, speak for themselves, it is Part III who brings the real novelties: the subjects that are considered \\"issues\\" (measurement, feminism, positivism, antipositivism, and so on) and, specially, the relevance given to concepts like coherentism (Evers) or connectionism (Lakomsky). This last entrance brings mind to the scene of educational research, not in the same way the interpretative paradigm had done, but rather in a phsysical stance, also. This seems a non negletable path to the understanding of educacional research, but, it seems to me, it needs more arguments and to be more specific.4. On the other hand, it is not sufficientely clear how the idea of the unity of educational research and the negation of the quantitave and qualitative divide (preface) is sustained by the general contributions to this book. What are the concrete links between the study of the functioning of the brain and educational research, as it is sugested by De Landsheere and, more strongly, by Lalomsky? How far do they contribute to the unity of educational research, one of the vindications of the editors? When the scientific study of educational research began, by the last decades of the nineteenth century, mind was banished; then, by the seventies, a certain mind returned by the hand of the interpretative paradigm. Now, is it that another view of mind (intra- and extra-cranian human experience) is entering the field and giving new explanations and solutions for educative issues and, at the same time - by linking contexts and neurons - contributing to the unity o educational research - the way to finally and successfully articulate positivism and interpretativism?5. Anyway, and as I have said earlier, this is an unloosable book, especialy for the new lights it shows in the field of educational research.6. Since I am not a native speaker, I apreciate if my English is corrected. Thank you.7. I'd like to be aware of the purpose or dissemination of this review, in case I intend to share it with some portuguese publication.

Not only Roman and Eastern Catholics and Orthodox Christians as well as other Christians pray this very special Rosary for all who are involved in an abortion.

It is an unfortunate consequence of our unpredictable, sometimes dangerous, and unquestionably litigious society that such a warning must be so boldly declared, but the disclaimer also doubles as sound advice for life in general. Wired Not Weird dares to tackle a subject that is at best made light of in vapid comedy movies, at worst demonized with horror stories: online dating. Collaboratively written by Christy Clement and Kay McLean as a guide specifically for women, Wired Not Weird incorporates personal anecdotes, a hefty dose of common sense, and simple, easy-to-understand advice and strategies about what to expect, what to stay away from, and what to say or not say during the first meeting in person. Wired Not Weird's suggestions are also directly relevant to placing personal ads in the newspapers, which is basically the low-tech local equivalent of using the Internet to look for a date.

The most recent \\"authoritative\\" version - Robert's Rules of Order: Newly Revised, 10th Edition (2000). This is the version often referenced by the National Association of Parliamentarians. If an organization's bylaws state that the latest version of Robert's Rules is their parliamentary authority, this is the authoritative one that you'll have to reference. It's definitely a good revision. I saw notice somewhere that a newer edition is coming out in 2011, which would then make this one outdated.2.) A \\"classic\\" version, such as this one, which is usually based on the last editions published during Henry Robert's life time (copyright has expired and they're in the public domain). You can even find online copies of these versions. Usually these have little to no editorial or extra explanatory information. I think of them more as a historic document.3.) A condensed/easy to read/\\"common language\\" version or discussion of the rules. Some of these are more like \\"companion books\\" which are adequate for many but don't have the complete rules.So, if you're buying this copy, it's probably for historical purposes, although I had a different reason for buying it. The current versions are very verbose. True, they have modern information, including how to resolve new issues such as meetings by conference call, etc., but I wanted something terse and to-the-point because that's my learning style, I didn't need to refer back to it as \\"the authority\\", and I already have a copy of the 10th edition. I suspect most people won't take or need the \\"classic\\" approach.If you do need to get a \\"classic\\" version, I like this one (ISBN 1420922521) because it fits more content onto the pages, making it easier to read than other \\"classic\\" versions (such as ISBN 1599869411) which suffer from too little content on the page, resulting in way, way too much page flipping. It's easier in this version to follow short sequences of ideas because they are not needlessly spread over multiple pages."},{"Title":"Robert's Rules of Order","review":"While there certainly are other options to understanding parliamentary procedure, \\"Robert's Rules of Order\\" is a traditional key to knowing the ways things are done. This is the book, with a leather binding. The leather is its strength and weakness.True, true: this isn't exactly the sort of book you bring to a coffeehouse on a Saturday. However, it is also true that if you are part of an organization that has organized meetings, 'Robert's Rules' is a great place to start. The liturgy of meeting procedure starts and finishes with the rules set forth in 'Robert's Rules.'The leather looks and feels great. For use in an ordinary meeting context, it is likely too much. As a gift to your favorite politician (or as a editorial comment to your least favorite politician), the leather is a nice touch.Get this book, but consider getting one of the plain English versions as well.

Gymnasts will enjoy reading about things that they do on the floor, the beam, the bars, and the vault; others will simply enjoy Anda's strength, determination, and competitive spirit.

Unfortunately it's out of print, and I had to buy it from a 3rd party seller for a bit of a markup.This is the story of 12-year-old Jess, a girl who is partially deaf and wears hearing aids. One day while out on the ocean, she catches a glimpse of a mermaid about her age. As punishment for allowing herself to be seen by a human, the mermaid Melusina is banished to the land. Jess finds her on the shore, and with the help of Captain A. she helps the girl adjust to her new life. All the while, Melusina is longing to return to her home. Though they come from different worlds, Jess and Melusina become dear friends and because of their hinderances they can understand each other in ways that no one else could.There are some great themes present in this short novel, and Yolen's descriptions of the mermaid's longings for the ocean are haunting and beautiful.

The two eventually discover that they are not so different and find growth/strength even through loss.

While prior works have been clean, almost scientific, Minsk, while exuding the chill of winter, is nevertheless a vehicle for fantasy, a dreamscape of an imagined land.In a thoughtful forward, Edward Hirsh discusses the direction of Greenlaw's poetry, her fascination with issues of time and space, but with secret electricity, a current of morality. He states that Greenlaw is a winter writer and her icy landscapes explore questions of place.Looking back, the past is examined, the bright promise of youth:\\"Did we not remember the curse of this place?How Sundays drank our blood as we watcheddry paint or the dust on the television screen.\\" (Zombies)Intoxicated by the newness of the world, it is possible to believe in beginnings and ignore reality:\\"How people died bursting out of a quiet life,or from being written into a small world's stories.\\" (Ibid.)The poet's impressions allow us to reflect, to root around in memories sparked by a phrase, an image. Like art, good poetry is visual and Greenlaw's deft touch challenges form, stating bluntly that this is poetry, these are the words meant to be, in columns or sideways, pulled from the past or fresh as this morning. History and myth loom large, images of a lifetime ago, when stories passed by word of mouth, in rhyme, in song. Complex and stunning, Greenlaw has stepped further out on the ice-encrusted pond, daring it to hold:\\"They fold their robes, test each rung,half-enter a pool pinched in three feet of ice.Each swims a neat circle, wearing slippers and gloves.\\" (Steam)Minsk harkens the experience of untested territory, watching, measuring, feeling the cool fingers of winter, a creature walking the lands of myth:\\"All the small bones of feet and hands.What god is this we travel for hours,getting no further than the tips of his fingers?\\" (Vaeroy)Luan Gaines/2005."},{"Title":"The Tozer CD-ROM Library (Version)","review":"This is one of the Greatest Christian Growth resources you can own.

From his dying partner, Kel had learned the name of the mule--N. Two Feathers McKay. What he didn't expect was a beautiful woman of mixed Native American, Maori, and Scottish ancestery.Ngaire Two Feathers McKay has lived under a curse--and the only way to lift it and to survive her upcoming thirtieth birthday is to return the sacred stone carving to New Zealand where it belongs. When she wins a trip to the islands as a prize from a quizz show, it seems like fate. But others are after the carving and all of her Hapkido skills seem barely enough to keep her alive. The only good thing is that she meets this sexy guy--Kel. Although the rest of the world may be out to get her, she senses that she can trust Kel. Can't she?Author Frances Housden pours her heart into the sexual attraction between Kel and Ngaire and has fun with the action scenes. The New Zealand setting comes alive as the characters survive a tour bus ride through the two islands. The hint of a paranormal element (from the stone carving) is handled nicely as well. I found the drug sub-plot to be unconvincing, however. Kel soon realizes that Ngaire cannot be carrying the drug and decides that she must be carrying the formula. But why would international drug dealers use a mule to carry a formula? Why not simply send it via e-mail? Even if Ngaire is carrying the formula, stopping her would do little to stop international drugs. Another mule (or another e-mail) could soon be delivered. Finally, Ngaire's room is searched. Although the stone carving was in the safe, why wouldn't the Global Drug team have discovered the formula if there is one? For me, at least, the entire drug scenario weakens the story.From a romance standpoint, however, Housden's writing is strong with a wounded hero, a spunky and fighting heroine, a few family entanglements (from earlier stories), and enough sexual tension to light a fire."},{"Title":"American Yard","review":"This collection comes closer than anything I've read lately to achieving Horace's ideal of blending profit and pleasure, \\"at once delighting and instructing the reader.\\" In AMERICAN YARD, you will encounter such gems as \\"Pacific Airstream Reaches New England\\" a Petrarchan sonnet, describing in breathtaking detail the effect on flora and fauna of a December heat wave; \\"Taxidermy,\\" which tells the real story of Teddy Roosevelt's boyhood home, rich with entertaining quotations and sharp observations; \\"American Yard,\\" an inventively-rhymed couplet sonnet, describing the media sensationalism and desolate aftermath of a small-town murder; \\"Pregnant in June,\\" and \\"Postpartum Pantoum,\\" two of several poems on motherhood, which combine to achieve a sophisticated medley of blissful revery and earthy humor (\\"We used the diapers up three days too soon.\\").

As always, it's in Archie's storytelling voice:\\"When the doorbell rings while Nero Wolfe and I are at dinner, in the old brownstone house on West Thirty-fifth Street, ordinarily it is left to Fritz to answer it. But that evening I went myself, knowing that Fritz was in no mood to handle a caller, no matter who it was.\\"Fritz's mood should be explained. Each year around the middle of May, by arrangement, a farmer who lives up near Brewster shoots eighteen or twenty starlings, puts them in a bag, and gets in his car and drives to New York. It is understood that they are to be delivered to our door within two hours after they were winged. Fritz dresses them and sprinkles them with salt, and, at the proper moment, brushes them with melted butter, wraps them in sage leaves, grills them, and arranges them on a platter of hot polenta, which is thick porridge of fine-ground yellow cornmeal with butter, grated cheese, and salt and pepper.\\"It is an expensive meal and a happy one, and Wolfe always looks forward to it, but that day he put on an exhibition. When the platter was brought in, steaming, and placed before him, he sniffed, ducked his head and sniffed again, and straightened to look up at Fritz.\\"The sage?\\"\\"No, sir.\\"\\"What do you mean, no, sir?\\"\\"I thought you might like it once in a style I have suggested, with saffron and tarragon. Much fresh tarragon, with just a touch of saffron, which is the way--\\"\\"Remove it!\\"Fritz went rigid and his lips tightened.\\"You did not consult me,' Wolfe said coldly. \\"To find that without warning one of my favorite dishes has been radically altered is an unpleasant shock. It may possibly be edible, but I am in no humor to risk it. Please dispose of it and bring me four coddled eggs and a piece of toast.\\"\\"Fritz, knowing Wolfe as well as I did, aware that this was a stroke of discipline that hurt Wolfe more than it did him and that it would be useless to try to parley, reached for the platter, but I put in, \\"I'll take some if you don't mind. If the smell won't keep you from enjoying your eggs?\\"\\"Wolfe glared at me.\\"That was how Fritz acquired the mood that made me think it advisable for me to answer the door. When the bell rang Wolfe had finished his eggs and was drinking coffee, really a pitiful sight, and I was toward the end of a second helping of the starlings and polenta, which was certainly edible. Going to the hall and the front, I didn't bother to snap the light switch because there was still enough twilight for me to see, through the one-way glass panel, that the customer on the stoop was not our ship coming in.\\"I pulled the door open and told him politely, \\"Wrong number.\\" I was polite by policy, my established policy of promoting the idea of peace on earth with the neighborhood kids. It made life smoother in that street, where there was a fair amount of ball throwing and other activities.\\"Guess again,\\" he told me in a low nervous alto, not too rude. \\"You're Archie Goodwin. I've gotta see Nero Wolfe.\\"\\"What's your name?\\"\\"Pete.\\"\\"What's the rest of it?\\"\\"Drossos. Pete Drossos.\\"\\"What do you want to see Mr. Wolfe about?\\"\\"I gotta case. I'll tell him.\\"\\"He as a wiry little specimen with black hair that needed a trim and sharp black eyes, the top of his head coming about level with the knot of my four-in-hand. I had seen him around the neighborhood but had nothing either for or against him. The thing was to ease him off without starting a feud, and ordinarily I would have gone at it, but after Wolfe's childish performance with Fritz I thought it would do him good to have another child to play with.\\"Other plot highlights include a touching & ironic (never sentimental) scene around a death, some good New York hoodlum scenes - Stout draws these characters well -- and perhaps the best Archie action scene in Wolfedom, exciting and, as always, with some grins, including Archie self-grins. If you want a plot summary - and I wouldn't recommend it; why spoil the surprises? - go to Wikipedia, which has all the summaries of Stout's Wolfe novels.I've given this extended quote mainly for the newcomers and for those who may have forgotten just how good Stout's writing can be. He delights not only in reading, but also in re-reading, even when I know what's next. If this quote entices or even just intrigues, buy this book and give it a read.

Encouragement comes about from reading how other people have successfully faced their challenges and with God's help overcome them. In his collection, Dr. Peale provides such examples. His material is always relevant as the principles he teaches are timeless.Take the story of Dwight D. Eisenhower. He says his mother was the most influential person in his life and one of the things she taught him that stayed with him was to take the had you're dealt in life and work with it. By doing that things will turn out right. I see people who have come completely unglued because things didn't go their way. They used their energy up fussing over matters that would not change.

If you catchit by the blade, you can harm yourself. But if you catch it by the handle,you can use it to help you fight through the obstacles ahead.Dr. Peale also served as the narrator for much of this program. . . thoughhe was 90 at the time (he lived to be 95), his enthusiasm made it moreenjoyable than had I just read the book."},{"Title":"You can if you think you can (Spire books)","review":"If you have a particular goal in mind.

But given this book was first written in the 1970's, it is sometimes difficult to digest. What is said in 320 pages could have been said in 30 (quite wordy), the examples are far outdated (see below) and far too much attention is paid to supressing your emotions (therapists will tell you this is not good, feelings have to be dealt with). Example: Peale upholds Henry Ford as a shining beacon of a good person....Henry Ford was a great business leader but he was also a strong anit-semantic and was against employing people of color. The reader should also beware that Peale is a Christian minister.The book could use a re-write.The overall message however is still valuable today..Peale was one of the first to point out the Mind-Body connection and the Self-Prophesy theory..what you expect is what you get.

To say I felt shortchanged is a massive understatement. I really do not appreciate this being advertised as the full original, and being handed something less than the Cliffs Notes version. I feel like I've been given the bait and switch. I wish Amazon would offer print versions (as opposed to audio only) for Kindle in addition to the versions from audible.com. Being stuck with versions from audible.com only is a great disservice to the customer. Pass on this one and get the paperback instead. You'll be glad you did.

And, honestly speaking, it is quite a hard plot to deal with, especially in drama. Owing to the limitation on not writing everything explicitly in words, the story depends on dialogues to tell the readers the chaotic romance within the story. The book I have read so far, which can successfully deal with such a difficult plot is however, a gay novel - Larry Kramer's Faggots. Sleep with me has a potentially good and intriguing plot; however, there are not enough actions to dramatise the chaos. In other words, the chaos are not chaotic enough. The story is there. It happens by itself. It fails to pull the readers into the core of the drama. Finally, when you close the book, you will realise that something has happened, but nothing's changed."},{"Title":"Following Jesus: More about Young Children and Worship","review":"I was very excited to hear that Sonja Stewart had published a follow-up to \\"Young Children and Worship.\\" However, in actually looking through the book when I received it, I was disappointed to see that a certain amount of \\"Political Correctness\\" has been introduced, as well as some other elements that distract from the original Gospel accounts. Many of the stories have had a boy and girl added to the cast of characters. While I think I understand Ms. Stewart's intent (to draw young children into the stories in a \\"you are there\\" manner), I feel that it is actually a distraction. In some lessons there are more than twenty little wooden people to move around, which is difficult for the storyteller and confusing for the children. And some of the wondering questions, in particular, are hopelessly like something a school counselor leading a group discussion would come up with: (from the lesson entitled \\"Jesus' Trial\\") \\"I wonder why they want to kill Jesus just because they do not agree with him? I wonder how they could have settled their differences besides wanting to hurt or kill? I wonder what other ways Judas could have handled his guilt and sadness besides killing himself? I wonder how Judas could have been helped not to kill himself?\\" Perhaps I underestimate the wisdom of very young children, but I truly do not think they are yet ready to wrestle with the dynamics of first-century Jewish religious thought or the reasons why someone would end their own life.Nevertheless, there are some excellent resources in this book, in particular the templates and instructions for making the materials. I just cannot imagine using this book \\"as is.\\""},{"Title":"Following Jesus: More about Young Children and Worship","review":"This book contains stories from the New Testament that complements the original stories in Young Children in Worship.

The children (or older participants) learn in a multi-sensory way - not only by hearing or seeing, but by being able to participate in the stories and respond to them.Within the past year, I assumed responsibility for the Childrens' Worship ministry at my Church, and these books have been an invaluable resource.

It is also the type of theology that Mel Gibson follows - a very literal telling of events. There is a more intelligent way to teach Chritianity to pre-schoolers.

Reluctantly Neal constantly falls for his blarney and agrees, but the scenario never goes according to her uncle's plan.This time she is only to obtain a package from a US Senator's wife. However, whenever her uncle uses her, even as a simple messenger, something unexpected goes wrong. This time she and her target hide in a closet while witnessing the murder of the Senator. After the killers leave, Neal enables the spouse to quietly vanish from the crime scene before calling the Feds.Neal is hidden on the Montana ranch of Will Ryder, who reluctantly agrees to help a friend by protecting the witness. Will knows Neal is trouble in several ways, but mostly for his heart. Still her uncle's latest ploy is not finished and if history holds, the calamity has just begun for Neal and Will.The third Uncle Sean vs. the Shandian Corporation tale closes the entertaining romantic suspense with a strong finale. SUN VALLEY ties up loose ends including that loose cannon Sean even though he hints at one more niece to lead a new novel. The lead couple is a delight as the heroic Will wants to protect Neal, but wonders who will protect him from her. Sub-genre fans will take pleasure from Gena Hale's concluding stand-alone story, but to understand the bigger picture will want to read the two exciting previous books, PARADISE ISLAND and DREAM MOUNTAIN.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Sun Valley","review":"Reading S.L.

Books such as &quot;Babar the Elephant&quot; truely do awake in a child a want and need to explore different worlds different than their own. I know I maybe just talking out of experience, but as a child I took every moment to enrich my little mind in something as big as dreaming of going to France to see the Effiel Tower and such. Little children need time to read this book to explore the true self inside themselves, to search out this petite explore to the world of culture as Babar does in his books. Babar is different from the Bearstein Bears; Babar is a middle class man/elephant that has a family and a house in middle class Paris and he does ordinary things as well as out of the ordinary things. Like coming to America and flying around in Hot Air Ballons and wild things such as that. A child with the need to read really should read &quot;Babar the Elephant&quot; and all his great adventures. Great imaginations, especially young ones shouldn't go to waste let them dream of different lives in a different country--because dreams really can come true somday---I went to France when I was finally 17 years old--three whole years ago.

I read it to my boys, and now my grandchildren have met the gentle, bemused, wise elephant, his wife Celeste, the old lady, and the little elephants Flora, Pom and Arthur. I confidently assume I'll be reading Babar to great-grandkids one day. As in so many animal stories, there's the loss of a parent, followed by the assumption of responsibilities and rank. Babar is different, however. Just look at the insouciant way he wears his crown. As a small child, a half-century ago, I liked the endpapers best, with the elephant parade: nose to tail. As an adult, I appreciate the deadpan tone of the narrative as Babar learns how to rule. His creator has given him the correct dignified posture to grace his human clothing. People with too much time on their hands have offered literary criticism of this series. Children know better, and simply enjoy the stories and pictures."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant;","review":"I remembered how much I loved Babar growing up so I thought I'd get it for my 5 yr old and 19 month old.

This is NOT what I'd choose to read at bedtime with my kids at all."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant;","review":"The Story of Babar was on my library's list of recommended books to read to preschoolers, presumably because it is a classic. Alas, as I have been finding in many of the classics we have read (the original Winnie the Pooh, Mother Goose, Grimm's fairy tales, etc.), Babar is not what I would consider a good book for young kids.The illustrations are cute, I really like the rich vocabulary, and the story is linear and easy to follow. However, there are many decidedly adult themes presented and I just cannot understand the benefit of exposing a 3 year old to such horrific situations. Worse, the story handles these terrible situations in a completely emotionless way--giving the young reader very little time to process the events and instead starting on the beginnings of violence desensitization. I was also unable to detect any positive messages/morals to be learned from this story.My daughter and I tend to be fairly practical. Fantasy, fiction, and whimsy are wonderful creative outlets, but we prefer they be based at least somewhat in reality. Talking elephants--we can do. Elephants walking on their hind legs, shopping, driving cars--ok, we can totally go with it. But they should still be elephants in some way: what they eat, where they live, how they socialize--something. In Babar, the characters were blatantly humans, who just happened to look like elephants for some reason. We tend to find that frustrating.That said, this is not an offensive or horrible book with no place in society. I just don't think it's a good choice for young children. It could certainly be a useful resource in teaching older kids about several aspects of history (French history, colonialism, the draw of urban centers through history, etc.) as long as it was accompanied by discussion and further research."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant;","review":"I don't know why this book is a classic. Foreigners come to Babar's home and kill his mother. He goes to the land of the foreigners to learn to be just like them because the are so swell and all.

This is a nightmare, not a children's book."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant;","review":"At age 6, I knew something about this book wasn't right. I hated having to \\"dress up,\\" and when I read that Babar is made \\"king of the elephants\\" on the basis of his \\"fine clothes,\\" I felt uneasy. Why does one have to wear a shirt and tie just to be a decent human being? Can't people be appreciated if they don't wear suits? Can't we be accepted as we are? Or do we want to teach kids that we're only as good as the clothes we wear?Worse, this book is an obvious parable on how European powers tried to force their ways on Africans, Asians, and Pacific peoples. The aboriginal people of Africa, for instance, had to learn French and English, and had to dress in European clothes, even though the clothes were expensive and the heat would've been stifling. The colonial masters would introduce these people to \\"civilized clothing\\" under the guise of \\"moral education.\\" But the real reason was that they could create a bigger market for their manufactured goods if they persuaded Africans to wear shirts and ties!If you are an educator or parent, DO NOT read this book to children, and if you can, have it removed from the school library. It sets a terrible example for the children. Instead, read them \\"The Sneeches\\" by Dr. Seuss. It shows what really happens when you try to succeed based on your appearance alone!"},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant;","review":"I second what one of the reviewers said about the imperialistic propaganda.My husband recalled reading this book as a child, so when my mother-in-law got it for my daughter, I was delighted.

I'm returning it to the nearest used book store. I'm sure my daughter is too young to pick up on the offensive things as I do, but there is tons of kind and cute literature for children out there, so why bother reading this (on a personal note, I did not find the book either charming or delightful, but rather tedious and boring, offensive things aside)?"},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant;","review":"We received this book as a gift for our 3 yr old.

I disagree - when was a child's viewing a mother's brutal murder (Babar seeing his mother being shot before his eyes) ever appropriate fare for a little child? Then, Babar has to run for his life and later on in the book, there is another death. Also, Babar is surprised when his cousins have no clothes - this is upsetting to him. I find it offensive - elephants don't need to be like people - they don't need clothes. I don't see the charm in this book at all. I don't see the attraction. One thing -- Babar marrying his cousin is the one thing that is not shocking - its not like incest, like brother and sister or like they grew up together -- people have been marrying cousins for thousands of years - up until at least the beginning of this century - hardly immoral."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant;","review":"Thank God for the French speakers of the world. Were it not for them, Babar might not have ever been created and we would have to live in a wretched Babar-less world. As it is, however, we are blessed to have this delightful story at our fingertips at any time. The story of Babar was originally published in 1933, and it has stood the test of time with dignity and flair.The story of Babar is simple. After his mother is shot by a cruel hunter, the little elephant runs away to a metropolitan city. Once there, he is taken under the wing of a kindly older lady. Babar then proceeds to become the greatest dandy of children's literature today. Here is the section I love the most:\\"Babar then buys himself: A shirt with a collar and tie, a suit of a becoming shade of green, then a handsome derby hat, and also shoes with spats\\".Contrary to popular thought, an elephant in spats is the most dignified thing in the world. With these purchases Babar has transformed himself from rural rube to the original metrosexual. He becomes cultured, learning the rudimentary aspects of human civilization while regaling party guests with his tales of the forest (note his pin-striped pants and casual dinner jacket). Eventually Babar is lured back to his jungle home and is swiftly crowned King of the elephants.The 1933 setting in which Babar acclimatizes himself has grown more charming over the years. And most remarkably? Most older picture books contain at least one racial stereotype somewhere in the midst of a picture. Not so our darling \\"Babar\\". I feel safe in saying that you might search through any future adventure of the winsome elephant and not stumble across a single picture or piece of writing that causes you a twenty-first century gasp of disgust. This isn't to say that there aren't some rather peculiar dated aspects to the book. I read this book as a child and had a vivid visceral memory return to me when I saw the sickly state of the former King of the elephants who passed away after eating a bad mushroom. That is a grotesquerie unknown to the kiddies today. But all in all, \\"Babar\\" is without fault. Certainly he's the essence of capitalism. One might believe the elephants crown him king as much for his pretty red convertible as for his brains. But Babar is still a unique and moving tale that will continue to entertain the masses of children for years and years to come."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant;","review":"Ah, to be King of the Elephants. Not only do you get to live in the palace in Celesteville, but you also get to rewrite your life story. In the original books, Babar was an ordinary elephant who was orphaned at a young age and went to seek his fortune in the city before he returned and was chosen to be king. In the newer video series that my kids brought home from the library the other day, Babar recounts his adventures as a young prince growing up in the palace. And they say elephants never forget!The original story is fairly simple. After a hunter kills his mother, Babar runs away until he comes to a city. As luck would have it, one of the first people he meets is a lady who loves to spend money on young elephants. Soon Babar has a dashing new wardrobe, a private tutor, and elegant friends. Life would be wonderful if he weren't so homesick. When his two cousins show up, Babar decides to go back home with them. The elders of the elephant herd decide that Babar, with his civilized ways, should become their king.There's a school of thought that criticizes the Babar stories as colonialist. But then, most of children's literature written before the 1970s isn't exactly politically correct, is it? Do you tell your children that Babar is a tool of the imperialist establishment, or do you point out what a wonderful culture the elephants built when they banded together to build Celesteville, their capital city? Or do you just read the stories for pure enjoyment?"},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant;","review":"My children adored this book from a very early age due to the charm of the text and the pictures. The bon-bons, the kind old lady, the suit of clothes, all create a Parisian fantasy for the big, shy Babar. My kids are now high-schoolers and take French. I like to think it was due to those first images of the Tour Eiffel in this book! Every kid should have this delightful story. My high schoolers still enjoy a trip down memory lane once in awhile with Babar."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant;","review":"This book holds my fondest memories of my childhood, a childhood that was in some ways harder than Babar's. The idea that from the loss of a parent, I could still grow up and be king was something that that gave me confidence and hope. It made me want to learn and to teach others, and it helped me know that life isn't always easy and pretty, but you have to make the most of what you are dealt. I would recommend this book for every child, but especially for those that have lost something dear to them and could use a little help imagining what is possible.The low reviews for this book are all absurd, they are great examples of how poorly we treat our kids and how little we think of them as individuals. These people think they need to hide the world from their children rather than let them see and explore it for themselves. If you feel guilty sharing this book with your kids because you can't deal with reality, then you should really reconsider breading. The world will be a better place for your restraint."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant;","review":"I think the reviewers who claim this book is imperialistic, or a bad story because Babar's mother gets shot are off in their assessment of the basic story. Imperialistic? This book is about an elephant. Perhaps it is not appropriate for a 3-year-old to read about elephants being shot and dying, but my daughter is six-years-old and has no problem understanding the concept of death and that it is a tragic eventuality of life.I found this book a great entrance into a discussion with children about many topics, including France / Europe, elephant hunting and the efforts over the past 100 years to ban it, poisonous mushrooms, and the fact that the English language is a living, breathing, changing thing and a book written in the 1930s uses language different from a book written today. Yes, Babar's mother gets shot by a \\"wicked hunter\\" and the king elephant eats a mushroom and dies, and my daughter found these things very sad. So we talked about hunting elephants and why people hunted elephants and the fact that some mushrooms are poisonous, so we never eat anything growing outside without checking with mom or dad first. Personally, I am glad my daughter knows that hunting elephants was once a very popular sport and today is shunned by the majority of the world.I think that shielding our children from the past / history simply because we are uncomfortable with some aspects of it does them an injustice. To understand where we're going, we need to take a look at where we came form. I hope that this book continues to be seen as a classic in the years to come."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant;","review":"I have fond memories of tracing my fingers over the elephants, enjoined trunk to tail, which walked over the back and front of our huge BABAR book. Thanks to a thoughtful baby gift from my cousin, I continue to do so, with my two sons. We enjoy finding Babar among the other little elephants and weep together over his mother\`s cruel demise. We continue to delight at his resilience and enjoy with him his first experiences with people things, and always rejoice at his good fortune and friends.While there are some problematic elements, ( as when the hunter shoots Babar\`s mother or when he marries his cousin,) please keep in mind when this was written and do not let this stop you from sharing this classic with your young ones. Parents and caretakers should seize this great opportunity to talk with them while addressing the issues. There are many positive aspects to the story and the characters, themselves. Delightfully illustrated and charmingly told, the one drawback is that the text, while charming for adults reading aloud, can be an obstacle to early readers."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant;","review":"This book is about an elephant's travels after the death of his mother-- his search for independence and his return home. He takes what he has learned on his travels and offers it to the other animals in the forest. The book teaches that you can overcome aversity and make good things happen by working hard. Babar gets beyond the death of his mother by going to the city, studying and by learning how to act in society. I like the book because it is well written and has excellent pictures. It also has a strong message and teaches you a lot about the ways of the world. I also like the way that elephants are used to teach the message.---- Makki Russo (Age 7)----"},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant;","review":"I love Babar as much for the pictures as for the story. When I read it again to my daughter, I turned to the page where \\"Alas, that very day, the King of the elephants had eaten a bad mushroom\\" and thought wow, I remember that! The resurging memory of that illustration is so keen in my mind, it's as if twenty-plus years had just fallen away. And next comes my very favorite line, for its old-fashioned text and neatness of phrase: \\"It poisoned him and he became ill, so ill that he died. This was a great calamity.\\" Which is not to say that the story of Babar dwells on sad things, because it doesn't. Whatever happens to Babar he deals with it with grace and moves on. Endlessly adaptable, this is an elephant who so charms the ladies that he woos and wins Celeste in just their brief drive home. The only sticking point for some parents who are encountering this book for the first time and therefore don't have their eyes all misting over with tender rememberances of their own childhood is that Babar is chosen to be the new king of the elephants because he is considered to have \\"learned so much living among men\\". If you are trying not to teach your children that humans are above and beyond all other animals, you may not want this subtle message. Overall, I think this book is wonderful and, at the end, when he and Celeste fly away in a hot air balloon to begin their honeymoon, it is clear that the story continues. This can be taken in the vein of allowing for endless opportunity of sequels but I prefer to think of it as the beginning of your child's opportunity to answer \\"what happens next\\" and regale you with their own series of stories about the adventures of Babar, the little elephant."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant;","review":"Babar first came into my life at when I was 8 and in 3rd grade. I will always remember because that was the happiest grade-school year of my whole life. I was going to private school with a wonderful, sweet teacher and awesome friends. Among all the wonderful things my teacher did with us were some of the neat things in the classroom, some being her supply of story books. Naturally as an animal lover, I grabbed this book during silent reading because I needed some reading material. Tears were streaming down my face as I began to read of Babar's mother's death, and I had tears of joy as some good people take Babar in. I remember being so touched by Babar that whenever someone would mention the word &quot;elephant&quot;, I'd get all misty-eyed! It seems funny now but at the time it was quite a dielemma! I was too embarrassed to tell my mom and dad why I was upset so they were concerned! Then my mom went on a trip to California and visited a bunch of garage sales and found some patterns for making little felt Babar and friends dolls. No doubt, Babar had touched my life deep inside.

It is kind of bizarre, so keep in mind that it was written in the 1930's. First, Babar's mother is killed, as was the fate of most classic animal stories. Then, he decides to become more like men, HOW ODD! He wears clothes and walks on his back legs. Any time any of the elephants in this book wear clothes, they gain the instant ability to walk on their hind legs. When he returns to the elephants, he is crowned king, which is unlikely since elephants are matriarchal (they are led by females and grown males are banned from the group except during mating times). Then he marries his cousin, and they live happily ever after.

On fleeing from the hunter, he finds himself in a city. When he sees the people there are wearing clothes he wishes that he could do the same, and an empathetic Old Lady buys him a fine suit and takes him home. He lives with her until two of his runaway cousins cross his path. When he returns them to the forest he decides to stay, and the elephants choose him as their king.This unusual story combines the drama of bereavement with comedic humor. Young children will enjoy the way Babar takes on human characteristics as he puts on his suit, and spreads the human influence of civilization to the entire elephant \\"people.\\" Although he is shown grieving for the life he has lost, the evil that brought about his orphanhood is counterbalanced by the Old Lady's kindness, and his story is suffused with expectant hope. His traumatic bereavement remains a part of him, but it does not prevent him from bettering himself, helping others, marrying Celeste, and building a royal family together.While some critics have objected to what they interpret as sexist and colonialist undercurrents [...], I think the Babar series is best understood as an innocent and deliciously lighthearted fantasy, at the heart of which exists a stable, joyful family. It's definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The story of Babar, the little elephant;","review":"...a child's (or adult's) introduction to the wonderful world of Babar.

The first thing anyone who grew-up on more modern fare will notice is the delightful and literate prose. The reason children could speak latin by 5th grade 80 years ago, was that they weren't condescended-to; and Babar doesn't either. You won't get the modern \\"barney-speak\\" here, this generation had more confidence in your children, believe me. Although the prose may be too difficult for the average 5 or 6 yr-old to read on their own, they will have no difficulty at all in understanding it perfectly when read to them. Now my 5 yr-old daughter knows what a \\"perambulator\\" is, you won't get that from the Wiggles. As far as the complaints in regard to \\"scariness\\", all I can say is, if this is scary because Babar's mother is killed by a hunter, then you'd better take Bambi, The Lion King and close to all of the fairy tales off of the reading list as well. The subject is handled compassionately and tastefully. Of course I want to sheild my child from horrific content, but if we refuse to gently ease them in to life's realities, such as the loss of loved-ones, then their entertainment turns from safe into vacuous pretty quickly. I won't even waste bandwidth on the silly, leftist nonsense regarding imperialism. There is no political content here, subtle or otherwise. If you really want the kind of western culture \\"self-flagellation\\" that these aging hippies seem to thrive on, try Disney's Pocahontas, or a Cartoon version of The Life of Che Guevara.

It's a worthwhile read in its own right, don't get me wrong. But read _My First Summer in the Sierra_ or a Muir biography like Michael P. Cohen's _The Pathless Way_ before you move on to this one. Get a good dose of what the naturalist is like and learn some of his background, and then you'll be in the proper frame of mind to tackle _Travels in Alaska_. Otherwise, this book is just one glacier after another. And bless his heart, Muir wants to see them all. And climb them and explore them and sketch them and hike their entire lengths and write about them ad nauseum. He leaves his companions in his wake and puts himself squarely in the face of isolated danger over and over again. Read this book first, and you'll think he's insane. Know his roots in Wisconsin and his good work in California, and you'll be better able to appreciate what he thinks of and does in the Alaska of the late 1800s."},{"Title":"Travels in Alaska","review":"I confess up front, it's been a few years since I read Muir's Travels in Alaska. Yet significant aspects I remember well. Given Muir's exuberance for life and almost everything he encounters in his travels, one almost looses view of Muir the botanist and geologist. But not quite. Here we find the author contemplating the activity of glaciers and documenting the flora of southeast Alaska. Muir (who tended strongly toward vegetarianism) gleefully entertaining himself by foiling duck hunters. Baffling the locals by happily wandering out into major storms.The book is a journal of Muir's 1879, 1880, and 1890 trips (he wouldn't mind if we called them adventures) to SE Alaska's glaciers, rivers, and temperate rain forests. He died while preparing this volume for publication.I remind myself, and anyone reading this, that Muir isn't for every reader. And, as other reviewers have stated, this may not be the volume in which to introduce oneself to the one-of-a-kind John Muir. One reviewer doesn't think that Muir is entirely credible in these accounts. I won't say whether or not this is wrong, but I tend to a different view. For some of us -- and certainly for Muir -- wilderness is a medicine, a spiritual tonic, so to speak. For the individual effected in this way, physical impediments and frailties rather dissolve away when he is alone in wildness. I once heard Graham Mackintosh (author of Into a Desert Place) speak of this. In all of his travels alone in the desert, he doesn't recall having ever been sick. This may not sound credible to some, but I strongly suspect it is true.If you like Muir's writings, read this book. If you like the stuff of Best Sellers, perhaps you should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Travels in Alaska","review":"From the title, one would think this a type of travel journal, a panorama of episodes along the way, a sequence of stations between the starting off point and the destination. Instead, the overall weight of the book is given to glaciers, their descriptions, their influence on the landscape, their geological record, the discovery of new glaciers, and other characteristics of these moving rivers of ice. While Muir offers descriptive powers unequaled among authors on nature, never repeating himself though constantly repeating his subject, the sheer repetition tends to bog the work down. Two whole pages might contribute to our view of a particular glacier, and suddenly Muir reports that he's finished a 200-mile leg of his journey on foot. He tells us when he's climbed a glacier, and along the way we've missed an entire week. Time and space almost have no medium in this publication, utterly lost when gazing upon a glacier. For nature lovers who will never go to Alaska, the descriptions in this book make the ranges and glaciers come alive in print, but as a dramatic journey, a travelogue, or a field manual for the Alaskan bush, this book forms only a vague shadow."},{"Title":"Travels in Alaska","review":"The beauty of this wonderful reprinting is how it shows John Muir as a person, how it helps us to understand the dynamic and overwhelming beauty of Alaska, and the changes in the people of Alaska. Muir's complete, tireless, and joyful commitment to nature comes through on every page. The book unintentionally provides an excellent portrait of the kind of inexhaustible devotion it takes to change the world as did Muir. The book also provides a stunning portrait of Alaska in the latter part of the 19th Century and allows one to compare the Alaska of those days with Alaska of earlier times and of today. The biggest changes are in the glaciers and in the people. The glaciers have receded dramatically as a natural part of their centuries' long retreat. It is interesting to compare what Muir saw with the experience of Vancouver almost exactly 100 years earlier (ca. 1793). Vancouver could hardly enter Glacier Bay. Muir could enter quite some distance, but the glaciers were still the dominant features. Today, the glaciers have largely receded into deep valleys. Muir encountered people in Alaska living largely as they had for centuries. They were hunters and fishermen and lived in small groups along the shore line. As Jonathan Raban points out in the intricately woven fabric of his sublime book \\"Passage to Juneau,\\" the people of southeast Alaska considered the sea to be the real environment of their lives while the land was considered dangerous and unknowable. They lived along the shore and knew how to live off and with the sea year round. The lives of the Alaskan people are very different today but greatly influenced by the past. Raban often characterizes Muir's writing as overblown and florid. However, it is a portrait of a man, a maritime land and a people. To do justice to those three, the book had to be what it is - an astonishingly colorful and detailed portrait in words."},{"Title":"Travels in Alaska","review":"John Muir's \\"Travels In Alaska\\" is his accouts of his trips to Southeast Alaska in 1879, 1880, and 1890. Southeast Alaska 125 years ago was sparsely settled and poorly explored; Muir's adventurous spirit and enquiring mind led him to investigate the numerous inlets and glaciers in the area, including the magnificent and much-celebrated Glacier Bay.Muir's simple, muscular prose weaves a fascinating narrative out of descriptions of the people, wildlife, and geology he encounters on his journey, suffused with his endless sense of wonder at the landscapes in which he saw the hand of God. The reader can hardly help but be carried along by Muir's enthusiasm. Muir's descriptions may be most relevant to those traveling Southeast Alaska by cruise ship, for a sense of what the landscape looked like before the population reached today's size and spread. Those not interested in the travel aspects of the book and in numerous descriptions of glaciers may find this book less interesting.This book is highly recommended to fans of John Muir's writings, and to those planning a trip through Southeast Alaska."},{"Title":"Travels in Alaska","review":"I have read most everything that John Muir wrote and agree with Corinne H. Smith's review that if you are new to the works of John Muir, this isn't the best book to start with.

To be completely honest, I hold a degree of envy for John Muir for having the opportunities to do all he did, what an incredible life. At least I can be there through his eyes and in my imagination.These works are meant to be absorbed through the heart and soul by contemplating on Muir's thoughts.

Other than that, it's a free book, and worth downloading if you're interested in Alaska, glaciers, or Muir himself."},{"Title":"Travels in Alaska","review":"I have traveled to Alaska twice, and I simply cannot get enough of the glaciers. I wanted to read this because I had heard that Muir too felt the same that I feel of the glaciers. I was NOT disappointed! His trek to seek out the glaciers reminds me very much of how I would like to seek out each and every glacier. To me climbing the face of a glacier is just a dream, a dream that you can almost live out while reading this book. I felt like I was a part of the glacier crevices or part of the ice flow. I was traveling in the canoe right along with Muir. This was the first book of his that I read, and now I am hooked!!!"},{"Title":"Travels in Alaska","review":"Travelling Alaska with John is to see, hear, feel, taste, smell, experience the response of a God-intoxicated man to almost unearthly splendor. Muir's passions were elemental: apprehending the Divine through an understanding of nature, and hence, the protection and preservation of this voice of the sublime.He travelled to Alaska five times over a 30 year period. This book, only completed a few years before his death, polishes the field notes of his earlier trips and offers almost unedited, his journals from the last journey. Muir's interests begin with geology, specifically how the U-shaped valleys of both Yosemite and the Alaskan fjord-land resulted from glacial actions. Beginning with ice, they include the land, the trees, the waters, the fish, the First Americans living in the harsh beautiful world, the scientists, the missionaries, transportation, food, and in a chapter that cries to be read aloud, Muir's experience of a sunrise like the eighth day of Creation and of the Northern Lights.One remembers vignettes of one's own travels. So vivid, so immediate are these stories that they become part of your own memories. Raining is it? Experience laying your already soggy sleeping bag down in a bog so wet you strip off and shiver your way through the night, then arise---not like new-made bread---but to wring the water from your clothes and bag and slog on. Thinking of what it would be like to walk across that glacier? Start out early, accompanied by a dog who had more loyalty than brains and got over jagged ice frise-de-cheval points, across crevasses, up treacherous slopes----to get to the other side, and then come back at night, having to encourage the now-alarmed dog to leap those widening chasms, risking your own neck to get the crittur home.Those going to Alaska could hardly have a better companion. The book is portable and a bargain. And those who travel widely through the frigates of books, like Emily, will find their world enlarged and enobled in the company of this good and brave man who did so much to preserve our wild, beautiful places."},{"Title":"Travels in Alaska","review":"\\"Travels In Alaska\\" is, essentially, a diary which John Muir kept during his three visits to Southeastern Alaska from 1879-1890. In the course of his travels he describes the Indians, plants, wild life, mountains and glaciers. He is especially interested in his explorations of the glaciers. He provides the reader with an insight into pristine Alaska. His comments about retreating glaciers are of interest given the current claims of man-made global warming.The reader comes to respect Muir's love of nature and his bravery, as he paddles around ice bergs, camps on glaciers and enters the domains of bears and whales.The downside of this is that there is very little analysis beyond what he recorded at the time of his journeys. While his observations hold your interest, Muir's writing style adds little to the narrative. This book pales in comparison to Ranch Life & the Hunting Trail by his friend, Theodore Roosevelt (see my Amazon review).Overall I enjoyed \\"Travels In Alaska\\", but have read better nature books. Perhaps a reader more familiar with the Alaskan Panhandle or outdoor adventures would have a greater appreciation with this work."},{"Title":"Travels in Alaska","review":"Nature is a beautiful and highly complicated phenomena of this world. Many have sought to understand it and capture its essence in writing. The nature writings of John Muir succeed in capturing the beauty of nature as well as the scientific aspect. I have to be honest, I wasn't that enthused about reading a book about science. I expected Muir's book to be identical to a science textbook, definitely not my idea of enjoyment. However, his book was actually full of detailed descriptions and creative uses of similes, metaphors, and analogies. In fact, it completely changed my perception of a scientific novel.In his book, \\"Travels in Alaska\\", Muir brings alive the magnificence of the vast expanses of unexplored Alaskan territory. His prose reveals his enthusiasm for nature, and he weaves clear and distinct pictures through his words. Muir's writing is very personal. His favorable feelings toward the land are very apparent, and reading the book is like reading his diary or journal. He avoids using scientific jargon that would confuse and frustrate the average reader; his words are easily understood.Muir also uses very detailed descriptions throughout \\"Travels in Alaska\\". Although at times his painstaking description is a plus, at others, he seems to take it a little too far. Numerous times throughout the book, Muir spent a paragraph or two talking about something slightly insignificant. He would go off on a tangent of enthusiasm for something as simple as a sunrise or the rain. While his careful observances make the book enjoyable, the sometimes excessive detail tends to detract from the point he was trying to make. The description also reveals that his heart and soul was in his research; this became very evident upon reading the long and thoughtful descriptions.\\"Travels in Alaska\\" can be appreciated by a wide audience. Muir shines light upon the Alaskan territory, and he is detailed in his account of the many people he meets. Anyone could read the book and find enjoyment learning about Alaska when it was for the most part unsettled. Muir shares with the readers his keen insight upon the various Indian tribes that lived in Alaska. At one point in the book, he gives a very detailed description of one tribe's feasting and dancing. His observances capture exactly what he saw and the feelings these observances evoked in him.John Muir's writing is of high quality. He incorporates beautiful and creative similes, metaphors, and analogies. His prose is very poetic, which makes it an enjoyable read. For example, Muir says that \\"when we contemplate the world as one great dewdrop, striped and dotted with continents and islands, flying through space with other stars all singing and shining together as one, the whole universe appears as an infinite storm of beauty.\\" His work is also very organized. The book is divided into 3 sections, or parts of his trip, as well as separate chapters devoted to specific subjects. Muir spends one chapter describing his trip to Puget Sound, another on Wrangell Island, etc. The book follows a specific format that ensures that everything is easily followed and understood.Truthfully, I was impressed with the writing, and the fact that it was nothing like a textbook. It incorporated the literary aspect so well, that the book held my interest whereas a textbook would not have. I had the wrong impression of a scientific novel, and I urge anyone unfamiliar with the genre, to give \\"Travels in Alaska\\" a fair try. It may just change your mind about scientific writing."},{"Title":"Travels in Alaska","review":"I am enjoying reading all I can about Alaska lately and this one is just one to add to that list!"},{"Title":"Travels in Alaska","review":"Having been to Yosemite multiple times, I was very interested in his book about Yosemite. He is an English teacher's dream, the way he expresses himself and the descriptions he uses to tell about his journeys. So, when we went to Alaska, I bought this book and couldn't put it down. I was never \\"bored or unhappy\\" with the story. I think Yosemite was one of John Muir's favorite places. I remember him saying, in this book about Alaska, that \\"someday I think of Alaska being a lot like The Yosemite as the glaciers have been melting for 200 years\\", and this was written in the 1800s. I think one of the other reviewers mentioned this also. So, what's global warming? Also he tells of how he feels when he sees the Northern Lights, as if the Savior was coming to earth. Many things impressed me about John Muir and the way he sees the earth and how he would protect it, without being preachy. I read some good reviews here and they touched my heart as I feel the same way as do they. Thank you for this opportunity to view my thoughts."},{"Title":"Travels in Alaska","review":"John Muir's diaries and stories are enchanting - and especially welcome during my long, hot drives around Los Angeles this time of year! Just hearing narrator Lee Salibury talk about the glacier formations is refreshing - and the sound effects and music add so much to the ambience! The six hours of reading seem to FLY by, and make summer traffic bearable. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"Travels in Alaska","review":"No doubt about it, John Muir was one of America's greatest citizens. He founded the Sierra Club and was instrumental in starting the ecological movement in the United States. In this book Muir recounts three journeys to Southeast Alaska that he took in the late 1800's. He writes better about glaciers than any writer who ever lived. There are flaws: Muir's attitudes about native peoples are simple-minded and ignorant, and his prose is sometimes dry and dull. Also, one cannot help but call Muir's credibility into question when he writes than he and his dog Stickeen walked fifteen miles across a crevasse-riddled glacier in three hours and then had nothing for dinner but a moldy cracker. But these are important records from a man who truly loved the natural world, and it's essential reading material for anyone traveling to Southeast Alaska or anyone wishing to learn more about glaciers."},{"Title":"The Tainted Desert: Environmental and Social Ruin in the American West","review":"For anyone who is at all interested in the environment, or the American West, or issues of nuclear waste, this book is a must. Kuletz does something that is lacking in our radio, t.v., news magazine, and newspaper reports on environmental issues--she reveals the cultural biases in our Western, &quot;objective&quot; perspective.

This is by far the best of the bunch... The primary thing that makes this book special is the way it links the courses on the dulcimer to the music itself... Other books seemed to forget that I don't know what strings play what note and am also new at sheet music... This book solved that by showing a diagram of the strings that are associated with the notes as well as the sheet music... Very helpful!

I was much more excited about the thought of reading this book than the actual story itself. The timeline covered (1948-1990ish) is long and the book short, so it jumps from decade to decade quicker than Marty McFly. It's also somewhat repetitive, delivering the same message several times-I am a leper and shunned wrongly by society, it hurts me. But by far the part that was hard to wrap my head around was the dialogue. It's told in a first person, choppy, random thought process like the narrator is Gollum from Lord of the Rings. In his defense, Mr. Talagrio has tackled a tough subject and done a good job exposing the realities of dealing with a debilitating disease with inadequate medical knowledge. But I was disappointed at the lack of a real plot and the poor way in which that lack of a plot was told. Kudos to Mr. Talagrio for taking on such an admiral subject but less than stellar execution makes this one to pass on."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"This is affecting and elegantly written.

Or, at least it had the potential to be. I really wanted to like it. But I couldn't get into the way the story was told through the artifacts catalogued from the leprosarium. It gave the story a disjointed feel and left me feeling disconnected from the characters. As it's told, it's not a bad story, but it could have been so much more powerful had more time been spent on character development.This story was really interesting, but not moving.

The treatment they are subjected to seems barbaric & medieval, although the story takes place in the mid-1900s. Very large parts of this story are difficult to read on an emotional level.

The topic is based on history of the leprosy colony in Japan beginning around WWII and continuing for about 50 years. It was about how the people survived their new life of being interned on the island, how they survived being shunned by their familis, and how they were treated on the colony. It is told from the perspective of a young 19 year Pearl Diver and follows her through her lifetime. While this book is sad in many respects and sometimes horifying in others, it is also about mental survival in this circumstance.It was a good book club choice for those clubs that look to choose books that they can learn something from, have a good topic for discussion, and look for books that are easy to read within a one month time line.I gave it 4 stars because I found it easy to read and engrossing. I do not know that I will remember it long term like many of the classics. I do want to point out that there is another book by a different author with the same title.

Know of others who read it also and found it hard to follow."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"Every writer deserves at least one star for having a novel. Published or not, anyone who can write a novel should be given high honors for earning the name 'novelist.' Novels are so common that few people really think of what really goes into one--what it takes to let another person actually see it and read it.Imagine if you will, walking up to someone and submitting an invoice for two year's worth of overtime. The person sitting on the side of the desk where the money is can choose to pay you for your work or choose not to. He, a stranger, will pay your invoice--will give you money and exposure --if and only only if he and only he decides that your work is worthy. You have to give credit to anyone who writes a novel if only for making it all the way to whatever ends up on the last page. You have to give great credit to Jeff Talarigo for The Pearl Diver.The Pearl Diver is a thoughtful and beautifully-written work but in some ways it is also a fundamentally flawed one. To look at it is to see an attempt at high art that makes only limited use of the literary techniques and methods that create the drama and tension that are the driving force of less ambitious works. Mister Talarigo's novel is nothing if it is not ambitious.Written in the style of a structurally free biography. The Pearl Diver follows the life of a young woman who contracts Hansen's Disease (leprosy) in postwar Japan. Telling the story in a series of often exquisitely-rendered vignettes and meditations on significant objects; Mister Talarigo's narrative weaves the story a healthy, nineteen-year-old girl whose illness destroys what might otherwise have been an ordinary, but fulfilling life as her ancient disease and her culture's reaction to it strip her of everything she should have had; including and especially the sight of the rapidly evolving world around her.Mister Talarigo is a gifted prose stylist. A man with sometimes magical solutions to the problem of wedding image to idea in words. Over the course of his book, he comes up with a few things that should be part of a curriculum in writing prose because the world needs more words like the ones in this line from page 145:\\"On this late night, walking home from Clinic B, she hears a somewhat familiar sound far above her, but one that she has only heard during the daytime. She looks up and sees, for the first time at night, a distant jet slicing through Cassiopeia.\\"Everything that goes into the book is of substance and of interest and it should add up to a living, gripping account of a life pulverized by culture and the history of medicine but it fails to do this; and the problem is not in the story but in the telling. Mister Talarigo's sense of scene is marked with clarity and honesty (even when describing a disturbingly cruel, late-term abortion) but his choice of a fundamentally plotless narrative lessens the book's real power. In one section of the book, the patients revolt and the police are called in to quash the insurrection and afterwards, you can barely remember it: this book can make even a riot soporific.To be sure, The Pearl Diver is not a thriller. It can't be full of car-chases, intrigue and shots fired in the dark, but even the most staid and weighty works of fiction avail themselves of techniques and devices to create anticipation and make the reader turn the page. Shakespeare used them and Hemingway used them. Margaret Atwood used them in 'The Handmaid's Tale' Alexander Sohlzhenitsyn did in 'one day in the life of Ivan Denisovich\\" as did Don Pearce in \\"Cool Hand Luke\\" all of which deal with isolation and imprisonment as The Pearl Diver does. Cormac McCarthy's painfully vapid \\"No Country for Old Men,\\" was nothing *but* a collection of those devices, but the use of transitions and intelligent foreshadowing seems so malformed or absent In The Pearl Diver that the novel gives one the impression that Mister Talarigo is leaning too hard on the strength of his prose and the weight of his subject matter to respect the reader and imagine for even a moment that he or she might have something else to do.This lack of respect for the reader--the inability of the writer to understand that he or she is competing for the reader's time and attention--is a dangerous flaw in a book to be appreciated in a culture of distraction because, despite its brightness and its earnestness, The Pearl Diver will remind you of everything else you have ever done for entertainment. You will remember the last ten books you read and that you could be rereading them. You will be constantly distracted by wondering about what is on television or think of how long it has been since you last went to a gym. In fact, the slower, more disconnected parts of the book might make you actually volunteer to help *build* a gym so you can sign up for it.At the end of the day, it cannot be emphasized enough that The Pearl Diver is not a bad book and that Jeff Talarigo is not a bad writer far from it. The work is painstakingly researched and skilfully written by a man who has real and realized gifts. Mister Talarigo enjoyed powers as a writer that most writers never approach as he wrote page after page of lucid, and nearly flawless prose; but there is a touch of tragedy in his skill, because each original book is only written once, and prose alone is not enough to make a novel interesting.Mister Talarigo's choice of a plotless narrative approach may work well in some rarefied world of literary thought, or in a classroom, but in the real world of real readers, when it is used to evoke forty years of vaguely malign captivity, the end result is magnificent and dull.."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"The Pearl Diver, even the name of the book evokes mystery and a visual sense of something special, is a somber but lyrical story of a young pearl diver in Japan who is suddenly stricken with the socially stigmatizing disease of Leprosy.Throughout this book one is reminded of the isolation of people with Leprosy, and how they were cast out of society and sent to live on islands and leprosariums so they wouldn't spread he 'filthy' disease.This story outlines from beginning to end such a Leper Colonly and the changes throughout the sanitarium's history who's standards at times are beastly and inhumaneThis was a good story - refreshing in it's honesty and sombering in it's subject. One can only shudder now, while imagining living with such a disease in the middle of the last century-with it's rules and regulations on how to deal with a little understood disease. I learned a lot about the recent history of Leprosy in this book as it outlines almost to present day the battles fought to bring civility to the subject of Leprosy and the medicines invented and used to treat and prevent it.The writing is very good and I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"The author writes to make the reader feel what he is describing. The cold chill of the water, the panicky excitement of rushing from the bottom of the sea to reach the surface where a gulp of air awaits, the meals eaten, the clothing worn. It just makes you feel as if you are in this village, living among these people. The transition for the main character between diving for pearls to being forced into exile from everyone she's ever known is swift, the reader barely realizes what has happened before we are reading about the horrors of living with a contagious disease in 1948. One day she was a friend, a sister a daughter, a pearl diver. The next day, she was no-one. Stripped of her name, her family, her village, even her personal items to live on an island with people who are all afflicted with the same disease. A disease that I would guess many people do not know much about and probably have no idea isolation camps such as this ever existed. The main character is likeable and we even learn a little about the Japanese culture during this trying time. I definitely recommend this book, I found it very easy to pick up and become immediately engrossed in the storyline.This is a book that explores the question of what a person becomes after having been stripped of everything: name, family and function, privacy and freedom. The authors answer is that we are saved not by what we are but who we are, the part of us that exists within the flesh, that is capable of transcendence."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"The style of this book is a bit unique to me, set up with an \\"artifacts\\" beginning in each chapter, along with the story of what the artifact meant...

Furthering their isolation and cast-off status, they are forbidden to go to the mainland, the leprosarium has its own currency, and they are stricken from family records- even forced to take a new name.Through all the trials, Ms. Fuji, becomes a caretaker, a listening ear, a sympathetic voice, and a victim. Her disease is halted by medicines, but the stigma of leprosy follows her wherever she goes.Across the years on the island, she is confronted with the horrors of suicide, death, abortions, forced sterilizations, and the most crushing of all- isolation.We are treated to snippets of her life, pieces frozen in time, and as such are able to peel the story back- layer by layer.

It's down to earth, straight forward and never glossed over. It is often sad and sometimes even a bit gross but the story is a historical peek into a world few know about, that of what many would term a \\"leper colony\\". On a side note, such colonies may be a thing of the past in many areas, but this sort of ostracizing is still rampant in some areas of the world despite the availability of a cure.My main complaint about this book is Talarigo's frequent disregard for sentence structure. It is not uncommon for a writer to take a bit of artistic license using incomplete sentences for impact, but only sparingly. I found Talarigo's all too frequent use of this technique distracting and I felt that it only took away from the depth of the story rather than creating that impact and depth it is most often used for.Also, it lacked feeling, as if Talarigo was simply telling the facts of story without inflicting emotion upon it. The opportunity for depth and heartbreak in this story was lost. There was little bonding with the characters and no real immersion into the story. It was simply told and, while it felt realistic, the heart wrenching aspect I expected was absent. Despite a number of sad events, this is not the type of book that brought tears to my eyes."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"Author Jeff Talarigo pulls off a pretty impressive feat with his first novel, \\"The Pearl Diver\\". He has managed to tell a story of Japan in English that has the feel of a Japanese novel. The understated style, the simple prose, the melancholy tone, are all aspects of Japanese literature that I love, and are the hardest part of Western writers to emulate. Its Western/Eastern mix feels a lot like a Kazuo Ishiguro novel, specificallyNever Let Me Go.The title and cover are a little misleading. The naked woman sitting on the boat never appears in the novel, and the actual pearl diving takes up very little of the story. This is the story of a disease, leprosy, and how it affected the lives of those unfortunates who carried it. Taking place over the course of several decades from early post-war to the 1980s, \\"The Pearl Diver\\" is far from a sweeping epic. However, it is an intimate story of a young woman who becomes an old woman, all within the tiny confines of a small island where sufferers of leprosy were isolated.\\"The Pearl Diver\\" is a historical fiction novel, and none of the characters or artifacts are real. Some things, such as the setting of Nagashima Leprosarium, are real however, and lend an air of authenticity to the story.One of the things I loved most about this book was the realism. Characters were not artificially thrust into major world events, and in fact remained almost ignorant of the outside world. Their island not only provided safety from the infectious disease for the rest of Japan, but was also a safe haven for those whom society judged as shameful and cursed. Juxtaposed with artifacts recovered from an abandoned facility, these are the lives and deaths of the afflicted and scorned, who sought to scratch out what happiness they could.Japan has had a long, sad history with leprosy. The laws portrayed in this novel were only repealed in 1996, and Prime Minister Koizumi didn't offer an official government apology until 2001. Whereas most countries abandoned leper laws and quarantine when cures and prevention methods became common place in the 1940s, Japan continued its unnecessary policies including isolation and eugenics such as forced abortions and sterilizations."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"While initially reading the overview of this book I knew it was for me; I love historical fiction. I liked the beginning and had no trouble getting into the story but before long my expectations were greatly lowered. I didn't like the format; it was too disjointed for me. Talarigo told the story through numbered artifacts which interrupted the flow. Many of these \\"blurbs\\" were uninteresting and not pertinent to the story.Some of the characteristics of leprosy, such as losing feeling in the extremities, were presented and repeated way too many times as if the reader would forget and needed reminding after the first couple of times it was mentioned. I felt like saying \\"I get it already\\"!I don't recommend this book for more sensitive readers; there are graphic descriptions of not only the more unpleasant aspects of leprosy, but also of abortion.I don't regret reading it, mostly for the historical value. It does make you want to delve further into the subject and history of leprosy."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"This book touches on a subject considered by many cultures as taboo to even talk about. This book takes you into a journey of suffering and hardship followed by acceptance and insights. Well written. This book is a great vacation read. Didn't want to put it down. Makes you stop and see life from a different view and appreciate life more. Recommended reading."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"The plot of this lovely, multi-layered book is simple enough: in 1948, a 16-year old Japanese pearl diver is diagnosed with leprosy and is banished to Nagashima, an island leper colony where with few exceptions, she spends the remainder of her days. Leprosy is so terrifying a disease that society shuns the victims, who are seen to have shamed their families by falling sick. Shunning is lifelong. Dead to her family and her past, the girl must chose a new name. Like the other patients she has no surname, no nickname or any identity other than as a leper. She becomes Miss Fuji. She begins as a caregiver to the most afflicted and ends as a 'nurse' assisting the meager medical staff.On the one hand, the book is a history of the changing attitude toward leprosy and on the other Miss Fuji's changing attitude towards herself. It is discovered to be a bacterial infection, slow to transmit and possible to treat. Miss Fuji is fortunate because she qualifies for the daily doses of promin, administered through re-used needles roughly sharpened between each dose. The drug arrests the disease and keeps her from becoming disfigured. Despite the medical advances, the lepers remain isolated, with the minimum of care and all work done by the patients. Men are sterilized and any pregnancy is aborted--often brutally. Bandages are reused and in short supply. Miss Fuji, is her relatively unmarked condition, considers herself not quite one of \\"them\\" and dreams of returning to diving, which she loves, and to the freedom of a normal life away from the colony. As decades pass, the disease is better understood, the lepers better treated and the freedom that calls to Miss Fuji becomes possible. Whether or not the freedom can extend to the woman Miss Fuji has become is less certain.Talarigo won an American Institute of Arts & Letters prize in 2005 for this, his first novel. The tone is much like -- but not quite -- in the same tone as Japanese writers, which is a very spare, elegant style of inference and delicacy. I don't think Talarigo quite manages that, but the indirection and the style of letting the point make itself, without special emphasis, is close. He follows the changes in the history of leprosy treatment through the exemplar of Nagashima very well. He is a little less successful in the emotional growth of a young, nearly illiterate girl coping with the horrors of her life. On the other hand, some of the other characters in the book are described beautifully, with some succumbing to the emotional and mental numbness that is a physical characteristic of the disease --and others returning to their basic humanity and demand for dignity.Any criticism I have is faint. For an American man, albeit married to a Japanese woman, to make the journey into the culture of Japan and further still into the distance any society puts between itself and a horrible disease (which Talarigo hints is not unlike the world's current view of AIDS) and then to frame it from the view of a young girl who must change into a woman is an exceptional achievement. This is a tight and spare novel which despite never quite reaching the lyrical, is a book you will end up remembering and thinking about well after the last page."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"On Shodo Island in 1948, a girl dreams suddenly end. Once she dreamed of pearl diving, the one place where she was herself as she escaped the expectations of her family. In a moment, her entire life is gone. The appearance of two small spots brings shame to her family and lessens their social and economic position. The young girl goes into hiding only to be arrested and removed from society by laws meant to isolate the contagious disease of leprosy. Transported to a remote and isolated area, the Nagashima leprosarium, she must forget everything: her past, her family and even her name, a name now erased from the family records She must choose a new name for her new life. Her past is now dead. Stripped of everything she ever knew, the woman begins her life anew known as Miss Fuji. Although new drug discoveries arrest the disease, she lives out her life helping other patients, massaging them and caring for those more harmed than her. Through reaching out to the other patients, she rediscovers the part within herself that yearns for freedom and connection.Jeff Talarigo's THE PEARL DIVER looks into the life of a leper colony in Japan through the cataloguing of the artifacts left behind for posterity. Through the artifacts, the life of Miss Fujii emerges. Each artifact has a story to tell. Some tell of the advancement of history. Others items tell of the horrifying cruel effects on patients as Japan's Leprosy Prevention laws encourage not only the segregation of patients sanitariums where forced sterilization and abortions are routine. Some items as simple as a teacup, a map, a badge or a tide table leave behind evidence and stories of compassion and community between the patients. Although THE PEARL DIVER clues the reader into some of the political realities of Japan's policy towards leprosy and the political figures on the outside of the sanitarium, THE PEARL DIVER focuses on the intimate details of the inner life of the patients and their isolated world. Prefaced and postcripted by life after the height of the sanitarium's activity, the artifacts remaining provide the heart of a inner transformation that is both inner within the life of a secluded woman and also a life that expands outward beyond herself through sometimes quiet but daring actions. THE PEARL DIVER explores solitude and community, isolation, and the bridges individuals create between one another. Jeff Talarigo's prose has an elegance in its beautiful, emotional simplicity and precisely connected images. An image of a map becomes the map of not only a place but an inner journey.The rich character of Miss Fuji creates a very emotional story. Her innocence makes one feel the shock of isolation, her compassion towards others inspire, and her yearning to reach beyond her world uplifts. Once a young diver challenging herself to the depth in her pearl diving, she now faces other challenges, challenges that make her into the woman she becomes through her actions day in, day out. At times heart-breaking and thought-provoking, THE PEARL DIVER is a novel that leaves the reader with a sense of hope.If the topic of leprosy makes you shy away from this book, don't let it. The most shocking elements of this story do not center around grotesque descriptions of the disease but rather the treatment of the patients by those responsible for their care. Certainly, Jeff Talarigo does not sanitize the difficulties of Hansen's disease itself, but in the midst of the disease and isolation, the actions outsiders responsible for the patients' health and welfare are by far the most harrowing aspects of the novel. In the midst of this cruelty, THE PEARL DIVER looks into the humanity of the patients and the interconnections between them. THE PEARL DIVER is a novel that looks into the worst of humanity and yet leaves the reader with an inspiring hope both individual and a hope lived through history."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"Upon admission to Nagashima, the Japanese \\"Island of Shame\\", patients were stripped of their clothing, their name and their past. \\"The Pearl Diver\\" relates the story of a woman who does not allow the diagnosis of leprosy to strip her of her dignity or her desire to be free within the confines of the institution and the societal zeitgeist. The themes of finding life in a place of death, community, the overriding desire to be known, caring, cared for and remembered are not new but are woven into a narrative that is fresh, multi-layered and powerful. As a novel, it can be easily read in a single setting. It also offers many images and phrases for long term reflective contemplation."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"In 1948, Jeff Talarigo's 19-year-old protagonist, a pearl diver in the Seto Inland Sea, is diagnosed with leprosy. Her symptoms are nothing more than two small, red patches on her forearm and back, but she's immediately whisked away to Japan's leper colony on nearby Nagashima Island, where she's cruelly stripped of her identity, her individuality, and her integrity.There, Miss Fuji, along with the hundreds of other lepers at Nagashima, lives in squalor, sleeping on dirty, bug-infested futons, working all day to help sustain the very leprosarium imprisoning her. Daily, she witnesses both the passive apathy of her keepers and, sometimes, their cold, hard cruelty.As the least sick of the patients there, she also becomes a sort of caretaker for the rest of them, many of them ravaged beyond repair by their shared disease. Eventually, her sustained relative health becomes a double-edged sword: she's grateful for it, but it also makes her feel even less like she belongs on Nagashima. She's stagnating there, and she knows it.Jeff Talarigo has created a beautifully intimate portrait of loss, grief, strength and acceptance. His world, fully realized in simple but lyrical prose, feels completely organic, and his characters authentic in their mutual tragedy. The Pearl Diver is a tribute to the human spirit, an elegy to dreams deferred, and a gorgeous story waiting to be heard by all."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"I enjoy reading fictional books that portray the way people really behaved throughout history, even though they can be somewhat depressing. This story takes place in post-war Japan, and the central character is a young girl who is diagnosed with leprosy. Instead of receiving love and support from those who have been in her life, the 19 yr old is shunned and exiled to a colony. Even though medication helps her, she can't return to her previous life as a pearl diver. She is known as Miss Fuji, and during a visit from her uncle, you learn why Mount Fuji was important to them both, and the special birthday surprises he plans for her afterwards.I'm ashamed to say that I can't even imagine being able to be so kind to the other patients. I understand why she eventually felt more at home at the colony, but I wish she had made a different choice at the end. It's rare to find real people with that kind of inner strength, at least, in my opinion. However, despite my reservations, I wouldn't mistreat a family member the way her older sister does - it's the uneducated stereotyping that cause the backlash (ex: bringing shame on the family).I think Talarigo did an excellent job writing this book, but I only gave it four stars because I don't think I could read such a sad book more than once. I also agree with other reviewers that the point-of-view and timeline are a bit choppy.I don't think I've felt this sad after a story, since I readThe Pearl: (Centennial Edition). (Completely different stories, but both sad portrayals of human nature.) The only bright spot for me was the identity of the young nurse in the epilogue."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"This Book Has Haunted Me and I can't wait until his next book comes out.

It truly takes you back. I can not believe this was his first novel. Can not wait till his next."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"\\"The Pearl Diver,' is a debut novel set in 1948 Japan. It's written by an American, Jeff Talarigo, who has been living in Japan, on the island of Kyushu with his wife and son, writing and teaching English since the early 1990s. The novel gives us such a clear, sweeping, yet particular view of Japan at that time, and at that particular place, that I find it hard to believe it's not written by a Japanese, but by an outsider - who evidently did a ton of research.It concerns a nineteen-year old Inland Sea pearl diver whose life as a free woman, loving the sea, is ended by the discovery that she has leprosy. By law, she is quarantined, sent to an island sanatorium where she is stripped of her dignity, her clothing, and her name. Her family is deeply shamed by her; they disown her, erase her name from family records, and must move and take a new name, too: her sister is never able to marry. The pearl fisher must choose a new island name, and becomes Miss Fuji. Modern drugs contain the disease, but she is not allowed to leave the island: instead, as she is not contagious, she becomes a caretaker for other patients.The story of the pearl diver is a fiction that reminds me strongly of the true story of Mary Mallon, who has gone down in American history and legend as Typhoid Mary. Mallon (1869-1938) was born in Co. Tyrone, Ireland, and immigrated to the United States alone, without family, at fifteen years of age, in 1884. Like most Irishwomen who immigrated at that time, she went into domestic service, and soon became a cook, as she had a knack for it, and it paid better than other domestic employment. She worked many places; apparently cooks' jobs at the time were short-lived. She infected 47 people with typhoid, three of whom died. She was, it appears, the first known healthy carrier of a disease: medicine had not even been aware that there could be such a thing, but she made them think about it. So she was suspected of being a carrier. She denied it vehemently, insisting she did not have typhoid, never had had (she might have been born with the disease, as her mother had it at Mary's birth). That she was being picked on because she was a powerless young woman alone, without influence, family or friends: only a boyfriend.Mallon was held in quarantine for three years on North Brother Island, in the East River, off the Bronx. A new health commissioner then freed her, on condition she never work as a cook again. So she got work as a laundress, but it didn't pay enough, and, under the name \\"Mary Brown,\\" she began cooking again at a women's hospital. There was more typhoid, and one death. She was found out, and this time became notorious as \\"Typhoid Mary,\\" a name she abhorred, always insisting her name was Mary Mallon. Even her boyfriend was apparently dead, or, at any rate, gone: she was sent out to North Brother Island again, and never left, for 23 years. She began caring for other patients: she was called \\"nurse\\" from 1922; she was called a \\"hospital helper\\" from 1925. Eventually, she worked in the hospital laboratory. At her death at age 69, it was found she was still carrying the disease. She was cremated, and buried at Saint Raymond's, in The Bronx.The story of \\"Miss Fuji,\\" the former pearl diver, is intrinsically powerful, as is \\"Typhoid Mary's.\\" The author has told it with great attention to detail, great knowledge of the history of leprosy, and the flora and fauna of the time and place. He gives us an up-close, intimate view of the leprosarium where \\"Miss Fuji\\" is confined, the kindness and bravery of some of the patients, the cruelty of some of the officials. Not to put too fine a point on it, I loved it, and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"I very mush enjoyed this book. It was a new subject for me. I didn't know much about leprosy and how it was treated in Japan in 1948. You are sent away and considered to have shamed your family. You have no frther contact with them.It's like a Holocaust concentration camp. You are given a number and you are to forget your past. You may choose a new name and our character a 16yr old girl chose Miss Fuji since it was a good childhood memory.She has to do horrible duties that are hearbreaking that no one should ever have to do. thru it all she remains a positive person and encouraging to others. She is about helpng others and takes into accout how they feel.She does take risks and leaves the island at nights somtimes and swims to the mainland. After a time she is caught and punished. She makes friends with a boy and girll she waves at across the water, carves them little soap shells and leaves them on the rocks at night. Even though it is just waves they share a bond is formed that will really be special later in the book.Jeff Talarico is a gifted writer and has a beautiful way with words. I was drawn in on page one. I loved the ending it was tender and sweet. Nothing like I thought it would be but a wonderful way to tie it all together. I highly recommend this fine work."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"This is about a young pearl diver, who at age 19 learns that she has leprosy. She is--in effect--banished to an island leprosarium. He family suffers deep shame, her sister's engagement is broken off by the fiance's family. You'd think she had been caught as a serial axe-murderer. At the leprosarium on Nagashima (I won't say Nagashima Island, since \\"shima\\" means island) the patients are forbidden to leave. They must change their names, and be reborn into an oppressive environment. Eventually, policies do change, but having leprosy in 1948 Japan was in many ways only modestly different from being a leper in the middle ages or in Biblical times (but one of the differences is less personal freedom, at least initially).The heart of the book concerns life on Nagashima. People are allowed to marry, but only if they agree to sterilization. The pearl diver--who now calls herself Miss Fuji, is more enterprising than the other patients (victims would be a better word), and without giving away too much is also a skilled swimmer. This heart of the book is very episodic. Many of the episodes are directly experienced by Miss Fuji, but others are completely out of her sight--but even these relate to her in one way or another. Some examples: \\"ARTIFACT Number 1002: a pair of rubber boots\\". \\"ARTIFACT Number 0638: A Teacup\\". \\"ARTIFACT NUmber 1609: A wheelchair\\". Each bit is a story--some are very short, most run several pages or more. These show aspects of life--usually Miss Fuji's life--on Nagashima. Some are very interesting, others are less so--it seems a bit uneven at times.The book gives a fine view of the life on Nagashima and of Japanese culture and society. You certainly get a well-drawn picture of a side of society that most Japanese at that time were happier pretending did not exist. For another book--set in medieval coastal Japan, I'd strongly recommend Shipwrecks by Akira Yoshimura. The contrasts portrayed in the two books--and in some ways the lack of contrasts between medieval Japan and 1948 Japan--are fascinating."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"She is the youngest pearl diver - until the day that she cuts a spot on her arm and learns that she has leprosy. Taken to the nearest leper colony by police who are afraid even to come close to her, she loses her clothing, her money, her right to vote and even her name. Henceforth she will be known as Miss Fuji. Miss Fuji is one of the \\"lucky\\" ones, developing leprosy just as the first effective treatment for this ancient disease comes into use. As we examine the few artifacts that remain from Miss Fuji's resulting long life, we simultaneously examine issues like lifelong confinement of patients long after such confinement is no longer a medical necessity, the forced abortions and sterilizations in the name of Eugenics & Social Darwinism, and social discrimination so complete that even a patient's own family will completely abandon them.Hansen's Disease (leprosy) is one of the oldest and most feared diseases known to mankind. Leprosariums - leper colonies intended to isolate patients from society - still exist in many places in the world, including the US. Some of them do (or have in the past) issue special money for use by the patients, just as Miss Fuji does. In his presentation of Miss Fuji's life, Talarigo has done a masterful job of presenting some of the toughest issues in medicine in a compelling and thought-provoking manner.Suitable for teens."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"\\"The Pearl Diver\\" was a sad read - it tells the story of a nineteen-year-old girl whose dreams of being a good pearl diver are shattered when she finds out she has leprosy and her life changes irrevocably. Soon she is ostracised by her family, is forced to change her name [Ms Fuji] and finds herself living in a leper colony on the island of Nagashima. Despite the immense feeling of abandonment, Ms Fuji does make a life for herself under painful circumstances and her inner strength shines through in this novel.What was so tragic about this story is the very realistic portrayal of how lepers were treated back during more ignorant times - lepers were treated like dirt and many suffered disgraceful humiliations at the hands of their own family members, those who were supposed to show more empathy and provide emotional support. It really shows us what ignorance can do to the innocent.I highly recommend this book to those who love historical fiction and human dramas."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"In which a 19 YO Japanese peal diver is diagnosed with leprosy and herded off to an island leper colony in the years just after WWII. Very sad. I was taken aback by the sheer vehemence of the families of most of the people diagnosed with leprosy -- they basically disowned these people, simply for having a disease. Many of hte family members were angry at them for contracting the disease, and all were pretty much erases from society, to the point that they chose new names for themselves on the island. I can't even imagine how I would respond to that."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"From Publishers Weekly:This unusual debut novel set in 1940s postwar Japan renders brutality and intolerance in quiet, lyrical prose. When a 19-year-old pearl diver, the youngest of a crew working the Seto Inland Sea, discovers she is sick with leprosy, she is banished to Nagashima, an island leprosarium, where she is told to change her name and forget her past. Nagashima is its own kind of civilization, where the renamed \\"Miss Fuji\\" must care for the sicker patients, which includes helping the island doctors perform forced, often late-term abortions. Treated with drugs that make her isolation unnecessary, Miss Fuji remains healthy (\\"she has only the two spots on her body.... Medals or curses, she isn't sure how to wear them\\"), but she is still not permitted to leave and remains a captive for most of her life. The novel is divided into three sections, with the middle (and by far most substantial) section revealing its story through artifacts, as each object evokes a haunting, smaller story. At times the characters are drawn as artifacts themselves, with strained, wooden dialogue (\\"You deserve to be with all these freaks here.\\" \\"There are no freaks here, only people who are sick\\"). As if to mimic his protagonist's bracketed sense of time, Talarigo details minute scenes and interactions, then jumps decades ahead. It's an effect that de-emphasizes his dramatic subject matter and allows the emotional consequences of the situation to surface in unexpected ways, as when Miss Fuji finds solace in watching children playing on a nearby shore. Drawing from actual medical history, Talarigo succeeds in telling a compelling story whose strength is its elegant simplicity.Copyright Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The story is set in post-war Japan and spans 40 + decades of the life of a 19-year old pearl diver who is diagnosed with leprosy and is exiled to a leper colony on a small island not far from where she grew up (she can see her hometown island from her new home, Nagashima). She must change her name and takes on \\"Miss Fuji\\" for the island she climbed when she was 9 with her Uncle.Her leprosy is a mild case and she is able to remain relatively healthy compared to the other patients on the island. She struggles to accept her new life and especially the loss of her diving which she loves more than anything. While she makes some friends and becomes quite useful on the island; eventually becoming a nurse there, her longing for her beloved diving never ends.Talarigo does a wonderful job of letting the reader feel Miss Fuji's full range emotions from anger to sorrow, to longing, and even that of joy and hope. She is a complicated character with contradictory feelings about things and people (like real people do) and I found that added much to being able to relate to her and feeling empathy for her.Although this is a relatively short book, only 237 pages, it is not a light read. There are many themes to explore and consider, it would make a very good selection for a book club."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"This story is about a young woman that is a pearl diver.

I learned just how cruel life could be for a person suffering from leprosy in the mid-1900's. But the book isn't all tragedy. Even with the prospect of a lifetime of being rejected and mistreated by \\"normal\\" people (even the doctors could sometimes be quite cruel), she often rose to the challenge by putting others' needs ahead of her own, and proving that a person's happiness is determined more by his/her attitude than by circumstance. This was quite inspiring to me.I would only offer one caveat. Some of the subject matter might be a bit mature for some children; there were a few times it dealt with sexual situations of everyday life. I didn't think it was crude, but some parents may want to read the book first before offering it to their children."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"Like everyone else, I ordered this book because I thought leprosy would be an interesting theme in a novel.What I wasn't expecting was the exotic feeling from reading the book. The book feels very Japanese in tone, not just setting. The story itself hints and puzzles--doesn't answer all your questions about either characters or the leprosy colony. It's a book that leaves you hungry for more--a frustrating and yet intriguing technique that you rarely get in a novel. I liked this feeling until I turned the page and the book was over. Then I wished for just a little more..."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"A really great book is one that stays with you after you finish it. This is such a book. The story is at once tragic and uplifting. I found it hard to remember that it was fiction. It most certainly captured the authenticity of the time and circumstances and the author's empathy for his characters make each one a living person. It is at once a historical novel and a social expose'. While it's easy to condemn the Japanese government for their treatment of lepers in the \\"modern\\" world of the mid 20th century, I found myself thinking about my own instinctive reactions if I had been in that time and place. The fear of not knowing exactly how you could contract it, if it could be transmitted through food or airborne, the knowledge that if you or a loved one became infected it was a virtual death sentence. It also made me think of the people I knew with AIDS when it first became a major health issue: how the lack of any proven knowledge, the fear of infection, and the ensuing condemnation of those who contracted it was very much the same kind of cultural attitude.The story is simple and clean, rich with detail that makes the time and place come alive but without weighting the reader down under wordy descriptions. An excellent bedtime read or for travel or vacation since it is relatively short and flows smoothly.Miss Fuji's story is told is a manner both thought provoking and entertaining. I would recommend this book for men and women alike and is not a children's book in any respect. As for young adults, I would have let my daughters read it as teens, but would caution others that there is some disturbing content that may not be right for all but the most mature teens. An older adult should read it first. It would be a great piece of literature for some open discussions on a variety of obvious topics as well as social banishment, suicide, abortion, and death."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"I loved the start of this book and found it odd that people as late as 1947 were thrust from family and quite literally erased from life with a stroke of the pen. Leprosy must have been a curse that friends and villagers found intolerable. I found the central person to be a proud and a private person. I think a lot of interesting parts had been glossed over, but this is my opinion only. Otherwise an intersting story of human interest."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"I truly loved this book. The writing is like poetry, and I felt completely immersed in the story. The story begins with a young girl who works as a pearl diver in Japan at the end of World War II.

She loses her entire identity, yet she remains hopeful and positive and builds a new life for herself, given the situation she has been dealt. The way lepers were treated during this time, is shocking. She chooses the name Miss Fuji for herself in the leper colony, to spare her family the humiliation of having any ties to her. As she spends her life in the leper colony, we are shown around through various relics, each part of the book being loosely tied to these relics. Despite the horrors she experienced, I could not help but come away from this book feeling uplifted. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"This book is just so sad. I found it hard to believe that people were really treated like this late in the 20th century, so I did a little research and found that Japan did treat those who contracted leprosy very unfairly.This is from an article from BBC News: \\"An inquiry into Japan's treatment of thousands of leprosy sufferers has concluded that the government committed an unprecedented abuse of human rights. A panel was set up in 2002 to look into why leprosy patients were quarantined up to 1996, despite the fact the disease is not highly contagious. It found that the health ministry kept up the practice of isolation partly to secure continued funding................ it was reported that the government panel also found that for a period of 30 years up to at least the 1950s, the babies of hundreds of leprosy patients held in sanatoriums were deliberately killed by medical staff.\\"I personally don't care for the style in which this book was written. It contains a good story but is told in such a manner that it is hard to follow."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"*No plot will be revealed in this review*The author has such an incredible ability to weave a story that you can imagine yourself experiencing what the heroine of this story \\"Miss Fuji\\" was experiencing. What seems like a small book, each chapter was packed with a punch so huge that I was taken back with the emotion, the life changing events for a person who is discovered with leprosy living in Japan in the 1940's. A reflection of how we in society could judge a human being and treat them so cruelly due to ignorance. The simplicity of this story and how the heroine rises above the prejudices and her lot in life are truely astounding.I loved this book for the story telling, an insight of history and to learn how we can be a better society in treating our fellow men. I applaud this book for addressing this topic; although a disease well managed now; I am no sure we have really changed our views and improved our tolerances with all the new and modern diseases."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"This book leaves me feeling heavy with sadness, Miss Fuji who seemed to have lived a whole lifetime without getting to really live one day. Disease is powerful, human fear is more so. I am glad I read the Pearl Diver, being one of those books that makes you happy for the life you have and maybe appreciate it just a little bit more than you did before."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"This story is about a nineteen-year-old in Japan in 1948 who is diagnosed with leprosy. She was a pearl diver, and now she is sent away to live out the rest of her life in a leprosarium on an island. Her name is erased from family records, and she is forced to choose a new name on arrival.It was...OK. It was interesting from a historical standpoint, but I didn't feel any deep attachment to the characters (including the main character - the girl who has become Miss Fuji). I liked how the author uses \\"artifacts\\" (I don't know if any of them are real or not - I'm sure some are created.) to move the story. For example: \\"Artifact Number 0488 - A Japanese Communist party badge\\" moved into a small story piece about how the patients started a small uprising to show that they didn't like their treatment.If the goal of the story was to get me interesting in learning more about the possibility of this in history - then it succeeded. If the goal was to leave me feeling like I was involved with the characters, then it did not."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"This book can be summed up in a few short sentences. A Japanese girl who works as a pearl diver (a difficult job, but she loves it) contracts leprosy and is sent to a sanitorium on an island. Conditions are bad there and she is not allowed to leave. She works as a nurse for other patients and becomes friendly with some of them. Over time, some conditions improve, but she dies on the island. That's it, there really isn't much more to the story than that. We hardly get to know the protagonist, and she doesn't develop realationships with others that we really care about as readers. This novel seems to rely completly on the fact that it is exposing the stomach-turning details of leprosly, as if that alone is enough to keep the plot going. And sometimes the logic of the plot suffers so that more gruesome details can be exploited. For instance, people who marry are forced to undergo sterilization, but a newly married couple's baby is aborted at 8 1/2 months. Why didn't that couple get sterilized, too? I found the descriptions of rat-eaten fingers and late-term abortions too gruesome and would have stopped reading the book in the first third if I hadn't wanted to finish it for my book group. Overall, this is the worst novel I have read in a long time. If you want to learn about leprosy, read a non-fiction book. The story in this one is just not good enough to waste your time on."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"This book is beautifully written, and full of life, but they lost me when the descriptions of people's fingers being eaten by rats at night!"},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"In this quietly moving novel of a young woman's life on the leper's island of Nagashima, Talarigo speaks of horror with tenderness, of dreams interrupted, families who disown the contaminated, condemning them to a slow death in isolation. Even though a cure is found in the 1940's, the officials refuse to release those patients whose disease can be controlled, fearing a public outcry. Consequently, the lepers remain on the island, sharing their stories, skills and incredible generosity. Voiceless in a society that will not hear them; the lepers comfort each other, compassionate in a world that has none for themThe story begins on the leper's island of Nagashima in 1948, where a young woman stands at the base of the suicide cliff. There desperate bodies have cast themselves into oblivion rather than face the empty years ahead. She looks across the sea, where the pearl divers begin their daily diving adventures, a life she once shared. Her disease has not progressed; in fact, there is medication to impede the progress of the disease. Still a young woman, \\"Miss Fuji\\" has only her memories of diving, deeper and deeper into the comforting silence of the sea.Miss Fuji gives daily massages to the other lepers, cataloging their loss of fingers and toes, the result of an absence of nerve endings, causing frequent damage to limbs. At night the patients take turns, rotating watches in their vigilance against rats that nibble at the fingers and toes of sleeping victims. The pearl diver swims in at night to surrounding islands, her secret rebellion, where children play during the day. As the years pass, and the lepers are fractionally integrated into society, Miss Fuji is tethered to the only home she has really known, tethered by her heart and her emotions. Freedom is a concept she nurtures in her soul, preserving her private dignity.The young woman and the people she has come to know so well make a livable space where the life is unlivable, where death and decay permeate the air, poisoning hope. For all their deformities, their insides shine with a light that cannot be extinguished. In the Japanese manner, the dying create a shrine to life: asked to be complicit in horror, they find whatever small redemption is possible, forming a spiritual chain to one another.The Pearl Diver is a small but powerful testimony to the best qualities of humankind. With the precision of a calligrapher, the author pays homage to the pearl diver and the other shadowy figures that live and die on the island. The image of the pearl diver remains, washed in the dulcet tones of the past; her interminable kindness from inside the heart of isolation suggests the true nature of humanity in adversity.

She is disowned, and banished to a leprosorium. Forced to chose a new identity, as &quot;Miss Fuji&quot; she cares for other more severely affected patients.The bulk of the story is told from her perspective, as she looks through objects found in the closed leprosorium.The writing is beautiful, and instantly transports you to another world.Every word is carefully, sparely placed.The author's powers of description, and ability to create mood are remarkable.Savor reading this, do not skim.Amazing that this is a first novel!I am recommending this to everyone I know, and plan to discuss this with my book clubs.This book feels inspired by one of my favorite books of all time, The Samurai's Garden by Gail Tsukiyama."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"This is one of the most hauntingly beautiful books I have read. Talarigo's voice is fresh, unique and with bold simple strokes creates a rich tapestry of lives with all their strengths, frailities but above all it's their basic humanity that touches one deeply. It's a sad to think that all one reader got out of the book was &quot;It's a little gross,&quot; I wonder why they even felt compelled to write such a comment. I read the galley several months ago and could not wait for it's actual release so that I could share this novel with friends. This is the loveliest book you will read this summer and one that will stay with you for a long time."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"Talarigo has captured both the horrendous pain of the enslaved leprosy patients (try googling \\"Japan +leprosy\\" for historical context) and the will to overcome oppression in this story of a pearl diver with leprosy. The protagonist has a streak of rebellious independence, which combined with her hope for life outside the leprosorium, guides her through decades of abuse. A must read!"},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"A beautiful first novel - Miss Fuji is a character to remember. Quiet, haunting, reflective, soulful are just a few words to describe this deeply telling and touching book. The ending is unforgettable - you will want to read this book in one sitting."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"She's a nineteen year old Japanese girl beginning her dream career--pearl diver. It's a grueling job, diving for pearls, but one she wouldn't trade for anything else. Then the spots appear--first one on her forearm, then another on her back. She gets a deep cut on her forearm while diving, but doesn't feel the pain or the blood that flows from the gash. When she finally goes to a doctor, he renders the worst diagnosis she could hear in Japan at that place and time--leprosy.She's taken into custody and moved to an isolated leprosarium which is itself isolated on an island. She is stripped of her identity for she is now a source of shame to her family and her nation. She has no family, no past. She's forced to choose a new name and begin a new life with a new family--patients forced into isolation just like her. The leprosarium is a harsh place, breaking the spirit of most who enter here.\\"The Pearl Diver\\" examines the effect this type of enforced community has on individuals who still see themselves as people even though their society tells them they are not. The long-term effects are shown through Miss Fuji, the young pearl diver, as the story progresses through the years.My biggest problem with the book was keeping track of the timeline. It was difficult at times to figure out how much time had actually passed; how old Miss Fuji now was, how long she had been on the island. But overall, Jeff Talarigo's novel is a walk alongside a young Japanese girl as she is forced to live out a life she never wanted, in a society that considers her untouchable. As the years pass and the fear and loathing of leprosy subsides, will Miss Fuji be able to make the change as well?"},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"This is a novel of a young woman whose life was completely transformed upon diagnosis of leprosy. She was disowned by family and sent off to live with other in exile as they awaited death. They lost their identity, their familiarity of life and most of the sens of belonging.Even after a cure was found in the 1940's this young woman and her fellow captives were banned from leaving the island due to possible public outcry. They remained on the island and formed a family of sorts depending upon one another for friendship, fellowship and intimacy.The book begins on the leper's island of Nagashima in 1948, where \\"Miss Fuji\\" - (the name she gave herself upon stepping onto the island) - stands at the base of the suicide cliff. She glances across the sea, longingly seeking the sights of where pearl divers begin their daily diving adventures.Freedom has come to represent an inner self that she expounds in her massages given to other lepers at this cast away island. Death and decay are prevalent to many that medication cannot help and she talks to these individuals with voice, a simple touch and a knowledge of deep compassion for fellow human beings. She creates a shrine to life and even when forced to become part of death to those unborn, she rises above the callous feelings of the doctors and nurses to assist those in need.This is a very powerful work on how humankind can benefit from each other in times of crisis and times of misunderstanding. Those that live and die on the island are given new life by the author, and expound through the book as kindness, generosity and love from a simple Pearl Diver, no known as Miss Fuji. She is no longer bound by water surrounding the island, for she has risen above the pain and suffering through he struggles and small victories over ignorance of her disease."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"Unlike a lot of people living today, I don't have a hard time imagining what it must be like living in a leper colony. Vesta and I lived on a sailboat for about a dozen years in the Caribbean. During the safe months, we'd mostly spend our time anchored off the French side of St. Martin or, if we wanted some peace and quiet, at Ballast Bay on the southern side of St. Kitts. But during hurricane season we'd sail south to Trinidad or Venezuela where hurricanes don't blow and one of our favorite anchorages was a small deserted island between them called Chacachacare, which used to be a leper colony.We'd often go ashore and explore the hospital or the nun's quarters or the old auditorium, the doctor's houses, the small houses the lepers who didn't have to be hospitalized lived in, the generator room. It was a small community on a small island, away from and out of sight of the population of Trinidad.So in reading this book I had a pretty good picture in my head about living life as a leper on a small island within view of the mainland, though Trinidad and Venezuela were not within a swimmer's reach from Chacachacare as Nagashima is from Shodo in this story. Still the lepers could see out where the uninfected lived. It must have been horrible.The pearl diver in this book is confined to the leper colony in 1948 and the age of nineteen and though she isn't infected as badly as the others, in fact she has no outward signs at all, this is where she must life. She adopts the name of Miss Fuji and stoically sets about helping to care for the lepers there as the years move on. However, sometimes she swims to neighboring islands during the night to watch children play, to see life as lived by ordinary people.This is a story about life in a leper colony, about dashed hopes, about a kind of fatalism that those condemned to such a life accept. It's a story about humanity. It's a story about pain, suffering and loss and it's a story about the inherit goodness found in the human heart."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"\\"The Pearl Diver\\" is a difficult book. Leprosy is not part of most our lives, and much of what we think of may involve Jesus Christ's healing of the 10 lepers in the Gospel of Luke. The book is not about leprosy, but it is the context which drives the story. It is about being confined in flesh, the ever present and ubiquitous human condition.Imagine a young woman diving with great skill to the ocean floor. The grace, beauty and athleticism just off the shore of a Japanese island alone is an image to carry a reader through each page. Author Jeff Talarigo finds the proper tone and pace so as to begin the story well. A diagnosis of leprosy changes this scene, and the woman quickly moves to a leper colony. Her family cannot handle the shame and disowns her.Giving context to the story are 'Artifacts', something Talarigo uses as object/symbols. The technique works like a subtitle within a chapter like as with \\"Artifact Number 0596: A bar of soap.\\" The soap represents cleanliness and purity. Miss Fuji, as the young woman is called at the colony, carves them into shells or fish, and in them briefly finds freedom.The tone of the book is beautifully dour. It never ebbs and flows like the waves of the ocean dove into, creating emotional exhaustion for readers who want to leave the book uplifted. But leprosy in the 1940s is not a happy disease. The disease itself is hard, as is the social outcasting that packaged with it.It occasionally leaves a contemplative place and falls into sentimentality, and arcs into cynicism as Miss Fuji reacts against one patient who describes her faith to her. The most tragic portion is when Miss Fuji falls into intolerance, and \\"wants to rip their skin apart,\\" whenever someone religious talks about what they believe. At once she claims it is OK for some, yet is enraged when patients discuss their beliefs openly.The world continues on without her, and it will continue when she's gone. She understands this, but isn't satisfied and pursues freedom.Excellently written, if a bit monotonic, \\"The Pearl Diver\\" is more than moralism wrapped in an exotic context. It looks for, and arrives at deliverance.--Brockeim"},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"I'm half Asian and grew up partially in Okinawa and Japan and although I LOVE both my Asian and American cultures and backgrounds, I'm also well aware of both 'weaknesses' if you will in both societies.The last time I was in Japan was about 15 years ago and even then - AT THAT TIME anyway, I found that it wasn't an supportive or accepting society for those who suffer from physical or mental disabilities or illnesses. I remember as a little girl about 25 years or so ago wondering why families who had a family member who was incredibly ill or disabled wouldn't generally allow them to be seen publically. I AM NOT saying in ANY WAY that these sort of naivete, ignorance and shame still take place there - I have not lived in Japan for decades now but I was curious to read about the perspective on this sort of outlook years ago.I'm not going to into detail about what the book was about since so many others have already but I'll offer my perspective in why I think it's a worthwhile book to read.Although Pearl Diver was written by an American author - a male at that, I was pleasantly surprised to read about the details he was able to explain about subtle daily things in their culture. The author was able to describe things so the he created images in my mind so I was able to visualize what the characters looked like, how they felt and what they 'saw' through their eyes...physically and metaphorically.If you are interested in the Japanese culture and how those affected with leperosy were treated years ago, this is definitely a worthwhile book to read. Some chapters were incredibly harsh to get through so I had to put it down at times and get back to it, I still enjoyed having the opportunity to get to 'know' the characters and get a glimpse into their lives."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"The protagonist Miss Fiji, as she is called in a leper colony, the previous pearl diving girl, is not fleshed out enough in this novel that still manages to intrigue. The author, Jeff Talargo, uses an unusual writing style - the use of \\"artifacts\\" to drive the book is a novel and clever idea - but that very style limits the connection the reader feels with the characters. The story arrives disjointed and unemotional, even when atrocities are described. The book still intrigues because the history of the treatment of leprosy is fascinating.

(If I had a dollar for ever book that had a poor finale I wouldn't have to work anymore).The set up for The Pearl Diver is extremely engaging, so much so that I was frustrated that the author didn't spend more time with it. As such the loss of this world is less impactual than it would have been had we had more time to become immersed in it and I would have easily devoured four or five more chapters set in the world of the Pearl Diver.Also fairly condensed is the many years the main character spends on the island of Nagashima. We experience over forty years in just a few hundred pages. Most books are painfully overwritten, but here there seemed opportunity for much more.But the end is perfect. It's lyrical, emotional and exceptional and show that although there IS room for more here, the author succeeds with a lighter, softer more minimalistic touch.I'm interested in now reading Jeff Talarigo'sThe Ginseng Hunterto see how he grows as a writer."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"The Pearl Diver is a beautifully written novel.

I felt a range of emotions while reading the novel -- from sadness to anger to disappointment -- not of my own, but that of the young woman's experiences.This is definitely a novel for people who enjoy historical fiction and want to read something that is a departure from the typical period pieces.

We are introducted to a young teenager who dives for pearls to make a living and help her family. One day, she contracts Leprosy and is sent to a sanatorium on Nagashima. Here she experiences the \\"brutality\\" of social exclusion and quarantine. She must drop her name, assume a new one and live the rest of her life on this island with other sick inhabitants. It is a very sad story, not just for those people who have progressive leprosy, but the humiliation and shame that they experience. They are not visited by family (usually) and are considered dead to the outside world.The main character assumes the name Miss Fuji - reminiscent of a ascent of Mt. Fuji with her uncle when she was only 9. Miss Fuji will stay on Nagashima for most of the rest of her life.The author describes the horrible conditions upon Miss Fuji's arrival. As time progresses and the patients \\"stand up\\" they achieve more items and conditions improve. They are given a medicine every day that is thought to suppress the disease's progression, but the the needles are ground on whetstones in between patients (no disinfectant or sterilization). Some contract hepatitis. When anyone comes to visit the island or leave, they must endure a disinfecting process.There are some islands across the channel from Nagashima. Miss Fuji visits one that houses an ancient temple. Another island is inhabited and she enjoys waving to children on the beach there.At one point, Miss Fuji attempts an escape and she is punished by having to assist doctors in their clinic - mostly for abortions. This troubles her so much that the reader can feel her pain.The style of the book is interesting. It is told in short \\"chapters\\" that are titled as \\"artifacts\\". As if one would find certain items from Miss Fuji's life, the story is told about that item. So the reader is given the necessary information and story development based on each item. No more, no less.Overall, I gave this book 4 stars only because I thought that more could have been expounded upon toward the end of the book. Some parts I thought were too abrupt. However, the author was able to make me feel for Miss Fuji and experience emotions that made the novel a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"This novel explores the life of a young woman afflicted with leprosy in 1940's Japan.

This small lesion--a PHYSICAL stigma--leads her down an incredible path of isolation, dehumanization, and even cruelty from the society of \\"normals\\". \\"Leprosy\\" is the name of this horrible SOCIAL stigma which turns her and the other victims of this illness into outcasts. They are victims of the fears and prejudices of the society in which they live just as much as they are victims of their illness. Hanson's disease. An illness. NOT a shameful curse earned by evil doings.Kenichi, diagnosed, disgraced, disowned,is delivered via rowboat to the insular leprosarium of Nagashima. From this point on, the story of this girl--who, stripped of her identity, is now known as \\"Miss Fuji\\"--,and the society she is now part of, is told from the vantage of old artifacts found on the island. Left over bits and pieces from the past decades of the old colony are being sorted, identified and cataloged, like anthropologist trying to piece together what it was like there.The story of Miss Fuji and \\"her people\\" is artfully woven through these reminders of the past. A photograph, a teacup, a map...each discarded item informs another memory in the narrative of The Pearl Diver. Thankfully, effective treatment for leprosy is discovered relatively early during her stay on the island. But progress in overcoming the horrible social stigma of this disease--even though cured--is long, and painfully slow in coming. Still slow.THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BOOK. If we are to fully understand the meaning of this story for today, we must understand the story of our past: how we have treated people with illness, with disabilities, with any \\"difference\\". How we treat them now. And ask ourselves: are we doing better?

I loved her first as a child, when my mind was fascinated by supernatural wonders in time and space. Recently I discovered her adult novels, and finally this book of poetry.This poetry covers a range of topics, and many of the poems cover Bible stories and Biblical themes. But it is not sing-songy, watered-down, cliche, or boring by any means. You'll see the world through the eyes of a parrot (and will be taught something of humanity in that poem) and through the eyes of the mother of Jesus. The poetic devices are used beautifully, especially internal rhyme, rhythm, and alliteration. There are some surprises here. A couple of the poems are very brief (only five short lines), and you'll be surprised how much a few words can say. I found myself laughing out loud several times. I kept going over to my husband and insisting that I must read him another poem.This poetry has encouraged me to continue writing myself. I am hoping to learn through osmosis here, so I am reading these works over and over again. They teach so much about form, style, vocabulary, and wit. There are unsuspected twists and so many different subjects here. Find this book if you enjoy L'Engle or if you enjoy excellent poetry! Many of these poems will be like water for your soul, the cold refreshing water of depth, love, and laughter."},{"Title":"Creating Value in the Network Economy","review":"This collection of articles provides an excellent overview of the key changes occuring in the network economy.Tapscott's introduction alone is worth the price of the book, as he succinctly and insightfully overviews and integrates the primary issues affecting today's businesses in the new economy.The selected articles explore critical issues, including the changes in what consumers value and the implications for new and existing busineses; the disaggreagtion of firms and the creation of digital networks; and the shift in power from suppliers to buyers and the imperatives for businesses if they are to gain buyers' long-term trust and loyalty.Some of the articles may be &quot;old&quot; as measured by publication date, but the concepts contained in them certainly are not.

The authors develop the theory by generalizing from examples, most of which are taken from military or industrial applications. This gives the reader insight into how mathematicians develop theorems by abstracting from problems arising in the real world. The theorems are proved rigorously except in the final chapter on normal distributions. Formal proofs about normal distributions require advanced mathematics not familiar to the intended audience.Probability theory is developed in the first section of the text. The authors define probability. They explain the addition rule and how it simplifies when events are mutually exclusive. Likewise, after they obtain the multiplication rule in terms of conditional probabilities, they explain how it simplifies when events are mutually independent. The authors discuss Bayes' formula for the probability of a hypothesis given that a given event has been observed using several examples. They then prove Bernoulli's formula for the most probable number of occurrences of an event when there are a large number of trials.The second section of the text is on random variables. The authors discuss laws of distribution, mean values, variance and standard of deviation, and how these quantities are used to measure the dispersion of a random variable. Their development culminates in Chebyshev's law of large numbers. In the final chapter on normal distributions, the authors informally discuss their properties and show how they can be used to solve problems.In a brief conclusion, the authors discuss other developments in probability theory that are beyond the scope of this text.This text is an excellent introduction to probability theory. I recommend it highly for the insights it offers. However, it does not contain exercises. To learn mathematics, one must solve problems. Therefore, I suggest that you read this text in conjunction with a problem book on probability or a text on probability that does contain exercises such as Samuel Goldberg'sProbability: An Introduction."},{"Title":"An Elementary Introduction to the Theory of Probability (Dover Books on Mathematics)","review":"This book explains concepts simply and clearly. It is the exact opposite of a typical American math book which is filled with useless formalism and endlessly repeated examples. This book conveys the core concepts of probability quickly and seemingly effortlessly."},{"Title":"An Elementary Introduction to the Theory of Probability (Dover Books on Mathematics)","review":"Even though the fifth edition of this book was published in 1961, this book still gives a useful and brief introduction to probability. However, if you're going to buy a book to learn statistics or probability, I would suggest a more recent book. They may not be as brief and concise as this, but newer books would be more up to date. One interesting thing about the Gnedenko/Khinchin book is their examples and problems, which involve things such as the production of artillery shells, or hitting targets with cannons. It is a very welcome change from the traditional, but obvious examples that use decks of cards or dice. Also, it says things about the audience for whom this book was originally meant, and the relevant topics of the time of the cold war. Still, I suggest a more recent text."},{"Title":"Mim's Christmas Jam","review":"It's 1915 and Pap is working on the new subway in New York, keeping him from his family on Christmas.

If you can deal with that the information is superb. I encourage all to read this book and take control of your life."},{"Title":"Uropathy: The most powerful holistic therapy","review":"Uropathy by Martin Lara is a very astonishing and realistic book about urine therapy. This book is the only reference everyone needs to really understand how to use urine in the most effective way. Martin Lara explains the detailed formula for every desease or body imbalance. He is not afraid to explain why urine therapy it could fail sometimes, and it's because the Deficiency of Minerals and Malnutrition we are exposed every day of our lives because we don't consume natural raw seasalt or rocksalt plus the right nutrients our body need, this means urine will not always cure deseases provoked by malnutrition unless they are linked to pathogens. One of the most interesting topics of the book is how the combination of Dehydration and Deficiency of Minerals is the common denominator of all the deseases manifested in the body with the stagnation of rotten fecal matter either in the gut or in the very misunderstood lymphatic system depriving the body of oxygen absorption creating the perfect environment for malignant microorganisms development. As the best Charles Duncan's pupil, Martin Lara resurrects the forgotten AUTOTHERAPY and offers some alternatives teaching how to prepare other body fluids as natural vaccines to get better results with some deseases where urine is sometimes a weak resource. The best legacy of Lara's Uropathy book is his patented formula, the Universal Sublingual Remedy for those people who want to get cured quickly without drink urine, and at the same time Martin Lara explains how to produce the most powerful therapeutic urine including the right way to apply urine enemas, urine fasting and the fascinating use of urine collected from pregnant women. You will also learn the wonderful benefits of constantly being exposed to microorganisms as a natural way to enhance the immune system. This book denounces the actual medical system that is swindling and killing our society. The holistic and autotherapeutic urine is the best natural medicine to cure or relieve all the deseases provoked by invasion of malignant microorganisms, is abundant and free of charge. I really thank this man for all his nonprofit years of investigative and experimental dedication to unveil the true about urine therapy, and for so many lives saved because of his smart discoveries.

This is like NASA, instead shooting mammals into orbit, making it to the moon on the first try. Storms Beneath the Skin is Regie Gibson&#8217;s long overdue first poetry book. The meandering Slam minstrel has not stood still long enough in the last ten years for his words to be crystallized in print. For the poet described by Kurt Vonnegut as singing and chanting &#8220;for all of us,&#8221; Storms Beneath the Skin represents an audacious and auspicious debut in print. Behind the cover design by Gregory Harms featuring four epidermal close-ups is the first collection of poetry from one entrenched in the pantheon of Slam Poetry. The greatest poetry is elusively familiar, spiritually sensual, and harrowingly gentle. The 38 selections in Storms Beneath the Skin are divided into five sections: Chants, an invocation, coos, suite, and Canticles and Curses. Storms irradiates with dangerous diversity of word and theme. The initial poem, &#8220;Alchemy,&#8221; is a succinct critique of tone-deaf academicians who reduce language to grammar in the same way materialists reduce spirit to matterIn great poetry, language startles us, gyrating in new combinations: &#8220;cotton-myth our stories&#8221;; &#8220;daughter of desert/and dostoyevski&#8221;; &#8220;sightraped hunter&#8221; and &#8220;musebruise.&#8221; Storms startles us, from the chants to the haikus: u came on snake wings u red turjid gitar licks u left d same way.The Old Guard snivels at the New Poetic Proletarians like Regie Gibson. The Old Guard doubts that the word can make the transition from the stage to page. The fireworks on stage, they believe, conceal deep deficiencies in poetic formation. &#8220;When you [Regie] perform,&#8221; writes Vonnegut, &#8220;you are supersonic and in the stratosphere, where you can see that the earth really is a ball, moist, blue-green.&#8221; Audiences in the Slam World are dazzled by Gibson&#8217;s &#8220;bewitchingly/bleedin&#8221; performance of the &#8220;eulogy of jimi Christ,&#8221; an ode to Jimi Hendrix. The Old Guard views Slam Poetry as a mutation of their hallowed Tradition of Pretentiousness and Less Than Effusive Presentations of the Word. The Old Guard is as suspicious of the Stage Word having an afterlife as Page Word as they are as the spirit existing outside the body after death. Storms Beneath the Skin demonstrates that Word on Stage can exist and yes flourish on the page. Stage performance only enhances the lightening and lilting of Gibson&#8217;s poetry. As Vonnegut says: &#8220;To become a great artist, one must penetrate the sound barrier of secret self-pity, and the hate and fear that justifies.&#8221; Storms Beneath the Skin easily breaks the sound barrier. The only question remaining is what happens to poetry when it exceeds the speed of light."},{"Title":"Storms Beneath the Skin","review":"I must admit that as I write this review it is hard to not let the author's live performances influence me.

Specific episodes in the book take off and you find yourself burning 15 pages to find what happened. Some of the characters are interesting and unique. The construction is episodic with story lines cut and pasted like reading a painting from the cubist school. Chunks of the story are cut out and displaced into other parts of the story, creating a disjointed reading experience. This might have been a successful artistic technique if it weren't also weighed down by a huge cast of characters, so large that the publisher had to print a whole listing before you get to the first chapter. To complicate this, some of the characters are known by different names which also change depending on the timeline that is also cut and distributed throughout the story. To comlicate this, characters go from being homosexual to bisexual; so you have to identify who it is, what name they're going by, and whether they like guys or gals at the moment. In short, this book is extremely confusing. Knox needs a new editor; this relationship did not work well. Here are some examples of how the story didn't follow through for me. There is a whole segment on how a girl loves her horse. So, of course, two characters feel it's their mission to find the elusive horse and dismember it. They get naked, hack up the horse, bury it, wash in a stream, one guy tries to seduce the other only to have the other one try to kill himself, then the girl shows up, they get out and a flood comes, the dismembered horse floats by, and the story line is dropped. What's the point? To complicate these matters, there are secret societies whose members are unidentified. At one point, the characters are at a funeral. Rather than being affected by the sorrow in the scene, I was trying to remember who it was that died and what her relationship was to the people at the funeral. At the end, someone tells Carme that she's a mother, but I could never figure out who was speaking. After this book, I felt like I needed a study group to figure out what went on. Unfortunately, for all its promise, the read is not worth the effort."},{"Title":"Manifold: Origin","review":"This book is garbage. Don't let Stephen Baxter's awesome previous works persuade you to buy this idiotic waste of paper. I had some serious doubts at the start of Manifold: Space, because it seemed to be a re-hash of Time. What the --? It almost seemed like a cheap money-making scheme put upon sci-fi fans. space was *almost* too dull for me, but I did finish it. I was hoping that Origin would explain this stupid series and pull it all together, but NO! Instead, we are left with a bunch more dis-jointed and meaningless scenes that have absolutely no bearing on the plot--which, by the way, I have given up trying to figure out.A book shouldn't be this hard to read. I kept turning page after page *looking* for the plot, hoping it would just pop out at any minute, but I was very frustrated and sad when I'd read 3/4 of the book and still nothing made any sense.this is a terrible example of Baxter's work and should have never been written. He should have taken the time to properly explain this story. Instead, Baxter is hung up trying to prove that evolution works despite the uncontrollable amount of contradictory evidence that continues to disprove Darwin. What's with these sci-fi writers grasping at wild fantasies to try to explain the flawed theory of evolution in recent years? I'm thinking of Greg Bear and Baxter chopping down the same tree. the result is, several thousand trees sacrificed to publish their books in an attempt to describe the destruction of earth's environment and how homo sapiens deserves to go extinct or some such nonsense.I fear Baxter is going the way of L.Ron, having run out of steam, falling onto religious-philosophical theories. Does success as a sci-fi writer give one a feeling of responsibility for humanity, or does it become a medium for political/environmental propaganda along the author's worldview?I worry about future Baxter books, so I will read reviews before buying another one. I hope he gets back on track and gets off the wacky evolution train he's stuck on."},{"Title":"Manifold: Origin","review":"I read Manifold:Time, his first in the series, and found it a very satisfying SF read. The science is solid, the characters well-developed and the pace perfect. The next in the series, Manifold:Space, was a disappointment, but still bearable--Note that although the characters (at least their names) are the same in all 3 books, it is not really a series as the author uses &quot;parallel universe&quot; plot lines to make each book stand on its own. The third one, Manifold:Origin is truly a waste of paper. The plot has so many holes, inconsistencies and in general inanities that you almost feel the whole thing is a joke, or maybe Mr. Baxter really sacrificed ideas for speed (less than a year between M:Space and M:Origin). The main character of the book, a well-developed and engaging personality in the first book, is shallow and failry boring in this instance, with few endearing or engaging traits. The main plot line starts with his significant other being kidnapped to (he presumes) a new planet that has just appeared orbiting the Earth and replacing the moon. He fights tooth and nail to get a ship to go there (never mind why an overcrowded planet with existing technology would not be rushing to colonize a new planet with water and atmosphere less than 5 light-minutes away). When he gets there, primary objective being to resuce his loved one, he is met by hostile hominids and is saved by what appears to be a lost English lord. of course the next logical step is to: leave the ship, his only means of getting out, open and abandoned, have his only communications device with Earth destroyed, and proceed to go have beers and sleep off the hangover at the Brits' camp.Never mind that he also just found out that this planet happens to be a &quot;link&quot; between parallel Earths and just phases in and out bwtween universes and therefore any second he could be phased to a different universe and forget any hope of coming back. The plot goes downhill from there. it becomes excrutiatingly boring and even less believable. It is a shame that an author with such a stellar oeuvre felt compelled to publish such an unworthy novel. I hope his next effort is more satisfying, but after M:Origin, I will definitely wait for reviews before buying it."},{"Title":"Manifold: Origin","review":"This is a third volume in the Manifold series; the same characters reappear in a different universe. Now, I agree with other reviewers. This book contained far too much violence and the Zealots (the \\"villains\\") were disappointing. Baxter does best with antagonists who are never seen, such as his mysterious Xeelee Sequence. As mentioned, characterization is as weak here as for Baxter's predecessor, Larry Niven.The ending was very sad and left me thinking: in *Manifold:Time: Malenfant and the super-children collapse the universe and create a myriad of potential universes. At the end of *Origin* we're told that the Red Moon (itself reminiscent of Baxter's *Moonseed*) wanders between a series of parallel Earths. *Manifold:Space* presumably happens in a universe outside this circuit, as its galaxy contains myriad intelligent species.These books had several interesting themes in common: Malenfant's journey and ultimate death, love and faith as essential to human existence, the Neandertal toolmaking as a meditation, malfunctioning and meaningless supertechnology, and a vast, incredible view of all reality that dwarfs most sf writers' abilities to make their readers *see*. (The black hole miners, mentioned in the first and third book, are an idea so amazing that they deserve a whole novel...) The extremely depressing tone of all Baxter's writings is present here as well, and makes this less satisfying a read than it would have been if he let his heroes win for once. Overall, a strange series that reveals this writer's weaknesses as much as his strengths. A writer who has to reuse so much material needs to slow down or stop until he has more to work with."},{"Title":"Manifold: Origin","review":"ORIGIN finishes off Stephen Baxter's trilogy in a way that may initially seem less grand than the other space operatic installments, yet makes sense given that all three books deal with the Fermi Paradox and its depressing prospect that intelligent life is unique and alone in our universe, confined to Earth. In ORIGIN, Baxter responds by dropping the relentless quest for aliens pursued in the first two books, and instead tells a slightly more accessible story about what we do have--our humanity--and all the profound secrets and insights lying deep within our collective evolutionary past, and future(s). It is a story of the destiny of the human species.When the main characters from the series find themselves on a rogue, wandering moon that seems to be capable of traveling through the vast manifold of potential universes, Baxter directly justifies (not that it necessarily needed it) the reusing of the same characters gimmick that unites the trilogy, as well as provides for a few sly quips (\\"Maybe we knew each other in a past life\\" etc). In characteristic fashion, he flits from one stylized narrative to the next, presented from the eyes of the diverse hominids and pre-hominids that mysteriously share this primeval moon, assessing events in their own terms, all in minimalistic and lucid prose. Also characteristic of Baxter, the personalities are flimsy (even Emma Stoney, this story's definite heroine) and are often revealed to be little more than puppets ventriloquizing the author's ideas, or explanations. Inconsistencies abounds, most notably the huge fluctuations of apparent cognitive capacity held by various characters, and thecompletely pointless but nevertheless disturbing side-tale starring Shadow, an alienated and abused presapient \\"Elf-woman.\\"Overall, though--for readers of TIME and SPACE--this is a strikingly dark story. For those who haven't cared to think about it, early life was grisly and short, poignant little bursts of sentience unfortunately chock-full of violence, rape, and cannibalism. Baxter explores this delightful blur of pain a little more acutely than I would have wanted, but ORIGIN's real heart of darkness is in its analysis of the humanity that we stake a claim to--us modernized humans who read stuff like this--and its essential faults, which I read to be overanalysis and the drive to possess and expand. The basic facts of our humanity are not so much decried as compared to other ways of life in the \\"It doesn't have to be this way...\\" scenario used throughout the MANIFOLD series. Needless to say there are many melancholy revelations sprinkled throughout, and a surprising ending which makes one question what redemption may be to a homo sap.Despite its shortcomings, I enjoyed ORIGIN better than the other two precisely because of the subject matter. Baxter has a way with his writing that makes incongruity seem trivial when you meet and engage with his incredibly potent ideas, expressed in beautifully streamlined prose. To end, a rumination on a past mode of living, an immersion in the moment of a sunset as perceived by a Neanderthal:\\"Joshua felt himself dissolve, out from the center of his head, to the periphery of the world. There was no barrier around him, no layer of interpretation or analogy or nostalgia; for now he was the plain and the sea and the clouds, and he was the slim doe that looked up at the cliff, just as he was the stocky, quiet man who gazed down from it. For a time he was immersed in the world's beauty in a way no human could have shared.\\""},{"Title":"Manifold: Origin","review":"Manifold: Origin is apparently the completion of the Manifold: trilogy, and, according to the clerk at Borders, this one was already in the drawer and ready to go to the publisher when the second one came out, which explains the amazing speed of publication.This book is--well, like Quantum Physics Meets Stephen King. It's hard reading, and not because of the quantum physics! It's a brutal, hardhitting book, painful to read at times, and in many ways I felt that it was at the core of Baxter's meanderings around the universe: it felt to me as if he was working through some anguish that his very creative mind was trying toresolve--there is great sadness in this book, somehow.There are also many unanswered, irritating questions about resolutions (plot problems). In some ways I found the book exhiliarating, in others revolting, and essentially frustrating.See what you think. I have to say this: Baxter has a wonderful imagination.(But his characters, like those of many science fiction writers, are virtually interchangeable--even Reid Malenfant the Rogue is basically undeveloped--just a somewhat bewildered, oafish space jockey, imho..)But, for me, Baxter's books always pass the test: they continue to haunt me after I've finished reading them. And the only way to fix the problem is to buy another Baxter book.(This one felt, at times, like a great video game...)"},{"Title":"Manifold: Origin","review":"As usual, there is a core of hard science to the book. Knowing a touch of quantum theory and special relativity is a big boon.The plot seems to be a trellis on which other, more interesting, elements are hung. Those other elements, such as theoretical views of proto-human activities, thought patterns, and motivations recur in Baxter's writing. I enjoy them.As for the \\"darkness\\" in the story, it's true that this isn't clan of the cave bears. Criminalizing homicide was a huge mental leap for our ancestors and is of recent vintage. Baxter understands this.I was disturbed by the notion that predators know to keep their populations down. Not true. There are too many population studies revealing the critters in general have population explosions and implosions based on resource availability, predation, and disease. Oh well, no author is perfect."},{"Title":"Manifold: Origin","review":"This third Manifold novel starts in time about half-way between the first two, in 2015. But that doesn't really matter because they are all three set in universes parallel to each other, and could each stand alone. In this version, Malenfant and his wife Emma are separated when she is thrown onto the Red Moon, which suddenly replaces our own familiar Luna one day. She survives, interacting with the local hominid peoples, while Malenfant mounts a NASA expedition to rescue her with the help of Nemoto. Parallel versions of each of these characters play roles in the first two books. In fact, this book is primarily about Emma, who is nothing more than a tattered photograph in Manifold:Space.I found this story, unlike the first two, to be quite gory, with abundant descriptions of rape, torture, and cannibalism. I'm not sure if all that was necessary - except to show the pervasiveness of that across all the hominid species, and how it is a factor in evolution. The portrayal of Michael Praisegod, whose culture if not biology is close to our own, shows the use of more modern cultural institutions such as religion are not proof against the brutality.Thematically, I think the hominid species can be categorized into two camps - with most in a static stagnant relationship with the universe, while a few are growth and expansion oriented. Baxter's position seems to be that both are flawed. With an infinity of time and space to play out to their logical outcomes, it's hard to find much ultimate hope - other than local and temporary happiness along the way.Overall, I have to say that Baxter's Evolution is a more satisfying and enjoyable exploration of the concept of past and future evolution than this, although this one needs to be seen in the context of the series it is a part of."},{"Title":"Manifold: Origin","review":"Stephen Baxters Manifold series is as good as it getsin science fiction today. And afterManifold 1, Time, and Manifold 2, Space, I waslooking forward to Manifold 3, Origin.Expectations high, if not enormous.Origin begins in the year 2015 when a red moon appearsin the Earths orbit. Scientists scramble to understand whatis on the big red moon and how it got there.Eventually, Manifold heroes Reid Malenfant, his wife Emma,and Japanese scientist Nemotoends up on the new moon.We are then presented with a journey of survival. Whichreminds me more of \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear\\" by Auel thanthe science fiction of Manifold 1 and 2.A story of Neanderthals figthing Cro-Magnons and otherhominids on a brutal Earth like Luna world.A world where humans, human ancestors and could-have-beenhuman forms co-exist.Going overboard in this world of blood and pain -Where dying without illusions of afterlife,redemption or hope just saves you a lot of trouble -Stephen Baxter could have ended up witha deeply pessimistic book.But actually he seems to be saying in Manifold 3, Origin,that the (this) multiverse was created by the fardownstreamers (our children) to avoid \\"a saga ofmeaningless survival in a dismal future of decay andshadows\\", but instead a reshaped multiversethat creates a storm of mind.So, here (on the new Moon) we have blood and pain.And we know that given sufficient time, the universeitself is doomed as the 'heat death' killsoff the expanding universe.But by creating the multiverse, filled with differentkinds of lonely hominids in brutal worlds, the fardownstreamers (our god-like children) actually alsocreates the worlds filled with mind.And so everything is alright?Actually, I am not completely convinced,and would have liked to seen this exploredfurther. Perhaps at the expense of Stephen Baxters (too)long depiction of the horrible hardships onthis Luna world.Still, after Manifold 1 and 2 there is no escape, you haveto read manifold 3 as well.-Simon"},{"Title":"Manifold: Origin","review":"This book started out with a bang! I loved the first person narrative from a hominid view point and as usual, I really enjoyed Stephen Baxter's literary style. What really disappointed me was the cliche use of the \\"inquisition\\" type characters who are sexually repressed and ultimately evil. I also think that the story could have done without the gratuitous amount of violence, especially sexually related violence and violence against infant hominids. I got the point regarding humanity's view of lower life forms early on in the book and I resented the message being pounded on me through out the book. In addition, was this deja vu, or was Stephen recycling a lot of his ideas from his first two Manifold books?I really enjoy Stephen Baxter's writing and I thought that his first books were great science fiction. This book lacked any hard science fiction and was geared more toward a sociological observation of both the nature of evolution and how man's cruelty is related to his stage of evolution. I wish that Mr. Baxter would have taken more time on this book and allowed his imagination to travel past the Red Moon. Had there been more interesting and interactive characters (instead of saving them for a sequel), I would have given this book a much higher rating."},{"Title":"Manifold: Origin","review":"Baxter explores some of the holes in the theory of evolution and comes up with a unique answer to fill some of those holes.

He also began reusing the situations/scenarios, I believe one character got raped five times, three or four babies had their heads bitten off or dashed against a tree, etc. I believe with the exception of the \\"god\\" like beings all of the female characters were involved in a forced sexual episode of some kind - one or two and we could infer that a very dark vision was being presented.He has some interesting ideas and that made the book worth reading, but he could have cut it in half and removed a lot of the sex and violence and had a much better book IMHO."},{"Title":"Manifold: Origin","review":"In my opinion, some readers have misunderstood the nature of this novel. It is a fragmented, gory, unpredictable story that leaves the reader simultaneously nauseous and confused. And this is the point. The Manifold series is a discovery of alternate universes, alternate possibilities, from the context of a central but loosely constructed character Reid Malenfant.In \`Time' and \`Space', Malenfant's adventures were more linear and core to a saga of the universe. In the final chapter of the trilogy, \`Origin', Baxter discusses a set of possible evolutionary paths, a group of differently evolved humans, coexisting on a moon that jumps from one alternate possibility to another, with each group of humans acting out their primal instincts on one another. Malenfant acts more as an observer to a greater drama.Thus, this chapter is gory, because nature is gory. It is disjointed, in that transgressing alternate worlds is disjoining. It is exactly what it should be, a discussion of big ideas in a context where they can be understood and the relevance can be taken away and pondered.I give this novel five stars, not entirely of its own merit, but in collection with the previous two chapters. It fulfils my expectation of a story that allows me to stretch my imagination and at the same time challenge my humanity."},{"Title":"Manifold: Origin","review":"Another good book in the loose trilogy of the manifold series. This one investigates associations between different levels of humanity on the rungs of evolution. As if they could somehow interact between the ages with some interesting manifestations developed to make points.Right up there, almost, with Evolution, which is my favorite for his science, what if style, while of course Titan showcases his ability to create characters to bleed over. I haven't read all of his books, something that I'm remedying presently, but one of my top 10 authors since the release of Titan.heartedly recommended with no real reservations."},{"Title":"Manifold: Origin","review":"I am not quite sure what about this story did not jibe for me. I may have to give it another go, or at least another in this series. I think it may possibly be that I never was, or never will be, a Steven Baxter fan. I suspect it is something about his style or how he writes that does not gel for me personally. Otherwise, I can't pin down what is wrong with it, but I have tried it twice and didn't finish."},{"Title":"Manifold: Origin","review":"Have you ever been a good portion of the way through a book and been faced with the total certainty that it's not going anywhere. And yet, you've invested so much time in it that you feel silly not bothering to finish it and besides, it's not that bad. It's just not great. This was the situation I found myself in reading this book and true to form I did finish reading it only to find that the book was merely okay. Not good, certainly not great, but just \\"okay.\\" I guess I should elaborate. This is the third (and presumably) last book in the \\"Manifold\\" trilogy, which so far has been a loose consortium of absolutely fascinating hard science ideas held together by fitfully entertaining plots. The stories may not have been nail-biters but the cosmic vision kept you coming back and made the experience memorable, although you won't achieve any kind of transcendence reading these. But they were fun, for what they were. Then we get to this book. By now, we know the drill, as Baxter reboots everything again and gives us the characters we've seen before, but in different circumstances. This time our hero Reid Malfenant is back (with his wife still alive, Emma sat out the last book due to death, so it's nice to have her along) and as usual he's ticking off NASA. But the book sets up its premise early on, as a weird red moon replaces the actual moon in the sky, also scooping up a bunch of people along the way. Emma winds up being one of those people and Reid throws together a mad gambit to go up there and rescue her and bring her back. Looking back, I'm not quite certain where the book went off the rails. The red moon, for whatever reason, contains a wide variety of hominid species all living together and while this should be the central mystery, Baxter goes absolutely nowhere with it for a long, long time. He sets up the whole weird society well enough, and integrates the people who have been picked up in previous trips, but the plot just sort of shambles along. Emma wanders around with other survivors. Reid attempts to get up there. Various other peoples with one word names and simple narrative style jump in just to spice things up without really adding anything to the overall story. Once in a while someone decides to sit up and ask, \\"Just what the heck is this here moon for?\\" On some level a lot of it feels like Baxter just killing time and the book is so stretched out that when the Big Ideas start to come, you run the risk of just not caring anymore. Page upon page deal with people just wandering around, or beating each other up, or foraging for food, or engaging in acts that I really can't describe here, to no real purpose, it seems. Subplots feel tacked on and Baxter fumbles his money shot with the ending, which is generally the place where he dazzles us with his knowledge of science and his interpretation of whatever wild theory he's been reading up on. In the first two books, his grand visions made up for any shortcoming in plot. This time out, it falls flat and the grand speculations and revelations just don't seem to have any impact, it's all stated so matter of factly (and sort of repeats something that happened in another book) that it's like reading people discussing a scientific paper, which is the opposite effect the previous books had on me. In his defense, after going with \\"time\\" and \\"space, it's probably hard to figure out something to top that, so I do give him credit for trying. And in the end he gives it the ol' college try, it's never less than readable and although I doubt it'll ever be anywhere remotely near my favorite book it was a pleasant reading experience, if a bit overlong. So you can decide if the author was simply biting off more than he could chew or just executing it poorly. And although your milage may vary, if you've read the other two Manifold books it's worth a shot at least, you might as well finish it and besides, you might like it more than I did. Anything's possible."},{"Title":"Manifold: Origin","review":"Loose ends abound in this novel. I doubt this is deliberate. It looks to this reader that the publishers have cut out a lot of what made this book make any sense. What's left is a kind of Frank Herbert (particularly nasty British horror writer) sci-fi story. What's worse is that it gets really boring towards the middle of the book and never recovers. I have read most of Stephen Baxters books and this is an extremely poor example."},{"Title":"Manifold: Origin","review":"One of these days, I'm going to learn to never buy a book before reading the reviews on Amazon. Unfortunately, I was in a used book store, saw this, and bought it on the spot. What a mistake. I'm currently on page 382 of 518 and that's as far as I'm going. I'm not going to read through yet another rape, yet another child eating, yet another set of torment/torture, yet another scene of how rotten Stephen Baxter thinks mankind (and all it's various ancestral lines) is. Also, I'm tired of reading through all that stuff without any progress in the plot. Basically, I'm 74% of the way through the book, and nothing's happened to 1) re-unite the main man with the main woman, or 2) tell us who, why, or how the moon is flying through the multiverse picking up and dumping off hominids. Unless you're into being alternately bored and disgusted all while being confused, don't bother with this book."},{"Title":"Manifold: Origin","review":"Origin was definitely different than Baxter's previous novels. I forced myself through several of his other novels feeling like I have re-read recycled material and usually skim through most of his discriptions of asteroids and moons which he goes into way too much detail. He did a great job in creating this new world and his new characters.I liked this book a lot. I would have to agree with the other readers in that it was much too violent and extremely disturbing. It has to remain realistic up to a certain point but the detail he gives exceeds what is necessary to get his point across.I would highly recommend this book. If you're new to Baxter, I would definitely urge that this be the first book you read."},{"Title":"Manifold: Origin","review":"Having read many of Stephen Baxter's books I was again looking forward to this one. However it was such that I did not even bother to finish the book. Not only did the jumpiness of what existed of the plot make it difficult to read, many parts of it were just ugly - with what seemed to be no purpose.Some books may have unpleasant components in the reading, that serve a purpose to support the plot, as in The Sparrow and Children of God, where ideas served a purpose. I could not find a purpose here.Ok, so life on the red moon may be ugly... however I would have preferred to have had a foundation or reason for reading that ugliness.With over 1000 books in my collection this is not one I would recommend.John"},{"Title":"Manifold: Origin","review":"I used to anxiously look forward to the newest release by Stephen Baxter, but the Manifold series is starting to wear on my nerves. The first installment was quite good, but the second installment was a bit of a let-down. I had to struggle to muster the interest to finish this third installment.My first clue that this book was going to be a disappointment was at the very beginning when I saw such stimulating dialogue as:&quot;Fire? Dig! Fire?&quot;&quot;Dig, Dig, here! Loud, Loud?&quot;Loud's voice, from far away. &quot;Fire, Fire! Dig! Loud!&quot;When authors feel they have to invent a proto-language, or engage in some form of dialect, you know that there is some serious trouble ahead, since they feel that they have to introduce the novelty factor in order to overcome shortcomings in plot or characterization. In this case, there was only concept enough for a short story, not a full-length novel, particularly coming on the heels of the previous two installments.I saw another reviewer saying that this would be a good introduction Baxter. I disagree. In the Manifold sequence, Baxter is engaging in serious literary posturing, and it just doesn't work out. Baxter's strengths are much better illustrated in the Xeelee sequence."},{"Title":"Manifold: Origin","review":"I loved many of Baxter's other books. Waded through the first two in this series which I thought were pretty ok.Unfortunately he drops a big turd on the pages of this one. Pretty horrible stuff.

After the third graphic and explicit baby-murder I just couldn't read any more."},{"Title":"Manifold: Origin","review":"I recently purchased Origin for 90% off at Border's Books going out of business sale. Having made this purchase at 10 cents on the dollar I still feel cheated. This whining, nonsensical liberal claptrap truly pushes the envelopes of foolishness, boredom and hatred of religion to new extremes. This waste of paper has catapaulted into my top 5 \\"worst books ever\\", and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Baxter's naming of the books villian \\"PraiseGod Michael\\", who happens to be a sadistic homicidal madman, sums up Baxter's feelings towards Christianity. As other readers have stated, this book is rambling, disjointed, plotless garbage. As Baxter's goal was clearly to assault Christianity and intelligent design, he failed completely due to the lack of: 1) an interesting story, 2) a plot, 3) plausable or compelling arguments or 4) comtent writing/dialog. This book is a complete & utter failure on so many levels it's scary. If there is a list of \\"The ultimate worst of the worst books\\" hiding out there somewhere, Origins belongs on it.Oh, how I grieve for the 79 cents I spent on Origins..."},{"Title":"Manifold: Origin","review":"Manifold is a series of three books. They're not a sequence, actually, as they describe parallel universes. The main character are the same, but the world they live in is different. Origin presents us a world where the good old Moon is replaced by a large red moon. As it happens, the main character, Reid Malenfant, loses his wife Emma on the new moon and has to rescue her.Emma finds the new moon inhabited by various hominid species. Baxter offers us an interesting view to the life of different hominids, with a point of view of the hominids themselves and humans living with them. It's interesting, but it can also get slightly tedious - this is one long-winded book, with a plot that's a framework for all sorts of neat stuff Baxter wants to present.But it works, for me at least, because even though I began reading book with some doubts, I soon got sucked into the events. It gets quite interesting and Baxter has some pretty wild ideas there. This book isn't for everybody (that is easy to see from the Amazon reviews, many of which give just one or two stars), but if you enjoyed the other Manifold books, this one is worth reading."},{"Title":"Manifold: Origin","review":"Although I had already read the not-good reviews of this book on Amazon, I bought it anyway. The reviews are largely correct. The story went on too long, the characters are flat, the subplots detracted from the main plot rather than adding to it, and the science was much less interesting than that in last two books.Still... I am glad I read it. It did have a few interesting ideas. I might suggest a reading plan to get the most out of this book. Read the first 50 pages or so to get an idea of all of the characters (they won't change for the duration of the novel) and the plot. Read all of the sections labeled Manekatopokanehedo. Skip to Part Four -- \\"The World Engine\\" and read to end, skipping the sections labeled Shadow.With that reading plan, you should really enjoy the book. You'll get all of the key ideas and characters without having to slog through pages and pages and pages of the primitive lifestyles of the hominids. Hope this helps!"},{"Title":"Manifold: Origin","review":"After having read several of SB's books, including both Manifold books before this (absolutely loved Time Ships and Manifold: Time/Space), I was very disappointed in this &quot;conclusion&quot; to the series. I felt it spent much too much time droning on about the various hominid species on the Red Moon with no clear improvements to the story or plot. I felt like it was more of a sequal to Longtusk.It rehashed most of the same themes...Old Ones reaching back in time to fix the universe...etc, without adding any new ideas of note. Overall, not a book I'd recommend for someone looking to read one of the best new SF writers around, Stephen Baxter!"},{"Title":"Manifold: Origin","review":"This is an extended meditation on the Fermi paradox, the idea that if intelligent life existed elsewhere in the universe we should already have encountered it. Baxter's solution to the paradox is to suggest that our close hominid relatives - Neanderthals, homo erectus etc are the intelligent neighbours we never noticed. However, don't let this philosophical musing put you off. The novel is a cracking good thriller, often dark and violent, sometimes tender and humane. The earth's moon is suddenly replaced by a mysterious new one. Malenfant's wife is marooned there so he sets off on a mission to rescue her. On the way he learns the secret of the red moon and of the evolutionary tinkering it represents.This is the first Stephen Baxter book I've read. Although it is at the end of a trilogy of novels I didn't feel as though I'd missed anything by not having read the other two first.Baxter is sometimes mentioned in relation to 'hard science fiction', a phrase that puts me off. If you are similarly affected by the threat of too much physics and not enough story, do not be put off reading 'Origin'. It is an intelligent, easy read, with plenty of plot, enough characterisation to keep readers happy, and really not that many complicated spaceships."},{"Title":"Manifold: Origin","review":"From front cover to back I felt woven into the multi-layered tapestry of every scene. One of my new favorites of its kind.Sometimes - When you really enjoy a certain genre, writer or subject, one may lack patience or even become subconciously \\"snobbish\\" with the approach, digestion and/or analyzation of any artist's latest release. It is with this in mind that I can only begin to understand the basis of any negative comments about this novel.Completely opening the mind to any eventuality and hypothesis - and Baxter's gift (and gift to us) of colorfully illustrating his epic, Hard Science, reality-based work allows those of us with less than a degree in physics the joy of intelligently pondering miracles such as the origins of galaxies, universes and life itself.The \\"ride\\" of Manifold:Origin was a favorite aspect for me. I smiled every time I saw a new scene title - could be a few pages away, or even a few paragraphs. Pleased, not only in anticipation of which landscape or scenario I would soon be in, but also because I cared deeply about the characters and places I'd just left behind. Getting back there was a pleasure and a relief...and so on, and again...Until at last you're there. Standing on the cradle of the universe, your mind racing with possibilities.

There is more talk about various primate digestive problems than deep sci-fi or philosophical issues. Absolutely pointless."},{"Title":"Manifold: Origin","review":"\\"Origin\\" is the third and final book in Stephen Baxter's Manifold sequence, exploring the conundrum known as the Fermi Paradox: if alien intelligences do exist, why don't we see evidence of them all around us? As in the first two books in the series - \\"Time\\" and \\"Space\\" - it follows the experiences of Reid Malenfant, a washout NASA astronaut, and his wife, Emma Stoney.When a mysterious blue portal appears in the sky over Africa, it sweeps people from the Earth - including Emma - before abruptly vanishing. At the same time the moon is replaced in the sky by the Red Moon, and Malenfant, convinced that this is where his wife has been taken, lobbies NASA for a one-shot mission to bring her back, and to explore this strange new world. What he and Emma are surprised to discover is that the Red Moon is home to all manner of hominids - proto-humans from Earth's past, some of which were thought to have been extinct for millions of years. But who or what gathered them in this one place, and how?While the book begins dramatically, it quickly becomes clear that this instalment lacks the vision and imagination of either \\"Time\\" or \\"Space\\", or even of the related short story collection, \\"Phase Space\\". Much attention is devoted to the viewpoints of the hominids themselves, but since these tend to revolve around the basic activities of survival, there is little to hold the reader's attention, and these sections soon prove tiresome. As a result the narrative progresses slowly, and with little sense of direction. Far more interesting is the story of the technologically superior super-beings known as the Daemons, by means of which Baxter explores how humans might have evolved under different circumstances.Compared to the first two books, which by their nature allowed Baxter to roam free through space and explore many different environments, \\"Origin\\" feels rather claustrophobic, limited to the single setting of the Red Moon and a relatively small cast of characters. As for the final conclusion - the long-awaited resolution to the Fermi Paradox - this feels much like a rehash of themes explored in the earlier two volumes. It is clear that there are big ideas at the centre of the book trying to express themselves: ideas regarding the origin of our own species, the concept of human nature and the question of what makes us different from the animals, and (above all) the role of contingency in the universe. Perhaps a bigger stage was all that was needed.Entertaining but ultimately disappointing, \\"Origin\\" is perhaps the weakest of the Manifold series. To his credit, however, Baxter has never been one to shy away from the big questions, and just as in \\"Time\\" and \\"Space\\", he continues in this novel to push the boundaries of science fiction and what it can do. Thus even if the final product doesn't quite come off, there is nevertheless much to be admired in his attempt."},{"Title":"Flames of Glory","review":"No one can read this book without reflecting on their own lives and family.

The stories began to reveal a deeper meaning of life, death, happiness, sadness, and life's rewards for living by the &quot;Golden Rule.&quot; I was deeply touched of how the author placed into the stories a sense of family values, and I was truly touched by the different meanings I got out of the stories. I refer to the book as a book of poems because of the fact that each story has a heart felt meaning, but you have to truly read the book to obtain these meanings, and once you do, the poems will change your attitude toward life, and possibly bring you that much closer to family values.

On one of the stories, &quot;A Mother's Love&quot;, the story brought tears to my eyes because we have children of our own, making it real easy to relate to just how far a mother would go to help her children. There are no limits to the sacrifices, especially whenever a mother understands that their child will benefit immensely, as long as we give a helping hand and heart. The book is really inspiring in that it helped me to remember those moments of old, and just how important it is to take time out with the family, spending quality time. Another point of the book which really inspired me is the way the elderly are praised. The book gave tribute to the elderly whose contributions to the future of this great country will never be forgotten.

It's divided into four parts and comprises eighteen papers, each of which provides surprisingly mature insights into the topic being discussed given the relative experience level of the authors.The major themes into which the papers are divided are: (1)Competition and Business Impact (consists of six case studies of commercial and government organizations), (2) Information Systems Planning (four papers), (3) Managing the IS Resource (four papers), and (4) Communications and Information (four papers).While I carefully read each of the papers and thought the entire collection to be well researched and presented, my favorites are Part I, Chapter 6 &quot;Technology opportunities for the music industry&quot; (bear in mind that this particular paper was written from a British perspective and predates the issues that have arisen from the US DMCA), Part II, Chapter 10 &quot;IT Based-business process redesign: theoretical foundations, examples and critical assessment&quot; (the subject matter reflects my personal and professional interests and this particular paper is consistent with my own experiences and approach), Part III, Chapter 13 &quot;Ensuring the disaster recovery planning process delivers business continuity - the experience of a major UK retail bank&quot; (excellent material from a real case that exposes the scope and complexity of DR and BCP for organizations that require high availability), and Part IV, Chapter 16 &quot;Appraising investment in IS infrastructure&quot; (business-oriented and should be read by IT infrastructure managers).If you're involved in an IT strategic planning initiative that is attempting to align IT to bushiness this book contains case studies and essays that will generate ideas as well as expose challenges.

She was the only survivor and after months of recovery, she feels she needs a fresh start. She left Boston because she wants to try to start living life without constantly being afraid.She seems to be wandering and never stays in one place for any length of time. She takes odd jobs to survive and just exists. That is until her car breaks down at the outskirts of Angel's Fist, a small town in Wyoming with the Grand Tetons in the background. She ends up taking a job as a cook in Angel Food Caf&eacute; and renting a small apartment over the caf&eacute;.There are wide assortments of characters in town that are all entertaining. Reece meets the sexy writer, Brody, who happens to wander into the caf&eacute; to eat and thus begins the romantic sparks. On her day off, she hikes up on a local trail and witnesses a murder. When she freaks out with flashbacks and hysteria, Brody happens to be on the trail and ready to render aid. They report it to the local sheriff and an investigation begins but turns up no body and no evidence. The town people begin to wonder if Reece imagined it or if it really happened.Reece and Brody are determined to find out what really happened that day on the hiking trail but a series of events begins that make Reece appear as if she is slowly losing her grip on reality. Her close friends and Brody are the only ones who believe in her but others are wondering if she has lost her sanity and if she really saw a woman killed.The character development is excellent as I've come to expect from Nora Roberts. She leaves nothing to the imagination with her characters and we learn everything about what makes them tick. She gives the same attention to detail with her main characters as she does to the support characters. The reader can feel Reece's pain, her confusion, and her fear. You can understand Brody's standoffishness and smile when he lets a bit of his heart shine through. Linda Gail, Reece's coworker, made me smile each time she tried to make Lo jealous with her flirting with other guys. Even the cranky owner of the caf&eacute; is a favorite and I chuckled with her gruffness.The plot was excellent and enough red herrings were thrown out to make the reader really wonder the identity of the killer. This story actually had me fooled longer than most mysteries and I love when that happens! I did figure it out before it was revealed, but the unveiling was tremendous and done in a flair of the dramatic.To sum up this book in one word: Excellent!

But when she finds beautiful Angel's Fist, Wyoming, and sees an ad for a cook, she thinks she's ready to take a step forward. Not settle down--she's sure she isn't ready for that. Still, she can stay for a while, can cook again, can continue her long struggle to re-capture a life that had been stolen from her nearly as completely as life was stolen from the rest of the restaurant staff. If sexy author Brody can re-fire some of her long-dormant hormones, that would be a nice plus, too.When Reece sees a fight--and a killing, she feels as if her past has caught up with her. She was too far away to interfere, but she's certain of what she saw. Still, when the local lawmen check out the site, they find absolutely nothing. No body, no blood, no marks on the ground of where boots might have kicked. The lawmen look, but eventually they have to wonder if the so-called murder might not have been a part of Reece's paranoia. Even Reece has to doubt her sanity when she discovers that she's put things away where they don't belong--and can't remember doing it.While Reece fights with panic, Brody is the one person who believes her, assures her that she is sane, and guesses that the killer may be plotting to make her feel crazy--as in Gaslight. Still, even Brody has his limits and one of those is commitment. He's against it--at least he thinks he is. Which gets confusing when Reece tells him she's in love with him.Nora Roberts is among the most popular writers alive and it's easy to see why. Reece Gilmore makes a powerfully sympathetic character. Her foibles are convincing, her passion--for food and for Brody, is authentic, and her emotional reaction to seeing a second murder is completely real. Roberts also does an excellent job conveying the small-town atmosphere of Angel's Fist, Wyoming--where everyone knows what everyone else is doing. In contrast to the wonderfully developed Reece, I thought Brody was a bit flat. Still, Roberts sucks the reader in and keeps the pages turning.ANGELS FALL is an enjoyable romance with a nice mystery embedded in it. It's certainly possible to guess the killer's identity, but you're better than I am if you're completely sure until near the end."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Nora Roberts is a great fiction writer. I've enjoyed every book I've read written by her. I can't put them down once I start. If it's a trilogy, I have to buy all three so I'm not interrupted!! Having gone through graduate school and a postmasters program, it was time to read something nonstressful and these books have been a fantastic way of relaxing and losing myself in her words. The books cover so many areas under one cover,eg. romance, suspense, murder, relationships, lose, fun,fantasy, supernatural/mystical, and trials and tribulations of life."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Reece Gilmore's car is smoking from the radiator as she comes to Angel's Fist, Wyoming. Reviewing her cash on hand, Reece realizes it is time to stop \\"running\\" for awhile and get a job. Reece is from Boston and something horrible happened to her that has her emotionally distraught and overly cautious to say the least. She sees a sign in a cafe window that a cook is needed and figures it is a sign that she should stop here in this beautiful scenic small town.Joanie puts her right to work when she applies for the job and the general mercantile store owner helps her get her car in ths shop and points out a hotel. Reece, in spite of her compulsions such as double, triple, quadruple checking that doors are locked, and so forth, starts feeling welcome in this friendly town by Joanie, Linda-gail - a waitress, and the other townspeople so she moves into a room above the diner and goes on a hike.Reece is enjoying her hike and relaxing when she is observing across the lake with her binoculars and sees a man and a woman arguing. The woman is especially aggressive and slapping the man who knocks her down and then appears to choke her until her feet stop kicking and she stops moving. Reece is shocked by what she has seen and hurries down the trail to get Brody, a writer she passed on her way up the mountain. He calms her down and comes with her but no one is there when they look through the binoculars. Reece and Brody go back to his cabin and report it to the small-town sheriff. He can't find any evidence there was even any people there - no footprints, no flattened grass, nothing.People are doubting Reece and the story of what she saw spreads through the town. Reece also starts finding that she may have done things she doesn't remember such as marking up a map with a felt pen.What is happening to her? Did she see something or has she gone totally off the deep end? And why does only Brody really believe her?I had my share of suspects and guesses but felt the ending was surprising and well done! A thoroughly enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I bought this book thinking that I would sell it after I got through it, since it was a hardcover...but now I find that I want to keep it. Angels Fall is a very compelling and entertaining read. I enjoyed the characters and the plot...I generally am not a fan of mysteries/scary stuff but this is balanced out with great chemistry and dialogue. I found myself rooting for the heroine and cringing with all the roadblocks that the villain threw at her...but her journey really tugged at me. The hero was just what she needed and the cast of characters who supported her were also very interesting and likeable... I wasn't a huge fan of Blue Smoke because I found the balance between love and violence slightly aschew but I feel that Nora has redeemed herself, in my eyes...She is still my favorite writer..."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I am a long-time and quite devoted fan of Nora Roberts' books and will snatch them up the moment they hit the shelf. However, I must also admit that her hardback romantic suspense novels have always been my least favorite of the books she writes. I honestly don't know what it is about them that tones down my enjoyment level -- perhaps it's merely the cost of the book -- but I've observed over the years that my reaction to them is generally lukewarm. Not in the case of Angel's Fall, however! I loved it, and it drew me in from the very beginning.Reece is a likeable person and someone I felt I could identify with with her basketload of neuroses. (Not sure what that says about me, exactly.) Nora did a great job layering on the mystery of Reece's past, and when the traumatic event of her past was finally revealed, it wasn't at all what I had been expecting. One of the finest aspects of the book was watching Reece grow stronger over the course of the book, becoming a better version of herself.Some people, I have read in various reviews, had a hard time warming up to Brody, but I liked him from the start -- surliness and all. I liked especially that he seemed to give Reece exactly what she needed -- blunt, not-always-gentle honesty and simple, unquestioning acceptance. With Nora's books -- well, any book, for that matter -- I'm always more drawn to the characters than the action going on around them, and Reece and Brody [...] in from the get-go.Toward the end of the book, I did notice that the language and style seemed very reminiscent of the tone Nora takes when she pens her J.D. Robb books. Perhaps that was because this was a suspense book, focusing on a murder investigation, as is always the case with each new In Death. In Angel's Fall, there was one scene in particular that jarred me a little with its similarity of rhythm and lingo and cold processing of the facts. It fairly screamed \\"Eve and Roarke\\". Still...I'm a fan of that series, too, so that's no great detraction in my eyes.I want to say something about the villain, but I also don't want to post anything spoilerish. Suffice it to say that I appreciated very much the fact that the \\"bad guy\\" was not a psycho. There have been a few instances where Nora has used that approach -- particularly with her romantic suspense books -- and sometimes it has seemed like a cop-out. In this case, however, the villain is very human, and that added a dimension of heartbreak and realism to the story that I appreciated.Another great job by Nora, and now I'm REALLY ready for the Circle Trilogy -- coming soon to a bookstore near you."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"In Angels Fall, Reece Gilmore leaves the east and a horrible history and finds herself in the small town of Angel's Fist, Wyoming. She stays for a spell, getting a job as a cook at the local diner. Unbeknownst to the locals, Reece brings a background in sophisticated cooking and the memories of a nearly fatal attack by robbers in her former job. This latter event coats Reece in a patina of fear. Soon after she thinks she is settling down, she thinks she witnesses a murder, but there is no evidence of this crime. When things start happening to her as well, she wonders if she is on the road to recovery, or falling in another abyss.Nora Roberts makes Reece's fear and anxiety real, but I felt the continued panic attacks and the confusion of her memory of whether she was really having these memory lapses was overdone. In addition, Roberts really wanted the reader to suspect Lo as the bad guy, to take attention away from others. That \\"other\\" was pretty lame, and the bad guy really got away with too many feats of magic in that small town. For novels like this to work, the characters have to be believable. Some of the characters central to the story failed this test.The first 75% was better than the final 25%. I hate it when that happens."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"The story is all about a girl who experienced a horrible tragedy in her life and hit the road, trying to escape reality. She settles in a small tourist town and faces even more challenges. Justice does prevail, but there is a surprise in the end. You will love it! If I could, I would give it 6 stars instead of 5.Marty WurtzAuthor of Deceptions and Betrayals"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Let me start by saying that I always read Nora Roberts books. If she wrote on cereal boxes, I would read those as well. Angels Fall, while good, is a little slower to start than others of Roberts' books. The author takes a good bit of time to develop her characters and to make the fear credible. But that sometimes gets in the way of the pace of the story. By the time this book was over, the suspense had picked up, as had the pace. And the ending was certainly satisfying. Angels Fall is worth persevering through the slow beginning. Recommended!"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I really enjoyed this book...in fact, it was difficult putting it down so I could get some things done around the house! I didn't figure out \\"who done it\\" until the end of the book. I recommend this book to those who enjoy a good mystery."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"\\"Angels Fall\\" is one of my all-time favorite books by Nora Roberts. The characters are believable, the plot is full of suspense, and the setting is breathtaking. Once again, Nora Roberts does not disappoint when it comes to describing the lush mountain scenery.If you're a Nora Roberts fan, you'll like this book a lot better than the previous one, \\"Northern Lights.\\" Not only did I find Reece more likable than Meg, but there is also a lot of humor in this book, and the chemistry between Reece and Brody is just perfect. Definitely recommend!"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Even though this is the first Nora Roberts' book I've reviewed, I'm a huge fan and have read almost all of her books. The only reason I didn't give this book five stars is because it's not as in depth as her other books - such as Northern Lights - one of my all time favorites. Don't get me wrong, Angels Fall wasn't lacking in any regard. I thoroughly enjoyed the characterization - impeccable as usual - Reece and Brody read like real people. The plot was intriguing and even though I wasn't too surprised when the \\"bad guy\\" was revealed, it didn't at all detract from a very enjoyable read. Nora Roberts seems to write effortlessly while sucking you into the story, making you feel as if you're watching it all unravel on the big screen."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"A lot of writer's seem to hit a point, after they've written a number of books where they're plots become formulaic, predictable and boring. Nora Roberts (in my opinion) is one of the best at avoiding this, though the occasional book shows signs of it.Angels Fall had more of a fresh feel to it, with an on-the-edge heroine and a bit of a maverick for the male lead. The characters were nicely fleshed out and you're sympathetic enough that this becomes a can't-put-it-down book. I'd rank this as one of her best, right up there with Naked in Death (and the first part of that series), the MacGregors series' and Sanctuary.You should buy this one."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"This is by far the best Roberts book I've read in the last several years. The writing, characterizations, and plot are all excellent. I particularly liked the secondary characters, who added a great deal of breadth and depth to the novel (Joanie is a trip!). Brody, the reluctant somewhat anti-hero, was fun to read about. In fact, the lack of sentimentalism on the part of most of the characters was a refreshing change, and the dialogue sparkles. From the geographical descriptions to the murder mystery, this book doesn't make one misstep, and it is a most satisfying read.Well done!"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"A typically fantastic novel from Nora Roberts. The heroine is strong, but realistic. The romance is actually believable - two people who aren't entirely sure that getting together is what they want to be doing, but find themselves drawn to each other anyway. The suspense is first-rate, and I didn't figure out whodunit until the end (always a pleasant surprise).The only reason this didn't get 5 stars from me is because it felt strangely familiar - almost like a fourth book in the \\"In The Garden\\" trilogy. Slightly damaged young woman arrives in new home, where she gets support and encouragement from a strong older woman. Quirky locals are met, friends are made, not-quite-normal goings on and romance ensue. I'd like to see Nora move away from this mold a bit further; from the descriptions I've read of the upcoming \\"Morrigan's Cross\\", that series will hopefully be more of a departure."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"This is a great book! Very hard to put down! A great vacation read!"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Hmm, quite a disappointment, especially after splurging on the hardcover edition. Set as a kind of \\"Rockies Rear Window,\\" this is one slow story. Endless pages of crazy-making when I'd already guessed the outcome about halfway through. Finally skipped ahead to finish the book. I had really looked forward to Angels Fall, too :( If you are a Roberts fan, don't spend the money on the hardcover, wait for the paperback, go to the library, or borrow from a friend. Not worth the price."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Wonderful read and the description of people and places awesome as usual!!! Loved the mind of Reece Gilmore. I just finished the book so I could be ready for the Lifetime Movie!!! Can't wait!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I THOUGHT THE BOOK WAS VERY SLOW MOVING. HAD TROUBLE WANTING TO READ MORE AFTER I PUT THE BOOK DOWN."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Although her story line is rather predictable, two people not looking for love manage to find it, usually one with some overwhelming problem, it's still a great read!!"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Nora Roberts fans will be happy with this book. It has all the elements of a great story, including an exciting mystery, fully developed characters, and a good love story. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"i have read the j d robb novels and enjoyed them. i have now read two of nora roberts other novels and really like them. she is better than daniel steele."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Nora Roberts is my all time favorite writer. As soon as I see her books are available for pre-order, I order them. I also love her as J.D. Robb, the next one is due out soon. However, Angel Falls was a wonderful book about a woman who was facing herself and her future and finding victory at the end. I have a strong desire to tour Montana and Wyoming. She made it sound so beautiful."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I really enjoyed Angels Fall, in part because I love the area of Wyoming in which it is set (I feel the same way about Montana Sky). But it was really more because, as much as I enjoy Nora Robert's writings, I am just not as into the whole fantasy, witchcraft-y, ghost-y type thing that she so often writes about. So I read all her books and enjoy them, but wish away the supernatural part of them. In Angels Fall, I didn't have to do that...it was perfect just as it was, and, in fact, was my favorite Nora book since the Chesapeake Bay trilogy (which, despite the supernatural part, was such a wonderful, heartwarming story I wouldn't change a thing!).Angels Fall is a bit similar to Northern Lights, but the latter so closely copied the TV show Northern Exposure that I was a little disappointed. Take a similar concept (except that in Angels Fall it is the female lead moving to new territory to overcome personal obstacles relating to a crime), similar characters and setting (rough, outdoorsy setting, a diner and its customers), and a mystery to be solved, and you have Nora's latest. Still, the characters are likable, the situations believable, and even if you have the crime figured out shortly after it happens, it's interesting to see how it all turns out."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"This was so much fun, I didn't even care that I guessed the bad guy's identity from the get-go.More like this!"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Angels Fall is another winner. If you like the Nora Roberts books you've already read, then you will also love this one. Great characters and a great romantic mystery as always."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Another one of Nora Roberts' suspense books, with a bit of humor, that was difficult to put down. As usual, very well written and a page turner. I figured out \\"who dun it\\" before the end, but had to read on to find out how this person was finally caught."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Yep, a good old Nora Roberts book. I enjoyed it, as I do almost everything she writes. The scenery was breathtaking, as always, and I enjoyed her heroine very much. I felt like the hero got a little shortchanged in the character development department, but that may be just because the heroine had such a surplus of \\"character.\\" The mystery was a good one, crafted expertly, and kept me turning the pages. Nice winter read. Made me wish for spring in Wyoming."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"This is a page turner to be sure, without much mystery. You know who the killer is fairly early on. The relationship between Reece & Brody could have used more development. This is a fairly deep story of a woman recovering from the trauma of a shooting spree in her east coast restaurant where she was the sole survivor. She deals with it in an understandable way. Overall the characterization and dialogue were exciting for the suspenceful romance genre. Reece Gilmores fears built up to a crescendo making this a fast read. However, there was too much cursing & the character development was not as rich in detail as her other books."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Reece Gilmore is traveling across the country trying to outrace demons that haunt her past. In the small town of Angels Fist, her car starts having complications and she is running low on money. Seeing a help wanted sign in a diner window she decides to stay awhile or at least until she makes a few dollars for her journey. The townspeople are a colorful but friendly cast intrigued by this new addition. One of which is Brody a local author that has made Angels Fist his home.While investigating her newest locale, hiking up the mountains she spots a couple arguing and a possible murder. With a past like Reece's where she was the only survivor in a restaurant massacre it is more than her fragile mind can take in. Can she trust her mind not to be playing tricks on her, or is this all just a cruel hoax? One thing is for certain something is dangerously wrong in the little town of Angels Fist.Nora Roberts once again delivers a novel that will keep you turning pages long after the sun goes down. Reece, her main character throughout the novel has a battle raging inside herself that nags at the back of your brain until the very end. Nora does a great job in the words she uses careful not to give to much information and it shows. The flow of this book is effortless and shows how much knowledge Nora Roberts has for the written word.Spiked with intensity, suspense, and self awareness Angels Fall does not disappoint. One of Nora's better novels, it sure to be enjoyed by her base of devoted readers and new ones alike. Angels Falls has depth to it not many others have reached. While this is not this reviewer's favorite work by this author it does rank among the top, not an easy task by an author who has come up with so many wonderful books.Reviewed by JoyceCopyright 2006 CK2S Kwips and Kritiques.

The storyline, interesting though it is, pales in comparison to the rich, eccentric characters that populate a small town where everyone knows everyone else's business and nothing is what it seems. And hidden in their midst is a cold-blooded murderer who will do anything, kill anyone to cover up the brutal murder of his former lover.Reece Gilmore is a lone woman traveling wherever her whims take her. She is the lone survivor of a brutal killing spree that occurred in a restaurant where she worked. Since then, she's been trying to piece her life back together and win the battle over the panic attacks that have become a daily occurrence.Reece's travels eventually lead her to Angels Fist, a small town in Wyoming, with a busted radiator and little money in her pocket. She takes on a job as a cook in the local caf&eacute; and rents a hotel room. The friendly but peculiar locals welcome her with open arms and Reece soon begins to feel at home in the quirky little town; that is, until she becomes an inadvertent witness to the beating and eventual murder of an unidentified woman.Not long after, Reece finds herself not only fighting for her life but her very sanity as the murderer attempts to discredit and frighten Reece into running away. But Reece is done running and she's determined to fight back.I really enjoyed reading this book. Ms Roberts is a gifted storyteller. Her talent is with words, weaving them just right so the characters really pop in your mind; such as how Reece deals with the onset of panic attacks: She recites multiplication tables or recipes. Reece also relies on road signs, impulses and even the look of the weather to help decide where she'll stay next.The author takes her time in laying out the groundwork for the storyline and even painting a vivid picture of the surrounding environment. It made me feel as if I was actually there, in the story, watching all this unfold.I highly recommend Angels Fall. It'll keep you riveted to the last page."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Another Roberts story I couldn't put down even to go to sleep. The details of Angel Fist were so engaging I forgot I was sitting in my living room in Dayton, OH. I could feel Reese's painful memories and all of the other emotions she was experiencing in her short time in Angel Fist. Nora Roberts description of the cabins in the woods, the rivers and the mountains were so explicit. I could hear the laughter and the hum of the patrons at the diner eating the wonderful food prepared by Reese. It was hard to tolerate the fact that the sheriff dismissed Reese's story that she saw a woman killed on the edge of the river. Great beginning middle and ending as always. Can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"This is my umpteenth Nora Roberts novel, and it is right up there with the Chesapeake series. I like the way she structured the story, letting the facts about the heroine unfold a little at a time. I can also say that I never saw the ending coming, and never suspected the character that \\"did it\\". That, too, is unusual. The overall character development was good, and the setting sounded quite nice. The way the two lead characters interacted and finally, fell for each other was refreshing, as well. Keep this one for re-reading on a cold, rainy winter night."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Reece Gilmore, a victim of a restaurant spree killing, lands in Angel's Fist Wyoming after fleeing her bad memories in Boston. Her bad luck continues as Reece witnesses a murder while she was hiking, but when she got help, the body and and evidence of a crime was gone.I was very entertained for the first 100 pages of the story. The set-up of the plot was good, and the characters were interesting. I'm not sure what happened, but the story really started to drag. I did like the heroine's spunkiness, but it wasn't enough to save a substandard plot. For a really good Nora Roberts novel read SANXCTUARY instead."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Nora Roberts and the New York Times bestseller list go hand in hand. Since 1999, every book published under her name has hit this list. With more than 280 million books in print, an average of 21 Nora Roberts books sold every minute, 124 New York Times bestsellers and over two million hits a month to her website, Roberts has legions of fans eagerly awaiting her next books --- and upcoming movies. Lifetime Television announced in February 2006 that they will produce four Lifetime Original Movies over the next year based on her bestselling novels.Everything about Roberts's latest release, ANGELS FALL, is breathtaking --- the writing, the romance, the rapture of the summer scenery amidst the Grand Tetons. The wide open spaces that surround the \\"snow-dipped peaks of the Tetons\\" and the warm reception the heroine receives from a group of small town characters is a welcome break from the many recently released Chick Lit books set amidst the glitz and glamour of New York, Paris and St. Barts. I will be the first to say that I love glitz and glamour, but the majestic setting and vivid descriptions of \\"miles of wildflowers on the sage flats\\" of Wyoming drew me enticingly to a place I'd never been. That is what a good book does --- it allows you to escape to another place and experience new things that persuade you to grow as a person.Healing from the trauma of a near-death situation, Reece Gilmore finds peace and Brody, a sexy novelist in this small-town, put-the-pieces-of-the-puzzle-together novel. When Reece arrives in Angels Fist, population 623, she is skittish, paranoid and fanatical about locking doors. She has panic dreams about being the lone survivor of a random killing spree in the Boston restaurant where she worked. All of her close friends and co-workers were killed and she bears the scar of the gunshot wound that nearly ended her life. Reece has spent time in a psychiatric hospital, but left Boston and traveled cross country to \\"settle in for a few weeks, pick up some work...then move on...\\"As luck would have it, the town diner is looking for a cook. Reece is enticed by the opportunity to get back into a kitchen, a place she once called home, and decides to stay in Angel's Fist and work for Joanie, a tough but fair businesswoman who still smokes Marlboro Lights. Linda-gail is a waitress in this small town diner, in love with Lo, Joanie's son and town heartthrob. Linda-gail's friendship becomes a healing force for Reece, who in the first week of settling into Angel's Fist witnesses a murder down by the river. Brody is the only one who believes her story. He sees the terror in her eyes and knows she is not crazy. The killer covers his tracks well and begins to stalk Reece with a series of subtle events designed to make her think she's losing it again, but she is determined to uncover the identity of the murdered woman, despite the sheriff's inability to find a trace of evidence. Several characters become prime suspects in the reader's mind, and Roberts masterfully reveals the weakness that leads to murder.As the romance between Reece and Brody builds to tantalizing ecstasy, Brody wonders if this is where he \\"wants to be.\\" \\"He wanted most to comfort her, to smooth out all her troubles. No one else had ever reached that tenderness inside him, no one else had ever coaxed it out until it drenched him.\\" Roberts writes the male perspective with raw intensity. Brody's surprise picnic for Reece exceeds romantic fantasy. The location is where Reece and Brody shared their first kiss, the scenery is \\"pinks and blues, vibrant reds and purples, sunny yellows spiked and spread among the soft green of sage\\" --- \\"not only wine, but cheese and bread and fat purple grapes,\\" the scorching kiss framed by \\"the sun sliding behind the mountain.\\"The rhythm of doing what is familiar keeps Reece from believing she's the \\"town cuckoo.\\" Reece brings her Cordon Bleu gourmet cuisine, fresh herbs and paninis to Joanie's diner, where elk chops and stew reign. It's a combination that allows each woman their creativity. A day in Manhattan is more my style, but a moose crossing the road and the majesty of the \\"white-frosted mountains\\" that \\"stood in dazzling splendor\\" reminded me that simplicity can be so perfect. As the mystery of murder in a small town unfolds, so does a bright future for Reece. Some men come into your life when you need them most and make a profound and lasting impact; they remember what your favorite flower is and give a bouquet of them to you with love in their eyes and their hearts. Brody lets Reece know that she is where he wants to be.--- Reviewed by Hillary Wagy"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Reece Gilmore arrives in the beautiful and seemingly idyllic town of Angel's Fist, Wyoming with a car in need of repairs and almost out of cash. She has been following wherever the signposts lead her on the odyssey upon which she has embarked in an attempt to heal the trauma to her psyche that has remained even after her body has recovered from the almost fatal wounds inflicted upon her in Boston two years ago. She in fact survived a nightmare, and now suffers terribly from them; but she has concluded that the medication that kept her calm for so long has also become an impediment to her recovery and is now ready to take the next step in her rehabilitation. Thus, when she sees a sign in a restaurant window for a cook, this upscale Boston chef becomes a short order cook in a wilderness town.She has always traveled light and kept moving while being weighed down by all her personal baggage; despite the friendly people and the beautiful scenery and the calm which it engenders in her, she assumes that after a brief stop she will resume her wandering in search of her new identity. As she tells Brody, a local writer, in an uncharacteristic moment of self-disclosure \\"I want to be normal again, to stop being afraid. I want to be who I was two years ago, and I never will be. So I'm trying to find out who I'm going to be for the rest of my life.\\"Brody is a loner and novelist whose murder mysteries intrigue the area residents as much as his unexplained exit from his position as a newspaper columnist in Chicago and relocation to \\"the Fist\\" two years ago. Despite himself, Brody becomes increasingly fascinated with the mystery which Reece represents. He observes her \\"standing at the center window, staring out at the lake ...[with her] secret eyes\\" and \\"thought she looked more like a portrait in a frame than flesh and blood. And he wondered just where she'd left the rest of herself. And why.\\" Then they are thrown together by a chance encounter on a trail outside town. Through her binoculars, Reece observes a violent encounter across the Snake River which she believed culminated in a murder; she rushes down the trail in terror and returns to her vantage point with Brody but the area where she observed the attack is deserted and when the police search the area there are absolutely no signs that a struggle occurred.As Reece's troubled history becomes known and she exhibits occasionally fragile and even bizarre behavior, it becomes increasingly difficult for the town's residents to believe her version of events and as the questions proliferate she periodically questions whether she should move on once again. However, despite Brody's desire to remain uninvolved, he does believe Reece and their increasingly close relationship combines with the support of her boss Joanie to provide sufficient support that she becomes determined to identify the murdered woman and locate her killer.There are a lot of marvelous supporting characters in this novel, and the author takes time to develop their personalities to the extent that we recognize any of them as those wonderful characters who people small town America and who all immediately know all the details of any event which occurs in town. There is also adequate time for the plot to evolve, and the book is full of wonderful phraseology and excellent descriptions evocative of the gorgeous area in which it is set and which is an integral element of the story. Of course, it includes the detailed scenes of passion that are one of Nora Roberts' trademarks; in fact, the storyline involves two intertwined stories of romance which both are essential elements of the plot.As my rating indicates, I enjoyed this story tremendously despite the few minor criticisms that I detail below. This is the first Nora Roberts' book that I have read, but not the first book by this author. This seemingly contradictory statement is explained by the fact Roberts also is the author of the ... IN DEATH futuristic detective series featuring Eve Dallas, of which I have become a devoted fan. However, until ANGELS FALL I have avoided Roberts' romance novels as a genre which does not usually appeal to me. However, I was attracted to this story both by the psychological nature of the drama (which seemed more like a suspense thriller than a romance) and by the locale where it occurred. (Many of the references to the Jackson Hole area and the Snake River recalled fond memories of my immense enjoyment of a recent visit there. One minor caution is that the author uses the narrative technique of telling the story through multiple viewpoints, at times I found this a little disconcerting due to the number of viewpoints which are utilized. However, the increasingly rapid juxtaposition of these various viewpoints as the story escalated toward the climax very effectively increased the tension. My only disappointment was that quite early in the story I deduced what Reece had observed and the reason for the consequences that ensued. However, there was enough misdirection provided by the many enigmatic clues that I was never completely sure that my guess was correct, and in any event my identification of the villain only marginally detracted from my enjoyment of this very absorbing tale.In summary, while there are a lot of tension filled moments in this novel, the conclusion makes it clear that this is at the core a romance about a voyage of self discovery for both Reece and Brody. Thus, ANGELS FIST should appeal not only to both Roberts' legion of fans, but in addition to a wider audience of readers who enjoy psychological suspense embedded in detective stories peopled by complex and interesting characters with satisfying and encouraging conclusions.Tucker Andersen"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I thought this book was wonderfull. The story line just kept you guessing, and guessing as to who was the one trying to get under Reece's skin. When she moves to this new town, she witnesses a muder, but no one believes her because she has a history of being paranoid, and hysterical. The only one who truly believes her is Brody, who is determined to have Reece for himself. As she strugles to decipher if its her doing all these weird things she doesn't remember doing, Brody is there to support her, and protect her. He is worried that someone is doing things to frighten Reece into leaving the small quite town. The book keeps you guesing as to who is the one doing these things to Reece, and how far will they go to get her out of town, even if it means ending her life. These small acts like circling the place over and over where she witnessed the murder on a map, and crossing out pictures of her dead friends in her wallet, start to freak her out. Shes about ready to leave town but of course Brody is there to stop her. As her relationship with Brody grows, so does the danger she is facing. If you love mystery, thriller, and romance this book is perfect for you."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"This story was very lame and very predictable. Come on Nora, can't you come up with something new? The man is always handsome in a rugged sort of way, the woman is always beautiful, but maybe a bit thin. They usually hate each other at the beginning, or try to one-up each other in being the biggest smartass. Puleeze. And the sex scenes are always the same. The characters were totally unappealing. Particularly Reece. She certainly thinks the world revolves around herself. I would love for once, for a character such as Reece to be wrong, at least about one thing or another, or that the story's \\"couple\\" would go their separate ways at the end."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Two years ago in a family owned Florida restaurant where Reece Gilmore worked as a chef, a group of killers went on a murdering frenzy leaving only one survivor whom the predators thought was dead too. Reece is heartbroken as she thought of the owners as family; she also received two bullets and she saw her best friend killed. Reece enters a psychiatric hospital for trauma treatment before leaving her past behind to seek some solace from her anxieties and fears.Reece stops running when she reaches Angel Falls nestled in the Grand Teton Mountains of Wyoming where she begins to truly heal by accepting work as a cook at a diner her first cooking job since the lethal incident. When she goes hiking Reece sees through her binoculars a man kill a woman; she runs to find help and meets Brady a writer. By the time they get the sheriff to the crime scene, all traces of a homicide are gone. The sheriff does not believe Reece while someone tries to gaslight her into believing she is having a break down, which everyone except Brady assumes is true.At first readers will lean towards the predominant opinion of the townsfolk that Reece is psychologically regressing and the incidents are not real except inside her mind. However, her spirit and refusal to back down assisted by Brady's belief soon begins to persuade the audience that maybe her paranoia is based on a genuine attempt to drive her insane. The readers' turnaround is why Nora Roberts is one of the best at writing romantic suspense as demonstrated once again with the exciting ANGEL FALLS. Nora Roberts is at her very best in this great thriller.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I writting this eventhough I haven't finish the book yet.

I enjoyed it and will pass it along to my NR fans"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I really enjoyed this novel from Nora Roberts...she rarely disappoints me. I liked the main characters, althought I will admit I didn't like Brody in the beginning of the book but came of enjoy him by the end.I also liked Reece's character becasue she was trying so hard to get past her trauma but just couldn't get a handle on it.Now I will admit I guessed the killer in the beginning of the book but it didn't take away from the story at all because I enjoyed the characters. Nora has a way of making you want to know more about all of her characters."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Ok, I must admit that I am more of a reader of suspense novels than I am romance. This possibly could have effected my opinion of this book. However, I feel like Nora can do a lot better than this. The whole issue with no one in the town believing the main character about the murder she saw got REALLY old. The perfect Nora Roberts book has just the right balance of romance and suspense. I feel that this one had too much romance and not enough suspenseful action to keep the pages turning."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"After I had finished reading this book,I just want to scream. I had paid almost 20 bucks and what I got was nothing new. The love story was just lame and Brody was not a kind of hero that make my knees weak. The plot and story lines were familiar with her former books. Maybe it is because I have read a lot of her books so I didn't fine something new and exciting anymore. You know I have discovered the new author that I really enjoyed reading again. Nothing to fear or you can't hide from Karen Rose were the better choice for suspense novel today"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I love Nora Roberts' books. But this was just meh. I thought the writing was mediocre in some parts. This could be because I listened it on CD ... but still, it was just meh."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"This is one of the best Nora Roberts books that she has written , and I have read nearly all of them . I could hardly put the book down !"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I don't remember the last time I was engaged by Nora Roberts, so it is remarkable enough. But the book was good, too. And since I won't spoil anything that is about all I'm going to say.Still, she offered us tactile, believable, respectful representations of people, men and women alike.I recommend it."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"NewBERRY Street in Boston? Where's that? Though thousands get it wrong (I did Google search and got 485,000 hits for Newberry St Boston) so why should Nora get it right?As far as the book goes, well, I skipped to the end to see who bad guy was before I could continue reading it. Some days I just don't need the suspense. It would have been nice if this had come out in paperback and not hardcover. Mass killings too. Enough of that in the world too. Could have been worse though - could have had a fairy in it or a witch. I did finish it though so I'll give it three stars.I think the point of the seemingly nasty hero with a heart of gold was that the heroine had enough well meaning people in her life that she needed ultra strong dose of the opposite. It helped her stay grounded in the real world."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Angel Falls is a page-turner; a well-spun romantic mystery that had me spellbound. Nora Roberts is a gifted author who could have written this same book without the illicit sex between Reece and Brody. They were in bed together before their second date. How much more meaningful and sweeter the story had Miss Roberts left out the writhing and lust between two unmarried people.Call me old-fashioned, but I gave away the only other Nora Roberts book I had (unread as yet) because I was pretty sure I would find more \\"if it feels good, do it\\" fare. Such a shame that such a talented author feels she needs the crutch of unmarried sex to sell a book.....I would have enjoyed this book twice as much without that element. In fact, I feel guilty for having finished it..."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"this kid needed to get life - she was still cooking eggs after almost being murdered. Wasn't until last 100 pages that I stopped skimming."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I've read two or three novels by Nora Roberts and this was just terrible. First off it was terribly slow. I don't mind slow books if the literary quality is stellar. A damaged heroine trying to recover can make for some serious tearjerking reading, but this one didn't. It was slow and written in a slapdash, cheap romance novel kind of way so I wasn't interested at all.The hero, if you can call him that, is more than a little gruff. I don't mind gruff. One of my favorite romance novels is \\"A Virgin River Christmas\\" about a mountain man who roars at people to get them to leave him alone. Talk about gruff. But Roberts's hero constantly puts the heroine down, calling her stupid. He never warms up, is only using her for sex, he even says so, and never really has that epiphany where he geniunely loves her. She has to force him to admit he wants her to stay in Angel's Fist and that's exactly how the whole relationship comes across, forced.I really thought it was going to be a modern re-telling of Rear Window but it was so dull and uninteresting. I have another book by Roberts that's TBR, if that one is not any better, I will just give up reading her forever. The sex scene wasn't even all that great. Plus, she's kind of damaged, psychologically and she's resisting and he does it anyway. But even that doesn't get my back up. I wasn't even pissed. Even that wasn't written in a way that made me care about the characters.Just....ugh. Steer clear of this one. I wonder if it was an early story she played around with, stuck in a drawer, and years later re-discovered it and published it. Because I find it hard to believe NORA ROBERTS could have become NORA ROBERTS writing crap like this."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I really loved this book. The suspense was great and keeping you in the dark about the killer until the end was great. Kept you wondering and trying to figure who the killer was and why. Great story."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The descriptive details were wonderful. You can picture yourself in the scene with the mountains and lakes. My only disappointment was Reece being so jittery and fainting so easily. Seemed a little childish. I also would have liked to have her secret from Boston kept a secret for a little longer. All in all, it was very good reading. I could not put the book down. I had to know who was after her."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I was elated to find such a good price on this book.

Still suffering some of the aftereffects of her horrendous attack, she is hoping that Angel's Fist will provider her some relief from the panic attacks and fear that have taken over her life.She settles into the small town working as a cook in the local diner, but while hiking Reece sees a murder take place. She is certain of what she has seen, and the only one that will believe her is a popular author Brody. Brody believes Reece, but has also been informed of her past. He sees some of her unusual behavior, but sticks with his gut instinct that she is telling the truth.Not many can describe a setting like NR. I can picture it very clearly when I read her books. Reece is not your typical main character. She has issues and at times is very fragile. I liked the characters, and the secondary characters were also very well done."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"This book has it all , Romance and a Thriller .To me it is the best of Nora Roberts .Reece leaves big city Boston after she has been shot in a restuarant , and heads out driving not knowing for sure where she is going and then she comes to the small town Angel Fist and thinks this will do for awhile, as her car is breaking down , she sets out and finds a job she loves and meets Brody on a trail she is hiking .

She gets a job as a cook, gets a small apartment. All big steps. But she still needs her doors locked and the lights on at night... She meets Brody, a local crime writer, and the sexual tension immediately tightens as Brody sees past her frightened, brittle surface to the incredibly brave woman, battling to overcome her fears. One day, on a deceptively peaceful hike, Reece is horrified to witness a terrible murder. She sees a man strangle a woman, who fights back until she dies. Freaked beyond belief, Reece runs screaming to Brody, just a little further down the trail, but when he and the sheriff investigate there's absolutely no evidence that anyone was there. No murdered woman, no body, no disturbance on the trails, nothing. Everyone except Brody thinks Reece is nuts, and they don't believe her story. Then funny little things start to happen, making Reece doubt her own sanity. Brody doesn't, however, and his faith in Reece makes her fall absolutely head over heels in love with him - to his disconcertment! Between the food, the intense loving, Brody wrestling with his book, and Reece wrestling with her demons, this is such a gripping read you won't want to put it down. ...I nearly guessed the villain, but I was wrong..."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Nora Roberts' books have always got my attention and Angel Falls is another marvelous tale by this author. There are numerous reviews that detail the story so I'll be brief. The story follows Reece Gilmore's journey to escape reality from the east coast by settling in a far away town of Angel's Fist, Wyoming. While hiking in Montana she witnesses a murder and has a hard time convincing people that she actually did witness this crime. Then she finds a believer: his name is Brody and the pace and suspense begins in the story.Although the story line is rather predictable, it was still a wonderful story. Also, Ms. Roberts writing of the descriptive scenes of Wyoming and Montana was wonderful and almost made me want to take a trip there to see these beautiful states. Maybe some day."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I am so pleased to report that the old Nora Roberts is back!! This book was a delight with great characters and great suspense. And nothing too terrifying/creepy like some of her books. Honestly, I have not really enjoyed her releases over the past 2-3 years, but I got hopeful when I saw good ratings on Amazon.Reece is traveling the country, trying to redefine herself after witnessing a terrible crime. She ends up in a small town in Wyoming with a resident good-looking, reclusive author (of course). There are a lot of charming characters, and the story keeps you guessing until the end. The romance is great... like the old days. You really find yourself caring about Reece and Brody.Great Job, Nora!!!! I look forward to more like this!"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Thank you, Nora. I really enjoyed Angel Falls. An exellent book. And you know why? Because FINALLY Nora wrote a book about the relationship between two people WITHOUT a witch/warlock/faerie/ghost/empath/legend/evil curse etc anywhere in sight. Just a really great book about real people and how they cope with the various situations that affect their lives.I have everything Nora Roberts has ever published and I'm really dreading her new trilogy. Vampires for crying out loud. Not sure I'll even buy those. Please, Nora, enough of the cult stuff. Go back to the really excellent relationship novels you used to write."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"A thoroughly enjoyable page-turner that kept me guessing until the end! I couldn't put it down. Reece's character develops with a complexity that befits someone who has suffered a horrendous emotional trauma. I like that Brody's character is not the perfect man but rather is a bit rough around the edges, with a few flaws, though I would have liked his character to have had a bit more background to flesh it out. The relationship between Reece and Brody clicks in spite of (or because of?) their imperfections and quirks. Their chemistry is irresistible. The mystery/suspense is well done without being too graphic or violent. As usual, Nora's research in setting her story shines through. I could visualize the majestic peaks and fields of sage and wildflowers with absolute clarity - what a delightful escape from the heat of summer! A definite keeper for my permanent collection."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I have been blessed to be able to read all, or nearly all, of Nora's books thus far. I can't remember being disappointed in any of them, but all readers know that at some point a book isn't going to \\"measure up\\", whether it be the writing OR the mood the reader may be in at the time. Roberts' books have never let me down regardless of how I feel while reading them. However, I must say that Angels Fall has to be one of the best of her offerings so far. I hadn't read any information on the book prior to starting it, so I didn't have a clue as to what it was about. However, I quickly realized that I wasn't going to be able to just put it down and walk away, only to resume it at a later time. I had the unabridged audio version, which had a good many tapes to it, and I swear that I never stopped listening to each and every tape from page one through the end of the novel. This book actually made me feel as if I were in the town of Angels Fist and could see (which is rare) the layout of the land and the buildings mentioned. This book came alive for me, which again is rare as I read so many (or listen to) that are extremely entertaining but fail to transport me \\"into\\" the story itself. I don't feel that Roberts could do any better than she has in Angel Falls. Her characters are REAL, and I found myself actually putting faces with names as if I really could see the characters as she described them. Listening to an audio book gives a reader such an advantage, for we can hear their accents, their pauses, and it brings a book to life as it would if it were on a movie screen. I would love to see this book made into a TV movie if possible, for I feel certain the ratings would speak for themselves. I cannot give higher praise on any of Nora's previous books, although she has written so many exceptional ones. But to me, Angel Falls is the best of the best."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"In Angel Falls Nora Roberts does what she does best, creating a world of believeable characters and making you care about them. The balance between mystery and romance is just about perfect, and one of the things that I especially liked is that her hero seemed real, he wasn't gushing over the heroine but was more of a typical guy. The mystery and restaurant world was also very well done and engaging. This is the type of Nora story I enjoy most, not the ones with paranormal elements that she has done so many of lately. I look forward to more stories like this."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"This is Nora Roberts in top form--she spends enough time on the central characters and the plot isn't bogged down by two many romances. The central mystery--rarely her best point outside of the J.D. Robb books anymore--is decent enough to keep you turning the pages. But here, without the mysticism I have found so annoying in her recent trilogies, she tells the story of a woman coming back from a trauma in a believable way. Her dialogue and characterization is the best there is in the romantic suspense genre. I'm not disappointed that I bought this one in hardback."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Let me start out by saying that I always buy Nora Roberts books as soon as they hit the stands, be they hard cover or paperback. I usually love them and read them over and over. I have read all of her books and I can say that this was by far the worst. The only reason I rated it two stars was that it did have a good plot. I don't know about anyone else, but I have to relate or at least understand the interaction between the two main characters. I liked her character and could really relate. However, I really didn't like his. I couldn't relate to the relationship that they shared. She panics and he tells her that hysterical women make him angry. She wakes up from a nightmare swinging and he tells her that if she hits him he'll hit back. Yet she falls in love with him saying that the way he treats her is what works. By the time I got halfway through the book I was skimming and couldn't care less if they ever cought the bad guy. I usually love any book written by her and was very much looking forward to this one. It does have a really good story line. It just didn't have that special quality that Nora Roberts usually delivers. This is the first book by her that I am returning."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Is it really just me? does anyone else notice that Nora Roberts books seem to follow a pattern. i bought this book and crossed my fingers hoping that it would be different from the other series i have read by her, but .....i was disappointed. this was a different story, different plot, different characters, with different names, but the story line was the same. the main characters were essential the same as other characters she has written in her other series. i feel that Roberts has been operating from a formula to write her last few books and im just waiting for some originality."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Nora's latest mystery murder/romance is everything a Nora Roberts novel promises. Enter Reece Gilmore, gourmet chef from Boston, traveling to the town of Angel Fist, Wyoming to start a new life after being the sole survivor of a mass murder. Reece is trying to pull her life together when she witnesses yet another murder in this small town (or does she?). Her dilemma is to stick with it and not let the locals scare her off or make her believe she is crazy. She hooks up with Brody, another creative type from out of state (Chicago-writer) and is employed by the local diner - Angel Food's owner, Joanie Parks and even turns a co-worker into a friend in the form of Linda-gail. All these things combined, Reece decides the \\"Fist\\" is worth putting down some permanent roots despite the fact someone or maybe even she herself is trying to sabotage her sanity. Nora writes with her incomparable talent, describing the area - mountains, lakes and wildlife of Wyoming, that we have come to expect and certainly greatly enjoy from her work. She keeps the reader in suspense and on the edge of his/her seat as the story builds to a climax. I believe a movie for Lifetime is being made out of this book, so you know it is a keeper. Go out and get a copy and know you are in for a nail biting, heartwarming and most enjoyable experience."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"This was the best book I have read in months! The trauma that Reece lived was so well written by Nora Roberts you could feel the tension right off the pages.

Angels Fall is a story about a young lady with a tragic past, and a love story and a still a little mystery. Ok, I figured out \\"who done it,\\" before the end, but Robert's writing could have faked me out! All I can say is \\"When's the next book coming out?\\""},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"This is a top notch romantic suspense from Nora. I totally bought into Reece's angst and her fight to get back her life. Brody was a great guy, not as alpha as some of Nora's men, but a great guy anyway.All the town characters were fleshed out among the wonderful Wyoming Teton territory. (The Alaskan one in another book bombed for me). As usual, Nora's descriptions were wonderful and as I have said before, no one writes a love scene like Nora. Sensuality = 5.I could not put this book down and did not guess the killer until I was supposed to! :D Kudos to Nora for a book well done. The cover was excellent and the author's picture on the back was sensational!Now I await her next \\"in Death\\" installment."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"First time reading a Nora Roberts book and I have to say, I'm not real impressed. People tell me that she writes great books, well not this one."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I love Nora Roberts...I usually like her stories and this one just wasn't my favorite. Brody didn't seem as appealing as her other leading men. The mystery did intrigue me enough to keep reading. Disappointed!!"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I liked this much better than Blue Smoke. I am getting tired of all the violence in her stories, but this one was not as graphic and disturbing as some of her other stories.The book kept me fairly engaged. It was a pretty easy read, I read it in under 20 hours but there were some memorable characters. I could see some of her previous characters in the current ones. (Reece reminded me a lot of Nell in Dance Upon the Air etc) but all in all I was fairly entertained. The development between Reece and Brody was good and believable. I will probably buy this when it comes out in paperback."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Moves really quickly. You can't help but admire Reece. She doesn't know how strong she really is.

And while I'm at it a few others that I enjoyed also this year are Enchanted from Nancy Madore and Can't Wait To Get To Heaven from Fannie Flag."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"The incomparable Nora Roberts has done it again! With nearly 200 books under her belt, Roberts creates an engaging and exciting plot that revolves around a possible murder in a small town. The only witness to the crime is a new member of the community who has fled a violent and brutal past. Reece Gilmore is a young chef who has arrived in Angels Fall after surviving the brutal murder of her friends and colleagues back in Boston. Once arriving in Angels Fall, Reece meets Brody, a smoldering thriller writer who tries to cure Reece's fears of life...and love. Reece witnesses what she believes to be a murder, but the lack of a suspect or a body leads many of the towns people to see Reece as an unreliable source. Nora Roberts is a masterful storyteller and her most recent novel, ANGELS FALL, will leave all readers captivated."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Nora Roberts is one of the only authors that I completely trust to turn out a great book every time. There are a couple of authors that, when they hit it right, I will like their books more than one of Nora's but its hit and miss for them. However I have never, I repeat, never read a NR book that I did not completely enjoy and most of the time Love.Angels Falls is another that although, as some have said, it follows the classic theme of all romantic suspence, and granted doesn't offer many twists, is just a great book. It offers depth of caracter, which most authors try at but most of the time fall short, and a great plot. I loved the heroine who struggles to be strong only to realise that she already is. And who doesn't love a hero who is strong and masterful as well as sinfully HOT and who has more faith in his heroine than she does, even when it would be reasonable to doubt her.The mystery is a great one, A murder seen only but the unstable heroine, with no trace to be found that it actually took place. It's everybody's worst nightmare, to see something that you know in your heart happened, but you can't prove did. To be undermined with \\"tricks of the mind\\" until every one doubts your sanity and you can't help but doubt yourself, and the only thing keeping you stable is the amazing man that believes in you and what you say you saw 100%. It has everything a book should have. Try it you'll like it."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I liked Reece but still am unsure about Brody. I understand why he was not emotional with Reece, but would have liked him to have been more sensitive. Reece was a little too needy and too forward with Brody. I guess I like a more traditional romance in a story - where the guy courts the girl. I did not like all the sarcastic dialogue between Brody and Reece throughout the book. There were some unanswered questions for me in this novel, but all in all I still enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"This was a wonderful story, one of the best i've read in a long time.

Suspence is good and keeps you turning pages, I look forward to seeing the movie."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I've enjoyed a great deal of novels with NR's name on the cover, but it's getting to the point now where when I pick up the latest published book for this author, that I feel like Forest Gump with that box of chocolates. You just never know what you're going to get. This book will give the reader a great deal of knowledge about food, that's for sure. It's not one of the better novels that has come out with NR's spectacular and eye-catching book cover, but it was an okay read. For certain, I've claimed to be a reader that could recognize NR's style of writing about anywhere, but I won't claim to be able to do that any more. After all the reviews written before mine, I see no reason to go into describing the characters or plot of this novel. I bought the book, I'll add it to my library which contains many of NR's novels, but I won't read it again because I'll remember it as being just what I thought it to be, an \\"okay read\\"."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"great book. heavy and light, solid and sensual all at the same time. the characters were flawed, which made them perfect, and the storyline and ending is perfect for those looking to curl up by the fire with a cup of tea and allow the night to slip from beneath them."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I think some of the reviews are a bit unfair. This is an entertaining, suspenseful, romantic fantasy. It is exactly what I expect from a Nora Roberts novel, something I can read and escape into by the swimming pool. For all of her book, for all romance books, you have to suspend some of your hold on reality and let yourself be entertained.If you do that, you will enjoy this book a lot. I know I did and I think this is just as good as any of her other books."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I forced myself to finish reading it becasue I wanted to see where it would go and if it got better. It started good and I started thinking ..... \\"Chalk another up for Nora\\" but then is drug on and on and on. What should have been a 300 page story -MAX turned into 430+. I did not like Brody, his sarcasm annoyed me. Reese was okay but I didn't close the book liking her much. I think that the most interesting part of the book was the mind games that were being played on her."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"not really sure about this book...its an overall pretty good read.....it was the first book of hers i had read......more than likely i will purchase another......overall a good read"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I'm a great fan of NR and I was not disappointed.

I would highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"This is the first Nora Roberts book that I have read, and I have to say \\"BRAVO!\\" Excellently written and I couldn't put it down. I literally read this book in a day, and I have been telling everyone about it. One of the reasons this book really got me, was the main character (Reece) is a chef and she talks about cooking, that is her true passion in life, and I look to cook, so I enjoyed that aspect and the romance. A great read, and done with such great expression, I really felt like I was there, I had the entire place mapped and colored in my mind. Highly recommended, and I will continue to read Nora Roberts, she made a great debut with me!"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I found this book an excellent addition to my Nora Roberts collection and would reccomend it to all of her readers.PS I would like to add a little PS to this review and that is to advise your staff while stuffing me around on my other transaction with Nora Roberts' \\"Blood Brothers\\" you also sent me two copies ofthis very good book."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Outstanding! Nora Roberts has such an appealing magical and lyrical style of writing! The story has the perfect balance between drama, intrigue, and romance. The characters are very well-drawn and likeable, and the community is so warm and welcoming, that they feel like friends and neighbors. Wyoming's Grand Teton setting is beautifully described - from the Snake River to the hiking trails. It's always a bonus when a book is centered around a restaurant, with the main character as a professionally trained chef who makes an art out of the color, texture, shapes and flavors of her masterpieces! Scruptious! Having the male protagonist as an author kicks up the overall quality of the writing to even higher levels. (I loved Brody, btw. He's my type of hero, so patient and unpatronizing!)"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I am so glad to have found Nora Roberts. This is the second of her books I've read and it's was better than the first, \\"Northern Lights\\", which was great. She has interesting characters and I love the way she adds nature into her stories. A touch of mystery and some added romance and she's got you hooked on her story. I am waiting for her next book from Amazon."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Reece Gilmore was a chef in Boston where she was the only survivor of a brutal slaying at her restaurant. After therapy and hospitalization, Reece takes to the road in search of peace. Still suffering some of the aftereffects of her horrendous attack, she is hoping that Angel's Fist will provider her some relief from the panic attacks and fear that have taken over her life.She settles into the small town working as a cook in the local diner, but while hiking Reece sees a murder take place. She is certain of what she has seen, and the only one that will believe her is a popular author Brody. Brody believes Reece, but has also been informed of her past. He sees some of her unusual behavior, but sticks with his gut instinct that she is telling the truth.Not many can describe a setting like NR. I can picture it very clearly when I read her books. Reece is not your typical main character. She has issues and at times is very fragile. I liked the characters, and the secondary characters were also very well done."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"It has been a long while since I have read one of Nora Roberts books and I had considered her a romance writing author, but Angel Falls dispelled that notion. Fast-paced action, authentic dialogue and a gripping narrative make Nora Roberts' Angel Falls an intriguing and satisfying mystery. I applaud the author's success at keeping the identity of the murder a secret until the end chapters. Angel Falls is truely a can't-put-down bestseller."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"One of her better recent books, I would recommend to fans and new readers alike. The book arrived quickly and in good condition (brand new) Thank You, Phyllis Lautenschlaeger"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Haha, this was was of Nora's great ones. Not that she turns out work that's less than terrific anyway, but I really enjoyed this story. Right off, the plot was gripping and I immediately wanted to know who the bad guy is, what happened that had the main character all wound up, and how it would all end. At the end of the book...well, some people might like a cigarette, but I wound up with this uncontrollable urge to cook something. So...I made Nora's bread pudding recipe in the back of the book and it was REALLY GOOD!Delightful story, highly recommend!!"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Picking a favorite Nora Roberts book seems darned near impossible, but this book may be mine. From the minute I started reading, I felt empathy for Reece and admired her courage. I enjoyed watching her rebuild her life, fall back and reach deep for more guts and determination to try again.The characters in this story are flawed, but they're also smart. The plot is clever and kept me turning the pages, not quite sure if I had identified the villian or not.Bottom line, it is a well written book that captured my attention and gave me a pleasant weekend of reading. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Roberts nails it with this one. Its interesting and a fast read. I didn't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"When Reece Gilmore arrives in Angel's Fist, she's been running for a while. I was going to be cryptic about why she was running, because it was a bit of a mystery for me while I was reading it, but the reason is on the dust jacket blurb and in all the reviews, so what the heck. (This is one of the main reasons why I don't read dust jacket/back cover blurbs before reading a book.) As the sole survivor of a massacre in a restaurant where she'd worked as a chef, she recovered from her physical injuries only to be left with more serious psychological ones.She takes a job as a fry cook and focuses on living one day at a time, slowly starting to feel at home in the small town.Then she goes hiking and sees a woman being murdered.Eccentric writer Brody believes her--he met her on the trail shortly afterwards and saw her distress. But he's pretty much the only one who does. The sheriff is unable to find any evidence of a fight, much less a body, and even her friends seem inclined to think that maybe she's imagined it.Then strange things start happening, and even Reece isn't sure she's not doing them herself, backsliding on her recovery because of the stress.There are a couple things that keep this from being a 5-star read. First, the title. Okay, that's not really a part of the story, but I think the publisher messed up on this one. I've seen it written \\"Angel Falls,\\" \\"Angels Falls,\\" \\"Angel's Fall,\\" and \\"Angel's Falls\\" more often than \\"Angels Fall\\"... and that's on a Nora Roberts fan list. Besides which, \\"Angels Fall\\" doesn't get echoed in the book, except obliquely.Then there's the secondary romance, which I had trouble believing, between Linda-gail (whose name I kept wanting to fix) and Lo (short for his nickname of \\"Lothario\\", which is another complaint altogether--do people really call man-sluts \\"Lotharios\\"? nowadays?). From the moment I met the characters, I knew their entire story, and yet it didn't convince me, the way Faith and Wade in Carolina Moon did, for example.The real appeal of Angels Fall is the characters, particularly Reece. She's tough and strong, though she doesn't think she is. She recognized that she needed help after the restaurant shooting, and she sought it, then she also recognized when the drugs and psychiatrists had helped all they could and she had to do the rest on her own. Even when she's being made to think she's losing it again, she doesn't give in. She keeps working at making herself whole. And yet, at the same time, she has very realistic neuroses and phobias that make her both more sympathetic and more admirable than someone who'd triumphed over such a tragedy without any psychological effects. I'd like to think I'd react the same.Brody isn't everyone's cup of tea in a hero. He's rude and abrasive, and what's probably most attractive to Reece is that he doesn't treat her with kid gloves. In fact, it's just the opposite. He flat out tells her not to cry, not to get hysterical when reporting to the sheriff. Which is just what she needs--he treats her, in short, like an equal, the way he'd want to be treated, not like a fragile victim.Like most of Nora's single titles, Angels Fall is romantic suspense, heavier on the suspense. The mystery and Reece's personal journey are the focus of the story--the romance happens because of them. I admit, I was expecting a... bigger suspense story, I guess. I was expecting, frankly, for the killer to have been the same killer from the restaurant massacre. And that would have been exciting, but it would have made it a more ordinary story, and turned Reece into just another on-the-run romantic suspense heroine. I enjoy it when a book doesn't follow the expected path, and this is no exception."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"While this book started off a little slow for me, it picked up quickly once Brody became a more central figure in the story. I liked how he believed in Reece when nobody else did, when everyone thought she was crazy and I liked even more how he handled her, how he treated her, how he talked to her with that subtle, cocky way of his that kept her on even keel. What I didn't care for, and what I've noticed in other Roberts books with small town settings, was that nobody can seem to speak in complete sentences. What is up with that? I'm from a small town and believe me, we know how to speak in full sentences here. But all in all, a very good read, suspenseful and hard to put down once you get going."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I loved loved loved this book! This is definitely one of my all time favorites of hers. I just couldn't put it down and I really loved how the characters weren't the cliche typical characters in most the books I read. And I also really liked the male love interest- he was funny and witty and just a breathe of fresh air! And for once I hadn't already figured who did it at the end and was suprised which in itself was a nice suprise :) This is a must read for any Nora Roberts fans."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"This is one of the best of Nora Roberts' works.

The hero was actually quite funny (the wedding soup scene and the shopping scene). I loved the supporting characters. My only complaint was that the villian was a little too abvious. I actually knew right at the beginning of the murder. Don't miss this one- I don't believe I'll be loaning it out!"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"What can I say?

Looking forward to her next!Mandi"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I loved the beginning and then it fizzled for me. I thought the victim got what she desserved and hated to see what I perceived as a generally good person destroy his and his family's life/lives.

Also seemed like the action was sparce, and I didn't really come away from it loving any of the characters as I normally do with a Nora book."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I like mysteries, and I like romance novels.

I could tell instantly there was going to be so many bright colors in the objects and surroundings of the storyline. Nora Roberts always seems to detail her stories with tons of rivetting color. The beginning of the book almost reminded me of the other nature-tastic book she wrote, Rivers End.The plot is poor I found as I continued reading. The fear and mystery is poor. The romance is debateable. The only thing that seems real are the feelings of paranoia the main character deals with, and the wanting to escape. She wants to get away. Keep moving and get away from the past.I think the novel could have been better had Nora added some elements of deeper relationships instead of moving the plot around so much. It seemed confusing, and eventually uninteresting. Sadly, I will be getting rid of this one.

This story of a woman striving to overcome a traumatic past is expertly read by Joyce Bean who captures readers by vocally embodying the fears and challenges experienced by the protagonist. No over the top drama for this reader, only a pitch perfect, authentic performance.Reece Gilmore is literally hanging on with her fingernails. She witnessed brutal killings in the Boston diner where she worked and was wounded herself. Realizing the state she was in she sought help as a patient in a psychiatric hospital. Eventually, she felt well enough to leave and our story takes place primarily in Angel's Fist, Wyoming where she has sought peace and hopefully a stabilized mental condition, free of nightmares and panic attacks.Once settled in, she hikes up into the mountains and surveys the beautiful surroundings with her binoculars. What she sees is not beautiful at all - it is a couple struggling on the opposite bank of the Snake River. The man has the woman in a stranglehold, and Reece is sure he is killing her.However, once she reaches another person on the trail, Brody, and asks for help, they return to the scene she described and find absolutely nothing. She knows what she saw, but with her history who will believe her?Recommended listening.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"While I enjoyed the book for its setting and atmosphere, the flaws of plot were striking. And, alas, they are carryovers from her other works. Consider the following:(1) One can flip through the pages of any unread Nora Roberts book and come to the first sizzling sex scene without any difficulty. This scene is exactly the same place, every time--on rails. While I find this concrete formula annoying, apparently it works for most readers. Roberts sells more books than almost anyone and is on Time's list of the 100 most influential people. The somewhat campy descriptions of bedroom bombastics notwithstanding. I just wish she'd vary the placement and the language a little. Make that a whole lot.(2) The heroine of \\"Angels Fall\\" is flummoxed by malicious tricks played on her, often within her apartment over the diner while she is away. These tricks happen over and over again, without anyone setting a simple trap for the perp. Of course, that would make the book a lot shorter. No one even puts scotch tape on the door, flour on the floor, a bear trap, someome to watch the stairs, etc. The characters aren't dumb. The hero is a best selling mystery writer. But no one thinks to take precautions of any sort. In addition, there are just too many of these malicious tricks, presumably to fill out the pages.(3) Lastly, there oughtta be a law against the villain holding a gun on his victims and explaining in fine detail (several pages) just what he did and how. If I were the villain and had my pursuers in the crosshairs, I'd zap them right now and get the heck out of there. And so would any self-respecting villain with an ounce of sense. This old, stale device should be retired forever. The denouement of \\"Angels Fall\\" would have been much more effective without the explanations. Readers are capable of filling in a few blanks.So why did I give this three stars? Just for the atmosphere, for the Tetons, for the town, the lake, the diner, the townspeople, the food. No one is better than Nora Roberts at creating the background for a novel. I just wish she'd get serious about the plots and become a novelist who would be remembered."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Once again, Nora Roberts has penned a mystery about people in a small town living at the foot of spectacular mountains. It's not more of the same, though, because the people of Angel's Fist, Wyoming have a much different flavor than the residents of Lunacy, Alaska, and the places themselves are not much alike.Reece Gilmore is the sole survivor of a murder spree in a restaurant in Boston, where she had been a chef. After months of therapy and hospitalization, Reece is trying to put herself back together. She's meandering across the country in her old car, stopping from time to time to work long enough to make enough money to move on. Afraid of the dark and obsessive about locking doors, Reece limps into Angel's Fist with her car overheating. Seeing a sign in a diner window, the cordon bleu chef takes a job as a fry cook and, eventually, rents an apartment above the diner and starts settling in. One day while out hiking, she stops to rest in a scenic spot overlooking the Snake River and spies a couple in her binoculars. When their argument erupts into murder, Reece runs down the trail and into Brody, a thriller writer who lives in Angel's Fist. They report the murder and direct the police to the place where it happened, but no trace of an altercation is found.On the heels of that incident, strange things start to happen in Reece's apartment. Things are put in the wrong place and once she even finds her front door unlocked and open. At first, Reece believes she's having memory lapses, but as the bizarre happenings escalate, she and Brody start to believe the killer is messing with her head. With no victim and no trace of a crime, most of Angel's Fist believes Reece is losing it, but she is convinced that a very real killer is on the loose. In between the intrigue, Reece and Brody start having a hot affair, so nobody takes the fact that he believes Reece too seriously.I figured out exactly what happened as soon as it happened, the reasons why, and who the guilty party was. The only thing left was waiting to see if I was right, which I was. Still, I doubted myself a couple of times.The pace of this book is on the slow side for Nora Roberts, but never boring. There was always something happening to keep the story moving. Reece was obsessive and jittery, but not frail or clingy. Brody was all personality and I never really got a good picture of him in my head. Though not the most compelling or gripping book in the Roberts collection, it is nonetheless a good sample of her work. Nora has the ability to weave good stories with a different cast and at varying paces, and still make us keep turning the pages every time. Even meandering along, Angels Fall is another compelling tale by a powerhouse writer."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Reece Gilmore is recovering from post-traumatic stress after being the sole survivor of a bloody shooting spree. Having drifted for about a year, she finally decides to try to make a new life for herself as a cook at a small diner in the town of Angel's Fist. Settling into her new life proves difficult at first, but she quickly endears herself to the locals with her unmatched culinary skill.Her reticence and paranoia quirk only a few brows until she witnesses a murder for which no evidence can be found. Throughout the town, the only person who believes her is the rugged and reclusive mystery novelist, Brody. For his part, Brody is certain that his interest in Reece comes entirely from her mysterious background, yet finds himself unable to keep from staring at her.The romance was a slow-starter, yet very believable and ultimately satisfying. Roberts ably portrays a woman still recovering both physically and emotionally. Her courage in rebuilding a life made Reece both an inspiring and sympathetic character.However it was the mystery aspect of this novel which for me created the greatest delight in reading. Seen through her eyes, Reece's paranoia helped heighten my own suspense.As far as the writing itself, Nora Roberts once again has proven herself to be a master with words. The locals of Angel's Fist are well-crafted, lending a small-town family reunion feel to the plot, not to mention their own delightful stories.If you're looking for a thought-provoking mystery that just happens to include a believable romance then I highly recommend this book. I bought it today and couldn't put it down. In fact, I'm already going back to look for the clues I missed the first time through."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Just when you think there's no new way to tell the story of a knight in shining armor who saves the fair maiden, along comes Nora Roberts to turn that time-tested formula on its head . . . with great results. If you want a great new book for your vacation, get Angels Fall!If you have ever been to Wyoming, you probably came away in awe of the Tetons. Seeing those peaks is in some ways even more moving than the Grand Canyon. And on a hot day in July, it's nice to think about being in Wyoming. The Tetons are a primary spiritual character in this book, helping to inspire the fictional characters to take the right steps.A fragile woman, Reece Gilmore, finds herself stuck in Angel's Fist, Wyoming (not too far from Jackson Hole) after he radiator hose splits. Needing to make a few bucks, she impulsively applies for the cook's job at short-order Angel Food. Clearly, she knows what she's doing. While most people would freak out from the pressure, it's almost a relief to Reece, as it takes her minds off other issues.Gradually, we learn that Reece is on the roam to try to erase very unhappy memories. I won't say more because Ms. Roberts does a nice job of letting the details emerge in the novel.Meeting the people in Angels Fist soon makes Reece think that she might like to stay . . . except for one problem: Reece observes a murder while on her first hike. But no one can find a body . . . or signs of a murder. Is Reece crazy?The incident does have one positive element, it brings Reece into close contact with Jamsion P. Brody (who prefers to be called Brody), a mystery novelist whose posterior is causing much conversation among the younger women in town. Their relationship blossoms in unexpected ways . . . both for the reader and for them.The issue of Reece's sanity becomes clouded by lots of incidents where the unexpected happens. But as Reece points out in the book, \\"It's not paranoia if they're really after you.\\"The novel is filled with delightful characters you'll long remember . . . and may wish to meet:Joanie: She owns Angel Food and likes to talk tough . . . but may be a little bit softer than that.Lo: Joanie's son whose nickname is short for \\"Lothario\\" and who has plans for Reece.Linda-gail: The waitress who wants Lo . . . as a faithful husband.Mac: Loves to help people.Rick: The local sheriff who finds himself unwilling to place too much credence in the views of a newcomer, but has a delightful family.The mystery story is well done. You'll probably be thinking it's one of four characters right up until the last few pages.The most delightful aspect of this well-written story is that Ms. Roberts doesn't rush her story, her characters or your pleasure in enjoying the book. Although I'm far from a big foodie, I loved the many interesting food references in the book. It's like the Goldy Schultz stories in a way . . . but without the recipes. Like Goldy, Reece communicates through food.Read this book and enjoy yourself! It won't hurt to have a nice glass of wine and some tasty snacks nearby while you do."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"A librarian I know, who is very shy and not much given to recommending books, told me this was Nora's \\"best in years,\\" and I was duly impressed by that statement, but didn't really believe it. I thought I would find another fast-paced, serviceable Nora story, neither good nor bad but just fun. I was wrong.From the very first page, I could not put this book down. The story of Reece Gilmore, survivor of unspeakable horror in her hometown of Boston who is currently \\"hiding\\" in small Wyoming town Angel's Fist, is completely compelling and believable. Reece has fought her way back through physical and mental horrors, from post-traumatic stress disorder to a near-fatal gunshot wound to the chest, to crippling anxiety and panic attacks. So a day when she can put one foot in front of the other is a good day.Why, then, does it have to be Reece who witnesses a murder in this quiet haven? Nobody believes her--except for taciturn author Brody, as unlikely a match for Reece as the man in the moon. And yet...Read and find out what happens. The identity of the killer is hidden until the very last chapter, and although it isn't that hard to figure out, there are enough red herrings thrown in to cast some doubt.

There is no evidence of the crime and, as people learn more of her history and she begins finding things she appears to have done but doesn't remember, both she and other begin to question her mental stability. But is she really doing these things, or is someone trying to make her think she is?I love Nora Roberts' books. She creates strong, interesting characters--both male and female. Her dialogue is crisp, often funny and makes me wish I could think of those things to say. Roberts does sense of place well; I haven't been in Wyoming since I was a child, but she brought all the surrounds back to me. Roberts does suspense well; I found myself wondering whether my doors were locked. I suspected the killer, but there were a couple good red herrings that made me wonder. Was it a perfect book? No; the romance didn't sizzle for me as much as some of her other books have done and I felt the end was a bit week, but it was still a darn good read and made me stay up way too late to finish it."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"My second Nora Roberts read, Sanctuary was the first. Liked them both, but couldn't understand why my diet was no longer working. Both books describe food in great detail, sending me in search of it. The romance and mystery were neatly balanced. I look forward to reading more of Nora Roberts."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Angels Falls is a fantastic roller coaster ride, as much as Sanctuary and Montana Sky. These three novels have romance but mostly are suspense mysteries that will have you on the edge of your seat. Nora Roberts is a versatile author."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"This is my third Nora Robert's book. The first two I read were written in 1995 and 1998 and I didn't like them much. Because this is more recent, 2006, I'm wondering if her later work is better than her earlier work. I may try another of her more recent novels. This book \\"Angels Fall\\" is about a talented woman chef who has been terribly wounded by surviving a gunshot massacre. She moves away, is in the process of healing and witnesses another murder. It's a good murder mystery. The story also has an interesting romance developing between the chef and a writer who helps her. I enjoyed reading about these two characters. I also enjoyed a supporting character, Joanie, owner of the diner. There were some good lines. I'm extracting parts of three of them here briefly, but they are better within the context of the story.

Tough as it might be on the ego, it was better than platitudes and soft lies.\\" Page 266 \\"a man puts his hands around a woman's throat once, he could do it again.\\" Page 279 \\"what selfishness you have seems awfully healthy from where I stand.\\"DATA:Sexual language: mild.

First off, I'm amazed that she has been such a prolific writer, while continuing to crank out the level of entertainment she provides. Yeah, much of her work is frequently described as formulaic, but when I need a relaxing, comfort read, I turn to NR. Nora and a little piece of chocolate and I'm healed.I loved this read! It was like a brief vacation, with Nora's ability to so perfectly describe the environment. I could almost smell the fresh, crisp air of the Grand Tetons and sense the critters hiding in the mountains and swimming in the streams. It made me wish to pitch a tent and stay a while.Then here comes Reece, sputtering into town in her overheated Chevy Cavalier, battling severe PTSD, with mistrust of everyone, including herself. She hasn't been able to land and stay anywhere very long. She's been on an aimless journey, running from herself and her own emotions, after a near death experience. Her car trouble grounds her long enough, that she begins to realize she can't change anything about her past, except her reactions to it. She learns she needs to fortify her backbone. Some of it---the hard way.The secondary characters are very entertaining, particularly Brody who shows guarded interest in Reece. She's cute, but he's just not that interested, until he is involuntarily dragged into what may have been a murder scene, witnessed by Reece. Or, is Reece just a little unreliable, considering her traumatic event? Many would say she has the right to have some brief, reactive psychotic episodes, considering her past. She does come off a little quirky, sometimes. Time will tell.The Cafe patrons', where Reece lands a job, are fun to visit with and you feel like you're sitting at the counter, sipping a cup of coffee, while eavesdropping. The cantankerous Cafe owner is a hoot. She is...and isn't, what she appears to be, on many levels. I found her a delightful dichotomy between Drill Sergeant and nurturer, in a crusty, believable way.If you're a NR fan, I'm quite sure you will find much to love with this read. And, if you're not, you probably still will, too. It's a great reminder that women have internal strength that can pull us through almost anything---if we just remember to make it our mission to connect with it---regularly. Also, that women need to stand up and mentor other women in crisis. We are one!"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Once again, Nora Roberts superbly writes a murder mystery that keeps you turning the pages. The heroine is very likeable because she is imperfect like most of us. It was gratifying to see her successfully reach each milestone during her recovery process from a horrifically tragic event. The best part was she didn't have to do it alone. She makes some wonderful friends in Angels Fist, Wyoming, and I guarantee you will fall in love with each one of these characters. This includes the reluctant hero, Brody, who did not sign up for the job and never wanted any part of the action. But he's a keeper! The dialogue throughout the book is wonderful because it makes you feel as if you are right there watching the story unfold. That is the gift of a good writer and Nora Roberts has hit the mark again!"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Reece Gilmore, the lone survivor of a brutal killing spree, took to the road in an attempt to run away from the demons that haunted her. Her travels led her to Angels Fist, a small town in Wyoming. With a busted radiator and little money in her pocket, she took a job as a cook and moved into a hotel room.For the first since the murder two years before, Reece was starting to relax. She still had panic attacks and the paranoia was still evident, but the town's people were a friendly group, and they welcomed her. As long as she knew she could leave at a moment's notice, staying in one place might not be so hard.Her life was moving along at an even keel. She had a job, moved into an apartment, and met a man that caught her attention. All was going well until she witnessed a murder. By the time the sheriff arrived, the body was gone and there was no evidence of the crime.Angels Falls is a heartwarming story of a woman struggling to regain control of her life. Her efforts are undermined time and time again, but love and friendship make the impossible possible."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"This is my first Nora Roberts book and most likely not my last. While the mystery plot was pretty transparant and the romantic connection predictable, when the end came, it came too fast. Yes, the obvious was wrapped up but there's a whole other book waiting to be written....one where Joanie is the central character. She held my attention; had the spit, fire and no nonsense approach to life that the shrinking violets of this genre lack.Please do a sequel to this book and expand Joanie's life. Was there really a suicide in her cabin? Why does she present as a no-nonense, rough as sandpaper character? Plenty of background to work with which could be explored further when she and Reece open the Casual Gormet. Looking forward to more with Joanie as the central character."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Angels Fall is not going to help you broaden your literature horizons but it will be entertaining, if you're looking for a simple book to keep you busy. The book is well written, I've never read any of Nora Roberts books before but I was impressed.The story in a nutshell is about a woman who moves to a small town from the big city because of a personal tragedy. She leaves behind all of her belongings, friends, and family and decides to live in this particular small Wyoming town. As with most small towns, everyone knows everyone and every body's business. So when this young, attractive, and mysterious woman coming to their town everyone has their eyes on her every move.She ends up witnessing a murder but when the police investigate, there is no evidence of any crime or altercation. Therefore, she must be crazy. The story springs from there and the ending is a fun twist. The story does have a muted love story in the middle of the mystery, which I like, so all in all it was a good book.I would recommend it to anyone who likes mysteries and for anyone who is looking for a book that you don't want to think too much when your reading it. Despite the fact that there is a murder in the book, the book is light and easy. Give it a try!"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Angel Falls is magnificant tale about woman who must heal after terrible ordeal and must search inside to find herself before she can move on with her life. Nora Roberts weave tantalizing tale about Reece Gilmore journey to self discovery in small mountain town in Wyoming. During her journey, she witness a murder across from the trail. The only person who believes her and help her find the truth is the writer from Chicago. The story will leave guessing until the end."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I Liked the book. As always with Nora Roberts it was a good read. However, I found myself thinking that she's written much better. The storyline seemed familiar and a little slow. My main complaint is the abrupt ending. Very abrupt. The entire book was \\"concluded\\" in a page and a half and seemed like someone just said.. \\"okay, we've reached our page/word limit.. the book ends NOW!!.. I remain an avid Roberts fan, this book didn't change that, I guess I expected more."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I've read all of Nora's books and, until now, found her to be a fascinating writer, easy with words, great with descriptions. She could make you FEEL the story better than anyone else (passion, excitement, suspense) and I just couldn't wait to read the next book. Until this one. What a lame, lame, boring, predictable book. Can I say lame again? I suspect she let an assistant write the bulk of the book for her because I found none of her magic in there. Her heroin is pitiful (as in you can't possibly start caring about her, she's such a mess she's irritating) the \\"hero\\" is laughably average and... boring (there's average everywhere in the real world... I like romance novels for the escapism, Nora! If I want real world, I don't need to read books!). There is NO chemistry between the 2, just snappy retorts. The storyline was excruciatingly long and slow and I had guessed the killer within 5 minutes of the murder. After page 300 or so, I couldn't take it anymore and skipped to the end to make sure I had guessed right. Yep, I had. Nora, stick to romance novels. If you want to write thrillers, then have them marketed as thrillers and drop the romance pretense out of them, because you're just alienating readers who expected something totally different."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Too long, too predictable and I'm getting tired of shelling out bucks for a hardcover that should have been better. The villain is readily apparent, the romance is so-so and the weather sucks! If you must read it, wait until it comes out in paperback."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I was disappointed with this book. It is honestly the first time I've ever been disappointed in a Nora Roberts book. It was slow and the heroine was not particulary personable even though they story tried to make her special. I can't say I want to go to Angel Falls."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I am a huge fan of Nora Roberts. This book is a good read, moves fast and keeps your interest. A little bit predictable, but I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I am a huge fan of Nora's, I've read almost every book and have thoroughly enjoyed almost all of them, including Blue Smoke. But this one, in my opinion, felt used and written by a slightly bored, and hungry, Ms. Roberts. I felt our heroine, Reece was a bit moody. Reece comes to Angels Fist because she is running from something that hurt her in her past, which the reader later discovers, and horrifying it is. But I never felt compelled to shout, \\"Go Reece Go!\\" and really didn't care if she stayed or left Angels Fist. I actually enjoyed Brody because I felt he was somewhat original, unlike the rest of the novel. Main character goes to a small town in the middle of nowhere-didn't we JUST see that in Northern Lights? And funny, that character was running from something in their past also...The suspense part of the story occurs whenever Reece is hiking on a trail and sees a murder waaayyy across the river. No one believes it happened because they can't find the body, except Brody who was there on the trail. Then weird things start happening to Reece, and people wonder if she's lost her mind or not. The best thing about this book was the food-Reece is a cook and this book made me just want to whip something up myself. The scenery is also described beautifully, just as in Northern Lights. The mystery however, fell flat for me because I guessed the ending pretty early on."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I am very disappointed in this book. There is no soul in the characters, plot and location. It was flat. I expected something better from Nora Roberts than this boring, flat storyline. In fact, I would give this book 1/2 star it was so boring. The next time, I will not be racing out to buy a new Nora Roberts hard cover book. This book is as flat and boring as Blue Smoke was. Save your money and wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"If your going to write about a location you need to do more than look at a map or hit the tourist spots. ANGEL FALLS adds a valley to the Tetons (they could probably use the room) but just misses on capturing the feeling of the place although she is right about the beauty of the mountains and the power of the sky. Her locals are just a bit generic and not as developed as in earlier books. And we never, never, NEVER say U of W.Nitpicking aside it is her usual good work but just misses being top of the line."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Nora Roberts is a premiere story teller. It is rarely I have been disapponted in her novels. Angels Falls is another of her successes. It was suspenseful and fully engaged me during the entire reading of the book. I highly recommend this book to readers of romance ficiton."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I have long been a Nora Roberts fan and have read just about everything she's written (even back to her early silhouette days). This is one of her best books so far. The story is well developed and kept me interested and on the edge right up until the very end."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Another great story from Nora Roberts. Good story, good flow, great characters. Thanks Nora for a great read. Looking forward to the new trilogy coming in the fall."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"This is another book recommended by a female co-worker. She thought of this book for me because it is set in Wyoming near Jackson and she knows one of my brothers lives there. It was a long book, but read quicker than I thought it would. I liked how the author gives great detail about one or two items, but doesn't cover everything in that same detail. Having been to this part of Wyoming, I loved the setting and the small town factors. Good character development and very suspenseful. Love scenes were at the right level for me. This was my first Nora Roberts book."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"This was a real page turner! I didn't see the twist at all and that's how I like it. Miss Roberts wrote a great story!"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The mystery in the book is intriguing and you almost question whether the character is really crazy or if someone is messing with her. I enjoyed this much more than Blue Smoke and would recommend it."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Angels Fall is a great introduction for first time Nora Roberts readers; it embraces her unique approach to creating appealing characters, contains romance and suspense, as well as beautiful descriptions of the Wyoming country.It may be a little long, and a little slow in the beginning, but it is a good \\"cozy-time\\" read."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"When I see a new book by Nora Roberts, I just have to have it for my collection! She is by far one of my favorite authors! Angels Fall did not disappoint. I loved the characters Reece, Brody, Linda-gail, Joanie and Lo and the setting in the Grand Tetons. The story was great and I honestly could not figure out \\"who-done-it\\" til the end! Please write more books like this!"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":".this is probably one of Nora's best so far. I found it hard to put down and read through the night to finish.

It was a Christmas present so I felt obliged to finish it. I've read romance novels for years, this is the only Nora Roberts book that I have hated. The main characters are annoying and their interest in each other is unbelievable. There is was no excitement between them and by the end of the book I was hoping the killer would whack Reece to put her out of her misery. Usually Nora's secondary characters are interesting enough to want to keep reading...but not this time, except maybe the killer. However, even after the killer's motive is revealed it is so lame the book was still boring. Don't even waste your money on a used copy. Try a Judith McNaught book if you want a good romance. Now I know why they are putting author blogs with their books, so you will get distracted and not read the reviews of the book."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"The movie was good, but the book was better. Not Nora's best work but definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"The first Nora Roberts novel I read was Northern Lights, and I was pleasantly surprised by the strong sense of locale, interesting and believable characters, and a well-crafted and exciting plot. Angels Fall sounded like it would follow in the same genre, but it is more a gushy romance novel than a thriller. This time the hick town location is cliched and dull, as are the characters (especially the heroine). I started this book on a ten-hour plane trip, and put it down after a couple hours. A month later I'm still only half way through it; in the last ten chapters not much has happened."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I enjoyed the pace of this book and the suspense that was constantly added to the mix. Reece has a certain vulnerability to her, which adds nicely to the story line as she struggles to regain her strength from everything that she's been through. It was a great romance with just enough suspense to keep it paced nicely."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Angels Fall by Nora RobertsThis is one of my favorite Nora Roberts books. It is a true suspense novel with a dabbling of romance.Reece had suffered one of the worst things that could ever happen to someone. She saw many people she cared about being slaughtered. This even has shaped her life now and in her misery, she travels the country. Until she winds up in Wyoming. Now a cook at the local caf&eacute; and not planning to stay, things start happening. Moreover, not all of them are good things. She does meet up with Brody a writer who is just a tad nutty himself.One of the worst things is the gas lighting someone is doing to Reece. You see, she has witnessed a murder but can't prove it and since her past problem, everyone think she is a little paranoid and even a bit insane. But, one person must think she really saw something or they wouldn't be trying so hard to get her to leave.This book has a wonderful storyteller in Nora Roberts. The story is fascinating, the characters are engaging and the mystery will most likely keep you guessing right to the very last few chapters. I found it to be a real page-turner."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"\\"Angels Fall\\" was my first Fiction read by Nora Roberts. I would call it captivating; I couldn't put it down.

For a while many of Roberts' books were very formulaic and uninteresting, but Angels Fall does a good job of being believable. Reese and Brody - the lead characters - are both deeply flawed, but the romance between them is real and heartfelt. Reece meets Brody when she relocates to a small town (Angels Fist), and quickly becomes an ace chef at the local diner. Her past is a mystery to everyone in the town and, as a newcomer, she falls under suspicion when she claims to have witnessed a murder. Brody is the only person who stands up for Reece and the two start to form a bond as they look for clues to the murder and Reece's past. The mystery was fairly decent, and the book actually had two storylines going - one about Reece's past and one about the murder she witnessed. The book was good overall and much better than some of Robert's more recent books - but I'm still wondering about the title. Angels Fist was the name of the town, and it was mentioned a bizillion times, yet the book was titled Angels Fall and that wasn't used once in the book."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Circumstances force Reece Gilmore to end her wandering in Angel's Fist, Wyoming. Not long ago, she was the sole survivor of a massacre, and has been running away from the pain since. In short order, she has found a job and home, but the security and peace she thought she found ends when she witnesses a murder that there is no evidence of it having occurred. Then, odd little things begin to happen. Is Reece losing her mind or being stalked by a killer. Only one man, a writer named Brody, believes in her without reservation. Reece is the only person who can stop a murderer, unless she becomes the next victim. Brody is determined that such an event not happen.***** Ms. Roberts scores again. Between a simmering romance and a classic who \\"dun\\" it, this is among her most absorbing work to date. What makes these two elements work in perfect synch are her characters. Not only are the two protagonists vibrant and compelling, but the secondary ones add a richness and depth that makes you want to know more about them as well. This one is worth a whole constellation of stars. *****Amanda Killgore"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Reese Gilmore has traveled many miles working at many places, running from her past.

My main complaint with Nora's other stories is that I often feel like I'm reading the same book and same characters. While this did have a somewhat similar premise to Northern Lights, this book seemed so fresh to me. In particular, Brody is a great change from the typical Nora hero. Typically Nora seems to create wonderfully kind men who soften the jaded heronine, but in this one the hero was a bit more \\"alpha male.\\" I found his crusty personality appealing and a great match for the heroine.Reece (the heroine) was perhaps a tiny bit moody, but overall I thought she was very well written. I also loved how Nora put her career as a cook so front and center. It took what could have been a cliche character and gave Reece some depth and distinction.The mystery I thought was a little underdeveloped, although I don't read Nora for the suspense and was happy to have the book's focus on the romance, and on Reece's journey into this small town.Definetly a recommended read. After Nora's last few books have been \\"just okay,\\" I was tentative to buy this one in hardcover. I'm glad I did, it's definetly a keeper!"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Nora Roberts was really phoning-it-in on this novel!

However, her recent novels, Northern Lights, the Garden Trilogy, The Key Trilogy and, the latest, Angle's Fall have been a string of disappointments for me. You can almost feel a level of laziness creeping up in the writing, character building and even the story telling. I can't get any character in those novels feel the ways they feel. Almost every single one of them, with very few exceptions, are devoid of emotions. There's hardly any chemistry between the leading characters. The author ham-fisted put them together for no apparent reason other than out of convenience. The romance parts of Nora's books are certainly diminishing rapidly. However, I do give her credit for taking an inter-journey of self-discovery, especially after traumatic experiences, such as Reece's narrow escape from the death and Nat's (in Northern Lights) depression. But if you are looking for a romance novel and hoping to repeat the experience of reading her earlier great books, such as Genuine Lies, Honest Illusions etc, you are in for a huge disappointment. It is time to discover the next excellent romance writer. I wish all her loyal fans, me included, can speak up and stop her factory-assembly-type of rapid book release. Nora, please concentrate on writing fewer but better books, for the sake of your fans, rather than focusing on the dollar signs. If you continue this self-destruction trajectory, soon, your fans will leave you one by one."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"It was fantastic, the descriptions of people, places and events as they are happeningmade me think I was right there, I could see, smell and hear all that was going on....and keeping up with the \\"whodunit\\" was that much more interesting.thanks again Ms. Roberts for a great way to spend time.... reading my 1st love!!"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"This is a typical Norad Roberts novel. Romantic suspense done well. Like many /most of her work.A heroine recovering from a past tragedy sets out to find someplace to call home. An overheating car brings her to a service station in a little town. While walking about she sees a sign for a job and applies - figuring to try her hand at something on this journey to wherever she may end up. It just so happens (as frequently does) the town is peaceful (which she needs after her past tragedy) and starts to grow on her. She thinks she will stay a while. A place like this is a good place to heal and to be inconspicuous. Until she witnesses a murder. Then she starts questioning her sanity as if in the depths of PTSD. While she tries to convince herself, she convinces a local author (the hero) of what she witnessed. While trying to find evidence of the murderer things begin to happen that threaten her new found and fragile sanity. And her life.Good solid story and fans of Roberts won't be disappointed. The lack of the fifth star was due to the fact that this story (while a good read) did not carry as much suspense as I have come to expect from Roberts. The plot was easily surmised and there was no twist to surprise me. It turned out to be who I figured early on.Still, hard to go wrong with Roberts.Christine"},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"I'm enjoying this book. The character is so close to me with her fears, anxiety and panic attacks after a devistating experience Running away from her problems leads her to a small town where she goes to work as a cook and meets a novelist who helps her and falls in love with her. Witnessing a murder brings the two of them together while she tries to prove she really did see a man kill a woman while hiking up a mountain trail. It's a exciting read."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"Nora Roberts delivers another entertaining novel of romantic suspense. Reece Gilmore is traveling across the country trying to escape her past trauma and maybe build a new life. When her car breaks down in Angel's Fist, Wyoming she decides to stay for a while. Soon, she becomes the only witness to a murder. With local resident and writer of mystery novels, Brody, she tries to solve the case. The murderer makes it more difficult by taking advantage of her past trauma, trying to make her think she's crazy. Suspicion is cast on several local residents, and the murderer must be one of them.This is definitely a summer book. The plot isn't too complicated, the characters are likable and it's a quick read. Roberts isn't a literary genius, but she's not writing dreck, either. I particularly enjoyed the setting of rural Wyoming. It seemed an idyllic place to settle down and build a life, with stunning landscapes and townspeople you feel like you're already friends with."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"On the simple side of things, I have to say that I enjoyed Angels Fall. Interesting storyline, characters, and romance. I was hooked into the story fairly easily. And at the same time, I also have to say that I've read better books, and better from Nora Roberts. It didn't quite seem to have that pulse-pounding mystery, and sizzling romance that some of her other books have had. Still, I liked the book a lot.One of the things I enjoyed was that it was really a three-prong story. First you had Reece with her tragic past and all her current neurosis and her struggle to find a future for herself. The you have her relationship with Brody, and lastly you have the mystery aspect of the supposedly dead woman and who killed her. Those three aspects give the story a nice well-rounded feel. Even saying so, I didn't feel as if any one of those really stood out as outstanding.I really liked Reece. I can see how some would find her utterly annoying, but that's only if you take everything she does out of context. I think NR did a great job portraying her daily struggle with life and her anal, O/C nature. She kept Reece's personality and \\"quirks\\" consistent which made the character more real. One thing I did get a little annoyed about with Reece (or the way NR wrote her), was how easily she blamed herself early on for the strange things going on around her. It just bugged me that it wasn't until Brody pushed the idea at her that someone was out to get her that she began to accept it.As for Brody...a bit of an odd character. I can't particularly say he was highly lovable. He's gruff, no-nonsense, and a bit in-your-face. He's not very romantic or tender. On the flip-side, he's very honest and supportive in his own way. I was a bit surprised by his character once I got into the book. Normally, you'd think an author would pair off a character like Reece with a very gentle, sympathetic, soothing man that would help her back to herself. So it was a surprise that NR chose such a strong male lead for Reece. But the pairing worked for the most part. Reece needed someone who wouldn't coddle her or treat her like an invalid. Sometimes, though, I felt he was a bit too gruff...like how he'd tell her to knock-it-off if she was about to cry and stuff like that. I also though NR skimped a bit on developing his character. She didn't really give us all that much of his background, just some major points to give him a place in the story. I would have liked him to have a bit more depth.I liked Reece/Brody, but I didn't love them together. And I think it's safe to say that they wouldn't ever qualify for The Great American Romance. I liked that NR did a bit of a build-up with them. It seems like in so many books, the guy and girl meet and there's massive heat and lust and passion and they're falling into bed in the blink of an eye. Reece and Brody did fall into bed somewhat quickly, but NR gave them some time and space, some interaction to build things. I liked that. And I liked Brody's slow-slide into love. How he'd just suddenly realize he was doing certain things that he'd never consider doing before. It was amusing. In the end though, I just wasn't that attached to the pairing. They were an interesting pair and I rooted for them, but they just didn't have that really great pull, that strong emotional bond that makes them perfect together.Good storyline, but I wouldn't really call it a meaty, overpowering one. But then, if the plot had been like that, I think it would have overshadowed Reece's character too much. I think the plot was rather realistic, though, even if a bit simple. Woman takes a walk and sees someone get killed....nothing hard-to-believe, or very original, about that. It is very simplistic, but it works for the story. It sets up a chains of events that keep things active and interesting. Back to the originality aspect, though, the idea of someone trying to discredit Reece by making her look crazy has been done before, probably numerous times. In the end, I think perhaps the plot could have been a bit stronger, a bit more convoluted, but that's just my opinion.I read some reviews on the 'net that said the bad-guy was really obvious really early in the book, but it didn't seem that way to me. I had a character I was leaning strongly toward rather early one, but I kept second-guessing throughout the book, kept wondering about other characters. NR did a good job of allowing suspicions to wander. I always seemed to lean toward my #1 suspect, but at times I thought it could have been Mac, or Doc, or Lo, or for a brief moment, even Linda-gail. What tipped the scales, though, was near the end when the moon-pendant necklace was mentioned. Then I knew for sure who it was. So on that aspect of the story, I think NR did a good job of keeping me guessing, keeping me wanting to read more to find out who the bad guy was.One thing I thought early on was that I wished I hadn't known so much about Reece's character going into the book. The book jacket pretty much gives away the major point of her history, and the summary at Amazon was even more detailed. You know going in that she is the sole-survivor of a brutal attack, trying to put her life back together. I wished I hadn't know that. I think her character, and her idiosyncrasies, would have had a greater impact if I'd known less about her.I enjoyed the small, side-storyline of Linda-gail and Lo. I almost kinda wished she'd delved a little deeper there, but that probably wouldn't have fit the story. Joanie was also a nice addition to the story. I liked her, along with the others in the supporting cast - Mac, Doc, etc.So overall, I thought Angels Fall was a nice well-rounded story, but it didn't really stand-out to me on any level. But it was still a good read."},{"Title":"Angels Fall","review":"It was suspenseful and compelling. I have not read any good Nora Robert's books that were not outstanding.

It should've begun on the day that her happy culinary career was shattered by an armed robbery. For additional drama we could have been with the heroine when she decides to chuck her past life and take off across country in her old car. Instead the book begins when she has been drifting around for quite some time and her car breaks down at Angels Fist. We are shown how paranoid and jittery she is- which is more irritating than anything. The dramatic events that made her this way are related in an offhand background narrative. The story is too flat without hooks to pull in the reader. This is the first Nora Roberts book I've read and it may be the last.

This photographic chronicle is interspersed with prototype drawings and designs as well as reflections of the artists as they brought their project to life. Through \\"The Gates'\\" the couple created an artistic representation of two of our oldest cultural and religious totems: the myth of Hades and Persephone and that of Moses and the Burning Bush.The photos of a snow-covered Central Park in February with the naked, brown-grey trees - which lack depth but somehow yield shadows - reminded me of Hades; the orange gates reminded me of Persephone and her fateful pomegranates. Winter will yield to spring which will eventually yield right back to winter. Other photographs bring to mind the Biblical story of Moses with the orange gates looking like bushes blazing cross Central Park.The story of rebirth and redemption is expressed in literature and was exquisitively expressed in this outdoor art. Both stories, and about 4 million others based on crowd attendance figures, were told across Central Park for 16 short, sweet days.

Are the paths of our lives already determined, without our ability to change them, or do they consist of choice, chance and luck, with coincidences thrown in here and there to spice things up? The individuals who contributed their stories to Arlene Uslander and Brenda Warneka's book, The Simple Touch of Fate, certainly belief in destiny - and how it has worked in their favour.This is a collection of individual tales of unusual circumstances that seem to have no other explanation than that of fate for those concerned. What about Jacob, who through a series of events and a rearranged business meeting, missed the flight from Boston's Logon Airport at 8.45, that would have carried him to his death on September 11th? Or the story of Cynthia, who worked late one night - when she should have gone home - in her job as a nurse one to attend an emergency, and found the patient to be her real mother who had had her unwillingly adopted at birth?The Simple Touch of Fate is a pleasing compilation of 55 stories and accounts that do not need a scientific justification of whether they are actually the result of some kind of divine intervention. It is how the individual makes sense of them that is important. How many people have missed flights that would not have led to their death? And how many people have been in circumstances which have led to their life lost? Does fate work both ways?There may well be no explanation at all; it's just good luck and bad luck, but the enjoyment of this book comes from how the contributors interpret their own situations, and from amazement at how chance may throw out such odds, if fate is not a probable rationalization for you. Whether you believe in destiny or not, this collection makes a delightful book to read, pick up and dip into, as you desire."},{"Title":"THE SIMPLE TOUCH OF FATE: How the Hand of Fate Touched Our Lives Forever","review":"In their book The Simple Touch of Fate, editors Arlene Uslander and Brenda Warneka have collected the stories of ordinary men and women whose lives have been changed by circumstance, choice, or divine intervention, otherwise known as fate. From the dramatic to the every-day, each of the contributors to the book share with readers an intimate look at how they feel their lives have never been the same since that moment.From the man who missed Flight 11 out of Boston on the morning of September 11, 2001 because of an unscheduled meeting that ran long, to the man who missed his friends by going to the wrong bar, but ended up meeting the woman who became his wife, the contributors to the anthology bare their souls for us. Stories from war-torn parts of the world are arranged next to stories from contributors who could be your friends and neighbors. Events that happened more than fifty years ago are juxtaposed with those that could have occurred last week, giving each writer's story a 'just happened' quality that is sure to make readers take pause at the end of a chapter. Love, death, heartbreak, missed opportunities, and narrow escapes from disaster mark the pages of The Simple Touch of Fate, leaving the reader to ponder if everything really does happen for a reason.Even the development of Uslander and Warneka's editorial relationship could be described as fate. Warneka was the first to respond to an online bulletin board posting of Uslander's seeking submissions for the book, then responded again when Uslander posted another request for help with the query letter for the book. &quot;How could you have had books published if you can't write a good query letter?&quot; Warneka wrote. The correspondence had begun, and the friendship, and collaboration, soon followed.Uslander and Warneka have accepted some outstanding work from writers around the world for this book. While the writing style of dozens of authors obviously varies from story to story, the earnestness and honesty with which these writers share their experiences and convictions are unified by their belief that this event, phone call, or circumstance clearly happened for a reason.The editors include an 'About the Editors' section that really adds to the reader's overall appreciation of the book.

The inevitable events predestined by this force. A final result or consequence; on an outcome. If anyone has read Greek and Roman mythology it reads of Fates the three Goddesses Clotho, Lachesis and Atropos, who control human destiny. It real boils down to what if.

It is something inevitable, unavoidable, certain. But to the real people behind the stories in Arlene Uslander's and Brenda Warneka's book, THE SIMPLE TOUCH OF FATE, fate has a different definition.Says Thomas Wilson, \\"...when people are touched by the hand of fate, they know it\\" (p. 1). And, indeed, the contributors to Uslander's and Warneka's book knew that fate had played a hand in their lives...a play that would change direction of their lives forever.For some, fate meant a feeling or obstacle that held them out of disaster's way. For those, fate kept them from taking a route that would have meant their demise. For others, fate found them uncertain at a crucial decision-making time in their lives and directed them to a clear path. For still others, fate meant comfort at a time of loss, or a chance meeting that resulted in a reunion never thought possible. Fate, as the stories show, can take so many forms.Take, for example, an ill mother who speaks just one word before dying - and a daughter who hears it at a time she desperately needs to. Or a drowning child suddenly given one last thrust of energy that saves her life. Or a \\"spirit board\\" pounding out a life-saving message to a little girl. These are just some of the stories found in THE SIMPLE TOUCH OF FATE.The stories in Uslander's and Warneka's book are quite varied, contributed by people from all walks of life. A great deal of them revolve around avoiding tragedy, the kind of stories that make one wonder if there is something more \\"out there\\". But a few of the stories are the strange, no explanation, goosebump-creating tales that defy even the staunchest doubter.It is impossible to put down this book without feeling a glimmer of inspiration and a reason to explore your own faith in whom exactly is the director of our lives. Painstakingly chosen and carefully edited, the stories in THE SIMPLE TOUCH OF FATE are just a scratch on the surface of what wonderment may exist in this world. It is my prediction that Uslander and Warneka are onto something glorious with this endeavor - something that will turn into volumes upon volumes of people reaching out with their incredible tales - perhaps in doing so, extending their own hands of fate.Contributed by:Jennifer BrownBookpleasures"},{"Title":"THE SIMPLE TOUCH OF FATE: How the Hand of Fate Touched Our Lives Forever","review":"Ms. Uslander and Ms. Warneka compiled different wonderful stories on how fate had changed every character's lives.

Its stories are unique, a cut above what you might find in other anthologies, and through them we discover that no matter what the story, how amazing or normal, we can somehow relate. The first thought that will pop into your mind is, &quot;Hey, something like that happened to me once ...&quot; And isn't that what great reading is all about???"},{"Title":"THE SIMPLE TOUCH OF FATE: How the Hand of Fate Touched Our Lives Forever","review":"Choose to call it what you may: destiny, luck, kismet or fate. The common thread in this anthology is the presence in everyday lives of a force that intervenes. While that force may cause a shift that bears tragedy, this collection of more than 50 personal tales focuses ultimately on the positive.Culled from the experiences of people across the globe, each story carries the imprint of its author, allowing their personal perspectives to light the way to their conclusions. While some simply allow for the presence of destiny, others connect their experiences to a higher power, whether guardian angel or god. No matter the reader's theological stance, by the end of the book, readers are loath to attribute the events to simple luck. The stories, all of which are represented as factual, span several decades and cross the globe, adding elements of timelessness and universality to the concept of fate. This collection of stories from others opens the door to considering forces at work in your own life. Perhaps most satisfying though, is finally learning the answer to &quot;Why did the chicken cross the road&quot;?"},{"Title":"THE SIMPLE TOUCH OF FATE: How the Hand of Fate Touched Our Lives Forever","review":"What a great collection of stories! I'm still trying to figure out which one is my favorite! Each one of them is a unique and personal gift for the reader! I'm betting on a second edition!&quot;"},{"Title":"THE SIMPLE TOUCH OF FATE: How the Hand of Fate Touched Our Lives Forever","review":"I am a student of metaphysics and have a particular interest in Near Death Experiences and how they impact individual lives, so the experiences recounted in this book are consistent with my belief system. I see them as powerful anecdotal evidence of a higher intelligence, influencing and shaping our lives. The stories suggest that we are, in ordinary states of consciusness, only dimly aware of it's workings, but, occasionally, we are given a glimpse into the dimension from which events become manifest.I find it deeply affirming to read about such events, so I appreciate the work these writers have done, and I hope readers will continue to share experiences where the hand of fate has touched their lives, parting the veil for a brief glimpse into something beyond.Joan Ruderman, Marriage and Family Therapist"},{"Title":"THE SIMPLE TOUCH OF FATE: How the Hand of Fate Touched Our Lives Forever","review":"Tingles down my back at every story told me this was an inspiring book. Fate and how it plays a part in everyone's life, both young and old, is what makes this book fascinating reading. From the nurse who stayed late to meet a special patient to the train not taken, many wonderful awe-filled stories show us we are not alone in the world, but maybe part of a bigger design. Enjoy your journey down Fate's unending road. I applaud the author's efforts and can't wait for the next in the series. Susan Schwartz, Writer & Book Reviewer"},{"Title":"THE SIMPLE TOUCH OF FATE: How the Hand of Fate Touched Our Lives Forever","review":"Do you believe in fate? Fate, \\"the supposed force, principle, or power that predetermines events,\\" as defined by the dictionary, is known under many names--destiny, kismet, predestination, foreordainment, foredoom, luck, or just coincidence--and is often described by individuals around the world. Arlene Uslander and Brenda Warneka have experienced acts of fate in their lives. In The Simple Touch of Fate: How the Hand of Fate Touched our Lives Forever, they share not only their own stories but have gathered over fifty real stories by real people, in a thought-provoking anthology, that leave you with one question: if it weren't fate, how and why did these events happen?As a lover of suspense and mysteries, I enjoy reading or hearing about events or activities that leave us wondering and questioning. I especially enjoy \\"little\\" acts that happen. For instance, was it a coincidence that one of the authors chosen for this anthology, Patricia Patteson, had also been included in an anthology, Mist on the Mon, that had sat on my bookshelf for many years, unread, but was immediately pulled and enjoyed when it was included in this book?Or was it fate that a daily newsletter I read before I began to write this review, covered a mysterious life-saving event, but in that story, the writer attributed her story to guardian angels? Personally, I no longer question such things. In fact, based upon a book, As You Wish by Christine Massot Simpson, a resident of Canada, for whom I had the privilege to help edit and publish her book, I now use her phrase, \\"A God Incident\\" whenever I confront such events.Let me share a little about my favorites from The Simple Touch of Fate. If you don't believe in fate, then these short stories just may force you to reconsider--is there something or someone, somewhere that controls events in our lives?Jacob! Jacob! Reborn. The date was September 11, 2001. Jacob Herbst often traveled by plane; however, work-related activities prevented his taking a scheduled flight from Boston's Logan Airport at 8:45, American Airlines, Flight 11, to Los Angeles. How do you thank a man who could not make an important meeting, causing an unexpected delay, for saving your life?Desert Boomerang. Two soldiers meet in Iraq; one is standing guard at a barren traffic control point and helps the other by giving him directions. Months later, the same two soldiers meet at the site of an accident on a deserted road and the favor is returned. Only this time, lives are saved! For the man just happened to be part of a medical unit...We all Cross Paths for a Reason. A birth mother and her now-grown daughter are reunited through an automobile accident and a woman's willingness to work overtime. Just a coincidence?Time for Life. A man and a woman, members of one family, but located in different places--both trying to catch the train--fail in their efforts due to various reasons. They missed the most disastrous train crash in the United Kingdom in 42 years.\\"Honor, Courage, and Commitment\\": Saving Jack Roush. When a small plane is in trouble, it happens to hit near the home of an ex-marine, specifically trained \\"to save a pilot in an upside-down plane from a watery grave.\\"Grandmother Spirits. In a time of family distress, a woman prays to the spirits of grandmothers for the needs of a family. Was it a coincidence or a direct response to prayer that allowed a son just arriving in Hiroshima to be able to make a free call to his mother?The Angel That Couldn't Fly. My favorite! A wonderful answer to why the chicken crossed the road...Uslander and Warneka have created an excellent, well-diversified anthology that provides heart-warming, happy, life-saving and sometimes-unbelievable tales. They are presented with an interesting continuity, yet broken with small offerings of people's own definitions of fate. I found it informative, flawlessly presented to allow readers to form their own conclusions regarding these stories from \\"real people.\\" For those who continuously wonder... and search... I found this a must-read!"},{"Title":"THE SIMPLE TOUCH OF FATE: How the Hand of Fate Touched Our Lives Forever","review":"Fate means different things to different people, but in general it is described as a moment when our destinies are guided by something we cannot explain - a moment when things happen that seem coincidental, miraculous or simply amazing. In \\"The Simple Touch of Fate\\" the editors have compiled over 50 true stories of fated events. The collection will give readers a satisfying sampling of the variety of fate's guidance in our lives.Examples of chance events, from the reuniting of a husband and wife separated over years and oceans by the chance purchase of a tablecloth at a yard sale, to a woman's astounding luck at winning it big twice on the slot machines of Las Vegas on the same date a year apart, will amaze you and leave you wondering if these events are coincidences. Read on and discover that we all cross paths for a reason, we are all sometimes in the wrong place at the wrong time, but are also sometimes in the right place at the right time. How does it all equal out? Sometimes it doesn't. There are instances of devastating results of fate in this book, balanced by unbelievable tales of good fortune.The editors share their own instances of the hand of fate and have compiled a unique collection that is sure to be appreciated by readers who have even a hint of appreciation for the unknown, the mystical and the fact of life that not everything can be explained."},{"Title":"Grimms' fairy tales","review":"A particularly strong mid-century release from Heritage.Grimm's Fairy Tales aka The Complete Household Tales, 1962.

Don't get me wrong its a nice book with nice photographs, it just wasn't the find I was hoping for. If I hadn't of known better I'd thought I was reading Vongs cookbook.

I really appreciated the way the dishes were executed and pictured in real time. There is no over manipulation of presentation to impress nor over stepping too many classic boundaries whether Asian or Occidental.It seems that going &quot;beyond fusion&quot; is in a way a sense of going back to basics. Where the items are fused as in the book I could taste and see how each would complement, not confuse. This guy has the back ground and obviously has a respect for food. I think it is a great book and it is surely one of those thing where to get something simply done is not necessarily done simply. Congratulations.

A good find."},{"Title":"Beyond Fusion: A New Look at Ethnic Influences on Contemporary Cooking","review":"The book has wonderful photography but the main beauty lies in the application of ideas. It invokes the imaginative side of cookery. After reading it, I am urged to explore cookery beyond culturally accepted norms. I feel that the whole basis is totally about the combination of western and eastern styles of cooking to produce a unique food that goes beyond traditional boundaries. Even different sub-cultures are mixed in cooking to create something palatable to all. It is truly beyond the melding of East and West. The book shows us how the combination of cooking ideas can actually work. It is creativity at its best.

Don't despair, you can even start on Asian Dried Fruit Dipped in Chocolate, and make Mango and Jackfruit Spring Rolls.I bought this on the basis of the rave reviews, and just have found other fine Asian/Asian Fusion books with similar fine qualities, for less money, and with simpler recipes."},{"Title":"Beyond Fusion: A New Look at Ethnic Influences on Contemporary Cooking","review":"I have many cookbooks in my library but nothing as beautiful as this!

Renowned chef Pierre Koffmann refers to him as one of the most brilliant young chefs to graduate his restaurant La Tante Claire in Chelsea (London). In addition to this culinary confirmation, Rainer has traveled and worked thoughout Asia, North America and Europe. So who better to iron out some of the wrinkles in the confusion over fusion than a chef who has first hand experience of working within a multitude of cultures and countries?To set the scene the cookbook begins with a journey through an Asian wet market \\"the Temple to which the majority of Asian housewives make their daily pilgrimage for fresh food, household wares and other necessities.\\" Wet markets offers every commodity that a cook could desire; produce, seafood, spices - even live chickens wait to be bought, slaughtered and plucked. To many chefs in Asia the pilgrimage to a wet market serves as the fuel that fires their imagination.This well written piece puts the reader in the mood for the next five chapters of recipes. The chapters are logically categorized offering; soups and laksa (Asian noodle soups), vegetables, fish and seafood, meat and poultry and finally sweets.The skills and techniques used in each of the dishes varies - the recipes suit cooks of every level. The Thai Red Curry Cappuccino proved to be delicious and the Kataifi Prawns is a really simple multi purpose dish that would be a good addition to anyone's home repertoire or a great snack for professional chef to add to their bar menu.Each creation is accompanied by a brief narration from Rainer and complimented with inspirational photography courtesy of the author's friend Shekar. The lay out of the book is colorful and simple, finishing with a few &quot;notes&quot; from the chef. In this final part of the book Rainer explains some of his basic philosophies and credits the hard work of those who made the book possible.To summarize - if you want to understand or love fusion food or are a true cookbook lover, Beyond Fusion will make a fantastic addition to your library."},{"Title":"Beyond Fusion: A New Look at Ethnic Influences on Contemporary Cooking","review":"Somebody recommended this book to me and i bought it through a friend in Singapore as it is for some reason not available here.

The strangers in &quot;Kindness of Strangers&quot; were the people of Italy and the kindness was the way they thwarted the attempts of the Nazis to round up the Jews and ship them to their extermination camps. The people and the low level officials of Italy accomplished wonders in keeping these Jews out of the hands of their 'ally' Germany often at substantial risk to themselves.Erna and her daughter, Alice, and her husband Belo Grott were refugees from Czechoslovakia and were on their way to Palestine when they were trapped in Italy together with a number of other Jewish refugees. They were trapped by an unscrupulous agent who sold their tickets out from under them. Ms Herzberg relates their experiences in such a skillfully written story that the reader is completely entranced and turning the pages one after the other to keep abreast of the happenings. The reader may even shed a tear or two for this family and for the kindnesses extended to them by their involuntary hosts, the Italian people."},{"Title":"Kindness of Strangers","review":"As a fellow writer, I am picky about the books I read, but The &quot;Kindness of Strangers&quot; does not disappoint, although it often surprises. I never knew how humane some Italians were to Jews during World War II until I read this book. Ms. Herzberg is a masterful story teller. In her poignant tale of hope and hopelessness she proves that everywhere there are caring people willing to help strangers, while fearing for their own lives. The story will warm your heart and perhaps change your mind about many things.Rosalie Kramer: published author and poet"},{"Title":"Kindness of Strangers","review":"A wonderful book to place on reading lists for high school students...many schools have a holocaust unit.

I was already crying twice in the first few chapters as I began to become involved with the characters, so you can imagine, no you can't, how I sobbed and sobbed at the end.After I put the book down, it was like someone close to me had died, and all that history....I was at the health farm, 4th or 5th day on juices only, such a clean little body and soul I was, and so my mind was clear of the usual daily things of living at home. I just found it so interesting, and the characters were alive for me. I'm intrigued about how you gathered your resources.How did you get the stories / incidents from the people involved? How did you find them?Whom did you speak to? Over what period of time? Did you tape them? Did you take notes? How consistent were their independent accounts? How open were they with you? How did you get them to be so open with you? Did you search other sources? You know we had just seen a snippet of history, including the NY waistshirtfactory fire....amazing.One woman there said that she had heard it discussed on our ABC radio station.

You have shown a part of our lives of which was completely unknown to our generation. When I reached page 39 I became aware that the year 1921 was mentioned, and as my husband, Jack, and I were both born in1922 that the Following information had happened in our lifetime and we knew absolutely nothing of the dreadful events going on in Europe, culminating in the rise of Nazism and Fascism.[I don't think I should dignify those words witha Capital Letter! Jack and I both did our Matriculation in 1939 just as war broke out and we knew nothing of what had been going on in Europe and yet we had a Jewish boy migrate with his family from Germany in 1938. We were both studying German and he joined our class. We didn't ask him why he left Germany, we only knew he spoke German better than we did. All through the war we never heard anything about the atrocities that were a part of everyday life in so many countries. When the war finished in 1945 we wereamazed to see the first news reports and photos of Belsen with skeletal bodies, some dead and some still alive. Then the truth came out and we wondered why we were so unaware. How could we be so naive? We thought Australia was NOT a third world country!! Then we began to get refugees who told us about the things that had occurred We heard stories that were sickening. Of course when I read your book I was so glad that you had chosen to tell the story of Erna and Alice and Belo who came from Czechoslovakia. This was wonderful for me as one of my best friends isfrom there .Her mother would not or would not speak of her experiences during the War and it was only after she died that my friend discovered that her mother and a younger brother were the only survivors.5 older brothers died in one of the death camps.Also our daughter's partner's mother, father and grandmother came out here just before the war as neither of his parents could get work as they were Jewish. So your wonderful Book is very personal to me. I have spoken to Marketa [surname Lebovic]and she is anxious to read it although I know it will be a sad time for her. I know it was for me but we ALL should know to hope it can't happen again.

She takes the reader intimately into the lives of a Czechoslovakian Jewish family during WWII, expertly developing the characters. The three main characters are Erna, the mother, Alice the young daughter, and Belo, Alice's husband. When the Nazis threaten the Jews in their homeland, the three of them arrange to flee to Palestine via Italy, but find that they have been cheated and must remain in Italy. By exercising their inate skills including Belo's interpersonal charm, they establish warm relationships among the Italian people they meet. Their unintentional hosts go to great lengths to see to it that they and the other Jews do not starve and that the Germans do not ship them off to concentration camps. The Italian people performed one wonderful deed after another with no motivation other than inherent kindness to people who needed food and help. The Italians' kindness to the Jews during World War II has not been recognized to any degree, and this wonderful book goes a long way towards making sure that they get some of the credit that is their due."},{"Title":"Mirrors","review":"Proper placement of mirrors is an essential design strategy when attempting to alter the perception of space; I was hoping this book would educate me further on the subject.

However, this book is much better in summarizing (and reinforcing) the important issues when developing VB/COM+/IIS applications as compared to Transactional COM+ which does indulge in gratuitous details too often. Effective Visual Basic is definitely not for beginners, rather, it makes sense only if you've repeatedly wondered why COM+ works the way it does. Rule 3-4 also gives a good understanding of why stateless objects aren't always good. If you ever wondered why Singletons are not good in the COM+ world (or why you cannot stick COM object references into the ASP Session Object) then Rule 3-2 explains it all.

Assuming nothing more than an acquaintance withschool algebra and a little geometry, they developthe basic properties of central algebraic structures, includingrings, groups and fields. These are treated by reference tofamiliar examples, such as the ring of integers and therational, real and complex fields. Everything that one learnedin school algebra is to be found here, though, as is to beexpected, each topic is treated at a rigorous, mathematicallysophisticated level. In the first two chapters, the propertiesof the integers and rational numbers are gradually examined,ultimately down to the definition of addition and multiplicationon the basis of Peano postulates. The authors then considerpolynomials, the real and complex numbers, vector spaces, linearalgebra and other topics.The writing style is clear, concise and elegant, with each newconcept being carefully defined as it is introduced. The proofsachieve a satisfying balance between detail and brevity. Indeed,reading the proofs and completing the exercises would do much, Iam sure, to enhance a reader's mathematical facility.If you are interested in acquiring a deeper understanding ofalgebra, this book should serve as an excellent introduction."},{"Title":"A Survey of Modern Algebra","review":"This is a classic book on Algebra. There is much that I like about it. It is exactly what the name suggests--a survey course. It briefly introduces all sorts of topics, including rings, fields, groups, galois theory, vector spaces, lattices, boolean algebras, and much more. It is written at a fairly elementary level and it generally doesn't go into a great amount of depth in each subject. Interestingly, many (more modern) algebra texts omit a number of rather basic topics in this book. Also, many modern books separate \\"linear algebra\\" from \\"abstract algebra\\", whereas this book takes a more integrated approach.I find it exceptionally clear and easy to read. Many of the subjects are made particularly easy; there is a strong concrete flavour to the text. The authors provide good motivation for the material.I think this book would make excellent reading material for someone who is planning to study algebra. I did not pick it up until early in graduate school, and I wish I had had access to it earlier, when I was first studying ring and field theory.

War, greed, politics, underhanded schemes, a Leonardo Da Vinci-like. This book has it all. I'd have to say this is one of my favorites of my many Discworld novels. It rates to me on a level of Feet of Clay and Men at Arms. Commander Vimes, the ever reluctant gentleman, and his new pocket orginizer add an interesting insight into the ever famous &quot;Trousers of Time&quot;. The Patrician's foresight and amazing ingenuity is shown fully in this novel, a rarity to see because of his position. With Reg Shoe being brought into the Watch (remember him from Reaper Man?), the wide range of previously used characters, including the minor character Dorfl from Soul Music and Detritus from many of the previous novels, is extended. An enjoyable read, and quite insightful... if you can stop laughing enough to look into it."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"I love Pratchett novels, and this book is no different. In this excellent addendum to the Discworld novels, the main joke is that a new island pops up, and so who's the owner? This novel can be read on three different levels, for the chracters, the jokes and for the underlying meaning. If you get all three, consider yourself blessed, if not, read on... Definitely a must have for Pratchett fans, and a good addition for any Pythonites out there."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"If Death is scratching a cat's ears around the corner before coming to help you towards your final resting place, but, in his new role as a 'people-person', is allowing you to read just one more book, choose this one. If you gotta go, go with a smile on your face."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"This is my favorite Discworld novel I have read yet (the others are Men at Arms, Interesting Times, and Lords and Ladies.) Although Men at Arms has the best scene I've read (the pork futures warehouse scene,) this is the best overall. This novel is simultaneously one of the best fantasy novels and also brilliant parody of the genre."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"With war on the near horizon Nobby and Colon are the last two we'd expect the Patrician to seek out as trusted aides, but then this is Pratchett, who can make even this, one of the lesser Disk novels, a mind opening wonder. How the Patrician sues for Peace is alone worth the asking price."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"Terry Pratchett made it clear about a dozen books ago that when he is writing - no one is safe. Jingo focuses on the government control, or lack thereof, of Leshp - an island that has mysteriously surfaced between Ankh-Morpork (which is, of course, nothing like Britain) and Klatch (which is, of course, nothing like Northern Africa or the Middle East).Making fun of politics both modern and medieval, Jingo showcases the City Watch from such books as Men At Arms and Feet of Clay. Commander Vimes, a constant adversary of the nobility, faces the daunting task of averting a war when the hilariously clueless noblemen of the city attempt to raise an army to fight the vastly superior forces of Klatch for control of Leshp.This is one of the standout books of the series, especially if you have a disdain for politics in general. Pratchett is dead-on on his satirical commentary and even manages to squeeze in a plot among all the irony. Top notch!"},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"This is one of the best Discworld novels. City Watch is one of my favorite themes, so this book didn't disappoint. There are certainly so many differnt characters here: main ones like Vimes, Carrot, Vetinari the Patrician; other watch people like Angua, Detritus, Nobby, and Colon; and interesting minor characters like Leonard de Quirm and 71-hour Ahmed, Vimes' Klatchian counterpart.A new island (later we learn not so new) has risen to the surface, and both Klatch and Ankh-Morpork claim it, even though it in itself is hardly spectacular. It is funny to see the two groups of settlers fighting over wood and water as if it were gold. On the surface, it looks like no contest - Klatch has a real army; Ankh-Morpork has none. But Klatch doesn't have Vimes or Vetinari or Leonard de Quirm on their side to help them.On one hand, the rich leaders of the city under Lord Rust try to raise a real army and attack Klatch. This is funny, especially Vimes' butler Willikins as a soldier (better than I would think). On the other hand, Vimes smells a rat concerning an attempt on the Klatchian ambassador's life and travels to Klatch to confront his Klatchian counterpart, 71-hour Ahmed who basically seeks the same information from him. Further, Vetinari, together with Leonard de Quirm, Colon, and Nobby, seek their own answers - they go on a submarine mission to the island to see if they can solve the problem another way.The submarine mission is very funny, especially Nobby in disguise in Klatch - it has quite an effect on him in later books. Leonard de Quirm gets a large role here, more so than in Men at Arms. I always like reading about the discworld's answer to the Renaissance Man. (It gets even better in the later book &quot;The Last Hero&quot;).A good all-around book with plenty of interesting characters."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"Of all the series-within-a-series that the Discworld books include (Death, Rincewind, Granny Weatherwax, etc.), my favorite has to be the tales of Captain Vimes and the Ankh-Morpork Watch. \\"Jingo\\" continues their tales with an adventure that begins with a lost island arising from the sea. This, naturally, edges the city of Ankh-Morpork to the brink of war with Klatch for no apparent reason.One of the things that made this book stand out, even from the other Watch books, is how Pratchett got to shine a spotlight on some lesser-used characters. Corporal Nobbs (\\"Nobby\\") gets a great, brilliantly funny subplot that starts with him wanting to find a nice girl and concludes someplace so wonderfully absurd I refuse to spoil it for you. Vimes is the level-headed leader of men we've come to expect. Even Lord Vetinari gets a chance to shine in this book like he hasn't in the earlier volumes. My personal favorite character, Captain Carrot, is pushed a bit to the background this time out, but he gets so much development in the other books it's hard to complain. Even here there are a few moments that show exactly how superhumanly rational Carrot is, rounding him out quite nicely.Pratchett can blend satire, comedy and adventure in a way no one else can. If the day ever comes where I tire of the Discworld, you'll have to roll me away under a tarp."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"It's been a while that I read the book, but thinking of the events that happened lately, I think that anyone who knows the story, knows also that it can happen in reality. A war between two countries and the intollerance against the others. As I had read the book I saw it as a very funny book, leaders making decisions that can and will go absolutely wrong, some poor guys who have to follow the orders and the intollerance against the others, normally living in peace next to each other. But then I didn't realize that someday it would happen in reality. We can only hope that there will be also a real Commander Vimes. In the book he was a strong person, showing that intollerance was a bad leader"},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"I can not say much more than what has already been said, most of it right on as it is.

Jingo, a thrilling book, is one of the best of the later publications in the series. It includes laughter, as Nobby is transformed into an exotic strip-dancer, and of course, the thrill of our very own Ankh-Morpork taking on Klatch, and other baddies...Oh, and Leonard da Quirm invents a tin boat that's meant to SINK! We can let him off because he's a genius, I suppose. The watch are as funny as ever, and Commander Vimes is yet again living on his wits.Jingo is a book that will keep you on the edge, and rules supreme over The Truth and The 5th elephant. And it's on paperback too."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"Pratchett is on great form here in this brilliant satire. Thiss is perhaps not surprising since his 'Watch&quot; novels are always of the highest calibre. I particularly enjoyed the quotes of the former Ankh Morpork soldier General Tacticus however. It gives a very accurate portrayal of the jingoism it mocks and besides which it is absolutely hilarious. If you've never experienced Pratchett's humor before you don't know what you're missing. If you're new to Pratchett you'd probably be better starting on Guards Guards but this is still a good novel to start on."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"In the latest edition of the series involving Commander Vimes and crew, quality co-exists with quantity. By this I mean that this great read will keep you reading for awhile. Don't worry though, it will keep you wanting more. There are plenty of jokes that'll keep you laughing too. One of my favorite things about this book are the characters. Their personalities are so unique and in-depth, it made me almost miss them when I had finished. The plot is good too, with many different parts that come together in the end. If you like this one, you'll like its predecessors such as &quot;Feet of Clay&quot; and &quot;Men at Arms&quot;.

Well, at least dinner. Most of the time.) while keeping up with his never-ending chase of criminals.And when the prince from the other continent (Klatch), on a diplomatic mission in Ankh-Morpork, is almost killed, war is started.Vetinari goes on a little mission of his own, in a submarine (though it's real name is much longer) invented by one Leonard of Quirm, and Angua boards a ship heading for Klatch and has to get rescued by her boyfriend, Captain Carrot (who is quite calm about the whole thing, of course).By Jingo!Filled with the satire that could only be written down this way correctly by Terry Pratchett, Jingo is a fun story that takes you up in the spinning of the Diskworld."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"I took me a while to figure out why the book is Jingo, but my advice is look it up(AND, of course, read the book) While all Discworld novels are poignant, this one is especially so at a time like this. Not the most funny, but one of the more philisophical City Watch books. See President Bush, stereotypes, nationalism, and just about everything that leads to war not only parodied and ridiculed, but somewhat explained. Mr. Pratchett, as always, makes one laugh out loud at times and want to think deeply at others. Ofcourse, if you are a staunch American, you may not want to read this book."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"I found the book to be one of the most humourous distillations of the real world that I have read for some time.

This was my first DiscWorld and will certainly not be my last."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"I loved this book...See the head of a parade tossing his sword around in the air and rolling a dogend. See an army arrested for loitering and unruly behavior. See Leondard da Quirm with his automatic rocket launcher...

It's bursting at the seams with laughter, but the puns don't jump up and try to snare you, you find them yourself. If you like the discworld novels, you might try Piers Anthony's Xanth novels.

'Jingo' seemed to appear on only one page, and only as a meaningless curse. The story didn't have a lot to it, and the laughs were sparse. I was also disappointed by the disoragnizer and it's journey down the wrong leg of the trousers of time. There could have been a great deal of fun and chaos as a result (remember the madness in Mort?) but Pratchett missed out. Worth reading, still, but not in hardcover. It is Pratchett's worst discworld novel, but that means it is better than almost every other fun-fantasy writer ever!"},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"Jingoism -- \\"inverted patriotism whereby the love of one's own nation is transformed into hatred of another nation, and into the fierce craving to destroy the individual members of that other nation.\\" -J.A. Hobson. Pratchett chose his title well."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"While the main hero of the novel is Commander Vimes of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, the story jumps from character to character, and from sub-plot to sub-plot, leaving the story somewhat fragmented. Ankh-Morpork and Klatch become involved in a dispute over ownership of the desolate island of Leshp which has risen from the sea. It is a typical story of countries spending vast amounts of their resources in a dispute over a relatively worthless piece of real estate, with various people pursuing their own agendas and feathering their own nests as they appeal to patriotism. With sailing ships, camels, a stolen (somewhat threadbare) flying carpet, and a submarine, the plot gets interesting. The story is humorous, but various dead bodies are left about the landscape."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"All Corgi Audio books are abridged editions, with Terry Pratchett being read by Tony Robinson."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"... but as a true Discworld-fan I guess you just have to have the whole collection. Don't waste your money on the hardcover edition, though. Better buy the paperback!"},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"If you want the book Jingo, the version coauthored by Steven Briggs is not it!! It is the script for a play based on Jingo. If you want the book, make sure that you get the book where only Terry Pratchett is author!!"},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"Until this latest work, the Diskworld series was more or less unblemished, but the jokes in &quot;Jingo&quot; wore a bit thin. I guess everyone makes mistakes, though...&quot;Jingo&quot; sees Pratchett falling into shallow moralizing instead of good storytelling. Lord Rust is the most cookie-cutter, two-dimensional character in the whole series, as the egotistical, Warmonger Noble [&quot;as seen in the Wheel of Time series!]&quot; and especially unbelievable considering that in &quot;Men at Arms&quot; he was the pragmatic one.21-hour Ahmed is almost as shallow, again it seems that Pratchett pulled a stock character from the Bad Fantasy Novel Cast List Grab Bag[tm] and grafted him in.Speaking of grafting, the whole thing with Vimes and the disorganizer in alternate universes is not only rather boring (imagine the worst episode of any Star Trek spinoff), but also badly meshed with the rest of the story. It just comes out of the blue, and never really gets integrated into the story. It's like the sub-plot was shoved in fifteen minutes before deadline.The jokes are fewer (and hence stretched thinner) than in his other books. The &quot;Nobby in drag&quot; joke is so overdone that it qualifies as the first Pratchett gag to fall in the &quot;beating a dead horse&quot; category. We've all seen the joke a thousand times, and just because it's an especially ugly cross-dresser doesn't make the jokes any more original."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"I recently read Terry Pratchett for the first time through an advanced reader's copy of &quot;The Fifth Element.&quot; I greatly enyoyed that book and immediately went out and purchased&quot;Jingo.&quot; While to a large degree similar--though I felt the former to be better plotted and more tightly written--I found the similarities here beginning to wear thin midway through the book. It wasn't that I was bored, or found Pratchett's writing lacking in inventiveness, but that his use of plot devices were already becoming familiar. Not a good sign, if a reflection upon the other 23 Discworld titles. I think I'll give Pratchett a rest; perhaps after a few months the next title I read will appear fresher."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"This is the 21st of Pratchett's Discworld series. Alternatively, it's the 4th book in the Watch subseries (\\"Guards! Guards,\\" \\"Men at Arms,\\" \\"Feet of Clay,\\" \\"Jingo,\\" \\"The Fifth Elephant,\\" \\"Night Watch,\\" and \\"Thud!\\"). Like all his books, this one has a very lively, funny, and tongue-in-cheek plot and narrative. Unfortunately, the very theme of the book forces me to downgrade it to only 3 stars. The title of the book tells it all: Jingo. According to Webster, that's \\"a person who boasts of his patriotism and favors an aggressive, threatening, warlike foreign policy; chauvinist....\\" Essentially, this is an anti-military, anti-nationalism book. It's an interesting thing that throughout Pratchett's novels, various groups of people have formed into guilds. Assassins, thieves, beggers, prostitutes (heck, even stray dogs), etc. all have guilds and, in general, the membership of those guilds are very competent at what they do. Indeed, not only are these people competent, but the very existence of those guilds is considered to be a GOOD thing (in an Ankh-Morporkian way). However, there's no military guild. Almost every instance of military thought or use in this book is something held up as a matter of ridicule. There are no competent military men (well, perhaps one Lieutenant). And the military is always considered to be a BAD thing. Ditto for nationalism. This is a very strange mindset that almost ruins the book. If you subscribe to the same mindset, or if you can work around it for a bit, this is a very good book. But, unfortunately, I found it disconcerting (to say the least). I rate it at merely an OK 3 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"In yet another installment of the interminable Discworld series, Terry Pratchett describes Ankh-Morpork's war with a better-armed and better-prepared neighbor. Though he was once the funniest author writing, Jingo shows further degeneration in Pratchett's creativity and ability, probably the result of seriously overfarming the series.Pratchett has reached the stage in his career where no idea is too weak or too small to be made into a novel. The entire plot of Jingo would have merited a two-line reference or a two-paragraph footnote in one of the best books in the series. In fact, it *did* get used briefly in Guards, Guards. And that is where it should have stayed.The novel drags on through recycled characters and trite plot lines, never really picking up speed, certainly never producing a real laugh. The only consolation prize for the truly determined reader who manages to finish the thing is Pratchett's always masterful command of the language.Reading each new Pratchett novel is like watching the inexorable process of a terminal illness. Jingo is no exception. At this point, perhaps the only kind thing to do is put the series to sleep."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"I've decided he's too good and too prolific for me to write a brand new review every single time I read one of his books. Discworld currently has 34 titles and every one of them will probably knock your socks off. His mind bubbles and flashes like a boiling pot of electric eels, and I simply can't get enough of his writing.A reviewer has compared him to Geoffrey Chaucer. He reminds me more of Douglas Adams, or perhaps S Morgenstern. Great company, isn't it? He's an extremely skillful and imaginative writer, damn funny, clever and observant to boot. He's also very easy to read. A master of characterization, and if there's anything else you like about reading that I didn't mention here, assume I simply forgot. He's awesome.Another reviewer mentioned Jonathan Swift and PG Wodehouse. Why such hallowed company? Because Pratchett belongs there! Truly, I'm enjoying my quest to read every book in the series. You should do the same, and begin your quest at the library because he's got to be there. He's awesome!Yet another reviewer said Jerome K Jerome meets Lord of the Rings. Yeah, that works too.Why do we, as reviewers, compare authors to other authors? Because it's easier than thinking. In the case of Terry Pratchett, it's probably because we'd otherwise wind up quoting the guy. He's so unique that we just don't know how else to cope with his greatness. Even this paragraph sounds like foamy drool raving, doesn't it? That's how all readers react to Pratchett. Reviewers simply don't have the good sense to keep it to themselves.I could call his writing fantasy, but I could likewise call what Douglas Adams wrote science fiction. In both cases, I wouldn't be wrong, but I'd be neglecting so much and just totally missing the point. A rare few authors transcend a genre to such a degree that you know they're shouting out, loud and proud, a big fat \\"Bite me!\\"I love Terry Pratchett's writing, and I completely understand why some folks refer to him as their favorite author. Or favourite, I should say, since we're being British. He's one of those authors that makes you want to grab whoever's in hearing range and start reading passages aloud. I'm simply thrilled that there's such an extremely talented and prolific author who's been working for years without me being aware of him. Now I have much catching up to do, and I will love it."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"\\"Jingo\\" is a good light reading, with some serious insights about human behavior mixed in. Pratchett has a keen eye for human foibles, and a knack for describing them in a humorous manner. My favorite character in \\"Jingo\\" is Leonard of Quirm, a Discworld equivalent of Leonardo da VInci. The consensus rating of 4.5 stars is about right, but individual ratings have to be either 4 or 5 so I went with 5."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"Jingo ridicules war, and that's what it centers about, but in the process it ridicules (the usual) the city of Ankh-Morpork and it's solid river, the government, the people, foreingers and anything else that Terry just happened to be thinking of. (he can't help it i guess).It's one of the best of his books i've ever read and i've read fourteen of them so far (with no plans of stopping). I'd read a recipe of bran muffins if Terry wrote it, that's how much of an established and devoted fan i am.The humour is very hidden at times. My advice, don't start nodding your head off anytime or you'll miss most of the jokes. This guy is a master at the art of sophisticated, witty humour. And fart jokes too (he gets to that somewhere halfway through the book; poor Nobby and Colon. Imagine stuck at a &quot;submersive&quot; and &quot;marine&quot; vehicle under the ocean, with all there is to eat is cheese and (shudder) beans. And the container you're in is sealed. Yeah, the poor crew on board the ship thought it was a sea monster).The characters are very believable, no matter how strange they are. I can actual feel pity for Vimes, the commander of the police Watch. Then there's Captain Carrot, the dwarf who's not so dwarf-ish. I think there's so much depth in this character because this guy just happens to understand EVERYTHING about people. And it's all through pure, innocent ignorance (sounds a bit strange). Terry wonders if three is some hidden intelligence beneath all that innocent stupidity. There must be, no one is that stupid. Well, if that's the case, no one can be that patient.Anyway, there's many layers to this book. The most important one is it's a very, very funny and entertaining book. And it's so different from anything else you've read (other than discworld)."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"I have read Jingo at least thrice so far, and picked it up again over summer. As I went through the usual riff-raff between Klatch and Ankh-Morpork, I couldn't help but throw back the whole story for the world's warring neighbors and the territories in between that cause the wars:Israel-Palestine-ArabsIndia-Kashmir-PakistanSerbia-Bosnia-CroatiaChina-Taiwan-Taiwan (!)China - Spratlys- PhilippinesChina - Spratlys - other SE Asian countriesEngland-France (of old)etc. etc.Just evaluating the possibility that the world's leaders could take a look at this book (better yet, read it!) makes my mouth water. The ridiculous behavior of the world's leaders becomes even more apparent when you compare it with the situations out of this book.I recommend this book heartily to all readers of history, political science, international relations and most of all, to people who need a laugh now and then.Mr. Pratchett, thank you for the great book."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"There are very few writers who can make you laugh out loud just seconds after making your heart clench. In fact, Terry Pratchett is about the only one I've ever read who could do that. The basic plot is very simple. Two countries, who haven't warred in centuries, find an island, that may or may not have value, situated between them. And for various political reasons both sides begin to prepare for war. It's up to the lowly city guard to put a stop to it. Led by a reformed alcoholic and an oddly naive and carefree captain who sees only the best in people (odd mainly because he's still alive, it is Ankh-Morpork after all) the chances for success don't look too good. Especially when Vetinari, the Patrician, is relieved of his duties by the nobility in preperation for the war. And when the foreign ambassador is killed right under the city guard's collective nose? Well, not even a nice game of football is going to do any good. This was easily my favorite of all the discworld novels, the humor was just as good as in Interesting Times but I felt that the plot and the shading of the characters was slightly superior. The only negative thing that I could say about this book (and quite frankly all of the discworld novels) is that you had better be a fast reader. I read it in under six hours, you need that kind of speed, otherwise I believe that the constant off-subject footnotes would get in the way. Small problem, but one that can be annoying at times."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"For anyone who thinks that the plot is confusing, well, life is confusing, isn't it? But I really liked the book, especially since Commander Vimes was so believable and the alternative countdown thing was downright scary. I also like the way he built everything up to just that one moment in the tent when everything rests on a click of the finger and you finally see how it MIGHT have been. Wonderful"},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"Of course Pratchett is the funniest writer of the XXst century. Everything has been said about that.Yet what has amazed me most this time was not the jokes but the story behind them. Pratchett has mnanaged to create an icredible political thriller where nothing is quite what it seems. in fact, the byzantine and treacherous policies of Klatch and Ankh-Morpork are only an image of our own policies.This is more than a Discworld comedy. It's a satire on world politics."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"Of all the shabby, unjustified aggressions witnessed during the 20th Century, few surpass the Malvinas War - Maggie Thatcher's effort to stand with Victoria Regina in Britain's regard. Hundreds of lives were lost over a set of cold, desolate islands in the remote South Atlantic. Someone has calculated that if the money spent on this last gasp of the British Empire had instead gone to resettlement, every resident of the Falkland Islands could have received a million dollars and a new home. Jingo is among the greatest critiques on the folly of wars. It would be nice to think someone sat the Iron Lady down and read this book to her, but she probably wouldn't comprehend it.When an island rises from the sea on Discworld, the nearest \\"nations\\" immediately lay claim to it. The clash of claims leading to war is almost inevitable. Pratchett explains how \\"war feelings\\" must be fostered and encouraged, even when the cause of conflict is such a departure from reason as this pitiful gob of land. Sam Vimes, arguably the most reasonable man on Discworld, becomes a victim of war propaganda, swept along in its tide against his will. Sam's natural leadership brings the rest of the Watch along. Except for two who've gone missing - conscripted by, of all people, Lord Vetanari.Pratchett's characterizations in this book achieve a new pinnacle, especially the new ones. Ahmed, at once Sam's foil and his peer, is a wonderfully enigmatic creation. That he's from \\"the other side\\" merely adds to his value in this book. It's to be hoped we meet him again in some future book. Leonard of Quirm arises from earlier vague references to become a real person. The near-stereotype of the absent-minded scientist must have set some teeth on edge at Oxbridge, but Len is a portrayal everyone will recognize. There's one new character, however, that will give the most dedicated Pratchett fan some pause - Beti. More than just a fresh persona, Beti gives Pratchett an opportunity explore previously unrealized themes in his writings. Some comparisons might be made with Angua, but they would pale against what Beti brings to Pratchett's recent publications.Only one of the characters in this book could be called a disappointment - Carrot. It's almost impossible to view Carrot as an overblown portrayal, but Pratchett manages it this time. No matter - there are too many other excellent renditions that keep you reading and enjoying. Especially that of Sam Vimes. Lord Vetanari's resolution to the strife is in the finest Pratchett tradition of innovative conclusions.The sad aspect of this book is that it was written ten years too late - the act of self- glorification had passed. As a message for future leaders of any nation, it seems to have missed the target. In part, that's because the media and other reviewers of Pratchett's work think that he's a humourist. That's mistaken. Pratchett's a philosopher who happens to have the talent to make us smile while he's making us face real issues. Pratchett forces us to confront ourselves, our prejudices and biases leading us into conflict with our fellows. The theme of \\"us\\" and \\"them\\" seems as ancient as humanity. Whether it will ever be shed is a matter for conjecture, but this book, if read by enough, brings some hope. Pratchett is always more than \\"just funny\\" and this work is one of his finest treatises on human frailty."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"What a fun read! This one had everything you'd expect from Pratchett: it's well written, quite funny (especially if you're already familiar with the series) and offers up some interesting insights into various things, especially xenophobic jingoism. I got a hoot out of the parody references to Oswald/JFK, too, so the book gets extra marks.I will say that if you're looking for a brainless beach-reader, get some SPF20 because Jingo will probably cause you to get sunburned from actually paying attention to it: there are multiple interconnected sub-plots you have to follow. Plus, there's fare to actually *think* about. A couple previous reviewers felt that the anti-militaristic commentary in this was too heavy-handed for their taste, though I kind of suspect said reviewers were jingoists themselves who just didn't *agree* with Pratchett's view. I mention all this mostly as a caveat to potential readers: if you're turned off by such things, you might want to pass on this one. It'll be your loss, though.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"I have to say... the back of the book didn't do much to raise my hopes on the subject matter addressed in this book... but the book more than did credit to Pratchett... quite funny and decent characters...

From the ridiculous causes of war to the insane prejudices it brings out in the populace, nothing is safe from Pratchett's perceptive and cynical pen. Using the black and white perspective of Vimes in conjunction with the behind the scenes machinations of Vetinari (In a sub with Colon and Nobby?) Pratchett examines war from different perspectives and is very successful at it. It even effectively echoes current world politics; the confusion and chaos over just what is being fought for. Discworld at its best takes a look at the big picture and often skewers it with a humor that is based on logic and intelligence; JINGO is no exception."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"Ankh-Morpork goes to war, and somehow Samuel Vimes and the rest of the Night Watch find themselves at the forefront. Is the dashing Carrot there? check. Super-chick Angua? check. The wonderfully mad Leonard da Quirm? check. The Patrician? check. And he's even found a way to keep Nobby from nicking anyone's boots (it took a long journey and a bout with cross-dressing, but it worked).This is the longest Discworld novel I've found, and at 448 pages, you'll enjoy yourself at every page. As with any Discworld novel, you don't have to start in any particular place to get caught up. Just dive in, and hang on!"},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"\\"Jingo\\" in Terry Pratchett's hugely popular Discworld series, was first published in 1997 and is the fourth to focus on Sam Vimes and Ankh-Morpork's City Guard.Sam is the Commander of the City Guard, and - having married Lady Ramkin - a member of the nobility. It's fair to say he's not your typical hero : he doesn't like the Undead (particularly vampires), Assassins (they keep trying to kill him) and - in keeping with an old family tradition - Kings (not an ideal musketeer then). However, despite being terminally suspicious, he is also a very likeable and fair man. While in the past Sam has dealt with the \`small' crimes, Jingo sees him moving in a new environment : war and - even more dangerously - politics. The book opens with a mysterious island called Leshp rising from beneath the sea, exactly halfway between Ankh-Morpork and Klatch. Both, naturally, claim it as their own...Klatch is a huge, multi-ethnic empire, and rivals Ankh-Morpork commercially. Furthermore, it's far ahead of Ankh-Morpork in terms of technology and scientific knowledge. Yet, the average Morporkian - despite having an enormous appetite for Klatchian curry and kebabs - seems to look down on \\"Johnny Klatchian\\" as some sort of primitive coward. Unfortunately, this couldn't be further from the truth : the D'regs, for example, are a terrifying desert tribe who trust no-one and will fight anyone on a matter of principle.In an attempt to resolve the situation - Klatch's Prince Khufurah arrives in the city for discussions with Vetinari. Depressingly, anti-Klatchian tensions rise in Ankh-Morpork...which naturally makes things very difficult for those of Klatchian extraction living in the city. So, when someone tries to assassinate Khufurah - apparently a lone bowman - nobody seems too surprised. Naturally, this only cranks things up at a \`diplomatic' level, and - with the heads of the city's Guilds raising private armies - Sam is really up against it...Although numbers in the Watch continue to rise, Sam still relies most on those he knows best. His most capable officer is Captain Carrot - who was born human, although raised as a dwarf. Carrot is an incredibly innocent and honest character, though many believe him to be Ankh-Morpork's rightful King. (Sam has - to date - refrained from beheading him). Carrot's girlfriend, Angua, is also a member of the City Guard though - particularly useful, given that she's a werewolf. Sergeant Detritus, a troll, seems a natural and likeable cop...though, unfortunately, he becomes a little more stupid as the temperatures rise. Unfortunately, Sam has to do without his most experienced officers for much of the book - Sergeant Colon and Corporal Nobbs (a confirmed slacker and probably human) are roped into a secret mission... although he has some help from two new recruits : Fred Shoe, a zombie, and Buggy Swires, a gnome.Another very funny book from Pratchett, with a storyline 'underneath' that would have made cracking thriller. The anti-Klatchian attitude of the average ignorant, bigoted, ill-informed Morporkian was a little depressing at times...even more so, given how attitudes have hardened in the real world in recent years. An excellent book though, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"Not one of his _very_ best, but as a meditation on the first Gulf War and all subsequent ones, you could hardly find anything more digestible. Vimes and the Patrician are in their elements, and Pratchett's incredibly decent, non-glib humane sympathy for the Other is in good form.Also it's fun. Leonard of Quirm is delightful."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"I've read the first 21 books, and this has stood out as one of the best I can remember. This includes a bit more action than the other books. I won't say much more, as most of the other reviews cover everything else."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"I've loved Pratchett's work since I first read \\"The Light Fantastic\\" in the early 1990s. Here, Pratchett manages to make an allegory of Middle Eastern politics into a riotously funny read. And, of course, it stars Samuel Vimes and his Night Watch. For depth, character, insight, and, of course, humor, all in one novel, grab \\"Jingo.\\""},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"A mysterious island appearing in the sea is claimed by both Ankh-Morpork and Al-Khali, capital of Klatch. Features an assasination, investigation by Carrot and Angua, a really annoying Palm Pilot, and a parody of Leonardo da Vinci. Makes good use of the minor Watch characters like Nobby, and includes a a lot of silliness blended with deft touches of anti-war sentiment (this could easily have become heavy-handed and unpleasant to wade through). On the down side, there are too many simultaneous plot lines, and it will not work well if you haven't read at least one or two of the other books in this sequence."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"War with the Middle-East is about the unfunniest topic you can dredge up. Not just now in times of political turmoil, but anytime. Terry Pratchett gives it a comic spin in &quot;Jingo,&quot; with a simple message (War is Stupid!) and plenty of hijinks from the Watch.A weathercock surfaces in the middle of the sea. Since weathercocks usually don't bob around by themselves, it turns out that it's attached to a new island that rises up out of the sea. Fishermen claim the island -- unfortunately, they are from two different lands: Ankh-Morpork and the desert land of Klatch. Soon both lands are at loggerheads over ownership of the new island, Leshp. (a sign in Ankh-Morpork: GREASY FORANE HANDS OFF LESHP) War is imminent, and unfortunately Vimes and his Watch are about to be dragged into it.Diplomacy takes a nasty turn when Vimes meets (in his official capacity as a duke) a Klatchian prince and the sinister-seeming 71-Hour Ahmed. Soon the prince is injured, and Klatch is furious. Now the war has gotten personal, and is no longer just about Leshp. Vimes and Co. have to enlist the help of the eccentric Leonard of Quirm, while the Patrician somehow ends up enlisting a pair of unlikely spies: Nobby and Colon.Any Discworld book that features the unattractive Nobby trying to do an exotic dance is worth checking out. But &quot;Jingo&quot; also has the advantage of lampooning just about everything connected with war: Racism, outdated ideas about how to make war, protests by stupid people, xenophobia foreign cultures (Vimes being offered the sheep's eyeball is a riot), politics, and those little time management computers (here called a &quot;disorganizer&quot;).Don't worry -- Pratchett's dryly goofy humor is quite intact despite the messages woven in. From the Prid of Ankh-Morpork to Nobby's deficient love life, he peppers the story with the strange and hilarious. However, at times it dips a little into slapstick (Nobby in drag, getting in touch with his feminine side), and some scenes are more sitcom than satire. His writing is, as always, spare and clear, not too descriptive, and Pratchett manages to avoid banging readers over the head with his messages.The crusty, hard-boiled Sam Vimes is back in full, here chafing at the idea of being a duke (especially if it means dressing up). Tough werewolf cop Angua gets to spread her wings a little, and supporting characters like 71-Hour Ahmed skim close to stereotypes, but just to make a point. Not to mention the hordes of weird recruits that the well-meaning, clueless Carrot manages to find.War satire is a hard thing to write. Usually it just displays a heavy hand and a big loud mouth. But Terry Pratchett dips into this with his usual deftness and humor. Recommended."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"A not-so-new island coming up from the sea causes diplomatic tension between Ankh-Morpork and its powerful neighbor, Klath. The tensions soon lead to a military confrontation - and yes, there's a problem. Only one side of the conflict has an army. Moreover, the army in question is led by a competent general, Ashal. Ankh-Morpork armed &quot;forces&quot; do include surprisingly good soldiers (like Willikins), but it is more than clear that they have not even a single goodish officer. The only one that is not a complete idiot turns out to be... oh, read for yourselves.Little wonder the Klathians consider the war as a huge joke arranged for their amusement.There's only one way to stop the ultimate destruction of the biggest city on Disc - diplomacy. With some support of idiot actions taken by people who either never dreamed to be considered soldiers (Vimes) or those who thought it's their birthright to be called officers (Rust) the necessary steps are taken.And it all leads to an ... interesting end!I admit I personally tell the difference between an &quot;interesting&quot; and &quot;potentially interesting&quot; Discworld book by checking out how much space is given to Vetinari, and I find that &quot;Jingo&quot; is absolutely satisfying. Take the &quot;donkey-minaret&quot; thing.For all those of you who don't like Carrot=Superman thing, read the book. Oh, he does turn out to be abnormally clever and nice, but at least it doesn't make a big difference. For the Vimes's fans - read it, too. The man never claimed to be a soldier, after all. Vetinari's supporters will find themselves overhelmed with pure joy and purring . And it is nice to meet the other old friends - Angua, Detritius, Dorfl.I strongly recommend reading earlier Watch books before this one, you'll miss too many jokes if you start with Jingo.A must-read. Pratchett at his best."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"Terry Pratchet is brilliant...as always.

Pratchett holds up a mirror to the failings of mankind, reintroducing us to past favorites(the Patrician, Commander Vimes, Carrot, Nobby) as they struggle to prevent war from breaking out. Of course, each of them has very different views on HOW this should be done...or even IF it should be done... I laughed 'til I cried as this wonderful cast of characters trudged doggedly through the pages, each determined To Do Their Duty in their highly individual ways."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"One of the sad things about being American is how long it takes Mr. Pratchett's books to appear there.

If you've never read Terry Pratchett before: Welcome to a thinly veiled version of London in which social classes and races are represented by various fanatic creatures: gargoyles, humans, trolls, dwarves, etc.-all trying to live together and get along. Uberwald is Germany. Klatch is something like the near east. You'll recognize other places. Disc World is basically earth with London at the center and a few weird twists.For those who are familier with Pratchett: This is one of the books featuring the Night Watch, but it's a somewhat mixed media performance with a lot from the Patrician (who is my favorite) and Lenard of Querm, also a bit from the wizards. A mysteries island rises out of the sea and both Klatch and Ank-morpork claim ownership. Some people in each country are willing to go to war over the island...but do they have ulterior motives?In the confusion of a visit from the Klachian prince, Angua is kidnapped (want to know how to kidnap a werewolf? Read the book!) and the whole Watch sets off after her to Klatch, where they unravel a cunning conspiracy. The book has plenty of depth, makes a number of valid points about war, politics, racial prejudice (both prejudice against a minority race AND prejudice in favor of a minority race), and is just superior all-round storytelling.

I have always been a Terry Pratchett fan since I first started reading his stuff, and this one really continues the tradition. This is one of the best books about the Ankh-Morpork City Watch to date.

This novel, as is usual in the Ankh-Morpork City Watch novels in the Discworld series, manages to be both hilariously funny and thought-proking, with some of Commander Vimes' lines in particular worth hours of moral debate.

Typical Pratchett. If he gets any funnier, you'll need a doctor's advice before reading."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"Jingo is yet another book that takes place in Terry Pratchett's Discworld series. It's the fourth book to feature the City Watch, which is the police force of Ankh-Morpork, a city on the Disc. It's also one of the best. The City Watch, in its initial incarnation, was an homage to those no-name soldiers, troopers and other various cannon-fodder that inhabit adventure and sci-fi movies. They're usually hapless, the hero runs right over them, and their survival rate is fairly low. Originally, it consisted of three people, Samuel Vimes, Nobby Nobs, and Sergeant Colon.This was until Carrot joined. Carrot is a human who was raised by dwarves, thus he considers himself a dwarf. He's the ultimate innocent, but yet he has a way of getting people to listen to him and follow him. By the time of Jingo, he's been raised to Captain (no comic book jokes, please). This all happened in the first City Watch book, Guards Guards. In subsequent books, the Watch has grown almost exponentially. It now has over 50 members, with more joining all the time. In fact, Jingo jokes a couple of times about how Vimes, the commander of the Watch, doesn't know that somebody's joined. It's very common for him to say \\"Who's that?\\" and be told that he signed the paperwork.Jingo involves an island that has suddenly appeared between Ankh-Morpork and the land of Klatch. Klatch is based on the Arab countries of our world, and there are quite a few jokes about how something that was supposedly invented in Ankh-Morpork has been used in Klatch for years. The people of Ankh-Morpork have a lot of the same stereotypes of Klatchians as exist in the real world about Arabs as well. Pratchett goes to great lengths to show just how stupid this is. He portrays the actual Klatchians very well, with no actual stereotypes that I saw.Anyway, both Ankh-Morpork and Klatch lay claim to this island, and thus talk of war begins. There's an attempt on the life of a Klatchian prince and other sorts of violence start to break out in the city. Samuel Vimes is trying to deal with all of this. He's a simple cop who just wants to solve crimes, but sometimes the crimes are too big for one man to solve. Events start to spiral out of control and Vimes and some of his troops find themselves in Klatch trying to stop things before the war gets out of hand.There are so many wonderful characters in these City Watch books, and this one even adds some more. The main new character is 71-hour Ahmed, a Klatchian who's more than what he seems. Vimes has to deal with him a lot, and while he starts out seeming stereotypical, but he eventually develops into a well-rounded character. There's Reg Shoe, who I understand is introduced in a non-City Watch book, but becomes a member of the Watch in this book. He's a zombie. Then there are the regulars, such as Carrot, Detritus (a troll), Constable Visit, Colon, Nobs, the Patrician (who, uncharacteristically, takes an active role in events after he's deposed from power), and finally Vimes himself. There are just too many of them to describe them all, but they all have their hilarious moments.Vimes is who the books are essentially about, and he gets the most character development. He used to be a drunk who barely got by, and didn't have to do anything in his job. He wasn't required to, because nobody gave the Watch any respect anyway. Carrot gave him a sense of duty, though, and he's progressed well since then. Jingo continues this progression, as he tries to stop the madness. Vimes is always an interesting person to read about. He's not a violent man, and he's trapped in a violent circumstance. Watching him get out of it is very entertaining.Discworld is known for it's humour, and this is a very funny book. Pratchett usually cloaks his philosophical points in the laughs. This book isn't quite as funny as the previous ones, though, and the philosophy sticks out even more in this one because of it. It basically points out the pointlessness of mindless militarism, nationalism and patriotism. The closest thing it is a parody of is the Falklands conflict, with a war over a worthless piece of land that nobody in their right mind would want anyway. Along the way, though, many jokes are cracked. The best thing about the City Watch books is that the humour seems to come from within the characters, which makes for very zany, yet almost believable, events. That's why I prefer them.This book is definitely worth a read. You could start with it, but I would suggest that you read the first three: Guards Guards, Men at Arms, and Feet of Clay. There is a progression of character that you will miss if you start with Jingo. But don't miss this one. It's a keeper."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"Although this book is a good book in its own right - interesting characters and plot, gripping pace, humorous dialogue and a meaningful theme, it's not my favourite of the Guards novels. Feet Of Clay and The Fifth Elephant have more interesting mysteries and Men At Arms and Guards! Guards! have more interesting character development. I don't know, maybe it's all the sand, but Jingo has always seemed a little unsatisfying. But I reckon that that's because I am comparing it to the other Guards books - there's still a lot of good moments and it's worth a read."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"I really hoped to enjoy &quot;Jingo,&quot; and did like its lampoon of seemingly needless conflicts over religion and territory. Nevertheless, Pratchett is not much of a prose stylist. He focuses so much on dialogue that reading this is like reading a play. There is virtually no description of events, places, or people, and the characters talking is endless and becomes taxing. I was ultimately disappointed by this novel because of its style (or lack there of), which is unfortunate because it could have been a very good satirical novel."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"This is my sixth Discworld experience. As to a rating, vs other Discworld Novels I've read, I would place it somewhat below REAPER MAN, MORT, and MONSTROUS REGIMENT, on a par with THE LIGHT FANTASTIC, and well above THE COLOR OF MAGIC.As you can deduce from the title, Pratchett here takes on the notion of jingoism in all its absurd manifestations. Dr Johnson's famous dictum about patriotism \\"Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel\\" is brought vividly to life by Mr Pratchett. A series of incidents initiated by the sudden emergence of a land mass in the middle of the Circle Sea has led to a renewal of enmity between the denizens of Ankh Morpork and their ancient rival/enemies, the Klatchians. The obvious parallels here are to the long held mistrust and misapprehension beween the Christian west and the Muslim mideast. Considering that the book was first published in 1998, Terry P was awfully prescient in many regards.The warfare, while humorous, has it's serious side. A hitherto innocuous butler is driven by patriotic fervor to bite an enemy's nose off, for instance. Think of some of the more absurd anti war movies (PRIVATES ON PARADE, OH, WHAT A LOVELY WAR, KING OF HEARTS) for a taste of what Pratchett offers up here.At the center of all the action is the venerable Sam Vimes, head constable of the Ankh Morpork Watch (police). He is the level headed one in the midst of all the screwball goings on. We also get to see The Patrician (overlord of the city) in a new light. His machinations are a marvel to behold. The usual assortment of offbeat characters (a troll, a female werewolf, a zombie, a dwarf, an imp in a pocket watch) are also along for the merry ride. A parodic version of Leonardo Da Vinci (Leaonard of Quirm) is another in Pratchett's great gallery of weird characters.As is his wont, Pratchett says an awful lot about some serious issues constantly confronting humankind, without being in the least onerous or heavy handed about it. He is the modern master of such satire. The same sort of outlook that informs Gulliver's Travels is at play here. This could actually serve as a companion piece to another of Pratchett's anti-war send-ups, the aforementioned MONSTROUS REGIMENT. I recommend both, highly.BEK"},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"Unusual for Pratchett, Jingo is almost a serious book. Not that there aren't plenty of funny or satirical moments, but, a bit like Thud! The underlying themes are darker than usual. This adds spice to the novel as it forces the reader to contemplate the values and assumptions we often bring into a conflict.Leshp is only a problem occasionally. It's a floating island that only floats occasionally. Popping up in the ocean in between Ankh Morpork and the Empire of Klatch it quickly becomes a bone of contention. Not because it has any value, but because of it's strategic 'importance.' Not only does Pratchett give us a ringside seat on the diplomatic dance that wends its way inevitably towards war, he also gives us a view of the pending hostility's effect on the citizens of Ankh Morpork. Prejudice against the resident Klatchians, which was previously non-existent, suddenly mounts to the heights of xenophobia. The Klatchians are force to flee, and despite the comedy Pratchett coats this pill with, we can't mist the underlying pain as peace deserts the streets of the city.Commander Vimes, is dragged in as he often is to use his rather abrupt form of diplomacy to try to untangle the conflict. What Vimes discovers is that people in high places are completely willing to foster a war to further their own purposes. On one side a noble who couldn't fight his was out of a paper bag risks all of Ankh Morpork's scanty fighting men so that he can look like a hero. On the other side one brother plots against another. Vimes finds himself in Klatch with his most trusted crew trying to fight a war or lose it brilliantly.Much of the charm of Jingo is in the details of characters like Captain Carrot, Sargeants Angua and Detritus, and even Lord Vetinari. For some reason the weight of the subject has caused Pratchett to lavish his players with kind affection. This is a very fine book. People may argue forever over which Discworld stories are the best, but Jingo deserves as least honorable mention."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"Jingo is one of the best of the Discworld series because it deals with a serious subject - the futility of war but still makes it funny. And if you know of the characters from previous books you'll find one bit of it unbearably moving - the hairs on the back of my neck rose as the Disorganizer read out the appointments of the characters within a few seconds of each other in the alternate universe - particularly for Captain Carrot. Of course, there are weaknesses in it. I still don't understand the plot, Vetenari would never get involved in direct action, there was too much of Colon and Nobby, and not enough of the other characters e.g. Cherrybottom, the OrangUtan, Detritus and the other Guards. Most of all, it's ridiculous to think that countries would go to war over a useless island (nobody mention the Falklands). But despite this I enjoyed it enormously and would recommend it as a good starting point in the series. By the way, the title &quot;Jingo&quot; refers to a song from the Victorian music halls which began &quot;We don't want to fight you but by Jingo if we do: We've got the ships, we've got the men, we've got the money too.&quot; And from that we get the word &quot;Jingoism&quot;. See, you learn something reading Pratchett!"},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"[For context's sake, I have been reading the Discworld books in publication order. Jingo is #21.]I have a hard time ranking this one among the other Discworld books I've read. It was fairly solid, but it felt like it was intentionally making a political/political correctness point for much of the first half, and then dispensed with that and got some plot for the second half. Aspects of the setup were at once needlessly opaque and two or three steps too transparent. Ingenious prospects like the temperature's effect on Detritus, some interesting Angua situations, or the intriguing relationship between previously opposed characters briefly sparked, then died out without really accomplishing anything. While the whole book was enjoyable, the disjointed aspects cause me to be critical in retrospect. However, even with the flaws, I still give it four stars. Continuing the Watch plotline, revisiting and developing the characters, and endlessly dangling the Carrot made for good reading."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"For those of you who like satire, a little dose of reality and with a sense of humor to match this is the ebook for you"},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"Simply stated, this is one of Pratchett's best. He brilliantly skewers politics, warmongering, racism, engineering, time management, navigational terms, police work, and foreign customs, for a start. He then manages to poke fun at (as opposed to ridiculing) humans, werewolves, dwarves, trolls, gnomes, Curious Squid, and the odd orangutang. His treatment of the temperature-sensitive intelligence of Corporal Detritus is well done, and the habit he gives of Commander Vimes returning to his old habits as a street copper even in the middle of ceremonial events had me rolling on the floor.The demonic organizer and the temporal slip-up was a very nice touch... although the reeling off of the appointments in the alternative final defense (which I shall skip for those who haven't read this yet - I envy you people! &lt;grin&gt;) I found honestly to be as chilling as anything Stephen King ever wrote.I don't believe I've ever read a bad book of his. Some may have been better than others, but not one of them have I put down and said, &quot;My God, why did I read this?&quot; Pratchett writes with a compassionate eye to his characters, keeping them comical without making them ridiculous.These are books that I'll still be re-reading 20 years from now, and I'll wager I'll still find something new to laugh at each time."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"This is by no means the best of the Watch novels ... but even an average Pratchett novel is a thing of beauty. By turns deadly serious and laugh-out-loud funny, the book has only three weaknesses (which other reviewers have touched upon).First, most of the Watch characters get barely anything to do. Second, the Patrician is way out of character. And finally, the ending is pretty weak.Nevertheless, this is a still a great and very entertaining read. I wouldn't recommend it as a starting point, though, as Guards! Guards! is a better introduction, Men at Arms is funnier, and Feet of Clay is a better mystery."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"This was the novel that got me hooked on the Discworld and the Ankh-Morpork City Watch. It's very very funny and also wickedly intelligent. Someone here pointed out that Terry Pratchett is actually a philosopher masquerading as a funny man. Perhaps the reason why some people don't like &quot;Jingo&quot; is that the philosophy is a bit more overt here than in other Discworld offerings.Those of us who were around when Maggie (excuse me, Baroness Thatcher) launched her little homage to the 19th century in the Falklands/Malvinas will probably enjoy &quot;Jingo&quot; a little more than others I suspect, but the book itself rings true on so many different levels that it transcends such a particular interpretation. This is Pratchett on the subject of nationalism, militarism and racism with Sam Vimes as usual cast in the role of ironic observer and moral center.I actually liked seeing Vetinari out and about more, and it's clear that this novel marks the beginning of a more three-D presence in the Discworld universe for both Sergeant Colon and the ambiguously human Corporal Nobbs. Leonard of Quirm needs more work though. Once you got the initial conceit, he became tiresome quite quickly.Captain Carrot, Sergeant Angua and Corporal Detritus do their usual sterling service. I had hoped for more from Constable Visit-the-Infidel-With-Explanatory-Pamphlets given that the conflict between Klatch and Ankh-Morpork was partly a religious one, but you can't have everything.Perhaps my favorite things in the novel were the face-off between the city nobles and Vimes, the Demon Pocket Organizer, and Vimes' precise and beautifully-articulated exposition of the differences between soldiers and policemen. Vimes, I suspect is an old-fashioned copper who believes in justice, rather than merely protecting and serving the law. Too bad the LAPD doesn't read Terry Pratchett."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"I have to confess that I find this one of Pratchett's weaker efforts, although it is still a good read. Although he always has some fairly deep and philosophical messages in his writing, they are usually so well hidden by the humour that you don't realise they are there. In &quot;Jingo&quot;, I found there to be a bit less humour than normal and, as a result, the political undertones to the book rather stood out sometimes.Don't get me wrong -- Pratchett's message (at its most basic level, without spoiling any of the plot, that war is silly) is quite profound, but it is rather jarring when it appears, uncovered, in parts of a book that is ostensibly a comedy. I usually love the Guards series of books the most (&quot;Guards, Guards&quot; is possibly one of his best books), but I feel that this is probably the weakest of them. It is most like &quot;Feet of Clay&quot; but does not have as much suspense.Still, a worthwhile read and a good book for a rainy day."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"A mysterious island, Leshp, rises up from the ocean depths leading to conflicting territorial claims and the onset of military opposition. Jingo is one of the most witty looks at the interaction of nationalism, racism & patriotism.In the beginning:\\"Why are our people going there?\\" said Mr. Boggis of the Thieves' Guild.\\"Because they are showing a brisk pioneering spirit and seeking wealth and... additional wealth in a new land,\\" said Lord Vetinari.\\"What's in it for the Klatchians?\\" said Lord Downey.\\"Oh, they've gone out there because they are a bunch of unprincipled opportunists always ready to grab something for nothing.\\"... The Patrician looked down again at his notes. \\"Oh, I do beg your pardon,\\" he said, \\"I seem to have read those last two sentences in the wrong order...\\"The wily and unscrupulous Lord Vetinari, Patrician of Ankh-Morpork, seeing no way to avoid war, lets events take there course while Commander Sir Samuel Vimes, Duke of Ankh-Morpork & Lord Vetinari's more principled but frequent, if often reluctant, ally (and underling) extends the reach of law to the very shores of Klatch itself and Captain Carrot organizes a football game between the two sides!Of course, in the lower ranks, patriotism is brewing:\\"Lot of cowards, the Klatchians said Colon. \\"The moment they taste a bit of cold steel they're legging it away over the sand\\"... \\"And of course they're all mad for fighting,\\" said Colon. \\"Vicious buggers with all those curvy swords of theirs.\\"\\"You mean, like... they viciously attack you while cowardly running away after tasting cold steel?\\"Then an attempt on the life of the Klatchian ambassador brings the conflict to a boil. Of course, just as in the real world, the causi belli are not what they seem. Surrender is victory and victory is pyrrhic.And of course, there is, as usual, the strange interaction between Vimes - the descendant of the man who killed the last King of Ankh-Morpork for the latter's brutality, Vetinari - the Patrician who is able to balance the dangerous mixture of groups and individuals who form Ankh-Morpork's elite, and Captain Carrot - apparently the descendant of the last King and who is well-liked enough to topple Vetinari but who prefers to be Vimes' loyal captain.As always, the Discworld is a place worth visiting!"},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"In the latest edition of the series involving Commander Vimes and crew, quality co-exists with quantity. By this I mean that this great read will keep you reading for awhile. Don't worry though, it will keep you wanting more. There are plenty of jokes that'll keep you laughing too. One of my favorite things about this book are the characters. Their personalities are so unique and in-depth, it made me almost miss them when I had finished. The plot is good too, with many different parts that come together in the end. If you like this one, you'll like its predecessors such as &quot;Feet of Clay&quot; and &quot;Men at Arms&quot;. There is no question this book gets five stars."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"Once again Terry Pratchett mirrors the irreverence of our own world with this charming little novel concerning a war between a very western Ankh-Morpork and a very middle-eastern Klatch. As usual the references from literature and the history of the real world as well as aspects of current events wormed their way through that beautiful dimensional portal in Pratchett's brain to give us a delightful romp and thought provoking look at one of the most basic and primal human events. It was written in the finest tradition of the City Watch series which seem to always show that true duty and realism tend to win out over the insanity that the majority of the world engages in. Watch out for 71-Hour Ahmed and the rest of the D'Regs, but they even seem weak next to the power of Corporal Nobbs in a dress. If you're a Pratchett fan, you're going to read it, and if you're not a Pratchett fan, become one."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"What can I say? I finished reading this book about a year ago and still pick it up again to read it. I absolutely adore this book. The character development is fantastic and we finally get to see Lord Vetinari on a much more *human* level. In some rather funny circumstances, as well.Vimes is a pleasure to read about, as well. I love all AMCW (Ankh-Morpork City Watch, for the uneducated) books and am a huge fan of Mr. Pratchett.I've read over the other reviews and am frankly rather surprised that people thought it was weaker than 'Feet of Clay.' I thought this was funnier and more attention-grabbing than 'Feet of Clay.' Overall, a good read and well worth the money."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"So said Walt Kelly's philosophically eloquent possum Pogo. And so says Terry Pratchett in his typically funny, absurd and thoughtful \\"JINGO\\" as he takes on the absurdity of war and those who have led us into war since time began.Jingo features Commander Vimes and the men, women, dwarves, trolls and undead members of the Watch. Jingo opens with Ankh-Morpork on the brink of war. The small island of Leshp has risen miraculously from the Circle Sea. Although small and of little value to anyone the good citizens of Ankh-Morpork and their historical protagonists the Klatchcians each claim title to the land. Each claim ownership based on ancient claims of dubious origin. Sound familiar?In very short order a Klatchian diplomatic mission arrives in Ankh-Morpork. However it it is clear that powerful forces of both nations are striving for the most efficient way to let loose the dogs of war. An assassination attempt is made, one in which Pratchett finds a way to evoke the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963. The too simple solution, the \\"one arrow\\" theory is quickly lost in a swirl of conspiracy theories. The drums of war beat faster and a war council, led by a cast of characters each of whom could be played by Peter Sellers in Dr. Strangelove, assume control of war planning. In short order Commander Vimes find himsaelf and his men immersed in an invasion while at the same time the Patrician, Lord Vetinari seems bent on following his own secret course of action.Of course a mere description of the plot of a Discworld book can never quite do it justice. It is impossible in a short review to reference the many asides, jokes, cynical observations and allusions to our own experience here. Captain Carrot find himself immersed in Klatchian culture, learns the language, adjusts to the desert culture (which seems clearly to be located in the Middle east) and ends up bearing a striking resemblance to Lawrence of Arabia. The Ankh-Morpork high command, led by gentlemen soldiers with little knowledge of military affairs and even less common sense reminded me of the British and French high command from WWI days. There are light moments throughout the book. Nobby goes undercover and discovers his softer side. The visual image one gets from that alone is worth the price of admission. Vimes meets his Klatchian counterpart in 71-hour Ahmed and their interplay forms the heart of Jingo. As events race (and events always race in a Discworld book) towards a conclusion we find a pensive Vimes realizing that he can deal with small crimes like murder, but wondering whether a meaningless war isn't the biggest crime of all and one in which his own nation bears as much responsibility for as its enemies:\\"It was so much easier to blame it on Them. It was bleakly depressing to think that They were Us. If it was Them, then nothing was anyone's fault. If it was us, what did that make Me? After all, I'm one of Us. I must be. I've certainly never thought of myself as one of Them. No one ever thinks of themselves as one of Them. We're always one of Us. It's Them that do the bad things.\\"Yes, Vimes like Pogo has met the enemy and has realized it is us. Towards the end of the the book 71-hour Ahmed turns to Vimes and says \\"there's plenty of reasons for fighting Ankh-Morpork. A lie isn't one of them.\\" I'll leave it up to the reader to determine whether such a sentimentis one that has applicability outside of Discworld.As with his other Discworld books, Pratchett makes you laugh so hard you don't even realize you're thnking and that is a wonderful feat.L. Fleisig"},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"Among Discworld fans, it's a well-known rule that you musn't read his stuff on the bus. People tend to regard as strange those among their fellow passengers who giggle as they read. Giggling is always a hazard with Pratchett, as is interrupting other people's activities and forcing them to listen to you reading a passage out loud. This one features Commander Sam Vimes and Vetinari the Patrician, two of my favorite recurring characters, as they try to deal (each in his characteristic way) with a territorial dispute that wants to become a war. Klatch, only a short distance across the sea, is a sandy country full of turban-wearing camel-riders who also invented astronomy and vindaloo, which gives the author lots of opportunities to show up rampant nationalism for the insanity it is. (I suspect he was thinking of the First Gulf War here, as well as British attitudes toward immigrant Pakistanis, but there is also considerable relevance to the present war in Iraq.) Vimes vehemently resists being a military man (cops are NOT the same as soldiers) but finds himself involved anyway. And Vetinari has no use for the social and economic waste of war. Plus, there's the political sub-plot, and Corp. Nobbs's search for a lady friend of his own, plus the questionable ability of Leonard of Quirm (inventor and artist extraordinaire) to deal with the so-called Real World. Pratchett is a genius of comedy -- in the sense of the Human Comedy."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"Another solid Discworld novel. Like most of the Watch novels, has some meandering subplots, and dialogue is often rambling. The subject (war) is always relevant, and Pratchett's insights are on-target.Not at the level of Light Fantastic, Color of Magic, Equal Rites, Mort, or (my favorite so far) Small Gods, in terms of humor or insight.But who cares? Let's be honest, if you've gotten this far in the series, you're gonna read them all anyway!"},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"One of the best stories ever about the idiocy of warfare & the untrustworthiness of bureaucrats, diplomats & generals generally. On a moonless night, somewhere in the Circle Sea between Ankh-Morpork & Klatch, a strange & useless piece of land erupts, topped by a weathervane. Two fishing vessels are in the vicinity, competing for equally undesirable sea creatures (the Curious Squid, so foul-tasting that they are much in demand by the kinds of restaurants that sell nasty & undesirable seafood to their customers), & each claims the land for their own nation. Of course, Sam Vimes & the Watch are sent forth to fight for their nation, while the D'regs are ready to fight back. Watch out for Lord Rust & the Dis-organizer (&#34;Bingely-bingely beep!&#34;). Thank goodness for 71-hour Ahmed & Lord Vetinari."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"One of Pratchett's best. It's war Ankh-Morpork style, with Lord Rust calling the shots. And not very well. Klatch and A-M clash over a small island that appeared from nowhere. After some failed diplomacy, a fire and a lot of recruiting for regiments, A-M goes to war. And Vimes go in hot pursuit of the people that are disturbing the peace and any other charge he can think of.Worth reading just to see what Lord Vetinari can do with melons and knifes! And of course he has everything completely under control."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"A scathing criticism of war and xenophobia, but also a hilarious adventure story, but also better than both of those things."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"Carrot always manages to come off on top any where he goes.

Purchased online through my phone from the kindle store and it was on my Kindle within 2min of ordering."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"Jingo is beautifully written, and like many of Sir Terry's books, full of hidden humor and satirical barbs at our own world and its history. It can be read over and over again as the reader gains new insights into the workings of the story, the plot, and the author's incredibly complex mind."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"It is a Terry Pratchett novel: Duh, It has to be uncommonly humorous. I would rather have a beer and a bs session with Terry Pratchett than any other living person"},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"The city watch novels started with Corporal Carrot being the center of the story, but Pratchett found his muse in Sam Vimes - who has several different titles, depending on where in the series you are, and how nice Lord Vetinari feels towards Vimes that week.Jingo was written in 1997, when Pratchett was hitting his stride with the Disc and the world was less medieval and more Victorian. By this point, Pratchett was pulling in the real world and bringing it to wonderful parody by showing the hypocrisies inherent in the actions we take. He's able to ameliorate this by the fantasy tropes that the world is set in, but they are no less true because they take place on a flat world supported by four elephants on the back of a giant space turtle.Jingo looks at the nature of conflict and self-definition and nationalism - who are we and what we do we stand for? The precipitating event is that an island rises in the circle sea, and is claimed by two competing powers, Ankh-Morpork and the city of Al-Khali.There is palace intrigue, some derring-do, and lessons learned. In the end, we learn that those we go to war with are just like you and I, but perhaps it is the ones that lead us to war that we should be most wary of. Reading it felt odd, as if it was a response to the drumbeats that lead the Anglo countries to war in 2003, but it was written years in advance. It just goes to show that the will to power is universal, the only shame is that there was no Sam Vimes in Baghdad, ready to save the day."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"I have read all of Terry Pratchett's Diskworld books and I have to say that I believe this is one of the best!

One to re-read!!"},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"In the tradition of his marvelous Discworld series, Terry Pratchett has once again excelled himself with this scathingly funny view of war between two countries.

This was probably the best buy I've ever made. At the moment I'm reading Jingo for the second time, and am still enjoying it as much as the first time. Its an understatement to say the no book has given me so much enjoyment as this one. I've caught myself waking up in the morning looking forward to the train ride to work so I can finally continue reading.

He said this book was about &quot;the pointlessness of war&quot;. For me, this beautifully somes up the book. It is amusing, in a subtle way, and occasionally warrants an out burst of laughter, but not often. That would be too vulgar. Just a smile is sufficient. It is also amazingly thought provoking . It makes me wonder, as with all Terry's books, whether it is secretly based on some unsuspecting war in the depths of history. I can imagine the author laughing at us for thinking he made it up. I think Terry Pratchett is one of the most readable authors in print today, even forever. He once said he &quot;writes for anyone who can hold the books&quot;. I think this means anyone aged 10 to 100 can read them.Ralph Evins, Age 14."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"Eventhough I have found it hatd to read, as it has not been translated into French yet, the only thing I can say about it is that I'm completely mad about it!

After the appalling &quot;Hogfather&quot; and &quot;Soul Music&quot;, he has not only resurrected the once-dead Discworld series single-handedly, (or shall I say single-bookedly) but reached a standard no one could ever expect!Everything - the characters, gags, storyline (he even gave us a few action scenes to polish it off) and that special Pratchett touch - is fantastic. While the quality of his masterpieces has always made every fantasy in a bookstore seem as outdated as dinosaurs, it can still outdo itself.Just like Tolkien invented the genre back in the 1930s, Pratchett gave it a whole new dimension. He is the best and only reason I read books!If you've been abducted by aliens over the past couple of years and don't know what Discworld is, then start your collection with &quot;Jingo&quot;, and you'll NEVER go back to the old sword-and-sorcery Tolkien-esqe relics again!&lt;"},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"Terrific story.

This book offers one of the greatest Discworld experiences, while exploring Klatch- the desert kingdom. The demonic dis-organizer makes another appearance (and a final appearance, as it seems). The character of Leonard de Quirm (a Discworld version to Leonardo de Vinci, perhaps) is one of the new characters in this book, as well as Lord Rust and 71-Hour Ahmed. The basic idea, of the Discworld going into war over such an idiotic reason is great, but no one can build a plot on that. Well, Terry Pratchett could, and I think that this book is one of the best books in the serie, although there is almost not a book which may be described as 'bad' in the discworld serie.If you liked the discworld, and Terry Pratchett's Humor, u'll like this one!"},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"Well, we're back in Ankh-Morpork, and the City Watch has a new problem on its hands!!This is a fun book to read!

The characters are as well drawn out as usual and any character who appears to be a cliche is only there to make a point, and is, in fact, supposed to be a cliche. Anyone who thinks 71-hr Ahmed is a stock character obviously didn't really understand the book.This book is very funny but at the same time makes some serious points about the essential stupidity and futility of war."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"In a great way Terry describes the futility of war and racism - a truly remarkable achievement. Hopefully, all those fanatics out there with guns who are fighting one or other holy war for reasons of...well, maybe a recently emerged island in the pacific or something, will also read this book, and think again. Back to the book: it's the Nightwatch again, growing ever bigger in number and stature.

A great laugh, and it keeps you longing for the next volume."},{"Title":"Jingo","review":"The story of Jingo is a very impressive one. The humour is quick and very clever.

I've been waiting to read these until I had three of them, and it took me three days to get through them. Jingo was worth the wait. I especially enjoyed the dis-organizer. I feel he will be much happier in the tummy of a shark who probably appreciates it more than did Vimes. I liked the alternate reality and got a chill as the demon announced what was happening in the other reality when Vimes didn't react as he did.

Characters familiar to us from past adventures as side-kicks or providers of comic relief, become much more fully developed.

Pratchett deserves credit for exploring the underlying, often foolish, causes of conflict."},{"Title":"Catherine, the queen,","review":"As an aspiring historical fiction writer looking for solid information on the wives of Henry VIII, I found Ms. Luke's biography of Catherine of Aragon to be exactly what I was looking for. The book begins with her birth in Spain and thoroughly covers everything the Princess/Queen experienced later in life, all the highs, all the lows, and anything in between. Ms. Luke also reveals a good setting and general idea of life in the English Renaissance and how Catherine played a role in that as Queen of the English. The book should definitely be commended for its accurate recording and analysis of the life of Henry VIII's first Queen."},{"Title":"Catherine, the queen,","review":"This book about Henry VIII's first wife left me wanting more. (Luckily, Mary Luke had other books about Tudor England.) Catherine's life is amazing, and anyone interested in the history of the English Reformation needs to know about her. READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Catherine, the queen,","review":"I thought this was going to be a serious biography of Catherine of Aragon. The Preface, however, gives the impression that it is more a romantic telling of her story: \\"Places, dates and facts are correct as far as can be ascertained, but certain events have been telescoped into a smaller framework for proper narrative flow.\\"The Prologue confirms that such is the case. For example: \\"They shouted their welcome in words alien to her ears and she wondered if he, the husband she had never known, was among them. Frightened, but knowing she must not show it, and wishing for her mother, she turned and clung - childlike - to her surprised duenna.\\"As anyone who has read my review ofMARY BOLEYNwill know, this sort of romantic history, in which historians tell us what people were thinking hundreds of years ago, without citing a source for the alleged thoughts, really irritates me - particularly when they could so easily have got around it by writing, \\"Perhaps, as she stood there and gazed, she thought...\\" or \\"As she stood there, did she think...?\\"Yet in this case, the author has been honest enough to make it clear from the start that she is writing romantic rather than authoritative history - as she should. People therefore know exactly what they're getting before they start reading, and have no grounds for serious complaint about romantic flights of fancy. So I tried to approach the book as I would a well-researched but romantic historical novel.This made me able to read the whole thing without getting too ticked off about those flights of fancy. Still, they did occasionally grate, in particular one on p. 35: \\"Rising from her curtsy, her heart beating with excitement, her unveiled face flushed and expectant, she saw a delicate, dark-haired lad a few months younger than she, with sensitive lips and the eyes of a dreamer. His skin was smooth and his body slim and frail. He reminds me of Juan, she thought, remembering her brother of Granada days.\\"Oh she did, did she? Maybe she did, maybe she didn't; I don't know, and neither, to put it bluntly, did Mary M. Luke when she wrote this.I don't want to sneer at this book, since there is a market for this sort of history and it has its loyal readers, as evinced by those readers who defend it to the hilt in spite of monstrous and proven factual errors. But I'm not surprised I've never seen this book listed as a source in a work of Tudor history, since it's not the sort of book any serious historian would use as a reference. Yet I did eventually get caught up in it, and, in spite of those grating passages and some minor factual errors, really enjoyed reading it. If only this book had been a little less romantic, I could have given it four stars; but as it is, three is enough."},{"Title":"SYLVIA'S LOVERS","review":"In this bleak novel Elizabeth Gaskell deftly weaves a dark thread of history into her narrative tapestry. While war hovers on the margins of the novel, no one is left unaffected by its horror. After a sometimes painfully slow setup of domestic life in the seaside town of Monkshaven in the first third of the book, the sense of doom grows increasingly palpable. Sylvia, the novel's heroine, is isolated by her supposedly protective domestic sphere, but Gaskell shatters the delicate domestic circle that surrounds her. While Sylvia is left to bear emotional scars, becoming an impassive, hardened woman, Charley Kinraid, her true love, returns from war a ghost, haunting the margins of Monkshaven to hide his terrible physical scars. The full realization of the blight on Sylvia's life comes when the novel spirals down to its inevitable conclusion, where even reconciliation and understanding brings a powerful sense of loss."},{"Title":"SYLVIA'S LOVERS","review":"In spite of the racy title, this book has no sex in it whatsoever. It was written in a simpler time (the Victorian age), when Lovers meant people who loved someone and desired to court them in a purely innocent way. So, if you're looking for salacious writing, you've come to the wrong place.I've recently developed a keen interest in Elizabeth Gaskell. I saw two mini-series based on her books \\"Wives and Daughters\\" and \\"Cranfield\\" (I immediately bought the DVDs). Since then I've read a few of her novels: Wives and Daughters, North and South, and now Sylvia's Lovers. I love the way this author looks into the hearts of her characters. There are no villains, just people who struggle to find happiness. Sometimes in the process, they might harm others, but it is rarely malicious. Some of her characters are truly saintly in their efforts to do the right thing. You go away feeling as if you know every character better than you know yourself. Elizabeth Gaskell has amazing human insight.This story is not a romance. It is a redemption tale, beginning with establishing relationships and dynamics between characters, it progresses through tragedy and unexpected character development, to the end when moral courage triumphs over romance. This is not a story that could be told today, when romance always triumphs, but it is far wiser than any mere romance. It is a tale of moral courage."},{"Title":"SYLVIA'S LOVERS","review":"Mrs. Elizabeth Cleghorn Stevenson Gaskell (1810-1865) is a fine Victorian author.Among her many novels the best are: North and South; Cranford: Ruth; Wives and Daughters (left incomplete at her early death); Mary Barton and Sylvia's Lovers.Sylvia's Lovers was published by Smith & Elder Company in 1863. It is a long novel consisting of 455 pages of small print in the Penguin Edition.The story concerns the lives and loves of Sylvia Robson in the 1790s. Sylvia is an only child of Daniel and Belle Robson. They live on a farm where Sylvia is spoiled though she does do many farmland chores. She is besotted by a handsome seaman named Charlie Kinraid. They become engaged but he is impressed by the British Navyin the life and death struggle with Napoleonic France. Sylvia weds her cousin Phillip Hepburn. Hepburn is a cloth merchant who is somewhat wimpy but loves Sylvia to distraction. The girl is illiterate. Phillip becomes her adoring tutor.Sylvia's father is executed for leading a riot against an impressment party of soldiers. He is hanged in York. Phillip lies to her when he refuses to tell Sylvia that her lover Kinraid told he he loved her and would be true before being dragged away to foreign service by a press gang. Sylvia reluctanly weds Phillip giving birth the estranged couple's child Bella.During the Siege of Acre sailor Kinraid is wounded but is rescued by his erstwhile enemy Phillip. Phillip had joined the marines after he parted in anger from Sylvia. Sylvia had learned that Phillip had lied to her about Kincaid's message of his continuing love for her. A few years later the badly wounded Hepburn returns home to Monkshaven in the north of England where Sylvia and Bella are residing. Sylvia has learned from a gossping friend that Phillip rescued Kinraid as in a hero. Phillip also rescues Bella who has fallen off a steep rock. Due to his efforts Phillip is mortally injured. Phillip and Sylvia are reconciled in a touching death scene. Sylvia never remarries and little Bella marries and moves to America. Charlie Kinraid weds a wealthy young woman.Many readers will not like the north country dialect and the sentimental Victorian scenes of domestic life. Mrs. Gaskell said it was the saddest story she had ever spun for her readers. Mrs. Gaskell had the ability to draw well rounded and complicated characters. The book is reminiscent of other bucolic tragedies of the Victorian era such as Adam Bede by George Eliot and Tess of the D'urbervilles by Thomas Hardy. Mrs. Gaskell's female characters are especially realistic.Mrs. Gaskell the busy wife of a Unitarian minister in Manchester knew how to spend a fascinating story which will keep you hooked. Gaskell is neglected in many college level English Literature courses. She deserves to be more widely read! Perhaps the recent serialization of Cranford on PBS's Masterpiece Theatre will lead to a revival of interest on Mrs. Gaskell. If you love Victorian English fiction then this book will be a satisfying reading experience. Well recommended!"},{"Title":"SYLVIA'S LOVERS","review":"After discovering the author, Elizabeth Gaskell, I've been collecting as many of her books as possible. I look forward to reading this book."},{"Title":"SYLVIA'S LOVERS","review":"Unfortunately, all too often we learn from our mistakes after it's too late. Seldom is one fortunate enough to use others' mistakes as a way of preventing unnecessary and often irreversible heartache. It's stories like this that make me see the value of religion and rules or commandments. And if suffering leads to growth, sometimes immaturity is not such a bad thing.Basically, this is a tragically sad story. The title is Sylvia's Lovers but in my opinion it should have been Philip's Folly. He made a self-serving decision that affected several people's lives and most of all destroyed him and the object of his obsessive love, Sylvia. We all know people whose trajectory of their life was interfered with by others' dishonesty or desire for control with catastrophic results. Betrayal is very difficult to forgive and often establishes lifelong pain."},{"Title":"SYLVIA'S LOVERS","review":"This is written with a vivid, lively and evocative style, often enlivened by humour. The first volume is lively and brisk in tone, yet overall, this is a tragic tale and the questions that it sets up about unrequited love, honour and duty are finally insoluable in terms of 'this world' which, apart from her natural inclinations as a minister's wife, is no doubt why Gaskell ends by drawing on the next in the final volume.Set in the whaling town of Monkshaven (actually, Whitby)when conservation was unheard of (preposition, I know!), the story concerns the two admirers of pretty, spirited daughter of the one time whaling Speckioneer turned farmer Daniel Robson, and her two admirers.One of the two is her unappealing,religious, dutiful, hard-working cousin Philip Hepburn, who becomes a business partner in a haberdasher's. He has 'made an idol' of Sylvia for years, much to her disgust. He idiotically believes he will win Sylvia's heart by teaching her to read and by trying to get her to wear drab colours.Her preferred admirer is naturally the handsome, swaggering, talkative, dashing Specksioneer (Chief Harpooner) Charley Kinraid, who becomes Sylvia's hero when he is shot defending his crew mates from a press gang raid. He takes to calling on Sylvia's family when he is recovering, and they soon fall in love.Kinraid has a reputation as a womaniser that has preceeded him, and Philip tries to warn Sylvia against him, but she does not believe him. When by coincidence he sees Kinraid being taken by a press gang on a deserted beach, Kinraid begs him to give the message to Sylvia that she must remain as true to him as he will to her, and that he will return. Philip treacherously decides against passing on a message he considers to be worthless and schemes to marry Sylvia himself.But Kinraid returns...I didn't find either the shallow, egotistical, opportunistic Kinraid, who has no human vulnerabilities, or the dismal, self-rightous Philip symapthetic, but I did feel a good deal for poor Sylvia.Because of Gaskell's Victorian reticence, she clearly cannot go into the question of physical attraction which is the root of the problem here in Sylvia's torn loyalties, and this adds to the confusion of the nature of Sylvia's true feelings for both in the melodramatic denounement.An interesting read. Most people enjoy the lively, cheerful note of the first volume, where Sylvia and Kinraid are falling in love, to the 'gathering shadows' of the second volume and the outright melodrama of the third. I enjoy a bit of melodrama myself...Does anyone care to discuss the superficial depiction of Kinraid in this novel by Gaskell? As she was an experienced novelist, this can only have been deliberate, and raises all sorts of fascinating questions; I don't want to write a spoiler, so I will go into no more detail here!"},{"Title":"Build It Right! What to Look for in Your New Home","review":"There is a lot of good information in this book, but there is also a lot missing as well as some misleading information. I'd recommend this book to someone that was planning on building or remodeling with the caveat that they also read from other sources or better consult with established professionals in each and every trade on the project.The strong points of this book include good discussion of doorway layouts, spacing in kitchen and baths, things to look out for that could be problems and good questions to ask or things to consider when planning. Pointing out problems and potential problems that a homeowner may face in the future makes this book worth the money, after all, if after reading this book an owner solves or prevents just one simple mistake, the book has paid for itself many times over.The weak points of this book are why I suggest reading elsewhere or consulting with professionals. I am an electrician by trade so I read the chapter on electrical first. It wasn't that any of the information was really bad or mistaken, but simply that I felt it didn't mention a lot of things that could and should be brought up when planning.The author makes a point (several times) about having three conductor wire run to any potential ceiling fan location. While this isn't bad advice, it's incomplete. Many of the top of the line fans use remote control switching and don't require an extra wire. The best fans I have installed use a remote that is battery operated and the ceiling fan itself is wired to a two conductor wire that isn't even switched. If an owner picked up one of this fans they would now have a switch on the wall that did nothing or worse a switch that if turned off would cancel out the auto temperature function of the remote.While pointing out the importance of having an extra outlet outside for things like Christmas lights, he fails to mention the nice addition of eve high outlets wired to a timer.There are many reasons to consider timer switches, especially for outside wall and path lights. The best is a 7 day 24 hour electronic timer that fits in the space of a regular switch. These can be programed to go off at various times through out the night, a nice feature when on vacation or simply for added security.The use of lighting controls, dimmers, timers, etc. is barely touched on or not discussed at all. While these systems can run into the tens of thousands of dollars, all but very meager budgets such at least consider the options available because for some applications the extra money can be justified.The use of dimming xenon lighting for undercabinet use instead of fluorescent is not discussed. I believe it is a much better option.I also noticed some problems in other trades. The use of insta hot water heaters is mentioned as a good way to save energy in the kitchen because the hot water doesn't have to travel to get there. I am not sure what the author was basing this information on, but it isn't correct. First off he implies that an insta hot can supply water at the sink but he doesn't mention that there are two kinds of systems. One is the insta hot that keeps about a gallon of near boiling water for use in making coffee, tea and instant soups and oatmeal. While this is great for people on the go or someone that doesn't want an elderly member of the family turning on the tea kettle and perhaps forgetting it; it is not an energy saving device. The second kind of insta hot is a small unit that doesn't store any water, it just heats up the water as it passes through the unit. It is really only designed for one purpose only hand washing. In the discussion on supplying extra or insta hot water for bathrooms, the author mentions that planning for the space and supplying electrical or gas are the considerations. But what about venting the unit if it is gas? This is a big consideration and would make adding a second unit not very cost effective. The best solution would simply be to add a circ pump and if necessary increase the size of the water heater. The way the information is laid out in the book would probably just confuse the non-professional.The biggest problem I had in my reading of this book was when I read the author describe linoleum as the floor of choice in the kitchen. I nearly quit reading right there and then and threw the book in the trash. To his credit he does mention that in certain parts of the country tile is the way to go and if you live in those parts it's ok to go with tile. I happen to live in Southern California where linoleum is the flooring used in apartments and condos and cheap o tract homes. I can't believe anyone would recommend linoleum over tile. Tile stands up for years and if one breaks, which is unlikely, it can be replaced with another tile. If linoleum rips, which it's easy to do when moving appliances around, it is not as easy to fix as replacing a tile and regrouting, it will have to have a seam and seams tend to come apart after time. Plus linoleum over the years tends to get dull with wear while tile can be cleaned and resealed, linoleum is a print on paper and once it wears out or is ripped or scratched it can't be taken back to it's pristine state. While I personally hate the current trend in fake wood floors (laminates) because I think they look fake, I think a compelling argument could be made to use them over linoleum. The author of this book obviously doesn't mind linoleum, which is fine, but he fails to make a case for the other options as well as he could have and should have so that the reader could make informed choices.Finally I would like to say that despite my misgivings and the problems I found, I'd like to reiterate that anyone going into building or buying a new home wouldn't be hurt by reading this book and even a simple suggestion or solution to a problem would pay for the cost of the book, but don't stop with just this book. It leaves too much out."},{"Title":"Build It Right! What to Look for in Your New Home","review":"The author does an excellent job of walking the reader through the residential build process, beginning with lot selection, choosing an architect and builder, design, and construction. This book is rich with helpful, practical, and useful information on a variety of topics, including windows and doors, the electrical and non-electrical wiring, HVAC, and plumbing. The suggestions offered are straight-forward and are common sense ideas that will help anyone building a new home. Recommendations such as wiring garage door openers to an electrical switch that can be turned off while the house is vacant as a security precaution, installing a basement floor drain for high-efficiency furnaces or if a humidifier is installed, using a mixing valve to bring both hot and cold water to an outside hose bib, are just a few examples that are offered. I found the section on kitchen design/layout, countertop selection, and exhaust systems very useful, as it caused me to alter some of the design I had previously done in the construction of my home, which will prevent me from experiencing certain issues that I may have otherwise overlooked.Having built 2 homes previously and having read 4 books on this topic in the past 2 months, I can tell you without reservation that this is the most-comprehensive, organized, and easy-to-read book I have found available on this topic thus far. I would highly recommend the material for anyone who is either building a new home or planning to undergo a renovation of their existing house. For first-time home builders, you will find this book invaluable."},{"Title":"Build It Right!

I bought several books after my husband and I decided to build a new home and this was the best. Whether you're doing your own contracting or hiring one, this book explains, in detail, what makes a good home and what is sloppy or poorly designed construction. It makes you think of things you might not have -- such as leaving enough clearance when building cabinets so you can walk around the open diswasher, or checking to make sure the interior doors all swing the right way so they don't open into each other. It talks about insulation, cabinets, heating and air vents, placement and number of electrical outlets you should have, etc. Truly, a wonderful book.

What to Look for in Your New Home","review":"I am writing as both a book publishing consultant and a former builder, with experience working on new custom homes and tract condos, as well as remodeling. From a publishing perspective, Myron Ferguson has done a very capable job of creating a title that is well-designed, well-written, and clearly illustrated. You will find it simply organized and easy to use. From my experience as a builder, I have to say that this is one of the most informative and valuable aids a home buyer or first-time builder is likely to find. Myron's engineering background is apparent, but just as evident is his common sense about how to put the parts of a house together so they work for you, instead of against you.

Whether you are looking at resales or building a new custom or tract-style home, this book will help you IMMENSELY. I walked into some builders show-homes and immediately was able to decide whether they were a good builder or not after having read the book. The section on kitchens is particularly helpful. It is amazing how many kitchens are designed poorly--something I would not have picked up without this book. ONe builder proudly proclaimed that he &quot;specialized&quot; in kitchen design and construction. His kitchens were designed with the builder in mind, not the consumer.

END"},{"Title":"Build It Right! What to Look for in Your New Home","review":"Some of the information is very helpful for buyers of new homes, but in many instances the author makes statements about topics which he clearly doesn't know anything about or doesn't like, and make them appear as fact. He is definetely mis-informed about hydronic radiant heating. There is good information but I would warn every buyer to use their judgement, and take much of the author's opinions as just that. The buyer should be aware that there are many new advances in materials being used to build homes, and the author doesn't seem to take this into account, or makes it sound like a bad idea if he doesn't agree. Some of the auther's design ideas are truely opinions(such as in the kitchen), and not based in fact but his likes and dislikes. He also includes some really good information, i.e. when he talks about the placement of the dishwasher in relationship to a corner sink.There are lots of books about design and what makes a good home. This book is okay, but ! do not make it your only design guide."},{"Title":"Build It Right! What to Look for in Your New Home","review":"This book is about the pieces-parts (as the commercial used to say). There are little sections on just about every piece in the house: plumbing, countertop material, HVAC, security etc. It also talks quite a bit about proper design, such as: which way a door should swing,; when to use pocket doors; where to put the dishwasher (better yet: where NOT to put the dishwasher); how to vent the dryer; what size kitchen hood to use; etc.As I mentioned, he writes one or two pages on nearly every visible or finish piece in the house (notable exceptions: framing materials and foundation). His primary focus is functionality and user-friendliness of the house, followed by quality and durability of the materials.Buy this book BEFORE you decide on a floorplan.

Far from being presented as a stereotype, Tom Molineaux comes across as a multi-dimentional, deeply moving individual. Such is the author's skill that the character of 'Black Ajax' is built up slowly and subtly, from a variety of points of view. The racial epithets, far from drawing attention to the 'shortcomings' of the book (there are none), serve to highlight exactly what Tom Molineaux was up against. His situation is treated realistically and with compassion.The characterization and structure overall are outstanding. Each character's voice is unique. The book's greatest strength lies in its utter lack of sentimentality. Fraser is clearly a writer of supernatural gifts."},{"Title":"Black Ajax","review":"Tom Molineaux, ex slave and brawler turned bare knuckle prize fighter, lover and dandy living life to great excess in pre Victorian English high society. This is a true story told from the view point of various people who come into contact with Molineaux on his journey up and down the social ladder. These characters, ranging from a female conquest's butler to the Prince Regent are wonderfully constructed and brought to life by Fraser's gift for the language of the time as already seen in the Flashman Papers. Molineaux is a horribly misunderstood and manipulated character and the story of his rise and fall is both touching and poignant whilst remaining humourous, gripping and brutal. Each person and scene is beautifully constructed, Fraser's passion for the era is obvious. The prologue alone telling the story of a broken down pug on his last legs brings tears to the eye and is worth the price of the book alone."},{"Title":"Black Ajax","review":"From one of my most favorite authors of historical fiction comes this tale of a freed slave coming to England circa 1810 to try and break into the prizefighting game. Apparently prizefighting was the sport back then, enjoyed by all levels of society. Fraser tells the story of the rise and fall of this one-time legend in a series of mock interviews with those surrounding him: his childhood love, his manager, his trainer, his patron, several foes, and misc. others. Just as interesting as the fighter's story is the variety in language and perspective given in each interview. The interviews are loaded with slang from the era, which is only partially decoded in the glossary, so it may make for heavy reading for some. The patron of the prizefighter is Harry Flashman's father, in a tie-in to Fraser's excellent long-running Flashman series."},{"Title":"Black Ajax","review":"In this marvellously original novel Mr. MacDonald Fraser fully deploys his ability to create the very feel of another age in the way he has done humorously in the Flashman novels and seriously in \\"Mr.American\\". This book immerses us in the prizefighting world of Regency England but the author does not write of the past, but rather of another present, different to our own, and he makes it live not only though its own speech patterns and slang, but by conveying the values, expectations and cultural norms of the time, as expressed in daily life. There is no overt judgement here of the rights and wrongs of that society, with its acceptance of exploitation, economic, social, sexual and racial, on a scale inconceivable in modern Western Society, and this makes the implicit condemnation all the stronger. This is not a polemic however and one is reminded throughout how basic qualities of human decency, courage and compassion - no less than of greed and cruelty - are unchanging with time. The story - a true one - is complex, exciting and thought-provoking. The technique employed, a series of narratives from different viewpoints and from different observers or participants, none the main character, is an inherently difficult one to pull off successfully, but Mr. MacDonald Fraser manages it brilliantly. Each narrator has his or her own uniquely personal style and many are not reporting - but rather justifying themselves or establishing a personal stake on the basis of recollections that may or may not be totally accurate. The range of characterisation through reminiscence is stunning - from the proudly-conscious sadism of a Louisiana plantation owner, to the cynicism of a wealthy Havana brothel-keeper whom we have first encountered as an innocent and terrified slave girl, to the absolute amorality of the alcohol-sodden Flashman Senior (father of the immortal Harry) to the rough decency of English prize-fighters. The use of period style and slang is masterful. The author has obviously immersed himself in the writings of Pierce Egan (who features in the cast) and many of the pages of \\"Black Ajax\\" might indeed go undetected as being of later date if inserted among the chronicles of the original Tom and Jerry, while I am still uncertain whether the contribution of William Hazlitt (who also appears) is an extract from his actual writings or a recreation by Mr.MacDonald Fraser. In summary - a splendid novel. One thirsts for more in similar vein."},{"Title":"Black Ajax","review":"From the real-life story of the meteoric rise, and subsequent fall of Tom Molineaux, freed slave who comes to England with one purpose alone--to defeat the reigning champ, Tom Cribb. Seen through the eyes of various people who saw him (including, notably, Harry Flashman's father) (Flashman himself gets a brief mention) and who are telling their experiences to an unknown person, presumably an author or writer.Since Tom's fate is revealed in the prologue, watching Tom's arc, which will bring him achingly close to the top only to fall, is painful. But what makes this book is watching the attitude of those arond him, and the Napoleonic-era society which is delighted to embrace him as a novelty--and to turn against him the instant he becomes a threat or a failure. For all the wine, women and song he is given, the turning point in this book is when the misunderstood Tom realizes he will never be accepted, as a non-white, non-English contender, society and the mob will turn against him the instant he is seen as likely to become the champion.Fraser, as he showed for the later 19th century in the Flashman books, and as he did for the Edwardian era in Mr. American, shows an intimate knowledge and understanding of Regency England, which is brought to life for our enjoyment."},{"Title":"Black Ajax","review":"One of the delightful things about the work of George MacDonald Fraser is the wide range of subjects he addresses which are knit together by one singular talent - his ability to breath life into another era.Those who have only read The Flashman Papers (not a bad thing by any means) have only seen one facet of Mr. Fraser's talent. When he applied it in &quot;The Steel Bonnets&quot;, one of the most confusing, convoluted and bloody periods in English history leapt into focus. Now in addressing the doomed career of Tom Molineaux, a former slave who freed himself by beating another slave to death, Fraser sheds some much needed light on that contradictory period which was Regency England.Using Molineaux's brief career as the subject of an &quot;industrious inquirer&quot;, Fraser brings in the views of such diverse observers as an eccentric upper class &quot;pedestrian&quot; who - between walks to Scotland and back - trains Tom Cribb for the second bout, a boxing journalist of the period whose florid hyperbole disguises the fact that he is rarely able to actually attend the matches and, of course, Flash Harry's &quot;guv'ner&quot;, Buckley &quot;Mad Buck&quot; Flashman.&quot;Black Ajax&quot; reveals more about the attitudes, prejudices and life styles of the Regency than it really does about poor Tom Molineaux. For those looking for a politically correct read, look elsewhere for, as Fraser is fond of saying, history cannot be bent to suit today's attitudes and still remain history. For those who revel in Fraser's adept use of dialect and period slang and his ability to bring an entire era to life, this is for you."},{"Title":"Black Ajax","review":"'Black Ajax' is an interesting novel about a African-American boxer who tries to win the British championship in the early 1800s. It's both comical and tragic, with many colorful characters. However the style of the book, written as narratives from the perspectives of different characters, leaves much to be desired. What we have is the endless use of crude slang that grows tedious, and we really don't to know any one character very well ... especially the main character. In addition, the story has holes in it. For example, the book starts off in New Orleans but then the main character has arrived in England. We don't know anything about how he got there, what happened during his voyage, etc.Bottom line: not without its moments, Black Ajax is not the best example of historical fiction out there. Not recommended."},{"Title":"Black Ajax","review":"Three of Mr. Fraser's most recent works have all dealt seriously with the same theme -- that of racism. Flashman and the Angel of the Lord explored John Brown and the issue of slavery. Quartered Safe Out Here dealt frankly with the racism that Allied soldiers lived with as they battle the Japanese in WWII. Now Mr. Fraser tackles the subtle racist and classist attitudes of Regency England with his most practiced touch. Mr. Fraser writes historical novels and in Black Ajax he creates the most complete picture of a historical period yet. He does so be depicting the action through the eyes of many different characters as they witness or react to the events of Tom Molineaux, a black american pugilist determined to knock the British boxing establishment to the canvas. All his characters are rich, most are extremely funny. Not the least of which is Sir Harry Flashman's decadent dad, proving that vice (if not bravery) run in the family. This may very well be Mr. Fraser's best book...it is certainly his most mature. While he has always used his characters' words to prove an antithetical point (i.e. what they say is the opposite of what good people should do) in no other work is his sarcasm so polished, his condemnation of hypocrisy so ascerbic. I loved it."},{"Title":"Black Ajax","review":"Fraser works his charcters and plots with taste and ease. They are real people and real places.

The story is presented in monologues as told by the principal participants to an unnamed fictional biographer/reporter some time after Molineaux's death. Of course, the dialogue and some of the characters are invented (most notably Buck Flashman, the rakish father of MacDonald Fraser's most famous creation), but I was surprised to learn after reading this book that its main incidents and characters were real. George MacDonald Fraser is simply a master storyteller with a jeweler's eye for historical detail who has written yet another masterpiece. In this retelling of the story of Tom Molineaux, it's striking how boxing's seamy template of racial animosities, financial exploitation and pathetic physical ruin isn't just a 20th century story but goes back as far as Regency England, and probably back to the Coliseum. This is a great book. It's too bad the old fellow can't go on writing forever."},{"Title":"Black Ajax","review":"This book is very good as a stand alone - but if you expect the usual Flashy antics, they are not there. Nevertheless as a canvas of 19th century English boxing, this is first rate.Tom Bertenshaw"},{"Title":"Black Ajax","review":"A more serious historical novel than we are used to from MacDonald Fraser. This novel still contains much of the wit and pizzazz found in the Flashman papers. The flavour of that era is strongly portrayed, but the heavy use of \\"olde Englishe\\" makes the book difficult to read and in my opinion, does not add to the story. A glossary at the end helps, but does not cover all the terms used. The central character, Tom Molineaux, a black slave in America who wins his freedom in a boxing match, almost achieves his life's ambition of becoming the bareknuckle champion of England which at that time was &quot;the world&quot;. But he fails to cope with his own demons and sinks to an early and undignified end. Is it a tragedy? MacDonald Frazer, leaves this question open. Tom started as an uneducated slave, then travelled to London, became famous, met the King, fought for the English bareknuckle title twice, and bedded some of the most famous &quot;ladies&quot; in England. It sure beats slavery!"},{"Title":"Black Ajax","review":"As with all of Frazier's books, \\"Black Ajax\\" combines rivetting storytelling with a very politically-incorrect sense of wry humor.

Fraser remains on the throne of historical fiction. One caveat: Anyone easily offended by racial slurs might want to avoid this and any other serious novel that deals with biogtry in history."},{"Title":"Black Ajax","review":"I have now seen George MacDonald Fraser in a new light. Before he had always been a good read but now I dare say he is venturing into literature. His new book, &quot;Black Ajax&quot;, tells the story of a Regency Era black boxer. What is special about this book is not only Fraser's exceptional skill and placing us in a bygone era but how he tells this particular story. The Story is told from the viewpoint of people who witnessed Black Ajax's life. It is told in a documentary fashion where you still feel a closeness with the main character. This story is not the normal gay romp of Flashman yet nor is it the melodrama of &quot;Mr Amercian&quot;. One last thing, For you Flashman fans, you get to learn all about Flashy's father and our hero himself is present if only just a little offstage."},{"Title":"Black Ajax","review":"With a relatively unusual format, using the jargon and slang peculiar to England during the Napoleonic era, the author brings to life a little known historical event in which an American ex-slave nearly becomes the boxing champion of England. Properly adapted for the screen, this stands to be a wonderful, highly unusual movie."},{"Title":"Black Ajax","review":"It is said that this book is based on historical fact. But with MacDonald Fraser you can never be sure if he wears his straight face, or if he is putting you on. Perhaps he just wants to make a point when he puts old Buck Flashman on the scene?

It features the advent of Gervase Fen, Professor of English Language and Literature, and amateur detective extraordinaire. Another of my favorite characters, the deaf and possibly senile Professor Wilkes also appears for the first time and tells a ghost story right before the first murder occurs. A story within a story. A mystery within a mystery.Fen solves both the mystery of the Gilded Fly, and the mystery within the ghost story.Crispin specialized in creating \`impossible' murders for his Oxford don to investigate. A murder usually acquires the label \`impossible' at the death scene, when someone blurts out, \\"No one could have gotten past the gate keeper (or into the locked room or through the sky light). This is impossible!\\"In \\"The Case of the Gilded Fly,\\" we have:\\"...Accident practically impossible. And murder, apparently, quite impossible. So the only conclusion is---\\"The only conclusion is,\\" put in the Inspector, \\"that the thing never happened at all.\\"Now Fen is off and running! A whole troupe of actors and actresses had motives for killing their colleague, and all of them (of course) have alibis.Although its characters sometimes sound frivolous and superficial (and very funny), \`Gilded Fly' also concerns itself with the gap between outward, conventional appearances and the inner turmoil that triggered a murder. All of the suspects have valid, psychological reasons for wanting the victim to die, but Fen is skeptical about crimes committed for hate or love:\\"I don't believe in the \`crime passionel,' particularly when the passion appears, as in this case, to be chiefly frustration. Money, vengeance, security: there are your plausible motives, and I shall look for one of them.\\"If you agree with Fen, then you will be able to eliminate ninety percent of the suspects. If you're like me, you'll keep blundering off after red herrings until All is Explained at novel's end. The author doesn't cheat---you'll get all of the clues ahead of the final denouement.For the second mystery in his series featuring Gervase Fen, Oxford don and amateur detective extraordinaire, Edmund Crispin finally treats World War II with more than just a passing reference to blackouts and tobacco substitutes.Unlike other writers from the Golden Age of British Mystery such as Margery Allingham in \\"Traitor's Purse\\" (1941) or Michael Innes in \\"The Secret Vanguard\\" (1940), Crispin didn't weigh in against the Nazis with \\"Holy Disorders\\" until the war was almost over (1945).Perhaps it was to be expected that a fictional professor of English Language and Literature would be less informed about current events (WWII!) than a fictional hereditary peer who performed secret missions for the Government (Allingham's Albert Campion) or a fictional chief of New Scotland Yard who performed secret missions for the Government (Innes's Sir John Appleby). Fen does run for office in one of Crispin's later books, but for reasons that have nothing to do with government, politics, or current events.Incidentally, Sir John Appleby gets some air time in \\"Holy Disorders,\\" as the local constabulary keeps threatening to call in the big shot from New Scotland Yard when their murders are not promptly solved. Fen manages to fend off Appleby as well as the Nazis.Instead of a mere \`locked room' murder, \\"Holy Disorders\\" sports a pair of \`locked Cathedral' murders. There is also a tinge of the supernatural---collapsing tomb stones, witchcraft, the shadow of a hanged man. As one of the characters says about the first murder victim, \\"What was it he saw, when he walked alone about the Cathedral? What was it he found there, that no one else has found?\\"\\"Holy Disorders\\" may not be the most tightly constructed of the Fen mysteries, but there is a full cast of eccentric ecclesiastics, many of them inclined to witty, religious debate and obscure literary allusions.\\"The Moving Toyshop,\\" published in 1946, was Crispin's third Gervase Fen mystery. This particular whodunit involves an unusual will, a hunt for five eccentric characters named after the nonsense poems of Edward Lear, and of course, a moving toy shop with a corpse in its upper story. The action begins in the Autumn of 1938, when the poet, Richard Cadogan wangles an advance from his London publisher and sets out for a vacation in Oxford.The reader begins to realize the oddity of the journey he has embarked upon with the poet, when Cadogan hitches a ride with truck driver who quotes Coleridge (\\"a thahsand, thahsand slimy things lived on and so did I.\\") but prefers D.H. Lawrence's \\"Lady Somebody's Lover.\\"We're entering Fen Country now, where even the truck drivers and police detectives are amateur literary critics, and our detective, Gervase Fen is the Oxford don of English Language and Literature. Dialogue fizzes with cynical witticisms and literary allusions when Fen and the poet, Cadogan go at it, or when Fen takes on any of a number of amateur classicists who populate \\"The Moving Toyshop.\\"All of Crispin's Fen mysteries can be read with pleasure for the dialogue alone. This particular book also has a full cast of British eccentrics, including the five Edward Lear characters (one of whom is a murderer).\\"The Moving Toyshop\\" is Crispin on his own home turf (he was educated at St. John's College, Oxford), and at the top of his classical form."},{"Title":"The Edmund Crispin Treasury Volume 1","review":"It's fun to read a writer who uses a large vocabulary.

The playfulness and wit makes it worth while.

In the 1920's a new histrical school was born among nationalist memebers of the rulling ellite.They discovered in Rosas a strong leader and a stern defender of the country's independance against foreign rule. Rosas fought against France and England, the major powers of the 19th. century.Carlos Ibarguren belonged to that school. He travelled to England, met the decendants and was able to research an enormaous archive of personal and public papers Rosas had taken with himself into exile, believing history would be softer with him than his enemies. In this book he shows Rosas' life fully, with lots of letters and other source transcriptions.

To a folklorist, it is utter folly to attempt to reconcile such diversity.\\" Patricia McBroomFolklore in Oral Transmission:My dad never described the Old Testament narratives as mythical, but he convincingly argued that since it was written after centuries of oral tradition was tinted with variants of ideas and theologies.Most biblical scholars acknowledge that the Old Testament was orally transmitted for decades before appearing in written form. Dundes offers a new and exciting way to understand its variant texts, using the analytical framework of folklore to unearth and contrast the multiple versions of nearly every major biblical event, including the creation of woman, the flood, the ten commandments, among many others.Interpreting the Bible as folklore:Using his expert knowledge of folklore, Dundes unearths and contrasts multiple versions of most major biblical event, to helps us resolve some of the mysteries and contradictions that evolved during the Bible's prewritten legacy and that persist in the Great Book today. With great reverence for the Bible, Dundes offers a new and exciting way to resolve some of the mysteries and contradictions that evolved during the Bible's prewritten legacy and that still persist today. \\"People say this is an oral tradition, but then they proceed to search for one true variant,\\" said Dundes, \\"In oral literature, there is no such thing. This is not meant to be disrespectful, but people should stop worrying about the discrepancies among the stories. They don't matter. This doesn't mean the Bible isn't true, or that it isn't a sacred text,\\" He hastened to explain.Multiple Versions of same stories?Professor Dundes reports examples of what he describes as 'multiple versions of various stories' that appear in the Bible. He believes that these stories were circulated for decades and even centuries as an oral tradition. During that time, each version of the stories subtlety changed as it was circulated before it was recorded in written form. From the discrepancies among the various version of the same story, he concluded not only that the Bible contains folklore, but that the Bible is folklore. Dundes writes: \\"It simply means that the Bible is oral literature that has been written down, and the nature of oral literature is that there must be two or more versions of any story...the Bible clearly manifests the basic distinctive criteria of folklore: namely multiple existence and variation.\\"Dr. Alan Dundes:Known as a world class authority on folklore, Alan Dundes, is a professor of folklore and anthropology, University of California, Berkeley. He has written over 30 books based on his studies of the oral traditions of many cultures. In more than 30 books he has unveiled the meanings in the oral traditions of many cultures."},{"Title":"Holy Writ as Oral Lit: The Bible as Folklore","review":"This was a fantastic read. The author step-by-step takes the reader through the basics of oral literature (folklore, folk tales), and gives numerous examples of oral literature in the Bible. Among many other examples, he shows how the two creation stories, the two flood stories, all demonstrate that the Bible, Holy Writ, is an example of a collection of Oral Lit, oral folk tales that the ancient people used to tell each other.It was a delightful and insightful reading experience for me, and I finished it in a couple hours."},{"Title":"Holy Writ as Oral Lit: The Bible as Folklore","review":"Alan Dundes, one of the U.C.Berkeley's foremost professors, has written a fantastic book again! He proves that the bible's source is oral literature (folklore), thus explaining the different versions of events throughout the bible. Dundes' book is the voice of reason in a sea of confusion surrounding biblical history."},{"Title":"Holy Writ as Oral Lit: The Bible as Folklore","review":"Those who hold on to the belief of a God-inspired bibilical text won't have their minds changed -- but those who seek rational answers to all the brouhaha over the old fairy tales of the Bible will find real food for clear thought and understanding."},{"Title":"Holy Writ as Oral Lit: The Bible as Folklore","review":"I was hoping to find more information on the historical context in which the bible was written, particularly in regards to the dissemination and transmogrification of the biblical stories. I expected a little bit of an attack on the modern interpretation of christianity, but this book is much more neutral. It exposes many of the contradictions between many of the books of the bible as nothing more than natural variations on the same theme, in the same way that any folklore changes but retains its meaning. The most difficult argument posited is that oral folklore remains folklore when written. The idea is adequately argued, and the majority of the book goes on to give examples in the form of accounts of identical stories told in different ways throughout the bible. I was hoping for something with a little more edge to it, but this book was a fine and informative read nonetheless."},{"Title":"Holy Writ as Oral Lit: The Bible as Folklore","review":"Very much in agreement with the book &#34;The Study of Folklore&#34; by the same author. The concepts of both books were new to me so, I can say they were instructive and as such were worthwhile reading."},{"Title":"Threshold to Music","review":"I do not know why this book has fallen in to disuse. This and the accompanying charts are very effective in teaching young children about music. I use them at church to teach early singers to feel rhythm. Also, they are wonderful to teach early note reading.

As such, it defies and even transcends the traditional hierarchy and divisions between the ethnographer and the subject of ethnographic observation/interrogation. He does this by focusing on the life of and his encounters with the elderly Qadi of Bzu, with whom he develops a increasingly friendly and intimate relationship.Beyond its intrepid methodology, Eickelman's picture of the order and system of the traditional reproduction of Islamic knowledge and its transformation in the modern period, stereotypical said to be a movement from chaos to order, has proved to be largely influential in other famous social histories-especially, for example, in the work of Mitchell and Messick."},{"Title":"Mighty Mouse to the Rescue","review":"Written in 1958, it is a cute little story for 3 and up.

Adapted by MGM in 1933 for the film &quot;Eskimo&quot;, it served the purpose of commercialization of the 'Exotic' wilderness. Performance by Chinese and Japanese actors as eskimo beauties, and the author himself as the villain.

While the text is well written, the total lack of any siteplans, floorplans, and elevations cause this book to provide only a partial understanding of Mizner's work. All photos are black and white, and while this serves to keep the book modestly priced, it also severely limits the reader's enjoyment. Still, for the cost a worthwhile bargain."},{"Title":"Florida architecture of Addison Mizner;","review":"I noticed the other review and felt it did not do this resourceful book as much justice as it deserves. My husband and I own a house designed by Addison Mizner, where we live half of the year. We had to renovate an entire back portion of our house to bring it back to the original design. During the 1980's a former owner did an odd renovation to a small portion of the house and a substantial addition to the house without respecting the original design. This book provided much insight into the original interiors & architectural details of Mizner's architecture. Two books by Donald Curl: Mizner's Florida: American Resort Architecture, and his other book, Palm Beach County: An Illustrated History were of extreme help and importance in renovating our house. Also, of great help in understanding Mizner's architecture was the large collection of archives available to the general public at the Historical Society of Palm Beach County. Since Mizner supplied furniture to many of his clients it was wonderful to see photographs of many of the interiors in their original glory. When researching Addison Mizner's interiors I found the interior photographs in this book to be the most resourceful photographs of all books or archives that I could find. Also to note of much importance is that there are photographs of homes that have sadly been demolished. Thank God for the Preservation Foundation of Palm Beach!"},{"Title":"Florida architecture of Addison Mizner;","review":"An important factor in the enjoyment of FLORIDA ARCHITECTURE OF ADDISON MIZNER, a 1992 softcover by Dover, is the realization that it is a republication of the 1928 book originally published by William Helburn, Inc. The 185 black & white photos by Frank E. Geisler and the Forward by Mizner's original Palm Beach patron, Paris Singer, is included. A new Introduction by Mizner authority, Donald W. Curl of Florida Atlantic University, gives a background of Mizner and work in Palm Beach and Boca Raton as well as an update on the fate of some of the properties. While it cannot be compared to the glossy coffee table books of today, this book is an invaluable Time Capsule look at the exclusive club houses, sensational private residences and remarkable retail centers by the legendary Mediterranean Revival architect Addison Mizner."},{"Title":"Florida architecture of Addison Mizner;","review":"This is a good, historic representation of the life and work of Addison Mizner. The Author has made an excellent attempt to capture the style of the Designer. The book lacks any color photographs, drawings or elevations that is expected in a book dealing with Architecture. I imagine that there is a dearth of information on the Mizner available and some of his buildings no longer exist. It is a good book if you are really interested to learn about the beginnings of contemporary Florida architecture."},{"Title":"Florida architecture of Addison Mizner;","review":"I love this book, there is just enough information for someone who is interested in Addison Mizner. This book contains no filler and is loaded front to back with black and white images taken almost a century ago. However, there is no floor plans or elevations of each property-there is hundreds of pictures capturing the elegant details and the \\"small details\\" that made these estates what they are today.

You will need a content-based image database system which accepts an image as its input and retrieves all images like that by using some image properties such as color, texture, shape or metadata.The curvature scale space (CSS) image is a multi-scale organization of the inflection points (or curvature zero-crossing points) of the image contour as it evolves. Intuitively, curvature is a local measure of how fast a planar contour is turning. Contour evolution is achieved by first parameterizing using arclength. This involves sampling the contour at equal intervals and recording the 2-D coordinates of each sampled point. The result is a set of 2 coordinate functions (of arc length) which are then convolved with a Gaussian filter of increasing width or standard deviation. The next step is to compute curvature on each smoothed contour. As a result, curvature zero-crossing points can be recovered and mapped to the CSS image in which the horizontal axis represents the arclength parameter on the original contour, and the vertical axis represents the standard deviation of the Gaussian filter.The features recovered from a CSS image for matching are the maxima of its zero-crossing contours. The matching of two CSS images consists of finding the optimal horizontal shift of the maxima in one of the CSS images that would yield the best possible overlap with the maxima of the other CSS image. The matching cost is then defined as the sum of pairwise distances (in CSS) between corresponding pairs of maxima. Note that this technique has been compared to moments and Fourier descriptors, and found to perform better than either of them.This book explains in detail the CSS method of image matching and how it is incorporated into the MPEG-7 standard, which is that MPEG standard that involves the description, indexing, and retrieval of multimedia elements. Although you would expect this material to be somewhat dry, the authors have done a good job of making the material very accessible and interesting. Whenever algorithms are described they are done so in numbered steps and all equations are described in detail in terms of their components. Lots of figures are included to help describe how the image is being processed at various points.Chapter one of the book contains material on the computation of the CSS image as well as its alternate forms. It also presents results on the theoretical properties of CSS images.Chapter 2 describes two robust free-form object recognition systems based on the CSS representation. Chapter 3 investigates image database retrieval based on shape content through the CSS method. The system is applied to the classification of Chrysanthemum leaves. Chapter 4 discusses a number of extensions of the CSS image and studies their behavior under affine transformations and non-rigid deformations of input shapes. Chapter 5 describes the approach to free-form 3D object retrieval from arbitrary viewpoints. Chapter 6 covers the MPEG-7 standardization of the CSS shape descriptor. This includes a description of the precise CSS enhancement which was selected for standardization, an explanation of how the image databases used for testing were generated as well as the exact procedures followed for evaluation of test results, and finally a review of the other shape descriptors evaluated during the competition.Chapter 7 discusses robust image corner detection through the CSS method. Chapter 8 is concerned with efficient active contour convergence based on CSS filtering. Chapter 9 talks about efficient multi-scale contour data compression and reconstruction using the CSS method. Chapter 10 explains the theory of torsion Scale Space images as multi-scale representations for free-form space curves. The final chapter presents a theory of multi-scale representations for free-form 3-D surfaces.I highly recommend this book not only to those who are interested in the MPEG-7 standard, but to those that are interested in the algorithms involved in image matching in general."},{"Title":"How to Publish Your Poetry","review":"This book is by far the best, most sympathetic, encouraging and stimulating book for the beginning poet that I have yet come across.

Cursively written, too, with pertinent quotes at the beginning of each chapter. I even laughed out loud a number of times reading this book, because it's just so fun to read! I have one small complaint, which can be expected of any printed book about the internet. The internet-publishing chapter of this book I think is way out of date. My only other complaint is more about what I didn't know about the book before reading it than the book itself.

Mauriac, who won the 1952 Nobel Prize for literature, was a comitted Catholic whose faith nonetheless refused sentimentalism or happy endings.In &quot;The Enemy,&quot; we meet an ugly man who through his family's wealth (and his own ill-advised reading of a chapter of Nietzsche) marries a beautiful woman who despises him. &quot;The Weakling&quot; likewise is a protagonist whose physical attributes help create for him a world of terrible suffering at the hands of others. Grace--that most mysterious of Christian experiences--comes through each character to those around them. Those &quot;normal&quot; folk who more resemble the majority of us...I cannot recommend these works, or any of Mauriac's works, highly enough. He is one of France's great undiscovered treasures, who (though he inspired and was the friend of such figures as Elie Weisel and Graham Green) has been all but forgotten. One needn't embrace his Catholicism to sense the profound truth of the Christian faith he espoused, nor the beautiful way in which he espoused it.

Aiming to inculcate some useful information through humor, this secular book has quite a hodgepodge of advice: how to cook eggs; don't take Hollywood's advice about first dates; changing a flat tire; an amazing card trick; recipe for a butt-kickin' fruit smoothie; living bling free; urban legends; how to play poker; beware financial procrastination; buying groceries; home maintenance; and taking a good photograph.Christian humorist, sometime expert on end times, and author of other Pocket Guides, Jason Boyett knows how to entertain with words, often using modern slang (which may be slightly offensive to people not quite up to today). His aim is to help his reader cope with the demands of a more mature life.I enjoyed reading this little book but was disappointed when subjects failed to mature into the Christian perspective. The advice formulae in the Pocket Guide to Adulthood make it a possible reference volume in topics non-spiritual.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it and I think that anyone who loves these characters will enjoy it. It's just that after you write a certain number of books about the same people, the originality starts to fade. I noticed that in Gibert Morris' House of Winslow series. The first books are excellent, but not the very end ones. I liked this book, but it just doesn't quite compare with the original series."},{"Title":"The Tender Years","review":"Growing up is hard to do. Virginia Simpson, granddaughter of Love Comes Softly's Marty and Clark Davis, finds this out first hand. At the tender age of thirteen, Virginia makes friends with daring and popular Jenny, a girl at her school. Feeling proud to be in the \\"in\\" group, Virginia begins to go on some of the group's fun after-school outings. But things start to lose their fun once she gets in trouble with her family. She knows she is disobeying her parents by going out with Jenny and skipping her chores, but she doesn't want to lose her friendship with Jenny. Virginia thinks her family is unfair and strict . . . why shouldn't she be allowed to have fun and grow up without so much supervision?One day Jenny and her friends go too far. They \\"borrow\\" a raft from a neighbor and steal candy from the store, then plan to go rafting on the flooded creek. Virginia realizes that she does not really belong with her group of friends. How could they stoop to stealing?She leaves the group angrily, knowing it would likely be the end of her friendship, but too angry to care at the moment.Then, Virginia hears some dreadful news that puts her in turmoil. . . .As time goes on, Jenny and Virginia become friends again, of sorts. Jenny comes over to the Simpson's house more and more frequently and is fondled by her family. Virginia feels left out and jealous. When it is too hard to bear, she goes by herself and sobs. But she realizes she is wrong. Wrong to feel jealous. Her sister finds her and gently reproves her. Virginia's awful burden of sin is too hard to bear anymore, and she prays to God, feeling a peace she's never known before.From her sister's marriage, to the trial of a neighbor accused of theft, Virginia's story, The Tender Years, is a book that will touch you and keep you turning pages. It is a book about forgiveness, love, friendship, and happiness that is found only in God.It is a very good book for teens (or for anyone)!"},{"Title":"The Tender Years","review":"As someone who enjoyed Oke's Love Comes Softly series and read all the books in it twice, despite their tendency to get a bit less well-developed and padded after the first few titles, I was very interested when the Prairie Legacy books came out. I was glad to see that a break from writing about the Davis family and their children seems to have revived Oke's ability to make up new, detailed incidents in the lives of Marty and Clark's daughter, Belinda, the man she was about to marry at the end of _Love Finds a Home_ and their five children, esp. teenage Virginia. Despite quibbles--like that the story seems to take place in a vacuum, as far as the outside world is concerned (no radio, no mention of the Depression or whatever period the book is supposed to be taking place in), or that Belinda would have been summoned to nursing duties by way of the phone at the time the book occurs, instead of by someone running to her house to tell her about an amergency (someone must have mentioned this to Oke, because they definitely have a phone by the next book), or that Clark and Marty *must* be at least six or eight years older than they are supposed to be in the otherwise wonderful where-are-they-now? prologue--I enjoyed the book and devoured it in one evening. Virginia's friend, Jenny, is very manipulative, but Virginia's conflict between pleasing her parents and satisfying her own ideals on the one hand and wanting to fit in on the other was something that anyone who remembers their growing up will identify with, and Virginia's conflicts after her own conversion, as she desires to see Jenny saved and worries about alienating her or being a horrible Christian example but also wants to avoid moral compromises and gives in to all-too-human emotions, as we all surely do, made the story compelling. I was not one hundred percent content with the way the mystery thread of the book was resolved, but I was pleased enough in other ways that my pleasure outweighed my quibbles, and I wanted to read the next book."},{"Title":"The Tender Years","review":"Belinda's daughter Virginia is the subject of this story, as shepasses through the teen years. Sometimes she falls under the bad influence of her friend Jenny, whose father is too busy to keep an eye on her comings and goings.

This is indeed an author and a series that deserves immortality!"},{"Title":"The Tender Years","review":"I think all 13 - 18 year old girls should read The Tender Years by Janette Oke. It really teaches and tells that in your teens, life just doesn't seem to go your way. Everything seems to wrong. No matter if it's your family or friends; life just seems confusing and frustrating. I also think 13 - 18 year old girls should read this book, because they could, at least, compare themselves to one part of this book. And I'm sure most could relate to the problems the main character, Virginia, goes through. I know this mostly because I'm going on 14 and can relate my friends and me, to this book. You should really pick this book up and give it a try...and it's not just for teen girls either...if you have kids or are planning on them the Tender Years might help you understand your kids a little more."},{"Title":"THE CHOKECHERRY TREE.","review":"Growing up is the theme of this book byFeike Feikema, who is also Frederick Manfred, and Feikes Feikema. He also wrote many Western tales that were wildly popular at the time in Germany. When my dad saw me reading this book thirty years ago, he said, \\"If you want to know what it was like when I grew up, keep reading.\\" While the book is set in South Central, MN, my father grew up 10 miles away from Feikes hometown. With his testimony and having visited both Hull (my father) and Doon (Feikes) Iowa, and grown up in small midwestern towns, I can say the book is true to the attitudes and lifestyles of small towns, particularly of Dutch heritage. The book describes Elof's reconciling to himself and his father, after he has come home from college. Delbert Wylder in the introduction to my edition (Zia 1975) says that the people in this novel are simple in their wants, which is true only if you ignore the depression and concentrate on the material wants.

For the last group this book represents a valuable resource - PMs managing projects in accordance with the British standard called PRINCE2 will have a ready made reference for business case development, which is a requirement for the Managing Stage Boundary (SB) process, and those who are working within the U.S. standard defined by the Project Management Institute's Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) will find that this book will greatly augment the scope knowledge area and associated processes.Each chapter follows in a sequence. Chapter 1 introduces the author's model and how it will benefit you. Pay close attention here because chapters that follow require hard work and commitment from many stakeholders. This means resistance, and you'll find the material here useful if you wind up in the odd position of making a *business case* for implementing a business case methodology.Chapter 2 covers preparing a business case. I like the way the author breaks down the elements of an IT business case and how it's cast into a process. The next chapter discusses how to objectively evaluate a business case and is another highlight of this book. Strategy and analysis are blended in Chapter 4, which covers the business outcome. This chapter has some interesting approaches, including the development of a macro model (with an example provided), and how this is decomposed into micro models that examine factors and assumptions from which to derive a quantifiable business benefit. What makes the approach here so interesting is the relationships between and among the micro models are also carefully examined using a &quot;Meso&quot; model (this model type is commonly used to analyze complex physical interrelationships in weather forecasting). Common sense needs to be applied here - you will not use the entire array of techniques to support a minor project. On the other hand, a strategic decision like web-enabling an enterprise or a high-value e-commerce initiative certainly should be subjected to the painstakingly detained process given in this chapter.Stakeholders, strategic alignment of IT to business and technology issues are the topics of Chapters 5 through 7, each of which contains essential information for implementing the author's business case approach. Project managers will greatly appreciate the material in Chapter 8, which covers risk identification and management. I like the 3x3 IT project risk framework provided. Chapter 9 is a thorough treatment of business case accounting (also known as cost/benefit analysis). Here Mr. Remenyi dissects the topic with precision, covering cost items, estimate sources (cost and benefit), and a number of analysis techniques. This is one of the best chapters in my opinion.Chapters 10 and 11 are devoted to evaluating, weighing and prioritizing business cases, and how to effectively use business cases in conjunction with project management. The latter is completely consistent with the PRINCE2 method I mentioned earlier. The remainder of the book consists of a case study, and appendices that provide an extensive collection of questionnaires and forms, and a nicely done description of financial measures used in cost-benefit analysis.It all boils down to whether or not you are serious about developing business cases and doing them right. If you are this book is essential. I give it five stars for thoroughness and the added value of more forms and checklists than I've ever seen collected between two covers."},{"Title":"IT Investment: Making a Business Case (Computer Weekly Professional Series)","review":"The book is quite superficial, it states the obvious and does not go enough into detail in order to be of any practical value."},{"Title":"IT Investment: Making a Business Case (Computer Weekly Professional Series)","review":"This book is definitely a good read for the general reference or framework to use as a resource.

That's not to say that I don't have quibbles; the book could have contained more critical insight and still would have worked fine as an introductory level text.For example both the Low Income Housing Tax Credit and the public housing chapters (chapters 5 and 6) seem to take the inherent value of \\"deconcentration\\" and \\"mixed income\\" at face value, at a time when both notions are finally beginning to receive long overdue critical attention from social scientists (besides William Julius Wilson), not just planners, pundits, and politicians. It turns out that these notions are highly problematic in their actual application. As Edward Goetz and others have pointed out about the HOPE VI program for instance, \\"the program is not so much about improving the conditions for previous residents as it is about reclaiming urban neighborhoods for middle- income families.\\" This is a stronger statement than Schwartz makes on p. 118 of the book where he observes instead that the program \\"does not necessarily improve the lives of all the residents of the original public housing.\\"It is also neither fair nor balanced for Schwartz to neglect to mention that the 1937 U.S. Housing Act, as one of its many compromises, ITSELF required segregated housing projects (in the book he suggests that segregated public housing was more of a local phenomenon). He also overemphasizes the role of elected officials in Black neighborhoods who he says did not want integrated housing because it would have affected their political base. Does he mean to honestly suggest that the black desire to hold on to what limited political power it possessed during the Jim Crow 1930's is somehow to blame as much for segregated public housing in America as the actions of people such as Rep. Henry Steagall (the House sponsor of the bill) of Alabama? Schwartz's simple and direct discussion of racism in the FHA earlier in the book is better and more honest.Then there's the simple but honest critical question that Schwartz doesn't really tackle: at a time of record profits in the secondary mortgage market (discussed in pages 56-62), how is it that housing affordability problems continue to exist and in some cases even worsen in city after American city?On the plus side, the fair housing chapter (chapter 11) is excellent, as is the \\"stubborn facts of housing policy\\" section of the last chapter. Also, Schwartz's summary of HUD's programs for the homeless and disabled is one of the most concise I have read.In the end my nitpicks do not detract from the fact that Schwartz has written the most accessible and comprehensive introductory text on American housing policy out there. By explaining the often byzantine laws and rules governing housing finance, he has performed a much-needed public service. And by clarifying why housing matters (and will continue to matter) in the way that he does, he is positively contributing to a growing and much needed debate."},{"Title":"Housing Policy In The United States: An Introduction","review":"Professor Schwartz has written simply the most complete book on public housing available today.

I wonder if Fyfield's focus on violence toward women is not something along the same lines. P.D. James and Ruth Rendell have both had very good things to say about Ms. Fyfield but I do not think you can praise her writing sufficiently. She is a lawyer's writer, a mystery-lover's novelist, a Booker Prize-type author and I think her work is as good as it gets. And when someone gets thrown off a balcony in Staring at the Light, I was as shocked as if I had witnessed the event myself. Or it had been me. I hardly ever have exactly that kind of experience when reading. The unabridged audiotape of Staring at the Light is a special sort of experience as well.

He is one of the few musicians who can take an assortment of horns, whistles, bells and pistols and blend them with a band to make memorable music. The book tells of his life from his birth in Long Beach, CA, his childhood in the Imperial Valley (on the border between the USA and Mexico)and how a short scrawny kid with big ideas used his skills and smarts to become a top drummer in Southern California. Spike then started a series of bands to make money, which led to the City Slickers which he formed with fellow musician Del Porter. They specialized in what was known as \\"Country Corn,\\" with unusual musical sound effects. Now there were band before the City Slickers that did this kind of music (in fact, one, The Hoosier Hotshots, outlasted the City Slickers, but were never as big) but the City Slickers were the biggest act of this sort. Spike gathered together the best jazz musicians he could find and mold them into a band that could deliver funny music on cue. Their first big hit, \\"The Fuhrer's Face,\\" came from a Disney cartoon about Donald Duck dreaming that he lived in Nazi Germany and was forced to make ammunition for the war effort. Spike had said that Disney himself gave the band the sheet music after hearing Jones play on many Disney studio sessions as a drummer. Now the lyrics are sung mostly straight, but a rubber duck call played at the right moments make clear that Hitler is being mocked. An even bigger hit, \\"Cocktails For Two,\\" starts out sweetly (like young Spike's idol Fred Waring would have done) but descends quickly into a hilarious jumble of cheers, gunshots, car horns, and other strange sound effects between the lyrics. This style of musical humor made the City Slickers a popular act and they toured the country putting on shows. Spike Jones was a good businessman as well as musician and spent much time promoting the band and lining up appearances. For that Spike expected to take in the lion's share of the profits (but he paid the musicians what he thought they were worth). Such behavior didn't sit too well with Del Porter, who felt he was an equal partner with Spike. So, one day he asked Spike about his share of the profits, only to be told that since Spike had lined up the engagements, paid the musicians and made arrangements with Victor records, that Spike got most of the profits. Besides, if Del was an equal partner, where was it in writing? Del got the hint and was quiet after that. But later he left the band. The City Slickers worked hard day after day and compensated by drinking hard after shows. One of their songs, \\"Clink, Clink, Another Drink,\\" could be emblematic of those days. The drinking continued until 1946 when Spike stopped drinking and urged the band to stop, too. Those who would not or could not either quit or were fired, leading to a whole new crew. Among them was George Rock, a trumpeter who could imitate a small boy. He became famous for \\"All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth.\\" Another was Winstead \\"Doodles\\" Weaver, who was known for his comedy patter in \\"William Tell Overture,Dance of the Hours, and Man on the Flying Trapeze.\\" (Incidentally, he was the brother of Sylvester \\"Pat\\" Weaver, who later became head of NBC and the uncle of actress Sigourney Weaver.) Spike and the Slickers were well known on radio and tried their hand in TV. After that was over, the band went back to touring, eventually making a number of trips to Reno and Lake Tahoe. But then Spike's health began to fail, by the late 1950s Spike had developed emphysema after a lifetime of smoking and required oxygen when he was not performing. Eventually the band broke up by 1961, but Spike kept touring with other acts until 1965, when he became to weak to perform. On May 1, 1965 Spike Jones died in his sleep. He had inspired many performers including Frank Zappa, George Carlin and \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic."},{"Title":"Spike Jones Off the Record : The Man Who Murdered Music","review":"This is a very thorough, well documented and well written biography of Spike Jones.

Young returns to a subject he originally covered in the 1984 &quot;Spike Jones and His City Slickers&quot;, in a somewhat expanded format. His revised version is far and away the definitive work on an incredibly complex entertainer. Jones comes across in the work as a man for whom show-business was truly a business, and a ruthless one at that.

I wouldn't reccommend it for a stand-alone reference work, as it documents single events, not long-term causes. Also, because of its format, it's not good for in-depth studies. However, it excels in what it aims to do. Additionally, it has some interesting charts in the back (who knew that there are currently 8 Baptist organizations!), though I doubt that most people will find these very useful. A slight warning: the book places the dates of the New Testament books later than many conservative scholars would estimate, though it notes the uncertanity (ex: Jude is placed at 105 a.d.). Still, a helpful reference!"},{"Title":"Timeline Charts of the Western Church","review":"I have been a little disappointed with this series after ordering several of them to help study for a comprehensive final for my theology degree.

This text however, is one, large chart, or actually 3 on different scales (one single page timeline, one 5 pager and one that's 226 pages); which really helps develop a mental map of historical events and thought. It lists people, events, and movements of note in a large chronological grid. While this may not be particularly helpful for understanding connections between movements or individuals (though the 19 denominational flow charts in the end help), it is a fantastic organizational framework for developing a historical theology."},{"Title":"Timeline Charts of the Western Church","review":"While this is a work of great volume, detail and overall is an excellent timeline, I am disappointed that the editors at Zondervan did not look more closely at the author's content. Suprising for an \\"evangelical\\" publisher like Zondervan, this work generally assumes the critical theories of the 19th & 20th centuries as \\"fact\\" when it comes to the dating and authorship of much of the New Testament canon.For example on p. 16 she writes (under the year 65 AD): \\"The Pastoral Epistles - the Epistles to Timothy and Titus -- are written. (Their dating, not to mention their authorship, is a point of substantial controversy. Estimates range from 65 to 110).\\" It gets worse!On p. 17, she writes (under the year 70): \\"Disciples of the apostle Paul write Colossians and Ephesians. (Possibly as late as 90) Some scholars suggest Colossians is written by Paul around the time of Philemon.\\" Notice here that the authorship by Paul (in her mind) is ruled out right away, and \\"oh by the way\\", some people actually think Paul might have written Colossians - can you believe it?.One more that I've noticed, p. 18 (under the year 100): \\"1 Peter is written. (ca.)\\". This clearly shows that she does not believe Peter is the author, since his death is listed as being in 64 or 68 on her charts. She apparently doesn't believe he wrote 2nd Peter either, since 2nd Peter is listed (with 1st, 2nd and 3rd John) as being completed in 110 AD, thus in one listing ruling out Peter and John as the authors of the books that claim their authorship.The author is much better once she gets into the rest of the timelines of the Western Church, but I have serious problems recommending this resource to anyone who believes that the Scriptures were actually written by who they say they are written by!An excellent scholarly counter to these types of claims of pseudonymity (writings claiming to be written by one person that were actually written by another)is the excellent \\"An Introduction to the New Testament\\" by D.A. Carson, Douglas J. Moo, and Leon Morris (all 1st rate New Testament scholars by the way!)and also published by Zondervan! They go into detail in the case of all NT books that critics claim are pseudopigraphic. Here are a few of their findings:\\"One noteworthy fact among the Jews and the Christians is the rarity of pseudepigraphic letters. Writers might claim great names as having been responsible for other kinds of literature, but only two pseudonymous letters have come down to us from Jewish sources....A false claim to writing a letter would probably be easier to detect than, say, a false claim to writing an apocalypse. Whatever the reason, pseudepigraphic letters among the Jews are extremely rare.\\" (P.367).\\"The difficulty is not the idea of pseudonymity but the lack of evidence that the New Testament Christians gave any countenance to the idea. Nowhere is evidence cited that any member of the New Testament church accepted the idea that a pious believer could write something in the name of an apostle and expect the writing to be welcomed. The contrary, as we have seen, is often maintained.\\" (p.370).\\"There appears to be no example of anyone in the early church accepting a book as truly canonical while denying that it was written by the author whose name it bears.\\" (p. 371).So, to sum up. You can use this for your post-apostolic history, but be very wary about the dating of the writing of the books of the NT canon. Look for a reliable conservative source instead."},{"Title":"Timeline Charts of the Western Church","review":"Susan Peterson's work offers a bold, yet beneficial perspective on the history of the Western Church.

I have steadily gained knowledge of the history of the state and region. Recently I read August Derleth's historical novels, Bright Journey and The House on the Mound, which deal with the life of Hercules Dousman from his youth in Michmilimackinac in the early 1800's to his death in Prairie du Chien, WI, in 1868. I am delighted that this book, A Gathering of Rivers,adds greatly to my understanding of the peoples of this historical era.The first chapter, Native American Village Economies and the Fur Trade in the Mid-Eighteenth Century, offers a precise picture of the sociology of Indian groups and the interaction between the Indians and the French traders. The second chapter, Creole Communities, provides detail about the extensive social interaction between the Indians and traders. Murphy says Creole is \\"An adjective used to describe the distinctive culture created in the Midwest by the blending of American Indian and European elements. Usually, this culture was strongest in fur trade communities where biracial families lived.\\" Murphy gives specific interesting stories of some of the persons in these marriages.Chapter three, The Expansion of Native American Lead Mining,informed me greatly about the extensive knowledge of the Indians about the mining. Note: the women were the miners! Chapter four, The Lead Rush, tells the story of the arrival of the Whites into the area, and of the interaction of the Indians and Whites.Chapter five, Indian Economic Development, Settlers, and the Erosion of Accomodation, ends the saga. Murphy says \\"Accomodatoin between Indians and Creoles had been based on economic specialization and interdependence, on cultural syncretism, on personal relationships that were most often cemented with marriages and on mutual understanding and communication. Both the fur trade and early commercial lead mining had followed this pattern. But specialization, interdependence, cross-cultural relationships, and communication declined as Anglos took over the lead mines. Conflict rather than cooperation was the result.\\"A Gathering of Waters is a book with detail, but it moves along readily and is fun to read. Personalities come alive.In her Introduction, Murphy notes other books covering social interaction between natives and new arrivals. I checked Amazon to learn more about these books. Richard White's The Middle Ground: Indians, Empires, and Republics in the Great Lakes Region, 1650-1815, is the one I will seek out first. Murphy notes that her book is outside White's focus, as hers permits in-depth scrutiny of the Fox-Wisconsin waterways region from Green Bay to Prairie du Chien.On Wisconsin!"},{"Title":"A Gathering of Rivers: Indians, Metis, and Mining in the Western Great Lakes, 1737-1832","review":"A DISSERTATIONA Gathering of Rivers lacks a preface, so the reader is not told the author's purpose, motivation, orientation, and background etc. in writing the book--albeit some of that appears in the \\"Introduction\\" (albeit oddly worded as though this is a chemical experiment). That, the organization, stylistic features, and even the vocabulary (e.g., use to the terms \\"moiety\\", \\"syncretic\\", \\"exogamy\\", and \\"usufruct rights\\" {not a typo}) strongly suggests that this was a doctoral dissertation. That is confirmed in the \\"Acknowledgments\\".AN EXCEPTIONAL DISSERTATIONFor an academic dissertation, \\"A Gathering of Rivers\\" reads remarkably clearly and smoothly. From my point of view (a historian), the text dwells on minute sociological details obsessively, to the exclusion (or at least absence) of pertinent historical details. For example, unless I missed it, nowhere does Murphy address the question of (the date of) the earliest lead smelting by Natives.\\"A Gathering of Rivers\\" contains ONLY 52 pages of footnotes. No, I'm not joking, the footnotes of recently-written academic histories are frequently longer than the corresponding text. NOR is \\"A Gathering of Rivers\\" a typical dreary narrow-minded rigidly politically-correct revisionist history as is the preponderance of recent academic histories, especially those written by women (in Women's Studies programs). Instead, Murphy applies well-rounded common-sense, acute insightfulness, and a deep and broad sense of perspective in unearthing and interpreting the historical record.IN COMPARISON TO ...Most \\"modern\\" histories of the area (mostly SW Wisconsin), are rehashes of the \\"white American\\" histories written in the 1800 (as early as 1832) which virtually ignore any events prior to ~1825--particularly the Native American culture, and the French-era and British-era. \\"A Gathering of Rivers\\" brings forth a surprise amount of previously obscure information and insights on the subject.INCONSISTENCES AND SHORTCOMINGSMurphy often quotes conflicting information from different sources in adjacent paragraphs, without pointing out the contradictions, much less attempting to resolve the apparent conflicts.Several internal inconsistences are troubling. For example, in several places Murphy states that after about 1780-1790, Native mining intensified, became a year-round occupation, and by 1820 was the principal occupation, especially of the Wisconsin Fox. Indeed this is stated as a significant finding of her study. But later, she states that the Wisconsin Fox continued their seasonal migrations, including, mining for a few weeks at mid-summer until 1832.Although a major thesis appears to be that Julien Dubuque's estate was a wheat farm and trading post, Murphy makes no attempt to explain what the function of his warehouse at Prairie du Chien had in his enterprises (and contained 733pds of lead musket balls) 30 years after he moved to the future Dubuque, IA. Murphy repeatedly (and unnecessarily) asserts that the estate was primarily a wheat farm and trading post so many times that, \\"Methinks the lady doth protest too much\\". What doubts or counter-evidence is she concealing?Yet another assertion presented as a significant finding is that the lead trade expanded the options of the Native miners. Again, this assertion is unnecessarily repeated over and over. And while probably demonstrably true in the 1700s, one wonders whether it was truly so liberating when it became their principal occupation in the early 1800s and brought them into conflict with the Whites?Early in the dissertation Murphy makes a point of her consistent use of names for the major tribes (the Fox, Sauk, and Winnebago). But then she uses both \\"Fox\\" and \\"Mesquakie\\", which refer to the same tribe, often in the same paragraph. If you don't remember that Fox = Mesquakie, in some paragraphs it sounds like she is comparing two different tribes.While \\"Creole\\" may, strictly speaking, be the anthropological proper term for a mixed-Euro-Native American culture, Murphy does not intend the meaning to be \\"French-Black\\" as most readers are likely to understand the term. Similarly while, \\"race\\" was formerly used synonymously with \\"ethnicity\\", \\"culture\\" or even \\"nationality\\", I don't think of individuals of mixed Euro-Native ancestry (like myself) as being \\"multiracial\\"--a term Murphy uses frequently.Although Murphy does an excellent job of analysis of the cultural conflicts, opportunities for accommodation, failures of accommodation etc., she doesn't quite reach the simple principle that when two unyeilding cultures collide, only the stronger survives; period, end-of-story. The only way the weaker group physically survives is by voluntary assimilation. If a group voluntarily assimilates into the dominant culture, they can preserve the most precious aspects of their identity. Indeed, the vast majority of Native Americans chose assimilation. There is far more Native American blood in \\"White\\" America, than on the reservations. Anywhere in the rural South or West, a high percentage of locally-born individuals have one, or several, Natives in their grandparent's generation, and a surprising number consider themselves to primarily be of Native heritage. That's the major reason what the vast majority of Americans revere Native Americans culture and traditions, and name our States, cities, highways, and baseball teams Native names, even use Native symbols for State flags and emblems. Many of us \\"assimilated Natives\\" resent the high-handed political demagoging of many \\"reservation Indians\\" who insist that ONLY THEY have any right to Native culture. It is ours too. It belongs to all Americans.The major problem for most Native Americans, was that a fairly few people occupied vast territories which they could not defend even from each other---even though they were at constaint war with other tribes over their territories. If the Fox and Sauk had not been evicted by Whites, they would have been displaced within a few decades by someone else--probably the Sioux.There is no way a few hundred Natives could compete with tens of thousands of settlers most of whom who wanted only a cabin and a few acres for a farm (an insignificant portion of a vast unoccupied wilderness, in their view), or with men driven by dreams of enormous wealth in the case of the lead and gold rushes. There was nothing noble or superior to the \\"Indian Way\\" (appropriate for a few 100,000s of people occuppying a continent), nor was it in anyway inferior to the \\"White Way\\" (adapted to densely populated Europe)---it was merely different, and equally rigid and uncompromising."},{"Title":"Self Mutilation","review":"I'm not a big reader, but when I picked up this book I couldn't put it down.

To make any of the airplanes in the book fly, Mr. Nakamura needs to have a few lessons in engineering and avionics because many of the models in the book do not fly.

In this book (and in the later ones), McCaffrey begins to compromise both, turning the harsh world of Pern into a positively friendly and hospitable place, and the strong and heroic character of Lessa into someone weak and self-serving.I don't want to give the plot away, but Lessa asks F'nor to do something in this book that in the first book she would have just done herself. Instead of boldly taking matters into her own hands she manipulates someone else into taking the risks. I didn't believe for a minute that she would really do this. The only reason for it was for McCaffrey to allow F'nor a bigger role in the book. Also note that in the introduction she describes F'nor's role in the first book &quot;Dragonflight,&quot; as being far more central than he really was to that story. It was Lessa and F'lar's story. And the fire lizard plot is the first sign that McCaffrey is bent on transforming the wonderful heroine of &quot;Dragonflight&quot; into a shrill *****, a transformation that continues in &quot;The White Dragon&quot; and later books.McCaffrey doesn't seem to care about he intergrity of her characters. She is perfectly willing to be inconsistent in her characterization for the sake of plot contrivances. The capper for me was at the end of &quot;All the Weyrs of Pern,&quot; when F'lar and Jaxom manipulated Lessa into staying home on Pern while they went to outer space. That was the last book of hers I read. So much for strong female characters! &quot;Dragonquest&quot; was the book that started the decline. I didn't care for all the focus on Kylara, a superficial and boring character. McCaffrey had a great thing with the first book in her series.

There's just a large space where an entire line should be. In some places it's barely intelligible. I kept wondering what some of these strange words were, I like to think I have a pretty decent vocabulary but when the kindle's dictionary has no idea what a word is, I can guess it's a typo (I had to assume \\"acerbating\\" was \\"exacerbating\\").I mean really, come on.

Friends have told me to stick it out through this trilogy, because the second one (the Harper Hall trilogy) is really worth it. I enjoyed the first bookDragonflight (Dragonriders of Pern), but didn't love it - I loved the dragons and plot, but didn't enjoy the characters much, and thought they were thinly drawn.I think that has started to improve in this 2nd book, and the characters are a bit more developed and rich. I think the woman characters are still a bit stereotyped, and Pern is a very patriarchal world (although there are some strong woman leaders, but they are the exception rather than the rule.) The dragons and dragonlore continues to be the strength of these books, and the complex plot involving Pern and it's ancient threat, thread.In this book conflict arises between the 'oldtimers', brought forward in time from the last book to help fight thread, and the current-time residents of Pern, most particularly F'rar, leader of the main dragonrider 'weyr' or community. From a socio-political perspective, the complexity feels real, although some of the characters are still pretty thin. There is a lot of struggle between old and new ways, and new discoveries are made of things left behind by Pern's ancestors. There are a lot more characters involved in the plot than in the first book, and a lot more interpersonal drama. Overall, I think it's an enjoyable and engaging read, although it still doesn't quite rise to 5-stars yet for me.

Lessa's desperate efforts to save her planet have solved the short term problem. The Oldtimer dragons and riders have come forward to save the planet from the ravages of Thread but their entry into modern day Pernese society has caused problems of a different sort. F'Lar, as the only present day Weyr Leader is in the unenviable position of mediating between the two faction. His wife, Lessa has problems of her own. When she left her family's Hold in the hands of the infant Jaxom she did not realize how torn the decision would leave her but what choice did she have? It would not be possible to be both a Dragonrider and a Lord Holder would it? Young Jaxom was doing well under the diligent care of his guardian and would someday make an excellent Lord Holder, regardless of what his own inclinations might be. Meanwhile there was Thread to fight, and an ever growing population straining Pernese society to its limits.This is the second book in the series. Those new to these stories should begin at the beginning (DRAGONFLIGHT).

The Oldtimers come from a much more hidebound, traditional era when Thread had been an omnipresent threat and dragonriders had commanded unquestioning respect. In the current era, an absence of Threadfall for 400 years had allowed more land to be cultivated (which must now be protected from Thread), the population to expand, and customs to change. The demands of the Oldtimers now seem unreasonable and their attitude, overbearing and obnoxious. They are out of sync with current thought and customs, and not cooperative with Benden, the only weyr that had continued to be occupied during the long Interval between Threadfalls. F'lar must find a way to smooth over the conflicts between the Oldtimers, Benden, and the current Holders and Crafters of Pern, while obtaining the cooperation needed to effectively fight Thread.Meanwhile, the accidental find of a sealed room full of artifacts from the long-distant founders of Pern yields a \\"distance viewer\\" that reveals that the so-called \\"Red Star\\", the source of Thread, is actually a small planet with an erratic orbit that periodically brings it close to Pern. Once the Lords Holder see this planet, they begin demanding that the dragonriders go there and destroy Thread at its source. But, of course, they are all unaware of the dangers of any space flight, let alone one to such a hostile planet. Will F'lar, or his half brother, F'mor, yield to the Holders' pressure? And if they do, will the rider who makes the trip survive?This is an excellent and exciting sequel to the first book in the series."},{"Title":"Dragonquest (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Almost everyone knows about Pern, even those who aren't generally interested in fantasy or science fiction novels. I'm surprised that no one has tried to take this series and make it into a movie. At the very least, a Sci-Fi channel original series or an anime treatment of it is due. I've included this as part of the classics because I believe that McCaffrey's ability to create a world and tell a story with lots of layers of conflict is far above and beyond that of most fantasy and science fiction writers. She doesn't just rely on the fantasy and tension of the storyline as a crutch, but creates realistic characters who are fighting real battles, whether that be against the threads, other people, or even time itself. She's also so intricately created the politics of Pern that it seems like a real place. A quick warning, though, there are elements of sexuality and murder throughout the text, so it may skew a little higher in age. I recommend this book to readers 14+.-Lindsey Miller, lindseyslibrary"},{"Title":"Dragonquest (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Dragonquest begins seven Turns after Dragonflight and the reader is immediately plunged back into the complex world of Pern. F'lar and Lessa are still Weyrleaders at Benden and are struggling to unite all of Pern to fight the deadly Thread. It is true that the 5 weyrs who jumped through time to come forward to aid Benden were there in Pern's time of need, but they are set in their ways and not willing to change. F'lar has heard too many complaints from Holds and Crafthalls under the protection of the Oldtimers' Weyrs to disregard them any longer. When the Weyrleaders even go so far as to keep other Weyrs uninformed of irregular Threadfall, F'lar has no choice but to take action. He immediately starts looking for alternative ways of fighting Thread and easing relations between the dragonmen and the rest of the Pernese, but it is an uphill battle all the way. Meantime, there are other problems brewing inside the Weyrs themselves. Kylara, Weyrwoman of the Southern Weyr, has caused much dissent and no end of headaches for the Weryleaders. Brekke, a new queen, is desperately afraid of what will happen when her queen rises to mate. F'nor is trying to support his half-brother F'lar in all of his endeavors, but he has many problems of his own. Outside of the Werys, the Lord Holders cannot understand why the dragonmen simply do not go to the Red Star and kill the Thread there, before it falls on Pern. Emotions are running high and F'lar and Lessa have their hands full trying to keep everything tied together, but will they be able to unite Pern?This is the second book in The Dragonriders of Pern book and is just as good as the first one in the series. I felt that this book was a little more complex than the first because the author could spend more time on intertwining people's lives since the reader is more familiar with the world of Pern. This will make it a little more difficult for those who have not read Dragonflight, however. I simply love Anne McCaffrey's characters so it is wonderful to have a series where you get to see the characters grow and change.

I have to agree with that, because in my opinion, this is the book that sets the standard the later books are failing to live up to.There's so much going on in this book--from the conflicts with the Oldtimers that show how much Pern changed in its long Interval, to the rediscovery of the fire lizards and the re-colonization of the Southern Continent, the ascendancy of Benden Weyr as the primary power on Pern, and the question of whether Thread can be destroyed on Red Star--and there's a huge cast of characters from both Weyr and Hold, along with an in-depth visualization of the world of Pern and its culture and traditions, both past and present.Yet all this is focused through a core cast of well-defined characters whose personal stories are not neglected. There's room among all that world-changing for a tender love story, personal courage, and success against all odds. And the dragons--gotta have dragons! :)The plot is conveyed with not only a cohesiveness, but an immediacy missing from the later books.

Reading All The Weyrs of Pern--itself one of the best of the later books--is like reading a report about what the characters did next instead of being there. In Dragonquest, there's no question that the main characters are the movers and shakers of this planet, and that what they do will change their world--and that I care what those changes will be.I highly recommend Dragonquest, in fact all of the Dragonriders trilogy.

This book is packed with great scenes: the duel of the Weyrleaders, the battle of the queen dragons, the discovery of fire lizards and that barely touches the surface of this dramatic book, packed with action and romance.Nothing less than the future of Pern is at stake. Although the Oldtimers have come forward in time to fight Pern's ancient nemesis of Thread, they are stunned by the changes in Pern's society. With Thread, a ghastly kind of interstellar rain that kills everything it touches, falling out of pattern, the Oldtimers are essential to Pern's defense. However, the Oldtimers cling to outmoded traditions that allow no room for Pern's expansion. Only one man, Benden's Weyrleader F'lar sees what needs to be done to keep Pern united in this time of crisis.I would argue that this book is the one that truly launches the Drangonriders of Pern series, because here the idea is first proposed to free Pern from the menace of Thread by eliminating it at its source. In book after wonderful book, Anne McCaffrey explores Pern and serves up wonderful stories of a society moving from a Dark Age to forging a future based on true knowledge of the past. Many of the characters who make it happen are in this book.Anne McCaffrey's dragon books ring true because of how she envisions the human/dragon bonding. Her concept of this has proved hugely inspirational to the generation of fantasy writers who followed her. From Paolini's Eragon to Novik's Temeraire series, writers have created other worlds where humans Impress dragons at hatching in stories that soar to new heights. This book is the \\"grandmother\\" of them all. Absolutely not to be missed."},{"Title":"Dragonquest (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"This book is even better than Dragonflight. Easily, as a matter of fact. And that's no small feat at all!In this book, we get to see, well, Pern. :-) We get to know better the people who make Pern works, though the book is still mostly focused on the dragonriders.The story is much more action packed than Dragonflight, and the characters are better developed too. How McCaffrey managed that, I don't know. :-)We get to see the dragonriders fight between themselves (politically, mostly), we learn how Halls and Holds work, we get to know some of the most important Lord Holders and Craftmasters.The book also sets in motion events that will eventually led to the erradication of thread, way down the line (in All the Weyrs of Pern).I loved this book, and can't put a single fault to it. While it might not be my favorite, it's definitely one of the best.My only complain is a timeline disagreement with Dragonsinger, but only consistency fanatics like me would even notice it. :-)"},{"Title":"Dragonquest (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"This is an audio book of a long time favorite of mine.

Reading the earlier volume first is probably a good idea - it sets up the characters and the situation on Pern to an extent that this book does not. Lessa, the heroine of volume one, is still present, but no longer a crucial player in this story. Much of the emphasis is on the rivalries between Weirs (homes of the Dragonmen) and the Holds (enclaves). At the same time, tensions are rising among the Dragon Riders themselves between the ultra-conservative Old-Timers (who were brought forward through time from the distant past in Volume 1) and their more modern and forward-thinking counterparts led by F'lar. A lot of pages were devoted to topics that didn't really go anywhere (the fire lizards, for example) but will likely be addressed further on in the series. This was a pleasant-enough entertainment, but didn't possess anything like the wonder and majesty of the original."},{"Title":"Dragonquest (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"This is the 2nd novel of Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern series.It is written so that it can be read not only in the series, but also stand alone.Our local library classifies these novels as \\"Science Fiction\\" and/or \\"Fantasy\\". I classify them as \\"Great Reading\\". Anne McCaffrey is one of the best authors I have read. Her other works are very good also.If you want to start with the first in the series, read \\"Dragonflight\\".After that \\"Dragonquest\\". Then \\"The White Dragon\\".Get all three!

All of The Dragonriders of Pern series are classics, I should think at least. This book focuses mostly on F'lar, but has a good deal to do with Lessa, the heroine of the previous book. And, that puts to mind the fact that this is not really, chronologically, the second book in the series."},{"Title":"Dragonquest (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"This second entry in the Pern series is yet another great attachment to my bookshelves. In this we are introduced to the fire lizards, flying lizards that can breathe fire/attach themselves to Pernesians just as the dragons do/annoyances in some cases, and we begin to see the downfall of the &quot;united&quot; feeling among Dragonriders. Greed and tradition take over for some of the oldtimers, and then things begin to heat up for a controling figure.Only one complaint... the names. At some times (like at 3am) its somewhat hard to differentiate F'lar and F'nor and such... but that complaint isn't worth taking away anything from the well deserved rating!"},{"Title":"Dragonquest (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Ok, 1 word, 3 sylkabblesFANTASTIC!For anyone who likes sci fi or fantasy, this book is a great read for u!!!! it is soooooooooooooo cool!!!!!

Wonderful reading for both men and women, no matter what their age !!!"},{"Title":"Dragonquest (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"&quot;Dragonflight&quot; was a grand adventure which introduced readers to one of sci-fi's strongest heroines, the indomitable Weyrwoman Lessa. &quot;Dragonquest&quot; continues the story 7 years after Lessa made her spectacular flight...and all is not well on Pern. &quot;Dragonquest&quot; is more a series of inter-related episodes than &quot;Dragonflight,&quot; but in this format the novel introduces new characters such as Jaxom and the Oldtimers, and really gives room for characters like F'lar, F'nor, Robinton, Kylara, and others, to become more fully-realized characters. Very exciting (is it just me or does F'lar get into a duel to the death in EVERY book?--not that I'm complaining!), insightful, and the world of Pern and it's inhabitants (yea! for the fire-lizards...gosh, are they cute!) becomes even more real than in the previous book. REALLY good stuff here."},{"Title":"Dragonquest (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I disagree with Daniel C. Sorbal. IMO Dragonflight is far, far better than Dragonquest. But Dragonquest is still very, very good! They are both very special books.This book does a great job of developing the Pern setting and some of the characters glimpsed briefly in Dragonflight. F'nor and Robinton both developed into great characters here and there was great further development of F'lar. Kylara was an interesting villainess. I was very disappointed not to see more of Lessa, who is still the most interesting character on Pern to me, but I ate up what I did see of her. I also liked Felessan and Jaxom (who becomes obnoxious in his own book) here. And I don't want to forget the dragons -- Mnementh remains my fave but I love Canth too! The rider-dragon relationships are a huge part of what makes the Pern books so special.What I loved in this book were the political dynamics of Hold vs. Weyr and between Weyrs, as well as within them. It is fascinating how, because of the dragons' courtship ritual, politics and personal relationships become intertwined, and social values become different.F'nor emerges as a romantic figure here, but I dislike Brekke &amp; find her overly passive and co-dependent on F'nor. I did not feel sad for her, since she had neglected her responsibility to Wirenth and Pern by pining for F'nor so many years instead of giving a bronze rider a chance. She also put F'nor in a hard position, and was childish: thousands of dragonriders had sacrificed personal preferences so that human beings like Brekke could live on Pern. If Brekke had matured and got stronger, as Menolly does in the Harper books, I might have liked her better.I thought the Wirenth / Prideth conflict was a convenient plot contrivance. I would have much rather seen the mating flight go through and found out what happened if F'nor failed, or if he succeeded. Either way, that would have been a great story! Felessan tells Jaxom that F'nor and F'lar had a major argument over this, so imagine F'lar's reaction if it had gone through. Esp. since it a F'nor / Brekke pairing would've been politically divisive, posibly fraying F'lar's alliance with the oldtimers, and certainly reflected badly on Benden Weyr. Not to mention the eggs could have been affected. I thought F'lar and F'nor's relationship here was perhaps the most interesting and central to the book, wonderfully done, so I wish there had been more conflict. I also would've liked to see Kylara try to follow thorugh on her plan in regards to F'lar. So I was sorry about the queens.The Oldtimers became stock villains and changed too much from Dragonflight and too obviously to create a story. I would have liked more shades of gray in their viewpoint, it must be so hard to move 400 years into the future. The Red Star plot also seemed contrived to me; F'lar's impulsive rush was out of character as were Lessa's actions. It put a sour note in F'lar and Lessa's relationship I did not care for.But I loved the other glimpses of F'lar and Lessa's relationship -- they are so romantic to me! One of my favorite couples ever, just perfect for each other. And I also found Robinton's unrequited longing for Lessa moving. Robinton is another great character here. The wedding scene was wonderful. But Perhaps the central character in the book is Pern itself, a fascinating, complex, panaoramic and well-realized world."},{"Title":"Dragonquest (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"If you're familiar with Pern, you've undoubtably read this book, or else you don't need to read a review to help you decide to read this one. If you haven't visited Pern, here's your chance! This is the second book in the series. It's helpful to have read Dragonflight, but not essential. All but two of the books (Dragonsong and Dragonsinger)are standalones.This book starts seven years after Dragonflight. Lessa's attempt to bring almost 2000 dragons and their riders forward in time to defend the people of Pern from the Thread that falls from the sky, devouring everything organic it touches has been successful...Despite a real thread - I mean threat -- to every living thing on Pern, people manuver for political power, often running over whoever is in their way. F'lar (hero of the first book) ignores stories of abuses of power until his brother is assaulted when he gets in the way of an &quot;oldtimer&quot; dragonrider who is trying to extort goods from a smith.To make matters worse, Thread, which has been perfectly predictable for the last seven yearsm has started deviating from its set pattern, making it even more dangerous.F'lar hatches a plan to go to the source of Thread (the Red Star) and destroy it there...McCaffrey's characters are believable and likable. In Pern, she has created a world so complete, that you feel if you could go there, you would know who the people were, recognize the colors of the various Holds, Weyrs and Halls, know what food you were being served. Not only is this book a great read, it's a must for any aspiring writer who wants to create worlds of his/her own."},{"Title":"Dragonquest (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"While the first Dragonriders of Pern book (Dragonflight) was fun, it was also somewhat predictable. I had the solution to the problem long before it was introduced by Anne McCaffrey. In Dragonquest, there was no such deus ex machina plot device to figure out. The book is largely a complex character study, during which we are introduced to myriad Lords of Holds, Dragonflight Leaders, Masters of Craft Guilds, and several other interesting characters. McCaffrey really put herself to the test in creating unique characters both in cooperation and conflict. She also introduced new fauna, with her Fire Lizards a surprising element both for their \\"cool factor\\" and for the ultimate impact on the story.She wasn't afraid to put some of her characters into difficult and tragic situations. In a lesser author's hands this might put off some readers. McCaffrey brought it off with great skill. She even left a very interesting story arc in play for the next book, without leaving a cliff hanger to make readers want to continue the series. Her heroes aren't perfect, in fact at times they are very flawed. I think that is one reason they come to life so vividly and become so well known to the reader.Although I had somehow avoided reading this series for some decades now, I finally decided a few weeks ago that I should give it a try. That turned out to be a very good decision.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dragonquest (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Dragonquest is one of the three great books I read. I enjoyed these books and I always like to read the book over again. In this book Thread starts to fall in unpredictable patterns due to the orbit of the Red Star. F'nor is injured in a fight where he is placed in the expert care of Brekke. F'nor goes to a cove in southern and finds a fire-lizard clutch. Brekke and F'nor both impressed fire-lizards while wild wherries killed most of them. F'nor impressed a gold lizard and Brekke impressed a bronze. The reason why I liked this series is the dialog and the detail is great. I recommend for everyone to read this book and series."},{"Title":"Dragonquest (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"This book was very good. Some people who reviwed it objected to how some character's roles were dimished. This is true, but absolutely neccesary in order to keep the plot pool from stagnating. F'nor's role was enlarged for us to get a closer look at him. He was not very deep in Dragonflight, but only because we didn't know him. I hope to see more about N'ton; he is my favorite besides Moreta. I don't see how anyone can say that McCaffrey doesn't write good female roles. THE two most famous dragonriders of all time are female; Moreta and Torene. Lessa saved Pern through her intellect and ingenuity; how can she be accused of being a bitch? I eagerly await the coming of more dragonrider books."},{"Title":"Dragonquest (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"DragonQuest There are not many excellent books in the world, especially in the science fiction/fantasy area. But, in my opinion, DragonQuest by Anne McAffrey is as close to one of those books as you can get. Set in the colonized world of Pern, DragonQuest takes you on an unforgettable ride into politics, adventure, and heroism. Pern is a fantastic land governed by three different groups of people: the lord holders, the craft masters, and the dragonmen. As in the real world, the politics of this world are harsh, as all three groups disfavor each other but need each other for survival. The lords govern the lands, the masters produce food and equipment, and the dragonmen protect Pern. Pern is threatened by an astral substance known as Thread. This Thread eats organic material to pieces. In order to keep Pern safe, the dragonmen breed dragons which destroy Thread. This is their role in life. Everything in Pern is peaceful until Thread falls out of rhythm, politics crumble, and fire lizards are introduced. Things start to heat up in Pern, and F'lar, undecided leader of Pern, is having trouble keeping things intact. Soon Pern is in trouble. This book provides marvelous detail, and I began to feel as if I was part of Pern. The book is incredibly vivid and very realistic. The story was also top-notch, keeping me guessing all of the time. The story was a little shy on action however, but that's okay, as it's made up for in detail. Overall I would say this book would be fun to read for anyone who is imaginative, likes science fiction, or isn't afraid to dream. DragonQuest will be a favorite of mine for years to come."},{"Title":"Dragonquest (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"The multitude of typos in the Kindle edition is extremely annoying. If I wasn't already familiar with the book, and re-reading it, I might not be so willing to keep reading. Four stars for Dragonquest, negative stars for whomever botched the Kindle edition."},{"Title":"Dragonquest (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"&quot;How to begin?&quot; mused Robimton, the Masterharper of Pern. How to begin this most dazzling and wonderfully imaginative and well written novel done by the much apraised author, Anne McCaffery? Well, how about we add some new and exciting characters (and not to mention the adorable 'miniture' dragons, fire-lizards.) But of course the story wouldn't be nearly as complete without F'lar, the Weyrleader, and Lessa, the Weyrwoman, and don't forget the never-ending thread. Oh, and of course F'lar can't resist but get into another life and death threatning duel.Their are a lot of suprises in here that you don't want to miss! It's definetly as good as The first book in the trilogy, Dragonflight. I still can't decide which one I enjoyed more. No questions asked, you have to check this book out! You'll find yourself staying up at night under your blankets with your flashlight on all night long waiting to see what happens next. So make sure you have plenty of batteries in your flashlight because this will keep you up all night. I reccomend reading the first book in this series, Dragonflight, before this one so you have a better understanding of this book.

Lessa, F'lar, F'nor, and the others have returned to continue in their endless quest to guard Pern from the deadly Thread. This time, new, interesting characters are introduced, and many surprising events occur. Dragonquest also brings the return of the legendary firelizards, 'miniature dragons' that the dragons of Pern were supposedly evolved from. The firelizards lead our Pernese friends on even more adventures that are thrilling, romantic, and suspenseful.As I said, I did not give this book a five for a good reason. The ending of Dragonquest leaves much suspense, taking it a point down, but gives you an excellent reason to read the next book, The White Dragon."},{"Title":"Dragonquest (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"While most complain that Dragonquest is McCaffrey's attempt to diminish Lessa's role, they do not realize that the Dragonriders series does not focus on Lessa, but the world of Pern. It is simply bringing to light characters that were only minor in Dragonflight.This book is more detailed than Dragonflight and has fewer inconsistencies as the model of Pern is finalized. Character development is advanced, also. Lessa and F'lar tended to be one-dimensional in Dragonflight but here they are not the focused characters and F'nor, Flar's half brother, and some others are brought forward. Particularly engaging is the focus on Kylara and Brekke and the expansion into the South. Although not recommended before Dragonflight, it is a much more concrete and interesting novel. The storyline is improved and continued with The White Dragon and onward."},{"Title":"Dragonquest (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Dragonquest is an excellent book, but since it is part of a series, the plot is not totally complete. This book can be really confusing at first if you haven't read the book before this one in the series. The story is very unique. There are people on the planet of Pern. Adeadly tread rains down on the planet for long periods of time. Dragons are raised to battle the thread. When not repelling thread, the dragon riders are trying to get rid of for ever. They constuct several plans to do this. They plan to attack the red star, raise fire lizzards, and even rely on grubs. I'll recommend this book to any one. Everything in ths book is original. It contains a fresh perspective.

Awesome man!"},{"Title":"Dragonquest (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"The plot kept me reading all day long, because of so many conflicts and concerns warring between all folks, including the dragonriders. I felt as if I was a part of the whole story, seeing what affect all people of Pern, how history is linked, and how the discovery of unfound things that will lead to further exploration of the Red Star. I was happy to see Lessa and F'lar again, but they became smaller parts in the whole tapestry of conflicts and events. Some things that happened in the book touched me, like the deaths of 2 dragon queens. It was like a glimpse into a world without high technology and the high expectations from the dragonriders. Without conflict except for Thread, there is not much to know about the Pernese. F'lar did a great job of holding all people and lands together working towards a goal of Thread-free existence or at least know more about Thread's source."},{"Title":"Dragonquest (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"This is on of the BEST sci-fi books I have ever read! It is very easy to relate to the characters. You almost feel like you are the only one who beleives F'lar when he warns that the deadly Threads will once again rain upon the fertile lands of Pern. Come with the heroic Dragonriders as they try to save their home."},{"Title":"Dragonquest (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I enjoyed this book as much as Dragonflight. I thought Dragonquest elaborated more on the people of Pern, not just the dragonriders. This book was more F'nor's story. Dragonflight was F'lar and Lessa's story. But Dragonquest still had the same charm as the first book. It also pulled you into the story. At times I actually felt I was a dragonrider! I would definetly recommend this book if you are a Pern fan."},{"Title":"Dragonquest (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Dragonquest is an excellent book because it kept me on the edge of my chair from cover to cover.

I won't go into the details of the plot here, however, since I'm sure the reader can find those elsewhere with ease.What I will say, however, is that Card has found what it is that keeps these stories alive for so long. It is not the adventure that brings us back, or the tales of magic and wizardry.It is love. From start to finish, this is a love story and nothing else, though it may not seem that way at first. This novel demonstrates that love, no matter what age it is in, endures, and will find a way for itself.Enchantment also makes the reader realize not that fairy tales do happen, but that there is no difference between fairy tales and what we obstinately call reality.From cover to cover, Enchantment tells the reader that life really is one big story, a fairy tale that never ends."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"That's right. Hate 'em. But this book was so ingenious, so original, so endearing... sigh... I read the love bits three times. That's right. And I'm not ashamed, either!The other top reviews on this page are on the money--the book really does a great job of taking an old fairy tale, Sleeping Beauty, putting it into a modern context, and really making it work by making the characters very believable, and endearing. Two people, seperated by time and culture come together to right the wrongs of the evil Baba Yaba--the witch of Russian folklore that has little Russian kids quivering under their coverlets every night. Ivan, a linguist, falls through time via a spell, practically landing on top of a \\"sleeping beauty\\", and helps her free her people from the witch's horrible influence. It's a fluid book, delightful at every turn, and will leave you feeling satisfied as if you've a belly full of Thanksgiving dinner.This isn't Card's most philisophical work--I got the distinct feeling that he had a great deal of fun putting it together, and if you're looking for a serious read, this isn't it. But if you're a closet romantic and really hate romance books, then this is for you. With Card on the cover, who's gonna know?"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"As with all of Orson Scott Card's writing, the core of this riveting tale is the delicate and true nature of the human interactions. As in many (most?) of Card's books, his intelligent and beautifully drawn characters struggle to get past the surface norms and expectations of their cultures to understand each other as individuals.In other of Card's works, his protagonists struggle to bypass cultural misunderstanding between humans and alien species (Ender's series) or American pioneers and American Indians (Red Prophet series), etc. Here, the cultural divide that Card has chosen to illuminate is one of time.Here, a brilliant modern Russian scholar, studying ancient proto-Slavonic fairy tales, is sucked into reality as it was nearly 1000 years ago. The differences at all levels are explored and beautifully illuminated, in a wonderful love story/fairy tale that brings Sleeping Beauty truly to life.Card manages to make this unbelievable tale completely believable with his usual crystal clear writing, and fully developed, rich and lifelike characters. He also branches out into wildly funny bits of fairy tale interaction between the great old Russian witch Baba Yaga, and the Bear (ancient god of Russia). These fairy tale snippets hold the true tone of the old tales, while they integrate perfectly into the full story.This is an absolutely compulsive read; don't pick it up if you don't have the time to finish it!"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I don't think I've ever worked so long and hard to get through a fiction book. It's not that it was a bad storyline; in fact, towards the end it was really quite engrossing. But to start off with it was very convoluted and slow. There was a lot of mythology and history, which would have been interesting if you weren't also trying to keep track of the plot at the same time. And it's considered a juvenile book! After all was said and done it was worth it, though, because it was an interesting story. I just don't know - if this is indicative of all of his work - that I want to slog my way through another one of his books."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"As a young boy, Ivan stumbles across a strange clearing in the forest near his Uncle Marek's farm. In the middle of the clearing lies a beautiful young woman. However, before Ivan can get any closer, he is startled by something moving in the brush, and runs away. Years later, upon returing to the area to complete his dissertation, Ivan finds himself drawn back to that enchanted place, to see if it was not just a figment of his young mind. It isn't. The story that follows takes Ivan and the woman (a princess named Katerina) back to her time, a thousand years in the past. The only way to save Katerina's kingdom is for the two to marry, yet Ivan has a fiance back in America...in the 1990s. The story is nicely done in the fact that it is told from many people's viewpoints. However, sometimes the discussion of language left me utterly bored. The book has some parts that are difficult to wade thru, but you do want to stay till the end to see how everything works out and if ANYONE is who they claim they are"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"If you think that Card's quality has declined since Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead, then stay away from this book as well. Card's editors just don't demand enough from him. Enchantment feels unfinished and unedited, overly long with surprises popping out of nowhere. Characters are not up to Card's standards. It's also consciously gender-roled (only women have magic at all), and the end dodges all the cultural conflicts set up in the beginning for a suddenly smooth &quot;happily ever after.&quot;"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I fell in love with Card's books a few years ago when my English teacher forced us to read Ender's Game. I loathed science fiction and fantasy until I opened that book, and I've been hooked ever since. I ran across Enchantment at the library, and thought &quot;He couldn't possibly have made the story of sleeping beauty any less boring than it was when I was little.&quot; I checked it out anyway, and I'm glad I did. There are so many twists and turns in Enchantment. Every page has a new surprise. And, just as with the Ender saga, I found myself attached to the characters, praying for them as if my little hopes would change the words on the page...and crying when things went well for them or when they weren't so lucky. If my grandmother had told fairy tales like this, I would never have gone to sleep. I've read for two days, barely stopping to eat. I'm glad I'm finished and can return to reality, but I can't help but wish there was just one more page."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"OK, this book could be summed up in one line \\"Sleeping Beauty in Ukraine, a Modern Day Prince, Wicked fairy is played by Baba Yaga.\\" But that doesn't do justice to this book. In fact, it's not a \\"modern re-telling\\" at all (which are often Very Bad) although certainly Sleeping Beauty forms a (admitted) basis for the book.First- it is narrated by several of the characters- mainly \\"the Prince\\", the Princess and Baba Yaga. OSC does so seamlessly and very well. Next- it's almost all about what comes after that famous kiss, how does a modern man fit into a Dark Ages Russian Kingdom? Without slipping too easily into Connecticut Yankee mode, of course!Baba Yaga is truly horribly evil. Our Prince and Princess, OTOH, are done fairly realistically not as one dimensional goody-two-shoes heroes.It's a fairly fat book, at 400+ pages, but it's a fast page turner of a book, which is always nice. If you're not a fast reader like I am, maybe it might be a little long.My \\"Baba\\" told me stories of the dreaded Baba Yaga and her Hut, and since she wasn't one to coddle us kids, I had nightmares for years. Card's Baba Yaga was thus recognizable by me.I have to say it is considerably different than OSC's other books in several ways, so fans of his should approach it with a little caution, and not expect \\"Alvin Maker in Russia\\". The magic is somewhat similar mind you.Overall it's an easy and fun read, with quite a bit of hidden depth."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"The thing about reading science fiction and fantasy is that you, as an author, can take the reader to a place never seen or dreamt of before. Unfortunately, Enchantment doesn't do that. It hashes over old storylines of sleeping beauty and Baba Yaga and simply puts them into a slightly new storyline. The reading was entertaining and kept me involved in the book till the end. I enjoy OSC work (his Ender's Game series is undeniably his best work), and this was good, but not great work. I want to read about things that I couldn't possibly have dreamt of; I want an author to take my mind on a trip that I never thought possible. That is what OSC has done in the past. But here, he takes us into old stories and throws a few twists at us. Sorry, three stars is all I can give it.Try reading Lord Of the Rings series or the Dune series for truly engaging trips into lands not thought possible. And, of course, read the Ender's Game series and the Foundation series. These are where the strengths in literature lay."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"&quot;Enchantment&quot; is better-than-average in the realm of books written by an exceptionally good author. The concept and characters are both intriguing, and Card's style is, as usual, unpretentious, concise, intelligble, and intelligent.This is not to say that the work is without flaws. I found the end, while dramatic and 'true' in the storyteller's sense, to be abrupt and less clear than the bulk of the story. Also, some things simply seem wrong: A Jewish child is named after her still-living grandmother in the book; in fact, Jews consider it unlucky to name children after living relatives and do not do this as far as I know."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I loved this book, coulnt put it down. I really hope Card decides to do a sequel to it!"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"As a Russian fairy tale, I should have loved this book. It's exactly the sort of book I actively seek out.I hated it.The story itself was okay. Nothing spectacular, had a little bit of a deus ex machina ending, but that by itself was not enough to inspire hatred. What I disliked was the conservative social commentary on feminism and marriage. Or rather, I disliked the lazy way in which Orsen Scott Card went about making his point.The anti-feminism conversation takes place early on between Ruth, Ivan's fiance, and Esther, Ivan's mother. Ivan is now in Russia. Ruth has, up to this point, spoken two lines and exhibited zero personality. The revelation that she wants a career and does not want kids is supposed to be shocking. Personally, I once wanted to have kids and be a housewife. I'm no longer sure. I wouldn't bash on any woman who did stay home, and I expect other people to respect my decision either way.Card clearly doesn't believe women have a right to a decision. Esther, the mother, thinks that choosing not to have children is as much of a curse (exact word) as being barren, and her viewpoint is presented without argument. She does not like Ruth, and she turns out to be right. However, because Card never bothered to build or even sketch out the relationship between Ivan and Ruth, we the reader don't know if Ruth had lied to Ivan (which really WOULD be a reason to hate her), or if they never had that conversation before he popped the question after all of six weeks of dating, and so if her feelings come as a surprise to him its his own fault. But no. According to the author, you don't need to have that conversation because not having babies is a curse. Ruth is the villian here, and its all because she's a baby-hating, career-chasing, air-headed feminist.The second thing that I found hateful about his book was its approach to sex. Ivan is characterized as a non-religious guy in his mid-twenties who is engaged to be married, yet he is still a virgin when he gets married to someone else. He kept telling Ruth, \\"There'll be time enough for that later.\\" Um, yeah. An easy way to explain Ivan's virginity would have been that he'd been too busy with school to date, and that he and Ruth just hadn't gotten to that point yet (if they hadn't been engaged), but Card wanted to make a point - even if you are in your mid-twenties, even if you are engaged, wait until the wedding night, because what if your fiance is a crazy feminist and the person you are really supposed to get married to lives a thousand years in the past? Just . . . gah.It's also shoddy characterization on Card's part. If Card has a moral problem with writing characters who have sex, then they need to display more religious convictions than Ivan does. Ivan doesn't keep kosher, doesn't even go to synogogue or celebrate Jewish holidays. He's only religious when it comes to sex. It's clear that Card wasn't just trying to tell a fun story - he also wanted to send a message that marriage and sex are only for making babies.To summarize: Just say NO to Orson Scott Card."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Enchantment has EVERYTHING. Adventure, intrigue, magic and even romance! Card, once again, has captured my entire being and transported me into another world I didn't want to leave! It only ended too soon! If you like fairy tales---you'll LOVE this book."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I have read more or less everything OSC has published for mainstream audiences. Some of his recent work is absolutely among his best (Pastwatch), while others just leaves you scratching your head at how he must have bullied his editor/publisher into printing such dreck.And I should say that at his best, he is just about the best story-teller around. This is really a very good book. The first 200 pages or so and the end are great, with a bit of a sag in the middle. As perhaps befits a fairy-tale, the characters are either absolutely good or evil. But this gets boring at novel-length.The happy band of pure-hearted underdogs saving the world wears thin quickly, especially since he is using substantially the same gambit in his latest Alvin Maker books.As a writer, his characters have somehow lost touch with reality. I know, I know, this is a Fantasy book. But his Mormon-ness is shining through ever-brighter into a readership uninterested in purity, goodness, and all that.Still a very good book; definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"If you are going to get caught in a fairy tale, don't get caught in a Russian one - sometimes even the princess dies. And that is precisely what happens to Ivan in Orson Scott Card's darkly amusing tale.Ivan is Ukranian, and just before escaping to the west as a young man with his family he visits his cousin Marek on a farm far outside collectivised Russia. There he finds a strange sight - in the middle of the glade is a ring of leaves, in the middle appears to be a sleeping woman on a plinth. Round the outside in a pit covered with leaves is something unidentifiable but frightening.Years later, as a linguist and scholar he returns to his cousin Marek's house - and returns to the glade. The woman is still there - as is the creature. As we see it now - Ivan's whole life has been geared towards being the right person to release the \\"sleeping Beauty\\" from her sleep. Having done so, outwitted the creature, he returns with her to a 9th century village in the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains - but all is not well. While he might be able to speak the language, the culture does not respect him and his skills - and there is magic - Baba Yaga - the worst of the Russian Witches is determined to take the village - and she has the power of teh ancient God, Bear, behind her.Having recently read Neil Gaiman's book American Gods I have been looking for similar ideas, of Gods caught in Modern times, or retelling of fairy stories. Scott Card does an excellent job retelling this story of Sleeping Beauty. It can be pretty convincing - and at times hilarious. Baba Yaga learning the power of computers at airline terminals is hilarious.It was a page turning read for me."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Orson Scott Card has written an epic and highly imaginative story. Once started, I couldn't put it down. The most I am willing to tell you about the actual story is to repeat what is printed on the back cover.\\"The moment young Ivan stumbled upon a clearing in the dense Carpathian forest, his life was forever changed. Atop a pedestal encircled by fallen leaves, the beautiful princess Katerina lay as still as death--while a malevolent presence stirred in the hidden depths below.Now, years later, Ivan is compelled to return. He finds the clearing just as he left it. This time he does not run....\\"With Enchantment, Mr. Card is at his story telling best. It will please anyone who likes suspense, action, ethical and moral dilemmas and a bit of the fantastic. I heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"The story starts off by explaining the background of the main character. It talks about various kinds of folklore and how the story begins. Once Ivan transfers to the other world, the story really starts. Ivan has to go through many embarrasing and fun experiences throughout the book. Orson Scott Card made love real in this book. It wasn't love at first sight, but something requiring better storytelling which Orson pulls off quite well.The book has a few twists here and there, making fine surprises. Intresting Background detail often comes into play making the story come into full circle. This story is also very exiciting and it feels like the world is actually realistic, despite delightful bits of magic involved. Orson creates very life-like characters in this book while switching viewpoints without disapointing readers.This book has all that you need. It has love, tension, suspense, happiness, and uses all aspects of the book to make a story you will be glad you read."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"My wife kids and I have a great time sitting down and listening to this story in the evening. A wonderful twist on an old fairly tale."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This is simply a terrific book! A time traveling tale of adventure, magic, and romance, mixed in with the age old battle of good and evil, gives rise to a story that is totally engaging. A take off on the Sleeping Beauty fairy tale, the author has given it a very definite Russian twist with the injection of Baba Yaga as the wicked witch.Our erstwhile prince, an Ukranian born graduate student living in America, goes home to visit his relatives. He also seeks to find a magical place he remembers from when he was a young boy, where a young woman lay sleeping in the forest. When he finds it, he will enter a world that will be beyond his wildest imaginings.Well-written, highly imaginative, and peppered with memorable characters and sly humor, this is a book to remember. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I am a big fan of Orson Scott Card and had read his Sci Fi books but was leary about fantasy books as a whole. I read this book and found that Card brought his same sense of characterization and internal conflicts to this book as he does in all his writings. A very satisfying read."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This novel is an abrupt departure from the remainder of Orson Scott Card's novels. While it retains more than a little touch of fantasy, it is set in a mostly modern setting. I enjoyed his portrayal of cross-cultural communication mishaps, as well as the humor with which he presented Baba Yaga.Card also manages the multiple story-lines and viewpoints quite well, giving us a fresh perspective on almost every scene in the novel. This deft handling of characters and stories provides a fast-pace feel even in places where the story is slower.Overall, the story flows rather quickly, although some scenes seem to drag a bit. The characters are sometimes a bit unbelievable, although the more unrealistic characteristics are explained away with ease, if you're willing to accept the explanation. Card enjoys theorizing about the linear relational affects of time travel, with characters musing about how their past and present lives will intersect given certain actions.Ivan and Katerina's relationship develops slowly, but begins taking off with the crossing of worlds. Destiny has a strong hand in pushing them together, seemingly setting up their entire lifetimes so that they may meet, divide, and conquer all threats surround them. The world of historic Russia comes to life with vivid descriptions from the viewpoint of Ivan the Scholar.I recommend this novel as a light read for pure entertainment value alone."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Ivan...dear lovers of magical fiction,... is a young lad in the USSR who loves to run who is informed by his parents one day, much to his surprise, that he is Jewish.

Orson Scott Card's version of Sleeping Beauty exceeded my expectations and is now sharing shelf space with my most favourite and cherished books.I don't want to spoil anyone's reading pleasure by disclosing the plot of the story, but for those of you who are lucky to pick this book up - expect a rich historical setting, convergence of culture, well rounded characters, magic, philosophy and suspense. This is not the well-known prince-kisses-sleeping-princess-and-they-live-happily-ever-after story. It goes beyond the kiss and shows how happily ever after has to be fought for.For once I am stuck for words to explain just how good this book is.

OSC did a good job of portraying how a time traveler would struggle with the change and also how the native people would view him.And of course, as part of the story the times are switched and Ivan takes his princess back to his time - I had a harder time seeing this as realistic.Either way, this was a good read.

Card recreates medieval Ukraine to tell the \\"real life\\" story of Sleeping Beauty. I particularly love how Card wove together history and folklore and blurred the lines between them. Card fully made me believe that he was an expert on Ukrainian history and folklore and made the historical passages completely believable.But, not content to stick to one genre, Card also spends about 1/3 of the book bringing his fairy tale characters into modern times and exploring how they deal with the \\"magic\\" of our society. It is a bit reminiscent ofEnchanted, but with much deeper characters and no Disney influence.So much of \\"fantasy\\" writing has become indistinguishable all telling the story of pretty much the same characters living in the same world with the same creatures and the same villains. While it makes it easy to hop from one fantasy series to another, it also becomes a bit mindless. Instead of being satisfied to work inside of this traditional fantasy world, Card has written a completely unique fantasy book.It brings a whole new meaning to the term \\"fantastic\\"."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"One of my favorite authors, Orson Scott Card(OSC), does a superb job with this book. I will admit that some of his work is hit or miss, but this one was a grand slam.This book is more then a simple retelling of fairy tells. OSC develops a nice story around the reimaginings of those fairy tales and builds a frame work to interconnect them all.Starting from the beginning he starts to weave the story around the central character over the period of many years. He uses real life events to fill out the story but then he goes off and he makes a completly original world. Part way through the book these two worlds meet and begin to merge. OSC does a fantasitic job showing how someone would react when thrown into a completly different world, and he doesn't just do it once but twice."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"\\"I'm ten years old, my whole life you've called me Vanya.

And the way they were going to do it was by declaring themselves Jewish, and applying for a Visa to Israel. From there, they were going to go to America. Ivan could grow up free, and Piotr Smetski could teach at a University. But declaring yourself Jewish in 1975 had it's drawbacks in Russia. After Professor Smetski lost his job, the family lost their apartment, and still no Visa was to be had. So the Smetski's moved to the country near Kiev to live with Cousin Marek and his wife.One day when Ivan was out running, he came across a clearing in the woods. The canopy of leaves overhead was \\"so dense that it was perpetually dusk at ground level\\". The ground was covered with leaves. When a slight breeze stirred the leaves, young Ivan could see something at the center. It was a woman: a beautiful, sleeping woman on a pedestal. And when the leaves moved, it wasn't just ground that it covered, but a wide chasm. Then something moved, and Ivan realized that he wasn't alone with the sleeping woman. There was some sort of creature hidden in the leaves. For a ten-year-old boy, this was too much. He ran off as fast as he could. But he never got a chance to tell anyone about what he saw (if he REALLY saw anything at all). Because when he returned to the country house, the family's Visa had come through and everyone was hurrying to get ready.The plan worked, and the Smetski's immigrated to New York, to a small town close to Syracuse. And this is where Ivan grew into a man. He became a track star and a scholar. Fourteen years later, Ivan was working on his dissertation for his graduate degree. He was studying Russian Folklore and Ancient Languages, and figured the best way to finish his work would be to go back to Russia. At least that's what he told himself. Because in the back of his mind, he knew that he wanted to see if the woman, the clearing and the beast under the leaves was real.The story of the Sleeping Beauty in most fairy tales ends once the Prince or Knight awakens the Princess and they live \\"Happily Ever After\\". But in this story it is only beginning. The best part of this tale is what happens after the beauty is awakened. Katerina is a 9th Century Princess who was hidden in time by the evil witch Baba Yaga. Baba Yaga's powers were so great because she had bound the Russian God, the Great Bear to her and was feeding off his power. What did she want? She wanted to rule to land of Tania, Katerina's land. So she hid Katerina away.....not knowing that Ivan would find her and lead her back to the 9th Century.I have to admit, I wasn't thrilled with Katerina for a very long time in this book. She was so headstrong (which I usually like in a female character) that she wouldn't listen to reason. She had no sympathy for Ivan coming to a new place and time....and having no idea what the customs were or how he was supposed to act. But when fate sends the couple back to the modern time, she realized just how hard life was for someone who didn't have a clue.Ivan, however, was a pure soul and I just fell in love with him right from the start. Far sooner than Katerina, that's for sure. Card did an incredible job of intertwining the lives of 2 people from different eras and making a fairy tale come to life. He truly is a gifted writer! On top of the fairy tale, he mixes in Russian folklore and creates a cast of characters that will stay with me for a long time. This was really a remarkable book, with a great story to tell. If you are a fan of Card, or just a fan of fairy tales, this is one book that you must be sure to read!!"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Orson Scott Card does what he does best here...which is to tell a beautiful, human story. Enchantment is very loosely based on the fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty. It is the story of 2 people, both thrust into worlds that are completely strange to them. Our main character is a student of ancient folklore, so he knows a few things about medieval Russia, only not near enough to fit in perfectly, and definitely not enough to become king! While the princess knows nothing at all of the modern day that we all know. Add to this a horrible witch and a talking bear, and you have one hell of a story! Often comical as you might imagine, and always human, this is one to keep on the bookshelf."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Ivan, a Ukrainian-American graduate student returns to his ancestral home in Eastern Europe only to rediscover what was once believed a childhood dream: a real-life woman sleeping in the woods. As a boy, Ivan had seen the same woman resting underneath shrubbery, but was told it was a dream by his parents. After many years in America, upon seeing the woman, Ivan kisses her and she awakes. Before he knows it both of them are transported back into the 9th century, complete with a nasty witch named Baba Yaga and a political struggle for a Kingdom. It's enchanting and makes one wonder - how much of spells are in our own minds or truly the work of a misguided meddler."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"In &quot;Enchantment&quot; Orson Scott Card skillfully blends fantasy, science fiction, adventure and romance. It is a true showcase of the author's talent. The story is based around the idea of &quot;What if fairy tales were true?&quot; The plot hinges around time travel between 9th Century Russia and the 1990's. The key plot device is used well and never seems too unbelievable.The author has obviously carefully researched the history of 9th century Russia and creates a wonderful picture of life in that world. What makes this book so enjoyable though is not just the combination of literary genres, but the fact that the main characters are well developed and can carry the story. A lot of science fiction and fantasy contains one dimensional characters. Here you can truly empathise with and understand the motives of all the main characters.I enjoyed reading Orson Scott Card's Ender series. This book is even more enjoyable. I wholeheartedly recommend it."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I was dissappointed. I was intrigued by the plot but there were too many details that were unnecessary and crude. Half way through I just wanted to be over. I love fantasy and felt that even in this fantasy some things were too contrived. I think I was diappointed because I started to care about the charaters but their strengths got lost in plot flaws and the unnnecessary details. I did enjoy Baba Yaga's interaction with the Bear and the twist that the Princess and her rescuer had to develop their loving relationship. Warning to readers there is some offensive language."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"When I first began reading this book, I was skeptical about how much I would enjoy it. The beginning is slow and seems to bog the reader down with \\"unnecessary\\" details, but as the novel progresses, it becomes an intriguing story that draws you into its complex plotline. Having read other Orson Scott Card books, I was not expecting such an intricate and romantic novel from this prolific science-fiction writer.The tale focuses on the main character, Ivan, a modern-day student, and Katerina, a ninth-century princess. Card often alludes to classic Russian folktales to give the fiction book a more realistic tone. While he obviously does not have exact information about the more far-fetched elements of the book, he does make educated guesses about how the events would have played out if there were such a thing as witchcraft and bear gods of winter. Also, he uses Ivan's constant compulsion to do the moral thing when faced with important decisions as a symbol for humanity's timeless quest for righteousness. Lastly, Card often writes in the many languages that the characters speak. This provides the reader with a clear picture of the barriers that would have been faced by these people had they been real.Overall, I felt that this book provides the reader with something to think about. The moral dilemmas that are faced by the characters parallel the problems that we often have in every day life. I think that Card's main purpose for writing this book was to show that the righteous human spirit will always prevail over evil. Using very believable characters and historical background information, Card has created a timeless literary masterpiece."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I like OSC's style a lot and have enjoyed much of his stuff. This book, however, seems like it was a pet project of his. I didn't really come away from it with anything. It was fun to read, but not too satisfying. I lump it in the same category as Harry Potter, except the plot of Enchantment is just simple twists on old fairy tales."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Wouldn't you want to know what happened after the prince kisses the sleeping beauty from her slumber? Is it just happily ever after? Or there is more to it?Orson Scott Card did a distortion to the famous folk tale of Sleeping Beauty. The story is thrilling and action packed! Card brings our high-tech world into the past where witches lived and religion is the control of one nation. The story is based on the protagonist, the prince, or so an University student graduate who just happens to be the victim of the folk tale. Card brings two worlds in comparison, magic vs technology, differences in value, culture, standard, and through all this we are able to see the development of each characters. It brings you a surprising ending!Again, don't let the book cover fool you, it is not a romantic story about a prince saving the slumbering princess. It is nothing compare to Disney's Sleeping Beauty. Read the book! It is as good as the Enders Series! No doubt the sequel (if there will be any) will be as good as Enchantment."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Orson Scott Card's recreation of the fairy tale &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; in his book Enchantment. The main character, Ivan Semetski, discovers a beautiful young woman sleeping on a pedestal in the middle of a perfectly round chasm when he was 10 years old. After this experience, he can never forget that chasm, even after he moves away. He returns to the chasm as a college graduate and rescues Katerina. He then travels to her world in 890 C.E. and trains to become a knight so he can lead the people in war when he is king. During this time, Ivan learns about his fiance's culture and her contempt for him. Escaping an assassination attempt right after their marriage, Ivan and Katerina travel to his world in modern 20th century. Here, Katerina learns about people like Ivan and learns to love him. They then return to the Kingdom of Taina to try and defeat Katerina's country's worst enemy.Card made this book a fun read through his use of words in describing different challenges to the protagonist, both moral and physical. His control of scenery and portrayal of characters is exceptional, although, like everyone, he has room to improve. His books make you want to try your hand at writing, to see if you, too, can produce such marvelous works."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"When I read the back cover, I was immediately interested, but it wasn't until I read the actual book did I realize what an absolute genius Orson Scott Card is to have written a book combining ancient Russian folklore, religion, and modern times. Somehow he managed to find parallels between our world and the things that could only have been conjured up using magic so many centuries ago. Also I thought it was clever to twist in a fairy tale with a modern love story to make it appealing to many generations, old to young.I had the fortune of having read some childrens' Russian fairy tales when I was younger and now I wish to go back and read them again. It might help to read a book of Russian fairy tales, before or after you read this, and it will amaze you further. Specifically, read Ivan and the Firebird, the Frog Princess, and Katerina Katerina."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"&quot;Enchantment&quot; gets my vote for book of the year. I read it last January and it still impresses me. Most of the time I can't sit still long enough to read a book for long stretches of time but this one had me hooked. At first it was a little slow starting out. I wasn't sure if it was going anywhere. Then when Katerina took Ivan into her world the magic began. From that point on nothing could keep me away from it. I love how the author wove ancient Russian folklore into a modern day context. The novel really paints Russia in a different light than the normal news stories you here about the oppresion of Russian people. It almost fooled me into wanting to visit there!"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"1-liner: Modern boy discovers he is fated to save Sleeping Beauty and become a king in the ancient past.Ivan's story begins when, as a boy, he discovers a princess sleeping in an enchanted clearing (in eastern Europe), which only he can find. It is guarded by piles of leaves and a monster that frightens him away. The memory haunts him when he is older, but he makes the obvious interpretation, that it was one of those pre-teen hallucinations.His family leaves for New York, where he grows up to follow in his father's footsteps as a PhD candidate in the humanities. Many of the peculiar events of his life seem set as if by fate--for one, his father and he decide to take on an archaic language, proto-Slavonic. He falls in love at a friend's wedding, but his mother does not like the girl he becomes engaged to. Ivan, although he does not admit it to himself, is drawn by the princess in the woods to return to eastern Europe. He leaves his family and his fiancee behind, as he ventures back into his past.Back in Europe, he stumbles into the sleeping princess, again, but this time, he does not run away. He temporally defeats the bear that guards her, and as fairy tale requires, he kisses her, and she awakes. Unfortunately, the bear is still at large, and the only way he can get rid of it is to agree to marry her, the princess Katerina. The bear is whisked away, and they stand alone in the middle of the clearing in the woods. Two bridges form, but to each, there is only one bridge: Ivan can see one, and the princess can see the other. Each is from his/her own world, and each bridge leads to his/her home world. The princess leads Ivan away from his own bridge. Taking his hand, Ivan sees Katerina's bridge, and he steps into 900 C.E. Europe.Although Ivan has studied the history and folklore of the region in depth as part of his dissertation, he finds that many things historians have assumed are wrong. Moreover, he is constantly embarrassed as he fumbles around, unacquainted with their customs. So, basically, thus far, the story is like A Connecticut Yankee in King Author's Court... except it's set a nigh bit far more east in Europe.The first part is ripe with slapstick humor--a ten year old non-Jewish boy's reaction to his impending circumcision, for example. (This can become a pain, though.) It is mediocre; an old tale told in a lackluster way... with stereotypical characters. A very dear friend of mine claims this is his favorite book; his word kept me at it, although I have the haggard sort of nature to finish every book I start reading, no matter how much I dislike it. For me, this would have been a huge disappointment, if not for the second part... where OSC begins to add his own flare into this old tale.The cool twist comes about when, in order to save Ivan from being murdered, Katerina is forced to come to the modern world. Forget causality and all that... the universe functions according to magic and fairy tale.I won't give spoilers, but I must mention one of the more memorable events. When Baba Yaga (yes, that witch of legends you've heard about in other tales) stalks them down to the present, she decides to hijack a Boeing 747 (complete with passengers and pilot)... and bring it back to the 10th century with her. The characters' descriptions of it as a huge white house that walks on chicken feet... is amusing. (Moreover, so is Baba Yaga's perspective of cars and airplanes--to her, they're all large houses that move.)At first, it seems the the characters' reasoning was just plain faulty, and it was a pain to have to read through Ivan's thought processes. Totally unbecoming of a PhD candidate. The story became more enjoyable when I decided to just veg out and let Ivan \\"think for me\\" (instead of wondering at his incredulity). But, fortunately, the characters do improve in their reasoning abilities; perhaps OSC got more \\"into\\" the characters as he wrote on.The story, overall, is a cheesy love story with an ending that fills you with the warm and cuddly feeling, but at the same time disappointed. Its novelty resides in its mix of fairy tale and time travel--and its association of fantastic elements of legends as being due to items transported from the future, which when described by the ancient people becomes too ambiguous for us to tell that Baba Yaga's house on chicken feet is really a 747."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"In this story a young grad student sets out to do research on his dissertation (on Russian folklore) and visit relatives in the Ukraine and stumbles upon a sleeping beauty, complete with a bear guarding her. What follows is a very fun and interesting tale of this young man finding out secrets about his family that he never knew and a land he never imagined. Ivan is a very likable character and you will find yourself rooting for him through it all."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I have never heard of the author, but regardless I don't really take note of any authors of all the books I read. But this book, the cover and the title stands out. Yes, i judge a book before i read it. I truly didnt think i would enjoy reading it, but i did. Since the first time i borrow from the public library to read it, i went out to purchase the book and read it three more times. The story, with a mixed of fairy tale and mystery was enough to lead me to finish the book in one sitting (well actually one day). its really a wonderful book if one likes to read a modern day version of fairy tales. A little romance, a little magic, a little mystery that keep you guessing until the end."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This book is one of my favorite books. As a big fantasy fan, this was different than Card's usual work. I was expecting it to be more science fiction.The hero was portrayed so beautifully and the plot, though familiar (sleeping beauty), was clever and intriguing. I have read this book over 10 times and still am not sick of it!"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This modern fairly tale transports you to a world of real magic, real courage and real witches. And it manages to do so while allowing the characters to remain true to themselves (which is always a challenge,and perhaps more so with fantasy).Early on, we're told that 'nobody in his right mind would want to live through the Russian version of a fairy tale', yet our hero does just that.All in all, I found the book deeply satisfying and heartwarming, and the created world internally consistent. I found myself looking forward to the commute, just so I could plunge back into this world and find out what was going to happen next."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This book jumped into my hands, as all of Card's work does. And while I have to say that this was not my favorite of his works, I found Enchantment to be a very fulfilling read.Once again, the author has done his homework. The description of the Smetski family's emigration was quite authentic, and therefore all the more enjoyable. And the story itself does draw from much in Russian folk tradition, although Card wisely refrains from trying to incorporate all Russian fairy tales into one story. I enjoyed the careful consideration of time travel issues, a theme more fully developed in Pastwatch, as well as the exploration of pre-Christian women's rights (as contrasted with Ruthie's 20th century women's lib). I would have liked to have seen greater character development, but with all of the characters in this story that would have been a Herculean task.All in all, I heartily recommend this book, to Card fans or anyone interested in the genre."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"What I love about this book is how it tells a modern story that still feels like a fairy tale - that is quite an accomplishment - to make the point of view 'rational' but still preserve the feeling of myth"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This is one of Card's best. I read it at about the same time as Ender's Shadow. Enchantment is MUCH better (and I liked Ender's Shadow).This is a must-read for anybody who is even vaguely interested in Ukrainian history, Jewish folk tales, or modern neo-Paganism. The story is compelling and captivating, but one thing I especially enjoyed was the rationalization of Germanic paganism and magic. I doubt any other book has combined such things into a very Jewish-Christain romance tale."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This book is probably the strangest retelling of a fairytale that I have ever read (and I read a lot of fariytales). i think it has a wonderful twist. This story, however seems unfinished. Either it has an ending but no conclusion, or a conclusion but no ending. Though I have not read any of Orson Scott Card books before this one, my dad told me what to expect. This was not like what my father told me Card writes like (and if you can make any sense out of that, you are wonderful)."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This story pulls you in and keeps you going. I loved the mixture of classic fairy tells, history, and modern times. It was also refreshing to see the usually flat dark age and fairy tell characters have true personalities. And in many cases they have a realistic sense of humour, sarcasm, and doubts. I read it on a trip to France, and the whole group was fighting over who should get it next!"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"The book is one of my favorites by Orson Scott Card. the book itself I give 5 stars, but the abridged audio version is horrible. The abridging was done with so little skill that its impossible to listen to the story without having first read the book. Do not buy the Abridged Audio Vesions unless you have already read the book. Even then, you will be disappointed, but at least you will be able to enjoy the story.The abridger chose to cut some portions of the story out, but later left the dialogue referring to those missing portions in. It is extrememly confusing, and you always feel like you missed something, because you did.I have listened to other abridged audio books by OSC like Stone Tables and Ender's Shadow. Those were wonderful books, so it is possible to have a good abridged audio book. Enchantment simply isnt."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Here's a very easy test to tell whether you'll like this book or not. Do you A) like sophisticated, at least somewhat intellectually stimulating fantasy literature or do you B) like silly, sappy harlequin romances with a dash of uninventive fantasy? If you answered B) this book is for you. As for myself, I found myself cringing through what I read (3/4 of it) before I finally gave up in disgust and just skimmed the rest. It started off good, but there was just too much cheesy romance to appreciate the fantasy.*however* I will say this. I think a younger audience would probably like it. I know that if I were considerably younger (12 or so), I probably would have really liked it.... though, come to think of it, I've read a lot of YA material and rarely is it this cheesy... Waste your time with this book at your own risk"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"this is a must read for any fans of any type of fiction.if you havent read it yet do it. it is basicly a aternate sleeping beuty book but very diffrent than normal. thats ill say and let the book say the rest."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I bought this, my first OSC book, based on his reputation as a writer, the back cover blurbs, and the cover art which hinted at nothing of the violence that just made me have to put the book down. I would have liked to continue if just for the interesting history, but as I prefer to keep graphic violent images from clogging my imagination I just don't want to bother. After the second eyeball gouging scene I could not bear further cringing and said 'enough'.Aside from the violence, the story was just barely engaging enough to keep me turning the pages. I found the main character shallow and not particularly interesting; there was nothing to make me care about what happened to him, not to even find out how he developed as a person, and so not much of a reason to continue reading.I found Philip Pullman's Dark Materials trilogy (books that are shelved in the young adult fiction section) immensely deeper, more imaginative, engaging and meaningful. The writing in this Card novel will not urge me to pick up another of his books, at least without warnings of what kind of violence he includes in his storytelling. If I wanted that kind of experience I'd read horror novels, not sci-fi/fantasy."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This book was a big disappointment. Not Card at his best. Some mildly funny anachronism jokes didn't make up for the overworked, overworked and overworked insipid fairy tale theme."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Like with a partial derivative, I was partially enchanted with the book -- the cover, that is. Seriously? The story was a bit confusing but OSC allowed the good guys to win in the end ... whch is the only reason why I gave it three stars...The story is not a well structured fantasy -- the center doesn't hold. Too many inconsistencies. Example: If Bear was stuck in the pit for eleven hundred years and under Baba Yaga's spell, how did he get out and manage to free himself from the witch's spell, AND to thwart Hitler and intervene in all those other evil events? And not only is Sam Kinison dead, dead, Dead! but Johnny Carson's show is also definitely not playing in the 1990's. Try Jay Leno next time you have old folks watching late night TV.The most glaring error of all is this (unless Uncle OSC was trying for some quantum effect on a macroscopic scale): the main characters were bitching and fretting about when they were to cross over the bridge. You know, the bridge that crosses the twenty-seven or so foot long chasm between the edge of the donut shaped pit to the stone island that's in the MIDDLE of the CIRCULAR pit. I mean, get an IQ, dude! Haven't you ever heard of ignoring the bridge altogether and walking AROUND this circular pit? It's like trying to figure out how you are going to carry back to the car exactly ten gallons of gas using ungraduated containers, while totally ignoring the fact that there is a gas meter on the pumps that figures it all out for you! Stupid is as stupid does, OSC, you Gump!Combine that turkey layout of the bridge across the donut shaped pit with Ivan's having an immortal god for a relative and maybe an immortal god for a mom, and we have a completely confusing tale that makes one wonder whether OSC wanted to be a Clive Barker here -- not that he is anyone great to follow either. The inclusion of supernatural relatives and such was completely unnecessary. I would also have liked to see a more rounded treatment of the roles and origins of these mythological gods if they were to be included, including how Bear can fight evil while all the while performing evil as well. But, alas and alack, too much time was wasted on Nerd Ivan, what with his pre-adolescent worryings and frettings about sex, as if he were some incredibly immature pimply adolescent. A really trite and dated handling of a key protagonist if there were ever other examples to compare by. Something better reserved for some B flick on a scifi channel, where the writing is usually handled by some brain dead flunky from one of those dilettante California schools for screenwriting and hair design."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"No one is doing in any genre of the publishing world (mainstream/sf/fantasy) what Mr. Card is doing. The mixture of fabulation, history, time-travel, and sheer magic pushes Mr. Card into the realm of writers such as Italo Calvino, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Jorge Luis Borges and John Fowles. His imaginative capacities are seemingly boundless, his writing style absolutely engaging, first word to last. This is the breakthrough novel for Mr. Card, pure and simple and should bring more readers back to his other masterpiece, HART'S HOPE. If I wore a hat, I'd take it off in a grand salute to this man and this masterpiece. (But no sequels, please. Onward and upward!)"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"True, you need to suspend reality in order to believe in the magic and story of the world, but when you have things like building a hang glider AND being able to fly decently without any training whatsoever, it gets sort of silly for me. It was a good story, don't get me wrong, but some of the writing and ideas, just seemed so adolescent. Still, the book kept me gripped with the character development."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Innovatative, exciting, funny, sexy, written in Card's thoughtful prose. Worth your time."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"A departure from Card's futuristic Ender series, Enchantment takes place in a combination of the past (900 A.D.) and present (the 1990s). While Enchantment weaves historical fact with fictional/magical fantasy to retell the \\"true\\" story of sleeping beauty, at its heart, Enchantment is a love story. But don't let that lead you to believe that this book is going to be sappy--as with Card's many other books, Enchantment is an action-packed page turner. Another bonus with this book are its many \\"A-Ha!\\" moments, delightful moments where the reader discovers Card allowing the seemingly insignificant to resurface and play a major role. Great dialogue, lovers' tension--love the social awkwardness Card invites by dropping his characters into other cultures and eras, appreciate the historical research about fairy tales and medieval Russia that Card wove into this book, very strong theme of fate (perhaps serendipity?), all together an excellent, fast-paced read!"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This novel is hard to rate because some parts are so very good, and some other parts are so uninspired. This tale of sleeping buety in the Urkraine has its moments, but in the end I found it failed to really deliver. I felt that Card really wanted to tell a story with these characters, but just couldn't quite find one that fit right. These characters are too deep and to involved for any of them to really be in a fairy tale. Card tries to make the world realistic while still keeping a fairy tale plot where everything will be okay if you believe hard enough. All of the momentum that is developed in the beginning of the novel is lost tring to set up series of events that are either not believable or not true to the tone of the book. What results is the last three or four chapters felt like an uninspired fatasy book that knows its telling a story thats been told before, and told better.This isn't to say the book doesn't have redeming qualities. The first half of the book is simply excellent, Card develops a character in Ivan that lives up to his talent as an author. The rest of the book has its flashes of being something greater, but keeps being draged down by a plot that just doesn't quite ring true."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"After Ender's Game I find it hard to believe that OSC wrote something so trite, so unimaginative. It starts off OK, but then gets terrible once you realize where he's going with it. Nothing creative, totally predictable. Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Enchantment is a spring fancy. A book that is pleasant to read in a warm sunbeam, contemplating nothing, just simply enjoying the pages as they flip by. There is nothing deep to Enchantment. It is a cute and modern reworking of Sleeping Beauty.The book contains some twists and turns. Card readers will recognize some of his usual characterization quirks. The plot is a bit loose, the dialog is great and the description is fast and free. Which makes Enchantment very much like what readers have come to expect from Card in the past decade. Enjoyable but not world changing. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Orson Scott Card is probably better known for his Ender's series. After becoming deeply entranced by that series, I sought out other books by him.And then at my school library, I stumbled upon Enchantment. Probably the most diverse novel I have ever read, mixing different ways of living. Card strays away from his traditional political sci-fi in this book. When I started reading it, I was skeptical of whether he could pull it off or not.He can!Contrary, to some of his other novels, Enchantment took me for a spin on the wheel of fantasy romance. The developing characters never ceased to amaze me, and the plot was beyond intriguing.This was probably one of the first novels of romance that I seriously got into. Why? The relationships here are awesome. Modern day Snow White flexes the romantic climax here.I definitely recommend this book. The book COULD be a tincy bit more exciting. Nonetheless, do not let that stop you. Fantasy lovers will be stunned at the enchanting words that Orson Scott Card spins on us."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"If you like well-written modern-day fairy tales, you just might want to check out ENCHANTMENT.Our Ukrainian protagonist actually gets to travel into a different time and place where Sleeping Beauty is real. But hey, he doesn't get stuck there. He even manages to take Beauty back to the present with him.If you're interested in the twists and turns that can come up in such a story, read ENCHANTMENT. It looks like one of the best novels Orson Scott Card has written."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Card has really shone his work here. Taking place in two worlds, each different from each other, it is completely awesome. You really get to know the characters, especially Ivan. You get plunged into the lives of these people, and can't wait for the next page. It's full of suprises and twists. It has just enough romance in it-not gushy, but not lame. This is my absolute favorite book. I can't wait to read more of Card's work!!"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"The story that kept me engaged from beginning to end was, of course, the love story. However, I found myself feeling that much of the whole setup to the story seemed too trite and constructed. Maybe I've just seen too much of how a story is constructed to be able to judge how other people consider it. The story was good overall, but not great, because most of the elements seemed predictable, and not enough depth or development was done among those elements to make for truly original writing. The fact that the main character, Ivan, has a cousin who turns out to be virtually a god; Ivan's abrupt marriage to Katerina and his just-as-abrupt breakup with the girl he was supposed to marry, Ruthie; and other things - they were all explained away too quickly, loose ends that remained dangling. For me, Card has a habit of starting with a great concept, and starting the story out in great ways, but then reducing the storyline to something less than stellar, often by stretching things out rather than adding depth. Alas, even the love story felt lacking for me in the end. If you're a Card fan, like I am, you'll undoubtedly like this book. But being a Card fan, I feel he is capable of much more."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"okay, if you have any interrest at all in folklore and fairytales, you have got to read this book-- it's charming, complex, full of magic and intrigue and a really well-handled weaving of history, folklore and plot that is something to behold. bear is just great, and baba yaga shines in her interractions with him. the story is really inside the heads of each of the characters, showing how thier opinions and points of view shift as the story progresses, and that's a joy only marred a few small times when card falls into third-person-omniscient and kind of condescends the characters rather then staying inside their heads. overall, i loved it. i read the whole thing in the hours i was flying from home to dc and it ate my brain the way only a really good, absorbing book can."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"If you enjoy Orson Scott Card's Science Fiction works, I believe you will also enjoy his fantasy. This isn't the first Card fantasy I've read (I like his fantasy much more, with the exception of Ender's Game and Shadow) but this was one of my favorites.My favorite thing about Orson Scott Card is his characters. And this book has the best of them all. First there is \\"Price\\" Ivan who was born a Ukrain Jew who defected from Russia and ended up in the United States. He meets the Christian Princess Katerina who was enchanted to fall asleep and would later on become the basis for Sleeping Beauty. You have a talking, immortal, good natured bear who is married to the meanest meanie of them all, Baba Yaga (Okay, repeat after me, Baba Yaga... one of the funnest names to say aloud). Can it get better than this?This story is fun, interesting, entertaining, and educational with enough plot twists to be considered one of Orson Scott Card's best.If you would like a good fantasy, give this book a try. It isn't too long and the pace is very good. The ending leaves you satisfied but, none-the-less, begging for more. Probably not the best bed-time story for young children, but more for mature teenagers and up (there is a splash of needless swearing in it).Come on, give it a go!!"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"It starts out in the present day. 10 year old Ivan Smetski has found out that he is Jewish. He and his family are leaving Ukraine for America. On the way, they stop at Cousin Marek's farm and while Ivan is running in the ancient woods nearby, he finds a clearing. In the middle of a clearing is a woman.This is the beginning of Orson Scott Card's Enchantment. When Ivan first sees this woman, he runs away. When next he returns from America to the same place -- a college student, a track star, and engaged to be married -- he faces his fear and does not run. Instead he wakes up Katerina, Princess of a place called Taina that existed over 10 centuries ago. Unwittingly, Ivan has stepped into the Russian Sleeping Beauty and has found that it isn't a fairy tale after all.Enchantment tells of how Ivan, unsuited to the time and culture of Taina, knowing only the language from his studies in college, and Katerina, Princess of Taina, overcome Baba Yaga, the witch who wants to end the Taina way of life and rule the country.On Ivan and Katerina's side is knowledge and eventually love. The two travel to Ivan's time to prepare for the upcoming battle with Baba Yaga. They have advanced weapons, loyal people, and Ivan's mother, who is a witch herself.But Baba Yaga has fear on her side; the power of a spellbound god; sorcery, hatred, trickery. She will give them no easy victory.Enchantment is a captivating story; a fairy tale so original it can hardly be recognized as a retelling. The writing is powerful; the characters are real; the issues are close to home no matter where home may be. This is a wonderful read."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Enchantment is a beautifully written story. Card has a gift for introducing deep concepts such as religion and morality and weaving them into the story in way that allows for deep introspection that is NOT boring. Besides that, this is a just a plain great story with real characters and an exciting plot. I enjoyed every aspect of this book."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"A masterful work by Card. Weaves modern characters into a perfect blend of historical fiction and a classic fairy tale. Card amazingly manages to create a 9th century kingdom that is both historically believable and as full of magic and enchantment as any fairy tale. Card also writes extremely well. His prose is effective and descriptive and never dull. This is a book that is fulfilling to read without being difficult to read. Full of well thought out and developed charcters whose actions and motivations are realistic and compelling, and a well crafted story that does not always unfold has expected, but never forgets that underneath it all it's a fairy tale. Card aptly demonstrates that he can still write science fiction and fantacy equal to Ender's Game."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"An excellent novel that tells a wonderful story with intelligence and grace. If we keep Card writing then the world will be better off."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Enchantment shares the same strengths and flaws that I find throughout Orson Scott Card's many books.He's able to combine physical action right alongside a brilliant exploration of his characters' interior world. I'd say Scott Card comes closer than any author I've read in accomplishing the goal Henry James set for himself when he wrote \\"Portrait of a Lady\\" - to make a character's interior development as thrilling as an action story.In Ivan and Katerina, Scott Card, gives us two characters that are as courageous looking inward as they are facing the challenges of their exterior worlds. They can both act obstinately and impetuously, but they also engage in deep, raw introspection and are willing to learn and evolve.But the book fails to keep it's balance.This is my problem with so many of Scott Card's books - they're simply too \\"thinky\\". If a story line must both progress (move the action forward) and expand (articulate the world at each moment), Scott Card often indulges too much in expansion. And that kills momentum and interest.The beginning of the book is a good example. The core story doesn't start until chapter three. The action,and the important part of the story, really starts when Ivan returns to Russia after researching his doctoral thesis. If we need glimpses into his childhood to understand his current choices, we can get those in retrospect.I'm not saying that Scott Card doesn't deserve his reputation. It's just that this balance is at the core of his books and he's handled it far better before. Both Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow are better books and both open at critical moments in their character's lives. They are two of my favorite books of all times.This is a terrific story, and at over 400 pages the problems isn't that the book is too long, it's that it's too fleshy and slower than it needs to be. Scott Card could accomplish the same feat in a book more lithe and sinewy if he had an editor with the nerve to stand up to him with a red pen in hand."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"While Card is known for his Science Fiction mojo with books like Ender's Game and Pastwatch, we get to see a different side of him in this book. I liked this book mostly because of how magic is used. I liked that it was more than just saying a spell. Card must have done a lot of research and pulled together from many different customs and cultures to give us a world where magic is an everyday thing and easy once you know how. I also liked the use of immortal beings (gods) in the book. He wrote in these deities that seem to bridge the gap between us and the omnipotent. All the while leaving an air of mystery around the idea the Hebrew \\"One God\\". Card also brings to the surface many great ideas surrounding fairy tales and their origin; He breaches the surface of sex and marital relationships with grace, but also makes us laugh (hopefully) about our own expectations. This is a good book to read if you are interested in a book to take you for awhile, away from all the series of books, and help you see the nobility in all of us."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"After recently reading a chic lit novel loosely based on Cinderella, one of my wonderful friends loaned me a fantasy novel by Orson Scott Card called Enchantment. My apprehension immediately turned into excitement when I found out what this novel is about.Ivan, a grad student from America is transported to the Nineteenth Century to save Princess Katerina from the curse brought upon by the evil witch (who is a popular Russian folklore figure) known as Baba Yaga. The curse put Katerina to sleep. She will only wake up if the man who kisses her also proposes marriage since this means that they are meant to be together. In other words, Ivan was transported to the Russian version of Sleeping Beauty. This is such a well told story filled with excitement, adventure and fantasy. Ivan and Katerina traveled from past to future to beat the curse and ultimately the evil witch. At what seemed to be a lengthy novel proved to be engaging and fast paced.[...]"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This is my favorite of all the Orson Scott Card books. I am so impressed with his research, and how cleverly he combines a fairy tale with myth and history. The people are so real.My only complaints, as usual, are the amount of swearing and crude references. they are so much that my DH won't even read the book. All in all, I think the wonderful story line makes up for it."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I thought this was an intersting blend of history, pagan religion, culture, fantasy with a twist of faerie tale. Thoroughly enjoyed this book. It rates number two just below my all-time fave Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follett."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Ivan grew up in uncertain times, in an uncertain place. When he was a child, his parents suddenly decided that Russia, where they lived, was too dangerous a place for them to stay. They sensed that bad things were about to happen in Europe. While they waited for their visas to come through to leave the country, they stayed with a cousin of Ivan's mother in the Ukrainian countryside. One day while running through the woods, Ivan would have sworn he saw a beautiful young woman lying on a pedestal, guarded by something terrifying. The next day Ivan's family left for America, where for years Ivan's memory haunted him.Now a graduate student living in the nineties, Ivan has a chance to do some research back in his Russian homeland. Although he is engaged to be married, Ivan takes off and immerses himself in his research. He can't resist going back to the clearing where he remembers seeing the beautiful girl. She is still there, and he feels compelled to kiss her. Just as in the ancient fairy tales, she wakes up.Things for Ivan and his princess aren't as smooth as a fairy tale. If Ivan is to truly be the savior of this princess he's awakened, he needs to help her to protect her land from an evil witch. But how can he, a modern man who has never picked up a sword, ever hope to lead a medieval army?I loved the idea of revamping a classic fairy tale. I thought Ivan's character was a bit weak, though, and Katerina should have cut him more of a break."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I became aware of this book after my father in law read it and recommended it. To be honest, I wasn't too keen on reading a spin on the classic fairytale....but was very pleased with the depth of this story. Card is by far my favorite author, and this is yet another demonstration of how he can take a familiar theme and breathe new life into it. He intricately weaves this story of Sleeping Beauty into it roots in Ukranian folklore, leading the reader to believe that maybe there's some truth to the fairytale. All around excellent read."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"_Enchantment_ is a retelling of Sleeping Beauty with a Russian twist. When he is little and still living in Russia, Ivan is drawn to a certain spot in the woods near his cousin's house. This gives him his first sighting of the princess. Years later, while researching for his dissertation on, what else, fairy tales, he returns to the spot, frees the princess and is transported back 1100 years. He and Katerina, the princess, eventually head back to present day, then once more to the ninth century to defeat the evil Baba Yaga.This was my first Card book and I love it. Retold fairy tales are a particular favorite of mine, and this one did not disappoint. Baba Yaga is truly evil and the little interludes from her point of view are monstrous fun. Her relationship with Bear is comical and engaging. I absolutely fell in love with Ivan. He is caring and sensitive to others' needs. He's not a pushover, really, he just doesn't like to hurt people. His consideration for Katerina is heroic and achingly sweet when you see how she treats him. When it is called for, though, he stands up for himself. Katerina is less likeable. She treats Ivan with barely concealed contempt because he has trouble living in her world and living up to her idea of manhood. Still, that is to be expected considering that she is a princess and the ninth century is very different from today. Ivan and Katerina's journey into love is believable and incredibly romantic. All of the secondary characters are very well-fleshed out. The story is captivating and rarely slow. I recommend this to anyone who loves a good fairy tale, romance, or adventure."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I knew before I was even halfway through this that this would be my favorite Card book to date. And it is. Even after working through the Ender series and a couple of stand-alone novels, this still put me in awe. What can I say? Card has found that crossroads that everyone wishes for but few can reach: the intersection where supreme technical writing ability, research, and knowledge meets with engaging, &quot;catchy,&quot; suspenseful fun-in-reading that spells gold for both the writer and the reader.Card has done a fantastic (as usual) job of showing parts of various cultures that American readers might not know so well (Judaism, Russia in general, ancient times). I think a large portion of his appeal lies in this: he shows us vivid pictures of things we don't experience in our everyday lives. He gives us the perfect escape, somehow making the unbelievable into normality.It's the kind of work that alternately makes me, as an aspiring fiction writer, want to give up because I know I'll never reach this level or feel supremely inspired and want to chug away at the keyboard all day.Read it!"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Great fantasy, not an elf, dwarf or quest in sight. Leave it to Card to create an alien moral dilemma in ninth century Carpathia that makes you examine your own life.And you thought Capathia was where the bad guy from Ghostbusters II came from! Get some culture. Read this book."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This book stands out so much from other &quot;timetravel&quot; books that I think I will never be able to read another without thinking how typical it is. The characters are so real that you can truly empathize with them, even minor charaters like Sergei and the priest he worked for. The book doesen't feel like a fantasy or a love story, both of which it has parts of. It feels REAL, like something that could happen to you. And the characters feel just like you would feel if it did."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"As soon as young Vanya (later Ivan) runs in panic from the mohel at his house, I knew this was going to be an interesting tale. Card has once again captured my imagination and forced me to lose sleep in order to quickly finish another of his books.After so many reviews here, I'll skip the plot summary. This myth turned fairy tale turned fantasy is a wonderfully written, captivating story combining various cultural myths with some more familiar modern-day fairy tales. The adult Ivan returns to a mystical spot from his childhood and ends up fighting a battle and finding himself transported back in time to a most magical and dangerous place. I absolutely love the fact that Ivan's damsel in distress is far from the simpering weakling most often depicted in &quot;real&quot; fairy tales and is instead an intelligent, assertive, and independent young woman. It is also refreshing that this is not a love-at-first-sight sort of tale. Card is a genius when it comes to creating complex characters who always have more to offer than they first appear. I found myself absolutely lost in this story, and there was no way I could put it down until the last word. This is certainly a treat for all Card fans although it is quite a departure from his more popular science fiction. To borrow from a much-used description, this story is downright enchanting. Devoted fans and those who are new to Card's writing will all enjoy this tale."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I LOVED this book!! whoever is looking it up, you MUST read it!! I was completely sucked in did nothing but read until I was finished. It's a book for girls or guys, though I think girls might like it more. It has everything, romance, adventure, sci-fi, suspense, you name it! It is one of the best books I have read in a long time."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This book has got to be one of the best fantasy novels I've ever read - and I've read tons. It ranks up there with my favorite series from Guy Gavriel Kay, The Fionavar Tapestry - This book is just as good as they are, or better. Very captivating story, will definitely keep you turning the pages. Its a fresh take on a fantasy novel and so not what you would expect from Mr. Card. I reccommend it to everyone and they never regret reading it."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This is a modern/fantasy romance tale. It is not as popular as some of Card's other books, but it is still a great story. Card sets the story in modern day and in medieval Russia. The evil witch in this story is Baba Yaga! Fans of Russian folktales will enjoy this story, too."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This is an awesome story. The characters are well developed, the story is captivating, the writing is (as is always true with OSC) superb!"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"A friend loaned me a copy of this book, and after reading a bit of it, I quickly stopped. Why? Because vacation was coming up soon, I was going to take my wife and go see my parents for a couple weeks, and it looked like something everyone would enjoy.And they did. All at once. Enchantment made great \\"sit around and read to each other\\" material.For Ender fans... no, this is not the Enderverse. It's well written. It entertainly probes boundaries between fairytales, fairytale settings, and modern misconceptions about fairytale settings. It's main character is a competitive runner, which I thought was fun. There's a sprinkling of magic, a modicum of history, and a lot of culture shock. It's a fun read, and a good book to pass on to the next person."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I loved this book the first time I read it (couldn't put it down). The only other Orson Scott Card I had read was Ender's Game and most of the Alvin Maker series (which began with promise but disappointed me in the end). Enchantment is very different from the aforementioned. I love the way he weaves in classic Russian fairytales and makes it an incredibly involving tale about personal change and development (whereas Ender's Game and Alvin Maker I feel are more societally-focused stories). Additionally, I always have much respect for Card's characters and their morals, and this is no exception."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"It has been so long since I read this book, but I highly recommend it. In fact, instead of loaning it out to people like normal, I actually bought it for two of my friends that I knew would appreciate it as well. This is a modern day &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, but it is so well written. I was first introduced to Orson Scott Card in college with &quot;Ender's Game&quot;, which was an excellent book and then read &quot;Lost Boys&quot;, which I did not feel was as good, but still worth the read. This book and perhaps &quot;Dogs of Babel&quot; by Carolyn Parkhurst would definitely be two I would like to have on a deserted island."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Enchantment is about a young scholar who gets stuck in a fsiry tale. When Ivan was a boy, he visited a relative in Russia and discovered a sleeping woman lying on a bed of leaves in the forest. Years later, curiosity forces him back. This time,he must fight a bear in order to save her. A kiss and a touch of magic, and then unwilling Ivan is forced into a marridge with the lady in order to save her ancient kingdom from the dreaded witch Baba Yaga. However, when Ivan t5ries to become the king that he must learn how to be, he is ridiculed by the villagers for his strange accent and behavior. Ivan and the princess, Katerina, travel from his world to hers and back again as they gather the materilals and magic they need to defeat Baba Yaga.I enjoyed this book very much. With witty humor, exciting plot twists and intriging characters, this book gave me an inside look at the world of Russia fairy tales. It was also full of sarcasim and difficult situations(such as when Ivan must explain to his former fiance, Ruthie, that he has married someone else) that kept it interesting. My only complaint is hat the book was very long and took a while to get started. I recommend this book to people who enjoy fantasy and who like books with a sense of humor."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This novel is my favorite so far. It's ending is superb, it's beginning pulls you right in. I especially liked the juxtaposition of realism and fantasy, and the time travel, the beautiful but independent maiden, the not-so-cliche hero... and the retelling of an age old tale, only better. It's a stunning combination. I urge you all to read it."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This was a good book about an enchanted princess in the middle of time bridge. It wasn't really my type of book, but it kept me interested. It's kind of hard to follow sometimes but you get back on track. Over all, it was pretty good."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I LOVED this story. I rarely read fantasy, but a friend recommended the book to me and once I started, I couldn't put it down. A beautiful story with fantastic characters. A quick and easy read for men and women! You can't go wrong with this book!"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"As readers of classic Card works such as &quot;Ender's Game&quot; know, Card is a master storyteller, able to create compelling characters, and taut plotlines making it impossible to put down his books. These characters are imbued with powers and abilities surpassing our own, yet their fears and insecurities ring true, emphasizing their essential humanity.But this isn't just a great story. It's a fascinating portait of life in 10th century Ukraine and of the evolution of folk tales.Following his own lead in such works as 'Alvin Maker' and 'The Redemption of Christopher Columbus', Card weaves together history and fantasy brilliantly. It might not help you pass a history test, but he makes life in the subject area come alive. Whether it's Medieval Ukraine or Colonial America, he illustrates how many of our everyday conveniences we take for granted.A delicious read- and nutritious too."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Though Card's &quot;Ender's Game&quot; has never been, (nor ever will be) paralleled, &quot;Enchantment&quot; was appropriately named. For this story is (in a word,) enchanting.Yes, Card has written us a love story. However, &quot;Enchantment&quot; is not your everyday love story. It bridges across time, linking characters from the past to present. Card still has the amazing ablility to actually let the reader believe his story could really happen.A fairy tale come true, is something every child dreams of. There are, of course, the moments of pure mayhem, that we all know could never happen, but smile to even THINK of it's possibilities. Couldn't you just imagine the look of the people when Baba Yaba enters the Princess's time in a 747?! I'm surprised half of them did not die of a heart attack.The book is endearing, the characters are lovable, yet mystical, and as for the witch...you love to hate her. This is definitely a book worth reading."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I didn't read all the book...I read the first 150 pages and easily put it down with not a thought afterwards. I was sick of waiting for the book to get good. It started out okay, even a little interesting, but once the fairytale portion in introduced, it is all cliche from there. I did find out the ending..no surpise how it worked out. This book had no good characters, even the \\"good ones\\" were annoying. Not only are the plot, and characters horrible, but Card must have felt he needed to add mentions of mens nakedness throughout the book, and use horrible lanugage. I tried to read this, really tried to like it but, I hated it! Very disappointed!!"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Found this book at a half-price bookstore on their dollar rack. Only reason I picked it up was the bf was telling me about his favorite author's \\"Ender\\" series, Orson Scott Card. The mystery, mythology and old childhood themes in Enchantment caught my eye (it didn't hurt that the book was a dollar, right up my cheapskate little heart's alley.)Card does an exceptionally good job weaving childhood themes, stories like Sleeping Beauty, Beauty and the Beast, a King and kingdom, witches, warlocks/wizards and so forth. He describes action in and around the Ukraine, the United States, whipping the readers around while the early century wicked witch learns about flight, credit cards and so forth.The characters are well-developed, from the title character's studying ancient ukrainian mythology (!) to his father's lifelong teaching at college, his mother's hidden white magic both from the old country to their followed land. His mother's side has a long line of white witches and a kind of coven.He travels to the ancient magic land courtesy of a sleeping beauty, cursed by baba yaga and a huge black bear, enchanted by said witch. Past and present intertwine into a beautifully told story.I would recommend Enchantment to anyone into mythology, old tales, witchcraft stories and so forth. There is literally, something for everyone.Card's Enchantment certainly deserves 5 stars."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"It is a fair to good book. I felt Card spent way too much energy of the character's' time wringing their hands over every single possible ethical and time variance issue to the point where the narrative drags several times. The plot is compelling enough to keep my interest even I found myself skimming down past some of the boring hand wringing portions."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"After he wakes the sleeping princess with his kiss and promises to marry her in order to break the enchantment, what happens when they go off to live happily ever after?Ivan is a 10-year-old child in Russia. It's 1975. \\"Cousin Marek had a dairy farm in the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains. . . . Because this hill country was remote, strategically unimportant, and thinly populated, Communism here was mostly window dressing. . . . Cousin Marek had the room, the independent attitude, and enough surplus to take in a few hapless cousins who had decided to become Jews in order to get to the West.\\"The story is a very entertaining mix of religion, technology, and magic. Where does one end and the next begin?It was at that age of 10 that Ivan first stumbled on the magic place in the woods where the princess lay. Of course he got scared and of course, he ran. But he never forgot. And he was drawn to return from the U.S. to Ukraine after becoming a young man and after becoming engaged to Ruthie. Magic happens fast. He found the princess Katerina, defeated the bear, promised to marry her and was led by her across the magic bridge to her home and time nearly a thousand years before he was born.You will enjoy this tale of a modern man trying to fit into a society where he is judged only by his ability to fight in war, or more realistically, his total apparent weakness and lack of fighting skills. The fact that the magic bridge removes all items from your time, including clothes, as you cross into the past creates some very funny scenes. Contrary to fairy tales, the people will not accept this weakling as king, and some plot to murder him, the sooner the better.Katerina and Ivan escape back across the bridge to modern times and now the tables are turned as she must adjust to a totally alien society. That comes after she has to suffer the fact that the bridge removed her clothes as she passed into the future, and it restored his normal clothes. Apparently there are very precise rules for magic. Almost like the rules for technology. Too soon they both find themselves fighting the terrible evil magic of Baba Yaga, who apparently followed them back. She even uses the jilted Ruthie to try to kill Ivan. Was it magic or not that the former girlfriend would actually want to kill the former fianc&eacute; who shows up with a strange, non-English-speaking new wife in tow and seems to have no explanation for it.You will find a lot of humor and entertainment in this creative story. It's a great story. The only disappointment was that Card did not develop his characters as well as he could have. He is such a skilled writer that I know he could have done so and the story would have been so much better for it. I wanted to \\"see\\" the strange tilt of a head, or the wrinkling of the brow, or perhaps the habitual movement of a hand to her hair, or the many other things that would bring out the personalities and behaviors of the characters and bring them to life. When you have a great story and you couple that with bringing characters to life, now that would be the ultimate magic story.For Honor: An Adventure of What Might Have Been: Book One of By Honor Bound"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"After reading and loving (and re-reading)Ender's Game: Battle School, I really wanted to love this book by Orson Scott Card.

It helps if you have already read Russian tales about &quot;Simple Ivan&quot; or Baba Yaga. If you haven't, here is a little inforamtion about them: The character known as Ivan is usually depicted as stupid or silly, yet still triumphs as the hero. Baba Yaga is usually depicted as an old sorceress or witch who has a small house that walks on chicken legs. She flies through the air in a mortar and pestal. She bestows both gifts and curses.Now, with all of that said, let me explain a little about this novel. The premise is that fairy tales have a true basis. In this case, there really was a Simple Ivan, Baba Yaga, and a house with chicken legs. Orson Scott Card creates this reality by having a modern day Ivan travel back in time where he meets a real sleeping beauty (Princes Katarina) and Widow Queen Baba Yaga. Ivan is an excellent scholar and athlete in his own time, but to the people of 890AD Russia and especially to his soon to be new wife Katarina, he is clueless about being a &quot;real man&quot; and therfore an idiot. Magic is real in 890AD and so is the witch Baba Yaga. As for the house with chicken legs, I let you discover how that comes about for yourself."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"A classic story.

Like frantically trying to sink your teeth into cotton candy before it melts to syrup in your mouth. I felt there was too much reliance on the &quot;Train of thought&quot; narrative mechanism which has become OSC's mainstay. So much of the 415 pages of this novel are filled with torturous vagaries and switchbacks tracing the internal monologues of these characters. There is extreme implausibility ( suspension of disbelief is one thing, but characters must act reasonably..the whole Picnic thing is laughable. Simple guilt does not explain inviting a jilted lover to your home...especially when you KNOW BY is in town! ) There are many &quot;modern&quot; references...the Pointer Sisters, Bruce Cockburn, Sam Kinison. These &quot;cultural artifacts&quot; tacitly state that OSC considers this throwaway work, to be forgotten soon enough for the already dated references to be irrelevant. Furthermore, these darn things just make OSC seem dorky and sloppy. I, personally don't like any of the artists mentioned, and hearing &quot;He's So Shy&quot; as the backdrop on the night Ivan and Katerina come to know one another.Most annoyingly, Ivan, a man with a God as a cousin and an adept witch as his mother, has no redeeming qualities other that a little athleticism and a lesson or two in first aid. He is a booding adolescent who kvetches, whines, and thinks himself more clever than he is. His character develops, but only as an adjunct to Katerina. I certainly unerstand and applaud the feminist argument, but then let Katerina have the promising parentage. Ivan is no mensch.Please, if you have not already, read Ender's Game for a taste of what OSC can do when he's not thinking about his next royalty check."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This book is just okay.

Mr. Card's a fine writer, but this book's just not all that good. It's a fairy tale, true, but the Good characters are SO good and the Bad characters are SO bad that there is virtually no tension in this story. Will Good triumph over Evil? DUH. Will Fathers be wise and sons obedient (so they can become wise fathers)? DITTO. Will there be the usual OSC lectures on Christian morality and family values along the way? You betcha. Card's characters have never inhabited a morally complex universe where doubt plagues people to the end of their days and the outcomes of stories--like those in life--are unforeseeable. For me, I fell off the Orson Scott Card bandwagon when he sold the Book of Mormon to Tor as a five-part science fiction series, his Homecoming &quot;epic&quot;. I thought I'd give him another chance with this book. Silly me."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I've been an Orson Scott Card reader for many years and this book was quite disappointing. The dialogue was stilted, unnatural and the characters poorly developed. I don't know when Card wrote this book, but it reads like it was written by someone writing for the first time.The basic story is good but the plot could have had better development and flow. The ending was a bit of a let down and a little to obvious. So unlike the Card I've come used to reading.I don't say you shouldn't read this book -- but if you're seeking Card's usual excellence you won't find it here. Read it much like a child's tale -- along with the underdeveloped grammar and 5th grade reading level."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Having read many of Card's books I was very disappointed with the quality of this new offering. It seems that over the years he has become more enamored with the carnal side of writing. What could once be considered a small part of the text has now become so pervasive as to dilute any story or plot line he is trying to tell. It seems that Mr. Card is drifting to the side of the sensational and abandoning the real art of story-telling. I was so disappointed with this book that I couldn't finish... a first for me."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Well this book was just too long, it drug for me.

I found myself skipping through huge sections of the book. Human dynamics a bit unrealistic as are the relationships. I had high hope, but this was a disappointment. This is definitely tedious and the melding of the past/future plus the inclusion of gods/magic was overreaching. Combat depictions were very contrived."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This book's basic idea is fairly similar to the one in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. However that's where the similarities end, this is placed in Ukraine (8th or 9th century) and deals with fairy tales origins. As far as I can tell it's making sense, known history wise, i.e. the world it describes is a mix of fairy tales and known history.Compared to other books by Orson Scott Card this one is about the same quality - there adventure has pace, story is interesting. Not sure if I would believe it was written by Ukrainian but there are no glaring mistakes, there are Ukrainian words mixed in where needed etc.FYI: this review is based on first third of the book, that's where I am at right now, will post updates if my opinion changes..."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"If you are a Scott-Card fan as I am, then you.know what to expect from his writing style.

I was just flipping through the shelves at my school library and came a across it. It looked interesting, so I picked it up and checked it out, the rest is history.I could not put this book down.

I reluctantly brought it back the next day to check out something else.That was nearly 8 years ago and no matter how much time passes, I still remember this book and keep on coming back to it. Buy it! You won't regret it. -- no matter how old I get, I will still pick this novel off the shelf and read it as many times as I can.Orson Scott Card is a genius in and of himself.

Ender's Game was wonderful. Alvin Maker is one of my favorites. I've read almost everything Card wrote and until the last two books, I didn't think he could write something I wouldn't like. Enchantment was cheesy and I didn't finish it. The book I read just before this one, Magic Street, was also a rehash of other tales. It was like he ran out of his own ideas and had to use someone else's. But he took the magic out of other worlds and tried to put it into this one and for me, it just didn't work. I might have to re-read something else he wrote just to remember why I liked his writing so much."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"...then you'll like this one.

I read this book and I thought that it was pretty good. It was a while ago that I read it, but that's okay. The story is about this kid and one day he goes to visit his Uncle. He wanders around the forests and finds a sleeping beauty. The story goes on from there. It was a good story, but when I picked it up, I guess it just wasn't what I was expecting. I am trying to find the perfect fantasy book about dragons and far off places. I am going to have to continue my search, but this was a good story. I have never read any Orson Scott Card books before, and I think that this one was probably quite different from the normal OSC books. I picked it up at the library one day with my friends, and I thought that it was going to be different. But I think that you should try it. It is a good story. But it just wasn't what I thought it was... and that is okay because I was hoping for a different kind of story. If any of you know any books that are about dragons and princesses and things, let me know. I am looking. Thanks."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This was a very interesting variation of a fairy tale. It was so different that I wouldn't presume to compare it to sleeping beauty, but that is the story that it most resembles. Ivan, a young boy fleeing Communist Russia with his parents, discovers a clearing covered with leaves in the ancient Carpathian forests when he is staying with his cousin. He sees a bump in the middle. A breeze shifts the dense layer of leaves that covers it, and the beautiful face of a sleeping princess shows underneath the leaves. Ivan starts to step forward to look closer, but the leaves shift to show a sheer drop. Not only that, but an ominous rustling of the leaves shows something moving towards where Ivan is. He runs, and determines never to go back.Years later, working on his degree, Ivan travels from America to where he lived in Russia. He researches for about a year, and decides to visit his cousin before he heads back to America. After a few days, he can no longer stand not knowing if he was delusional or not when he saw the clearing, so he visits it once more. Nothing has changed, and he decides that this time, the ominous rustling under the leaves is not going to scare him off. He runs around the clearing again and again, his hidden pursuer following him. Every time he goes around, more leaves drift off of the surface, until at last he can see his follower; an enormous bear, that is quite apparently intelligent.After a rather amusing ordeal with the bear, Ivan jumps across the wide chasm separating him from the pillar where the princess lies. He kisses her, and when she wakes up, the bear is clawing up the pillar, trying to attack the pair. The princess asks him to marry her in a very ancient dialect, that Ivan, as a student of ancient dialects like his father, understands. With the bear towering over them, he has little choice, so he asks her to marry him. The bear disappears, and a bridge appears. Ivan begins to cross it, and the princess begins to cross one that he cannot see. She insists that he cross with her, so he does. When he gets to the other side, it is many years in the past, and he has to deal with a medieval witch of fairy tales; Baba Yaga.Card had to do a lot of research and have a lot of knowledge about ancient Russia, different languages, and present-day Russia to write this book, for which I greatly respect him. However, this book has a cynical overtone which I dislike, and it champions superstition. Even though the story was excellent, this book left a bad taste in my mouth after I finished it."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Enchantment is the best thing Card has put out since Ender's Game. It is much more accessible than some of his science fiction (which I also love). What a wonderful way to retell a fairy tale. Card has a way of pulling the reader inside the story-the characters become as real as any person you have ever known. Anyone who loves the story of Sleeping Beauty will love this book."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"On the cover of the book it says that &quot;Orson Scott Card makes a strong case for being the best writer science fiction has to offer.&quot; I think this quote is completly off-base. He is possibly the best author ANY genre has to offer. A person who hated science fiction could easily fall in love with this book."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I am probably the only sci-fi/fantasy reader in the United States who read &quot;Enchantment&quot; as her introduction to Orson Scott Card's fiction. As unbelievable as it may sound, I avoided reading every OSC book, despite the fact that my sister and best friend did everything but read &quot;Ender's Game&quot; to me. You see, &quot;EG&quot; was once a class assignment (I chose to read Dickens' &quot;David Copperfield&quot; instead -- talk about your opposite book!), and after that, I refused to read it more out of obstinance than anything else. But I'm glad I read &quot;Enchantment.&quot;Coming right off the heels of Robin McKinley's &quot;Spindle's End,&quot; I wasn't sure &quot;Enchantment&quot; would be different enough to hold my attention. I was, fortunately, wrong! The best part about this book, aside from complete characters, effortless narration, and a compelling plot -- no small asides! -- was the fact that it had much more to do with what happened AFTER Ivan kissed and awoke the princess. We learned about her village, ancient Slavic culture and religion, magic (both ancient and modern) and the inner workings of an enchanted princess.Card handled 8 viewpoints with ease, though of course the dominant ones were Ivan, Princess Katerina, and the witch, Baba Yaga. As I am completely unfamiliar with Russian culture and folklore, I found OSC's version of Baba Yaga a completely hideous and believable villain; I was glad to get her viewpoint throughout the story. I also appreciated OSC's depiction of modern and ancient Russia, which to me are now familiar in my head. He conveys incredible amounts of information in few words, and the plot never lags; though this is a long book, it is a quick read. We also feel like we get to know the characters right away, and he writes with equal believability about women and men (I guess it helps to have a wife who proofreads your work :-) ).If you ever wanted to read an excellent story, get to know many interesting characters, and find out what happened after Sleeping Beauty woke up, read &quot;Enchantment&quot;!"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I'm a tough critic, and I don't throw around sentences like &quot;this is the best work of fantasy I've read in a year&quot; without giving the matter some thought. But this is a really superb story. I cannot see where it could have been done better, and I don't say that often.It's superb because it is told vigorously and plausibly. Assume for a few hours that gods and magic have been real, and that there can be magic bridges across time, and the actions of the characters make perfect sense. They are all intelligent problem-solvers - not only Ivan and his parents and Princess Katarina, but the witch-queen Baba Yaga and her captive Bear-god. At no point does Card feel the need to make a leading character into a dunce or a lunatic to shove the plot along.Card also avoids many pitfalls which you might be afraid that he fell into, given the subject matter and the fact that he really succumbed to some of them in the &quot;Alvin Maker&quot; series. For example, he does not bog the story down in discussing contemporary post-Soviet politics, or in the fine points of culture and technology in tenth-century Ukraine, nor in determining who the real heroes and villains were in Eastern Europe then, nor does he clutter the volume with every Russian folk tale element ever recorded. Nor, although this book does elaborate on the &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; story, is it merely a self-conscious &quot;retelling&quot; of the kind that we fantasy readers have come to dread, often in connection with Arthurian legend. The present and the past are nicely balanced and interwoven, and the center of attention throughout is on the story rather than on its setting and provenance.Furthermore, he manages to throw in a few surprising plot twists, which is difficult to do in a story like this, considering that you mostly expect that the hero and heroine are not going to get killed by Baba Yaga and it's mainly a question of how they will win. Nothing here is trite. Furthermore Card avoids the temptation to explain &quot;everything&quot; at the end or to develop a textbook on the laws of magic. He recognizes that some things have to be explained, but other things just work because that's how they work in fairy tales, and he draws the line between the two sets of things quite well.You know how you know that a book has really worked? After you are done with the book - you find that you aren't really done with it. You leaf back through it and re-read some of the nicely done parts and recapture how you felt at the first read-through. Then you put it on your shelf along with your other favorite books, where you can pick it up in a few months or a year and read it again. Not all that much stuff by Card has made it onto that shelf of mine, but this one has."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"When I first picked up this book, I expected it to be yet another one of those \\"modern Jewish person goes back in time to experience some aspect of Jewish history\\" trips. (Why is it that SF writers always have to send the Jews back into the past? Don't they think we will have a future?) Yes, there is an aspect of that here, but it's much, much more. The focus is not so much on JEWISH history as it is on RUSSIAN history, although Jewishness does play an important part.The year is 1975, the place is Soviet Russia. Young Ivan \\"Vanya\\" Smetski finds out he is Jewish when his father decides to claim his Jewish heritage in order to emigrate to Israel and then, hopefully, to the United States. Politically, it is a time when America is putting pressure on the USSR to release more Soviet Jews, but the Soviets react the other way and clamp down on letting Russian Jews leave. The result is that Ivan's father loses his university position, the Smetskis lose their apartment, and the family ends up living with a cousin named Marek on a little farm near Kiev. At this point, little Vanya is 10 years old.One day, while out in the woods by the farm, Vanya discovers a clearing with a strange round pit full of leaves. Something is moving in the pit -- a monster? The leaves rustle away and he thinks he sees a woman's face rising up among the leaves. He runs away in terror, but never forgets that place, although he thinks of it as some sort of nightmare or hallucination.Years later, the Smetskis are living in America, and Vanya, now calling himself \\"Ivan\\" with the English pronunciation, is working on his Ph.D. thesis about ancient Russian fairy tales. He returns to the part of Russia where he grew up (now part of the Ukrainian Republic) and eventually finds that same clearing in the forest. There is indeed a woman asleep on a pedestal in the middle of the pit -- and a huge enchanted bear is guarding her. Sleeping Beauty is real... Only it's not quite \\"happily ever after.\\" After kissing the princess, he must agree to marry her in order to get past the bear -- or be killed by it. He proposes and she accepts. He then follows her over a magical bridge into 10th-century Russia -- and into a major a culture shock. Suddenly he is in a barbaric world where literacy and scholarship count for next to nothing, and he is considered a useless weakling because he cannot wield a sword or battle axe. From then on, the real adventure begins...The book is a convincing mix of realism and magical fantasy that is based on serious historical research, but one thing did bother me in the beginning of the book. There is a rather strange scene where, after Professor Smetski decides to be openly Jewish, he has a mohel (ritual circumciser) come to the house to circumcise him and 10-year-old Ivan. Now, I do know that most Russiam Jews of that era were not circumcised because the Soviet government forbade it. I also know that, after emigration from Russia, many such Jews did have themselves circumcised as an affirtmation of their Jewishness. But I have not heard that they were doing it in a home operation in Russia. For adults, this operation is painful and dangerous and usually requires an overnight stay in the hospital. Plus, it was ILLEGAL in the Soviet Union and regarded as \\"practicing medicine without a license.\\" So nu, would a mohel risk imprisonment to do it like that? I'm not saying is NEVER happened, but I found the focus on circumcision somewhat disconcerting. Ivan's circumcision does play a part in the plot, however, so it could be taken as a literary device.The use of Russian fairy tales was interesting and believable. I was already familiar with the stories of Baba Yaga the wicked witch, but I did not know of the significance of the Bear in Russian folklore until I read this book. The story is taking place right at the time when Christianity is first reaching the area, and the people have not really given up their pagan beliefs. Magic still works because people believe in it, and the evil powers of Baba Yaga are very, very real. But so are the powers for good -- and they are not always coming from the Christian side, either. There's even a Jewish \\"good witch\\" who helps defeat Baba Yaga -- but more than that would be a spoiler."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I purchased this book in hardcover at a book signing and since have recommended to approximately 25 friends and relations. The reasons for the high recommendation are apparent in the first chapter. Card has an unparalleled ability to pen 3-dimensional characters with just a few words of conversation. While this book is ostensibly a modern reworking of Sleeping Beauty, Katarina, the princess, is no idealized archetype and Ivan is the most unlikely of heroes, though a thoroughly modern man. The warp of 20th century values and the woof of mythology create a wholly original yet still romantic tapestry for the author's exploration of such weighty topics as one's &quot;place&quot; in society and how one defines one's self-worth.Like most of Card's books this can be read on several different comprehension levels and it is equally enjoyable on all."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"If the &quot;happily ever after&quot; at the end of fairy tales never left you completely satisfied, then this is the book for you. In &quot;Enchantment&quot;, Orson Scott Card takes you beyond the &quot;happily ever after&quot; of the traditional story of Sleeping Beauty. The first few chapters introduce Ivan, a brilliant Russian graduate student living in America, and preparing to write a dissertation about Russian fairy tales. Just when Card's realism had me convinced that this could be a true story, Ivan stumbles across the sleeping princess Katerina, and awakes her with his kiss. But don't think that Card is just borrowing a fairy tale, because the end of the traditional story of Sleeping Beauty is merely the beginning of Card's tale! Ivan quickly discovers that kissing a princess doesn't result in living happily ever after, as he travels back in time to Katerina's world, and becomes involved with her in an epic struggle to defend the kingdom of her father over against the wannabe ruler, the witch Baba Yaga. In the course of this struggle, Ivan and Katerina travel to worlds past and present. This leads to some delightfully cultural comedy, where ninth century Russians get to use gunpowder and molotov cocktails and also have the rare privilege of seeing a 747 jumbo jet enter their world well ahead of its time. Card's story-telling is superb, and his fantastic blend of reality and magic, past and present, is wonderfully entertaining. There is constant suspense, romance, adventure and humour.But as usual, Card does much more than just tell a good story. His special attention to inner thoughts and struggles and the psychology of human relationships is masterful. In the course of telling his fairy tale, he shares numerous philosophical thoughts about literary theory, psychology, and religion. The clash between cultures achieves more than just comedy, but provides deep insights about the chasm between times, cultures, and religions (especially Judaism and Christianity - both of which are somewhat unfairly portrayed as mere outward rituals entered upon by circumcision or baptism). Card demonstrates that it is possible for two very different individuals from different times and cultures to make a new beginning together in a marriage, although this meeting of cultures cannot occur without both gaining and losing something at the same time.Especially thought provoking is the fact that Card uses a fairy tale to show that reality is not like the high fantasy of fairy tales, because in the real world that there is no such thing as living happily ever. Is Card satirizing the impossibly high ideals of beauty and happiness that fairy tales normally offer? I quickly found myself laughing at Card's harsh fantasy world, because it was one I recognized: the real world, my world, which in reality is often cold and harsh. We quickly discover that kissing a beautiful princess in the real world is not all it is made out to be. So we can identify with Ivan the naked prince - his shock at the harsh reality of a fairy tale come true (p.90) is our shock at the harsh reality of life.Perhaps to heighten the effect of a fairy tale that reflects reality rather than fantasy, Card frequently resorts to crude language, and sexually explicit details. Also the portrayal of the witch Baba Yaga and her sidekick Bear was at times unnecessarily morbid. It is undeniable that this contributes to the effect of bringing the fantasy to cold hard earth, but personally I found it unnecessary to go so far in order to create the effect he wanted, and from Card (a Mormon) rather surprising and unexpected. I find it a shame that by employing such language and giving attention to such crude details, Card has made this book suitable only for mature and discerning readers, and made it inappropriate even for older children.Card also uses the culture contrast between modernity and myth, past and present to criticize contemporary culture. Are Card's comments about the lack of respect for authority and the change in roles between husbands and wives (p.206) an implicit criticism of Western society? And is Ivan a mouthpiece for Card when he makes the observation that contemporary culture focuses on having itself remembered, whereas past culture focuses more on surviving (p.139)? And is the disappointing and harsh fantasy world that first promised so much intended to be a mirror image of life in the USA, which Ivan's Russian immigrant family also found disappointing (p.144)?These and more questions will amuse you for hours. &quot;Enchantment&quot; is certainly a wonderful marriage of fantasy and reality, past and present, magic and science, pleasure and philosophy. The crude details do leave a bit of a bad aftertaste, but like Ivan and Katerina's marriage, this marriage of modernity and myth in the end proves to be most successful and satisfying"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Once again, Orson Scott Card has done a masterful job of making fantastical situations seem realistic -- even the relationship between the malevolent witch, Baba Yaga, and her kidnapped Bear-god husband. This is a well written story of clashing cultures, modern and ancient, as well as clashing spiritualities: Christian, Jewish, Pagan. The novel is respectful of them all. It's also a romance with a happy ending that bridges both worlds. And contrary to what one reviewer wrote, Bruce Cockburn (whose lyrics are quoted in the novel) IS cool!"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"There are few dreamers of daydreams alive and writing about them well today. For those of us who ever did glance off in class or thrill at the mention of a bedtime story, \\"Enchantment\\" just might fail to put yourself effectively asleep. The story of Ivan, a man who jogs everywhere in an effort to find something purposefully aimful, and Katerina, the self-aware and talented princess waiting to satisfy an aim, keeps the reader turning each page just to hear their always amusing and wry commentary on the often clever problems that arise from the book's 400 or so pages. The two are bound inexplicably by the laws of fairytale magic to help each other overcome the perils of black curses, time travel conundrums, a bad decision to wear a hoose, a jilted neurotic fiance and ultimately the unexpectedly comedic duo of a ... bear god and the hilariously evil witch that binds him to her to save the kingdom of Taina.So many threads and themes are woven together, but it really is no wonder a good writer like Card did not lose himself in the muck. (After all, this IS the writer of \\"Ender's Game.\\" *cue cheers from the crowd*) You don't have to read the acknowledgements to see the legions of fascinating cultural and folktale details that flesh out the book's world. Characters of fantasy speak like they were auditioning for a TV show lines. Powerful beings dwell in ordinary places. Jewish, Christian and more ancient religions clash (and will certainly offend the easily offended). It is a book that does much to revive that something somewhere inside of you that wishes magic were real.Nevertheless, Card lessens this incantation a tad by giving most of his creations that smarmy, modern fantasy character logic that they all like to work out in brilliant detail for the reader to understand. Even as Card mocks crazed feminists, the modern language of Oprah and Seven Habits of Highly Effectual People merge with psychological insight most wish they could muster. The effect is like it always is today: character's who lose some of the freedom of interpretation and who are not carved with the graceful, mysterious lines a true literary master would give them. To give Card credit, at least he does not make them as irritatingly dense as Jordan, Goodkind and many others are wont to do on a quest for round, three dimensional characters.Certainly, while it does not rise out of the most of the genre's weakness, \\"Enchantment\\" does not fall to half of their worst devices either. Plot threads unravel evenly, not to suddenly stack odds back and forth in order to trick the reader into thinking great shifts happen. Slow, deliberate developments actually develop! Enough pages are taken to slow down to intelligence's pace, but even more admirable, to speed up for the sake of the plot! While I would have loved to know what happened to Terrel, it wasn't necessary, and it is where many others would have devoted 50 pages to an ancillary character in a bruised need to feel \\"epic.\\" Card understands the craft better to conjure a sometimes suspenseful, often hilarious, every now and then educational, but always unfailingly modern charm on anyone who reads the story. The denouement was particularly sweet, as few these days of never-ending fantasy are.Original enough to surprise even fantasy fans, but lacking real power outside the well-told yarn, you could certainly weave much worse magic spells than the riveting \\"Enchantment\\" out of a book store."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"In my love-hate relationship with Orson Scott Card's work, this is a definite high point. Here, Card abdicates his frequent role as second-rate moralist, content to be a first-rate storyteller. The result shines.The simplest description of this book is a retelling of Sleeping Beauty with a modern-day grad student magically transported back in time to play protagonist. This is factually correct, but does the book no justice. The Sleeping Beauty tale only instigates the action, and while Card keeps brilliantly true to the feel of the fairy tale, the story is really about what happens during &quot;happily ever after.&quot;The book's appeal lies in Card doing what Card does best. He draws appealing, compelling characters -- the opening character sketch of the protagonist Ivan's childhood in the Soviet Union would justify finishing a far lesser novel. He shows clashes between cultures, Christian vs. pagan, medieval vs. modern, without taking sides. Through it all, he saves himself from the trap of being unforgivably sentimental by filling the book with potent, witty humor. A series of scenes where Baga Yaga, magically transported to the present day, tries to cope with modern life, is particularly classic.There isn't a lot of deep meaning to be had in this book, but it doesn't aspire to have much. It is simply a enjoyable, compelling story, not in any frivolous sense, but in a very beautiful one."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Not a typical Card book, but then, what exactly is a \\"typical Card book\\"?It starts with a beautiful portrayal of a Jewish Boy growing up in Russia, moves to some gritty \\"it-sounded-good-in-theory\\" fantasy, which in turns alternates with fairy-tale fantasy. The fairy-tales are appropriately Russian, and along the way the truth behind many classical Russian folklore stories is revealed.Yes, it's as funny as it sounds.Add to that great Orson Card characters, and the strength his moral believes often lend to his books, and you get what would have been considered a masterpiece if written by anyone else. I haven't read his biblical series, but it compares well to his terrific \\"Hart's Hope\\" fantasy, blows his horror books out of the water, and is at least on par with his SF.I can't believe no one noticed this book, maybe because it's mostly fantasy. Highly recommended, even to those who think they only like Card for his SF."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"this book did for me in fantasy what Ender's Game did for me for science fiction.

He finds the sleeping princess in a clearing in the woods and must battle past a bear to awaken the princess with a kiss.In order to save both of their lives to save themselves from the \\"stunned\\" bear, he has to promise to marry her. Not realizing what that means he follows the princess and finds himself transported back in time one thousand years to the princess' real time. It is a time where men battle by the sword and there is an evil witch that is after the throne which was to be inherited by the princess and her \\"husband.\\"Ivan realizes that what he never took too seriously has just become real and he has to figure a way to stay alive and find his way back to his own time. This is difficult because only the princess can bring him back and she is loathe to do that because it would give her kingdom to the evil witch.Card is an multi-talented writer who has spun a superb tale that I could not put down until I read every last page!"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"When I say this is one of the best books I've ever read, believe me, it's a compliment!

It's very lighthearted-even the violent parts tended towards being satiric.The characters are AMAZING. The're extremely likeable, yet not &quot;phony&quot; like so many of the books I've read (A compliment that has thus far only been reserved for the Master himself, Stephen King). Even the villans were likable, you didn't want them to win, but it doesn't it seem such a shame to destroy them?Overall, I found myself laughing out loud many times. It's really hilarious.I think this book really reveals a new depth to Orson Scott Card (for me, at least). The Ender's series tended towards being serious. I didn't even know he was capable of this kind of work! It may disappoint hard core sci-fi fans, but anyone who likes bestsellers or fantasy or romance should throughly enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"As a young boy, Ivan stumbles across a strange clearing in the forest near his Uncle Marek's farm. In the middle of the clearing lies a beautiful young woman. However, before Ivan can get any closer, he is startled by something moving in the brush, and runs away. Years later, upon returing to the area to complete his dissertation, Ivan finds himself drawn back to that enchanted place, to see if it was not just a figment of his young mind. It isn't. The story that follows takes Ivan and the woman (a princess named Katerina) back to her time, a thousand years in the past. The only way to save Katerina's kingdom is for the two to marry, yet Ivan has a fiance back in America...in the 1990s. The story is nicely down in the fact that it is told from many people's viewpoints. However, sometimes the discussion of language left me utterly bored. The book has some parts that are difficult to wade thru, but you do want to stay till the end to see how everything works out and if ANYONE is who they claim they are."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I have a great admiration for Card, he is a fabulous writerbut this book just wasn't all that good.I was excited to see a writer(especially one as great as Card) use the traditional Russian version of the fairy tale and quickly bought this book while it was in hardback.As a big fan of the Sleeping Beauty tale this was very unsatisfying. I liked Vanya/Ivan but couldn't abide Sleeping Beauty. The story felt weak and unapealing and IMHO only the scenes with Baba Yaga and her Bear husband were interesting and clever. By the time I was done I felt very disapointed and sad that Card had not done as well with capturing what is so good about the tale. His characters were mostly cardboard stereotypes and inacurate ones at that from what other reviewers have said. The Princess was so unappealing I was wondering if this was a version of the Frog Prince and not Sleeping Beauty.Oh well the are pleanty of other excellent versions of this wonderful tale. Try \\"Spindles End\\" by Robin McKinnley or \\"Beauty\\" by Sheri Tepper(this book is NOT for kids though!)if you want a fresh spin on an old tale."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"A friend online recommended it, and I liked the premise. It's definitely novel--a story about someone who gets to go into a Russian fairy-tale. Well, I liked it--it's witty, well-written, the characters are engaging, particularly Ivan and Esther (I wasn't crazy about Katerina), and OF COURSE, the WIDOW!!! The parts about the Widow and the Bear are hillarious. So I would, in general, recommend it.Now for the negative. I took away a star because a lot of times, the \\"real\\" sections were not believable. Ivan's family are supposed to be Russian Jews--well, being one myself, I have to tell you--hardly. First of all, Judaism is an ethnicity in Russia, and with it, come certain attributes: names, occupations, physical attributes, areas of settlement. You'd be hard-pressed to find a Russian Jewish boy named Ivan Petrovich Smetski. Or, for that matter, a whole family of Jews studying proto-Slavonic. Or any that have farmers for cousins (Russian Jews are city dwellers). I understand that Ivan was supposed to be Ivan so that he could reappear in Russian tales, but...Also, I had a bit of trouble with how easily he accepts his baptism. Even though Jews in Russian were not particularly religious (probably less so than Ivan, who accepts circumcision at a grown age), most would ABHORR baptism. The word for a baptized Jew--\\"vykrest\\"--is a synonym of \\"apostate.\\" It's not a good thing to be baptized, and I wonder how simple it's all for Ivan.Other than that, a pretty cute book."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"The novel Enchantment can essentially be described in one simple phrase: Impossible to put down. Normally, I read one chapter of a novel then become disinterested, but not with Enchantment. Orson Scott Card writes so fluidy, and the plot so flawless that this novel is truly &quot;enchanting.&quot; After reading it, I felt as if I had learned a great deal about Russian heritage, as well as being entertained by the story of witches, magic charms, forgotten kingdoms, and most importantly, what true love really is."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I was amazed at the wonderful grace with which Orson Scott Card has transformed the classic story of Sleeping Beauty into a entrancingly original tale. I had a hard time putting the book down and was enthralled by the eloquent prose."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"In ENCHANTMENT, Orson Scott Card has nimbly avoided repetition of the coming-of-age trials familiar to those readers who already know Ender and Alvin, and he has deftly retained his familiar style and successful 'character evolution' motif set in a fresh plot and refreshing environment concocted from Carpathian folk lore, time-travel, a magic versus science dynamic, and even religious philosophy. As the characters and action move back and forth across time and space, fable and history, Card poses some interesting questions. How useful is knowing all the modern versions of a folk tale when one is suddenly confronted by the culture and events that gave rise to the earliest 'reality-based' version of that tale? What happens when 'The Wizard of Oz' and 'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' are the hero's only travel and etiquette guides and the local Wicked Witch can enchant her way through the international airline reservation system while the hero has to pay for a full-price ticket because he is not recognized as Sir Boss in either the past or the present? Card is particularly skillful in making the villains perform as both the comic relief and the characters who most successfully adapt to the culture shocks of time and [modern] air travel. Read ENCHANTMENT to find out what was REALLY wrong with that miserably uncomfortable seat you were assigned on your last trans-Atlantic flight.ENCHANTMENT is a good introduction to the work of Orson Scott Card and an excellent reason for digging out any of Card's earlier books that are too far from the top of one's To Read pile. The ending does not preclude a sequel, but ENCHANTMENT stands alone in a most satisfying fashion. Applying the same view point and hypotheses to another folk tale from another culture would work as well as a continuation of this well-resolved story. Still, now we know the origin of the chicken leg [or legs], but what about the flying mortar and pestle?"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"&quot;Enchantment&quot; is really rather less than enchanting - it is frustrating. It's a masterpiece with a flaw, like a beautiful boy with a goiter. The story itself is a masterpiece of about 100 pages, which is terminally flawed with another 300 pages of unbelievably bad filler. The whole sequence about the hero wearing woman's clothing is a dead duck of the purest water. Likewise the part where the male hero tries to live in the past. The very interesting bits, which make this novel worth its while, are where the female hero comes to present-day America; and where the reader suddenly realises that magic may still be at large in the present time. &quot;Enchantment&quot; shows all the signs of a story told in the wrong way. Card rushes into the main storyline in a few pages, and the ending likewise feels like a bad case of story diarrhoea. The middle bit is questionable in the extreme. This is probably a very good example of research taking over a story. It's certainly not a good example of storytelling."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This is a review of the audio version as acted by Stefan Rudnicki and Gabrielle de Cuir. The story itself is as good as any relatively modern fantasy / fairy tale. A great story, easy to follow. The acting by Rudnicki and de Cuir is excellent and never overshadows the power and fun of the story. A great escape that has made my commute something to look forward to everyday."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I absoultely loved this novel. It's just fun to read and presents a very unique fairy tale, traveling from the present to the distant past. A must read!"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Orson Scott Card's recreation of the fairy tale &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; in his book Enchantment. The main character, Ivan Semetski, discovers a beautiful young woman sleeping on a pedestal in the middle of a perfectly round chasm when he was 10 years old. After this experience, he can never forget that chasm, even after he moves away. He returns to the chasm as a college graduate and rescues Katerina. He then travels to her world in 890 C.E. and trains to become a knight so he can lead the people in war when he is king. During this time, Ivan learns about his fiance's culture and her contempt for him. Escaping an assassination attempt right after their marriage, Ivan and Katerina travel to his world in modern 20th century. Here, Katerina learns about people like Ivan and learns to love him. They then return to the Kingdom of Taina to try and defeat Katerina's country's worst enemy.Card made this book a fun read through his use of words in describing different challenges to the protagonist, both moral and physical. His control of scenery and portrayal of characters is exceptional, although, like everyone, he has room to improve. His books make you want to try your hand at writing, to see if you, too, can produce such marvelous works."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Orson Scott Card knows how to bring all elements of a story together. And here, working from the legends of Russian and western European fairytales, he does an amazing job!"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Card is probably my favorite author. And the diversity of stuff he puts out, as demonstrated by this book, which is nothing like anything else he's ever written, but still excellent, is one reason why."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I like the touches that Card puts into his work that just make it that much more readable. I've always been a big fan of his, and this book does nothing to diminish that. I love his characters, how he develops them and how he makes us empathize with them; I couldn't wait to find out what happened next."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Very humorous characters and ways of constructing sentences. At times the story got dull, but the witty ways of thinking kept me through. I never though sci-fi could be so exciting. Now I see why Orson Scott Card is so beloved."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Of course, the amazing attributes of fantasy and story-telling spoken of in the other reviews seen on this web-page all apply to my enjoyment of this book, the love story cannot be overlooked. While Card has proven that he can weave a love story into a novel without damaging the plot before, this was a particularly moving romantic sub-plot.Card has been a favorite of mine for over a decade, but I am amazed at how his writing keeps getting better."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This is one of the best books with a twisted fairy tale story I have ever read. Who ever knew that Disney had not perfected the story of Cinderella. Try this book, it's good."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"the book was great all I really want to know though is who was Baba Tila?"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This is a very enjoyable retelling of Sleeping Beauty with several twists thrown in. Because I'm not a Ph.D. in Russian folklore (apparently unlike some of the other reviewers) I found the storyline fun, entertaining and consistent. As an adult I appreciated the sexual tension between the main characters and of course a satisfying consummation of their relationship.I actually preferred this tale to straight magical realism. One of the elements of magical realism is that the charcters must accept the magic as normal. That's taxing on our suspension of disbelief. In \\"Enchantment,\\" on the other hand, the main characters are forced to grapple with the magic and find creative ways of dealing with, and using it.Another reviewer wrote that the book could be read out loud. As a father to nine- and seven-year-old girls I might consider reading the book to them, at least a chapter or two, although I think I might skip over some of the gorier stuff, as well as pp. 328-331."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I almost didn't buy this book because the title and the cover art seemed a little feminine. But then I said to myself, &quot;Hey, this guy has never written ANYTHING I didn't love. So I bought the book and realized something: Orson Scott Card could probably write a grocery list that would be more interesting than most of what's on the shelf today! Buy the book. Don't be stupid. (Like I nearly was.) Card, you da'MAN!"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Orson Scott Card is a fine writer, with beautiful descritpions who brings forth a fresh look to the familiar and (often hard to re-tell) story of Sleeping Beauty.The story starts out following Ivan, born in Russia during the height of communism a ten-year-old Ivan stumbles upon a beautiful maiden sleeping frozen in time on a stone slab in the midst of an ancient forest in the heart of Russia.Years later after Ivan and his parents have long since departed Russia and have raised their son in America. A grown up Ivan returns to Russia only to rediscover an unspoken promise made to the sleeping maiden to rescue her and marry her. Only Ivan's very much in love and engaged to another woman back home in America! Stumbling between a very ancient Russia held under the thumb of the mythical witch Baba Yaga and her ensnared god-husband a gigantic Bear the spirit of Russia. Ivan must become the right man to marry the sleeping Princess and ultimately battle Baba Yaga herself.While no one can deny Card is a beautiful story teller, with a knack for decscription that neither weighs one down but also gives the reader the impression there are right there in the middle of Russia traversing with Ivan. Where Orson fails ultimately is characterization and giving us rather realistically drawn characters but also realistic in their unappeal.Ivan often comes off as whiny, unsympathetic and bit of a push-over, it's unbelievable how Ivan lets others around him litterally push him from one adventure to the next without putting up a fight. A constant angsty &quot;Me-against the world&quot; teenaged battle isn't desired but some kind of character backbone is wished for by this reader. Ivan puts up some what of a fight when he learns that by simply stumbling upon the sleeping princess Katarina he unintentionally made a promise to her, but later simply grudgingly accepts his fate and rather sadly and promptly forgets his fiance back at home.Whilst Card paints an excellent view of mideval Russia. Perhaps a bit better and clearer then a communist U.S.S.R and post comunist Russia. He fails to deliver any sympathy for the people of ancient Russia or the mighty princess that Ivan and everyone are supposed to be so enchanted by.Katarina is probably what ruined the book upon this reader, she is once selfish, demanding, close-minded, horribly stubborn yet (as Card practically shoves upon us) a good ruler who cares for her all people and also (as he constantly shoves in our faces, even by Ivan) that's she's very very beautiful and innocent looking. So of course, because she's so beautiful we must instantly be enchanted by her. Her semi-spoiled behavior is understandable as she is a princess who is doated upon by her Father and her rather frustrating behavor and reaction to Ivan when he crosses over to Ancient Russia, as he comes from a time (and a place) very much removed from the fuedal era people around him. But this is where Card fails, he fails to &quot;Show&quot; on the part of Katarina, instead he tells. Instead of showing what a wonderful ruler she is or why we should truely support her throughout the novel he simply tells us. She is redeemed slightly when she travels to American with Ivan and starts to cool down on her constant critism of him but still fails to capture this readers attention or sympathy.Baba Yaga and her husband however, though obviously the antagonists of the story are beautifully done. Despite Baba Yaga being painted as &quot;EVIL EVIL EVIL&quot;, she manages to capture this readers interest and hold it throughout. Even after the end.Other characters in this novel, like a cliched Hallmark movie have their own special &quot;quirks&quot; but lack some enderaing qualities that truely make them stick out in this readers mind. Even the news that *SPOILER* that Ivan's Uncle is in fact an ancient Russian god himself *SPOILER*. Failed to really endure him or his wife or the rest of his family onto this reader.Whilest Card does a spelnded job bringing a new and fresh light to the old fairy tale Sleeping Beauty (This readers personal favorite). He fails on the part of creating enduring characters to really prop this book up to the Five stars it should deserve.Since finding a truely good Sleeping Beauty retelling is hard to find, while this book sticks out better then some it's still not quite the best that it could be. This reader, herself was decidedly UN-enchanted by Enchantment.~Jade Kith"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"At a book signing, Mr. Card mentioned that men did not buy the book because of the cover. Since I began reading this book on-line, I didn't have that hurdle. Guys, buy this book and ignore the cover, or at least SAY it is for you wife/girlfriend/daughter/neice!]This is a modern retelling of Sleeping Beauty set in the milieus of ancient and modern Russia. And if that doesn't wet your appetite, nothing will! It tells the story of an track-star/literature student from the Soviet Union who learns that he is really Jewish. After the Velvet Revolution, Ivan returns to Russia to visit his uncle, and there he sees her: Sleeping Beauty!This book is, as only Orson Scott Card can do, is a whirlwind of adventure, time travel, several &quot;First Contact&quot; scenarios, and, yes, romance! I read this book simultaneously with &quot;Timeline&quot; by Crichton, and Mr. Card blew him out of the water! &quot;Timeline&quot; was rather thin and runny, like bland oatmeal. A friend of mine pointed out that the book was more of screenplay than novel, and he also showed me some of the plot holes!Mr. Card, however, told a thick, well done New York steak of a tale. The characters were well developed, and did develop in the course of the story. The secondary characters actually had a pulse, and were not cardboard cutouts. And beneath this all was an affirmation of mutual respect across culture and time barriers; the sanctity of marriage in society; and the ultimate triumph of good.Mr. Card does a superb job of crafting characters that work within family organizations. As he pointed out in his introduction to &quot;Speaker for the Dead,&quot; most characters in books are free-roaming adolescents that run around solving other peoples problems. (Can you imagine Superman being a bishop? With all those interviews?) Card has a very tight family organization, which reflects how people really operate in the real world. Sherlock Holmes is single, and Watson's wife is a pale shadow of a person.One interesting plot point that Mr. Card does not develop is the importance of childbearing. It is interesting that part of the plot would be predicated on pregnancy. More Mormon family values!This is one of Mr. Card's well-crafted books. I know that many non-Latter-day Saints read these books and I hope that he can influence everyone for the good."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This is a book that gently pulls at you to keep readingSome books, including those by Card, hook you with an urgency to complete them. This book gently invites you to keep going.I strongly disagree with M.K. Whitmer's comments. This book is not prurient or obsessed with sex. The scenes which might be conidered carnal show vast cultural differences between the past and the present and show the difficulties of each main character in adjusting to the other era. The marriage bed scene is written to clearly emphasize the love in the relationship, not the sex. I was amazed at its gentleness."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Most of us probably heard the fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty when we were children. Card takes the classic fairy tale and gives it a unique, modern spin.Ten-year-old Ivan finds an unusual clearing in a dense, Carpathian forest. In the center of the clearing is a pedestal encircled by fallen leaves. Atop the pedestal is a sleeping maiden. However, Ivan detects a sinister presence beneath the leaves and runs for the safety of his cousin's farm.Years later, Ivan is a graduate student in America. Shortly after becoming engaged, Ivan returns to his native land to work on his doctoral thesis. Unable to forget that clearing in the woods, Ivan returns to determine if what he saw was merely a young boy's fantasy. Finding the clearing just as he left it, he does not run away this time. Ivan awakens the sleeping maiden with a kiss and is transported into a kingdom that vanished over a thousand years ago.This is a love story unlike any I've ever read before. Card touchingly describes the love that grows between two strangers from vastly different worlds. Deftly transferring between 9th century Russia and the 1990's, Card tells the classic tale of witches, enchantment, knights and princesses. Card meticulously researched Russian folk tales to give the story an authentic Russian flavor. The original Sleeping Beauty tale had a happy ending, but Card keeps you guessing about the outcome of his version until the very end.Card's first novel, Ender's Game, featured a very inventive, engaging plot but scant character development. However, it still established Card as a major force in the science fiction and fantasy genres. With the release of Enchantment, Card demonstrates his growth as an author. Enchantment shows that not only does he continue to generate creative plot lines, but that first-rate character development is firmly within his grasp. Children from 8 to 80 can enjoy this book!"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Having read all of the Ender and Shadow books by Mr. Card, I wasn't sure what to expect from a fantasy story. I was pleasantly surprized. It wasn't all fluff as some fairy tale re-makes sometimes are. I was also happy to see that Mr. Card's wit and style was easily seen in this different genre.the story it's self started with a seemingly mudane situation, but having read his other works, I stayed with it and was hamsomely rewarded with a wonderful flight of fancy. Half way through the book, I was thinking Surely this has to be the end. But it can't b, i still have half the book to go\\" I found myself thinking the same thing with a lot of the Ender and Shadow books.I am more detrmind than ever to read as many of his books as I can get a hold of after this reasurance that his wonderful style and tallent are evident in all his works (at least so far)."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"With one or two exceptions, I don't read much fantasy. I like historical fiction, primarily. If it's not rooted in semi-reality/real history, I'm not interested. But this story appealed to me, because the hero is a modern guy. Although all that Magic-speak was totally foreign to me.Two things led me to buy the book: the intertwining of legend and time-travel. And my own romantic notions about Sleeping Beauty. Admittedly, I wished the two leads liked each other more from the beginning--it takes almost two hundred pages for them to be civil to each other. They suffer from misconceptions about what the other is thinking far too long. Once they &quot;get together,&quot; the rest of the novel falls into place rather neatly. It might be the climax of the novel, but I wanted them to like each other a whole heckuva lot sooner.There are long passages when the hero, Ivan, goes off into tangents of thought, which I actually liked, because they were grounded in reality. You'd think I would have had trouble bouncing back and forth through time over a thousand years, but I didn't--although I wish I knew some explanation other than &quot;Magic&quot; that made it all happen. This was my first time reading Card, and I'd read something else by him."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This is probably Orson Scott Card's best book. It's not necessarily my favorite of his--although it is one of my favorite books--but all the aspects of his writing, from pacing to plot to prose, are excellent in Enchantment in a way that I very rarely see. Added to this excellence, as if that isn't enough, are some themes and ideas that really speak to me, including mythology and folk tales, philology, fairy-tales re-imagined, literacy, Judaism, academia, and more.The story is basically a re-imagining of the tale of Sleeping Beauty, but with a Russian flavor. It's part Russian historical fiction, part Slavic folklore, part fairy tale, part modern fantasy, as Ivan, a student of Russian folklore, crosses from the present to the past and back again, falls for a beautiful woman, and makes history (or is that mythology?) as he battles one of the villains of Russian folklore.The title is probably the worst part of the book, aside from this version's cover, because both of them give an incorrect impression that there's a lack of depth and darkness of the book, and makes it look...sparkly. And flowery. Well, it's not."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I read this book over a year ago and while there were some rough parts trying to keep up with all the information, when I finished it, I realized that it was a great book.

I look forward to reading it again to see if it goes smoother this time.Be prepared to really give your brain a workout but it'll feel great when you finish..."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"**This review has spoilers**There are several books that take on the clash of science and magic, and the medeival versus the modern, but few are as entertaining as this proves to be. What's refreshing is Card's even handedness in dealing with the modern American culture and the old Russian cultures without appearing too condescending.Ivan was kind of a wimp, and Katerina actually seemed much too strong and too quick in dealing with the modern world. I kind of wished at times she'd find some guy who wasn't such a whiny wuss, but at least he redeems himself more or less. Still, the characters are drawn very well and realistically, and you can't help but root for them.The main problem with the book is, like all books that procribe magic that actually works, is that it acts like too much of a deux ex machina, and the author can get away with doing anything he wants with it, and can just make up the rules as he goes, unlike what can be done with science, like how Baba Yaga, though too weakened to take on a housewife, can teleport a plane back to the tenth century."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Okay, lets start with the fact that I'm a big Orson Scott Card fan.

It's a page-turning romantic adventure which covers an amazing assortment of new ground with its &quot;magico-realism&quot; depiction of contemporary Ukraine, retired folk deities, Jewish kitchen magic, 10th century Eastern Orthodoxy and the Russian witch Baba Yaga.

But thanks to amazon reviewers, I liked it because it was a fairy tale. Ivan, a Russian Jew, stays at his Uncle's home while he waits for his visa to come so he can leave Russia with his mother and father and start a new life in America. But while he is wandering the woods near his Uncle's house he finds a woman lying asleep with a huge bear guarding her. He remembers it when he comes to Russia as a young college student visiting his Uncle. He goes back to the woods and find the woman still being guarded by the bear. Thinking she's in some kind of trouble, he defeats the bear (he's also an athlete) by outrunning it and exhausting it and then finally taking one of its eyes out. He kisses the woman and she awakens. He finds out her name is Katerina. But soon Ivan finds out that he has to follow her over a bridge because like Sleeping Beauty, he has to marry her. Ivan finds out that the bridge leads to 890 AD, which is the time period that Katerina is from. Katerina turns out to be the Princess of a kingdom he has never heard of. Because he is to be the future king Ivan has to learn how to fight in battle and he finds out that he is not meant to be a soldier at all and he has to deal with an evil witch named Baba Yaga that wants the princess's kingdom. On his wedding night he and Katerina escaped to 1992, the time that Ivan lived. They take gunpowder and other modern weapons back to 890 and teach the people there how to use them so they can defeat Baba Yaga. This book deserves more than 5 stars!! Orson Scott Card really knows his stuff!!"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"What if Sleeping Beauty really was not a fairy tale, but a true stroy that had been turned into a legend? What if she really did exist? Card writes about a modern young man, Ivan, who stumbles upon a sleeping beauty. He then asks her to marry him just like the fairy tale, except he does it to prevent a bear, who is really a god from eating him. The story progresses from Ivan following Katarina into her kingdom, which is from the Russian dark ages to fighting a wicked witch named Baba Yaga. Card bounces nicely back and forth from the modern world to the primevil world. His antagonist, Baba Yaga is a great evil witch who places the princess under a spell to steal the kingdom for herself. She is at once both the ugly fairy who places a curse on Sleeping Beauty and the wicked queen of Snow White. I could not put this book down the entire read. It is very engrossing and fun. Card does a wonderfull job of interweaving the reality of the old world problems and the fairy tale. He writes about the warts left out of the fairy tales about views and medevil thoughts, but leaves enough magic in the story to leave the reader cheering at the end of the book. This is truly a masterpiece. I am so glad I had read it. You will be also."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The premise is similar to another favorite of mine, Sherri Tepper's &quot;Beauty,&quot; but in my opinion Card tells the story in a more engaging and entertaining manner. I particularly liked the ever-nasty Baba Yaga. She's as bad as can be, and I wouldn't want to run into her outside of a book, but I delighted in the scenes in which she would appear.This isn't thought provoking or life changing literature, but it makes for some fun, casual reading -- and is a heck of a lot more entertaining than a few hours in front of the television. I haven't read anything else of Card's work, but this book served as a great introduction, and I'm looking forward to more."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I can see where some people think that the book it to wordy, but its not wordy enough to get in the way. I believe this book was really one of the best books I have ever read, I was actually quit sad when I realized that I was nearing the end of the book. Card writes the book so well, that if you're not careful, you might find yourself falling on love with Katrina or Ivan (depending on wether youre a guy or girl). You feel like you're with them as they go through their adventure together, and you can get completely lost in the detail (good) If you even ever thought about reading it, do it. Believe, once you start you'll be done within the next two days."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"What can I say but that I am an Orson Scott Card fan. I have read most books by him and believe me when I say that he has an incredible imagination. Enchantment is by far the best book he has writen in a while. The characters in this book are very much realistic and grow as this book reaches the end. The story itself is a modern Sleeping Beauty, but what is most interesting is that the story begins when the prince kisses the beauty. It is a great story because you don't know what to expect and is a great combination of science-fiction and a little comforting romance. My kind of book. Read it, you'll like it!"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I started reading &quot;Enchantment&quot; one year ago. I found I could not get past the first 35 pages. It's not that the story wasn't interesting, I just couldn't do it. I then picked up the book again recently and was able to finish it in a few days.Card has an unique way of writing. You really have to pay attention or you'll drift off and found you've missed a great deal of information. We get into the character's heads and we can see what they're thinking.This time around, I could finish the book for one simple reason: I was going to finish it no matter what. I wasn't able to a year ago because I thought it would be a casual read...it wasn't, at least, not for me. Not that that is a bad thing. Quite the contrary, I think that you have to find a book that you have to put a conscious effort into reading it, rather than just it being spoon-fed to you.One quibble I have about the book is it's length. Did anyone but me notice the small type and how the space on the pages were maximized so that it was almost dizzying to look at? The long explanations were, at times, needed, but not every time. The reader does not need to know everything. I think it's satisfying when we're left with a little mystery.All in all, this book did turn into a page turner by the mid 200s. An excellent story told with an interesting time travel twist to it."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I hate the cover art, but this is one of Card's best works.Our hero gets transported back into the middle ages after finding and kissing a sleeping maiden. And unlike all of the other books with similar themes ('Connecticut Yankee', Frankowski's &quot;Conrad Stargard&quot; series, etc) - this guy really has no idea how to bring the 'future' with him into the past.As always with a Card book, the character development is excellent - with a great deal of time spent looking at the clash of cultures and belief systems. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"If you believe that fairy tale is only for kids, well think again! This is not your ordinary fairy tale because first, it's not happily ever after immediately! And that what makes this story a must-read! The characters are so real that they almost jump out of the pages of the book.The subtle romance of Ivan and Katerina makes you pin for them. The humor is so there.Baba Tila is not your usual villainess. gads, you'll even root for her! So buy, this. You'll never put this down once you star reading it!"},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I am not a fan of eastern European folklore. Heck, I'm not a fan of most folklore in general. Going into Enchantment, who'da thought I'd fall in love with a warped Russian folk tale?Anyway, this is a fancified tale involving the Russian stories of Sleeping Beauty and Baba Yaga, and a great one at that. I found myself transported to a hamlet in old Russia, faced with the problems of the people...and I was hooked. I could not put this book down, and 18 hours and 419 pages later, I was finished, left with a sense of awe and a longing for a sequel that was not to be.One of the things best pulled off in Enchantment is Card's accuracy to the folktales. I read that he recieved help from scholars and common people who knew Russian folklore from the inside. He knew that a common failing in adapted fairy tales is a skewed (and typically wrong) view of things. Enchantment escapes that problem. I have yet to find a fatal flaw in any of its writing.In a word, enchanting. =)"}]`),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},R=["disabled"],M={key:0},j={key:1};function E(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",B,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",j,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",M,"See more"))],8,R)):b("",!0)])}const q=u(F,[["render",E],["__scopeId","data-v-93157cd6"]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/66.md","filePath":"drive/66.md"}'),P={name:"drive/66.md"},H=Object.assign(P,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(q)]))}});export{D as __pageData,H as default};
