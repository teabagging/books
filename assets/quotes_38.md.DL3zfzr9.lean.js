I should have known from the very flat looking pancakes on the front cover that I was not going to find them in this book, but when I ran across this book at the HPB store, I decided to give it a shot. I followed the recipe to the letter...room temp ingredients, griddle at right temp, let batter rest, etc...however the pancakes rose only slightly and fell before completely cooked. And even after 3 min one side and 2 min on other, their texture was still undercooked. Flavor was very good, but even after cranking up the gas on the griddle, these pancakes still came out disappointing flat. All of my ingredients were fresh, so I can only conclude that their is too much liquid--2 cups buttermilk plus 1/2 cup milk to 2 cups flour thinned out the batter too much.This book is going in the library donations pile."},{"Title":"The Pancake Handbook","review":"I've tried several of the recipes and all worked well.

Readers with experience in negotation will find themselves looking up from time to time saying, \\"Oh, that thing has a formal name!\\" For example, the tendency of one party to discount or ignore conciliatory overtures from the other side is called \\"reactive devaluation.\\" Labelling the concepts isn't necessarily of any use in the throes of a negotiation, but can be useful as a guide for analysis, and it was very interesting.Not as simple as _Getting to Yes_, on which it obviously builds (I think all books about negotiation have to use the term \\"BATNA\\" to have any credibility these days), nor yet as complex as _Beyond Winning_, this book does in fact offer a \\"toolbox\\" of strategies for the negotiator's use in analyzing a situation and maximizing the likelihood of obtaining a desired outcome.Of particular note is Watkins's emphasis on identifying and analyzing the interests of multiple players, which is more often encountered in the real world than the one-on-one situations more frequently used as examples by negotiation authors."},{"Title":"Breakthrough Business Negotiation: A Toolbox for Managers","review":"If you say po-tay-toe, and they say po-tah-toe, you say to-may-toe and they say to-mah-toe, you can work the whole thing out.

Sleeping well and eating well are the keys to keeping everyone happy, and this book will help you learn how to do it. The recipes are easy to follow, delicious, practical and unique.

It's really great if you've never spent a night in the woods before, or are planning to go only with a group of other inexperienced women. I had hoped for more on distributing weight in a pack specifically for a woman's frame, or gear that is tailored for women. It didn't really help me in either, the advice on gear is really for raw beginners and doesn't go into any of the high quality gear that is out there. The weight estimates of what you should carry seem really high. It doesn't talk at all about hiking in mixed-gender groups. Still, if you've never been backpacking and want an idea of what to take and what to expect, it does ok. But if you've spent any time in the woods previously, it's nothing earth-shattering as far as advice goes. The recipes for trail food were what I found most helpful and I'm excited to try some of them soon. It was well worth the price of this book (used) just for those."},{"Title":"Babes in the Woods: The Woman's Guide to Eating Well, Sleeping Well, and Having Fun in the Backcountry","review":"Great Book and will be fabulous for my daughter as a gift and my self...Thanks for getting it so fast to our home"},{"Title":"India : A Practical Guide","review":"There very few good books that cover the entire Indian subcontinent, and this is one of them.

If you want more in-depth knowledge, I'd look for books focusing specifically on one religion."},{"Title":"Operation Luna","review":"I loved Operation Chaos, and really looked forward to this book, but it didn't enthrall me the way the original book did. It just seems like things never take off, and I was never thrilled the way I was by the first book. The climactic &quot;quest&quot; (admittedly a poor choice of words, but I have none better) doesn't capture the imagination like the descent into Hell of the original, and climax seems short and unsatisfying. Not a bad book, and adequately readable, but it just isn't what it's predecessor was!"},{"Title":"Operation Luna","review":"This book is a sequel to Operation Chaos, which was written 30, and some parts over 40, years ago! It is set in a contemporary universe where magic (or goetics as they call it) works. It is a scientific culture, and the laws of physics apply. Familiar and strange principles combine to create some hilarious sections. One does tend to question the presence of streets in a world where everyone flies around on brooms and carpets. The main characters are Steve Matuchek and his wife Virginia. Steve, an engineer and werewolf, gives a first-person account. Virginia, a beautiful and powerful witch who is the real brain of the pair, has no qualms about using her looks and sex appeal as well as her skills. She even travels to another universe to find a tax attorney. She and Steve must deal with good, evil and mischievous spirits, rival practitioners, NASA, the FBI and the IRS. Also in the mix is their daughter, Valeria, who was 3 years old when she was taken to hell (alive!) She is now 15, gorgeous, nubile, a budding witch and ready to play an active role. There is an overly talkative sword, an ancient dwarf and other interesting characters and scenes in a humorous treatment of the serious subject of space travel development and the evil attempts to stop it; brilliant!"},{"Title":"Operation Luna","review":"I was delighted when I heard that a sequel to _Operation Chaos_, a collection of loosely-related stories set in a techno-magical alternate Earth, had come out. Unfortunately, I can't recommend _Operation Luna_ as I would its prequel.A lot of great elements are there: mankind's effort to reach the moon, our familiar protagonists from _Operation Chaos_ (Steve Matuchek, werewolf engineer, and Virginia Graylock, witch extraordinaire), a garrulous enchanted sword (named Fotherwick-Botts) from the Norse era and his forger, a dwarven smith who adjusts poorly to modern life, Coyote's schemes and uneasy dreams....Alas, despite the attempts at levity, the story never really comes together. Steve Matuchek wasn't the best choice of a narrator. While he's definitely involved in the action in _Operation Chaos_, here he's relegated to reporting on everyone else's actions since, due to his lack of magical expertise, he can't actually get involved. As a result, a lot of potential suspense (will Virginia succeed in her quest for Mimir's knowledge? will their daughter Valeria survive her desperate attempt to foil the IRS?) trickles away. Another problem is that the evils and dangers confronted are rarely convincingly dangerous. Occasionally Anderson throws in social criticism of our world as it is (in contrast to this magical alter-Earth), but there isn't enough of it to fully convince, and it sits uneasily with the lighter tone of most of the story.All in all, while it's a light and often entertaining tale, _Operation Luna_ fails to live up to the wit, fine worldbuilding and daredevil adventures of its prequel."},{"Title":"Operation Luna","review":"I had been looking forward to Poul Anderson's _Operation Luna_, a sequel to _Operation Chaos_, a fix-up of stories in F &amp; SF from the 1950s and 1960s. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend it in hardcover and possibly not even in paper. First, while not absolutely required, I think that reading the earlier book would be extremely helpful (and a new pb edition is out). Second, Anderson made a decision to bring the story forward to an equivalent of our &quot;now&quot;. The three 1950s stories take place either in that universe's equivalent of WWII (called that in the first story, but now called the Caliph's War (WWI is now the Kaiser's War)) or a little bit later. The last story in the fix-up has elements of the late 1950s and late 1960s. But while no year is mentioned, this novel takes place in some age resembling our present. Problem is the protagonist's daughter has aged only 10 or so years and it simply doesn't work for someone more concerned about continuity instead of plot. Third, the first part of the book is clunky like a square wheel trying to set up the storyline, throw in how that universe works versus ours, describe what has happened since _Operation Chaos_, etc. Fourth, we know more than the characters do, a distraction for us. Fifth, while there are a number of in the sf field jokes and puns, some of the points concerning our world are mean-spirited without a specific reason. I finished it, but I consider it to be fairly minor league Anderson."},{"Title":"Operation Luna","review":"Anderson is one of the most prolific SF writers. His output, not surprisingly, is uneven. At its best, his work is very entertaining. His writing style, however, can be cloying and his characterizations thin. This is not one of this better efforts. Operation Luna is the belated (by decades) sequel to an entertaining series of linked stories published in book form as Operation Chaos. Where the older book had clever plotting and considerable humor, the plotting of this book is plodding and the writing often cliched. Readers who enjoy this type of romantic fantasy should find a copy of Anderson's Three Hearts and Three Lions, his best effort in this genre."},{"Title":"Operation Luna","review":"This book is a wonderful sequel to one of the neatest books of all time, &quot;Operation Chaos.&quot; Our heroes return to us enough older that they'll use a mirror to peek around the corner at their foes, and still bold enough to charge the guns if that's what it takes to do the job. In a universe where &quot;Any sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from technology,&quot; courage and intelligence count. There are also some utterly delightful japes here that had me in stitches more than once. I came away from the bound galley I got to read richly rewarded for my time spent. I have also sworn an oath that when this book finally comes out, at least one copy is *mine*."},{"Title":"Operation Luna","review":"Once again we have a joyful and entertaining novel from one of the last remaining masters from the Golden Age of SF. Close on the heels of STARFARERS comes this long-awaited sequel to his highly enjoyable OPERATION CHAOS. Set in the late 60's of his alternate universe were magic works, this novel deals with a Space Race with magic as the means vice straight technology. Along the way, Anderson takes some well-aimed shots at NASA, the IRS, and the government. A good read, particularly if you enjoyed OPERATION CHAOS."},{"Title":"Operation Luna","review":"And in my opinion most people will have a lot of fun reading Operation Luna. The key is to remember this is basically a very lightweight, very silly lark of a book.At first I was put off by what appeared to be libertarian preaching, but after some reflection came to realize even that was over-the-top parody. A beautiful mother-of-three is willing (if necessary) to allow her raven familiar to pluck out her eye as payment to the Norse God tax consultant? Just to thwart the IRS? Not very bloody likely!If you approach this as a charming little bit of fluff, you probably won't be disappointed. That was the basis for which I gave the book five stars. If it had attempted to be in any way serious, one star would have been my ranking."},{"Title":"Operation Luna","review":"A friend recommended this book to me because I like werewolves. The book isn't solely all about werewolves but its a wonderful universe where science melds with magic. The setting is dynamic and as realistic feeling a science-fiction fantasy can get. The characters are unique with personalities and likable. I don't want to give away too much about the book itself and ruin it for future readers, so I'll just have to say I love this book and it's predecessor. They're definitely books I will read again and again."},{"Title":"Operation Luna","review":"An amusing, lightweight fantasy. Perhaps the slightly unbelievable part being that the two supernatural secret agents are basically married and boring suburbanites. Think Disney movie, when they were actually good, for the feel.Magic is technology, otherwise things are as they were in that period of time. The husband and wife team must save the magical space program with some travel of their own."},{"Title":"Operation Luna","review":"If you know Poul Anderson's work, this book will be a delight. If you don't, read it -- and then the rest of his work!OPERATION LUNA manages to pack space exploration, fantasy, and the 'Northern Thing' -- all Anderson specialties -- into one delightful package."},{"Title":"Operation Luna","review":"Having not read &quot;Operation Chaos,&quot; I can't say whether or not its sequel, &quot;Operation Luna,&quot; is similar. It's not really necessary, however, to read &quot;Chaos&quot; before reading &quot;Luna,&quot; since Anderson apparently decided to redo all his expository work. And my god, did he redo it! It took me two days to get through the first 150 pages, and I can normally finish a 700 page book in an afternoon. The book does get better after those first 150 pages, but I'm not sure it's worth plowing through that morass of banality.&quot;Operation Luna&quot; is set in an alternate world, where magic was reawakened by an unexplained physics experiment in the early 20th century. People ride broomsticks and flying carpets; traditional deities, fairies, ghosts, and other magical creatures exist; the IRS uses the tax code as dread incantations; etc. The time period is not terribly clear; Steve says eleven years have passed since &quot;Chaos,&quot; which was apparently set during this world's WWII, but the tone seems very modern.As the story opens, Steve Matuchek, an engineer and werewolf, and his wife Ginny, a beautiful witch (must the women always be beautiful?), are working with NASA to send people to the moon. When NASA's program is sabotaged, they begin -- oh-so-slowly! -- to work on their own space program, and to discover who's behind the sabotage. There are complications with the IRS, the FBI, Steve and Ginny's children, a Chinese spy, and demons of various nationalities, which eventually come together in a climactic battle, after which the book abruptly ends, without ever quite resolving its issues. Also, the overarching theme of the story never becomes clear, though Anderson seems to think there is one.Steve Matuchek is a lousy narrator; the book would have done much better in third person. Steve has three main functions: to tell us he can't describe things well, thus excusing Anderson's lack of descriptive ability; to be confused by magic, thus allowing Anderson to avoid showing a clear system of spells; and to wonder what his world would be like without magic, thus allowing Anderson to show differences between this world and ours, in one of the clunkiest expository techniques it has ever been my misfortune to read.I know Anderson can write, and I enjoy his other books. But this one is too long for its own good, and the charm of some later scenes (particularly those with the enchanted sword Fotherwick-Botts and his/its smith, the dwarf Fjalar) is dampened by the tedium of the exposition and Steve's narration. Also, Steve tends to reveal plot twists before they occur, and, despite his loud claims of not being able to think clearly as a wolf, he narrates exactly the same way in wolf form as in human form! Yeesh.I feel somewhat cheated by &quot;Operation Luna.&quot; It could have been amazing, and it just wasn't. I give it one star for an interesting concept, and another for some good scenes, but I can't, in good conscience, do more than that."},{"Title":"Operation Luna","review":"Please, do yourself a favour and do not read this book. Most of the time it's extremly boring! The only reason I gave this book a 2 was because I liked the ending."},{"Title":"Operation Luna","review":"You'll enjoy this sequel. Filled with tongue in cheek asides, and in jokes, characters you'll like and a lively plot, it's Poul Anderson's best work in recent years.I don't know why the Kirkus review was so lukewarm..."},{"Title":"Let's have healthy children","review":"I received this book in 1994 as a gift during my pregnancy. The woman who gave it to me no longer could find the book so she copied it and had it bound for me. At first I thought this was a little strange that she would like a book so much that she could not even let me borrow it. But then, after reading these copies and taking so many notes, I was astounded by the absolute genius I was reading! Adelle Davis has to be so far ahead of her time that she must be psychic! It's easy to see by reading her book on things that have since come true and other doctor's who are now encouraging the same things she encouraged when no one else really knew any better! Her advice on nutritional supplements is indispensable! I have told so many other mothers about this book and sadly, no one has really heard of it. This book needs to be in reprint for so many new mother's who would benefit so by her expertise. The reason I feel so strongly about this book and Adelle is because during my preganacy I went to get a manicure and the lady who was taking my nail polish off kept rubbing my nails saying she couldn't get off this clear polish. Well, that's when I looked down and told her that I didn't have any on, that my nails were so shiny from the vitamins! She had this mask of preganacy on her face and she said that she had had it for a number of years and she went to every doctor she could think of and no one could help. She had spent hundreds of dollars on cosmetics and cover-ups. She tried to have laser peels to no avail. She had told me that she had given up trying. Well, I was just finshed with Adelle's book and I remember her saying to combat the mask of pregnancy (melasma) take some Folic Acid. I told this woman about the Folic Acid and she had me write down how much to take and after work, she left to try it. I had to leave then and about 3 months later I came back to see her and to my surprise, her markings were gone! She said that the Folic Acid had done it in just a week and she couldn't thank me enough. I told her to tell others about this book and that would make me happy. Anyway, sorry for the babble, I just love this book. Buy it!"},{"Title":"Let's have healthy children","review":"After 10 years of using and researching Adelles books and nutrition suggestions I totally applied them to my last pregnancy. She was our \\"test baby\\". By that time I was fully confident in Adelles research. Our baby is now 19 years old and she was the epitome of health until the age of 17 when I could no longer control her nutrition and she finally got strep throat. She was never sick until the age of 17. Never had an ear infection or an antibiotic until 17. If she ever got the sniffles as a child they were quick and light and gone the next day. She is a stunningly beautiful (due to excellent bone structure), mentally gifted young woman with lovely skin and sparkling eyes and a zest for life. There are some cases where people (as people will be) misunderstand Adelles writings. She was not the only author voicing all the things Adelle voiced, but she was the only one to address the entire human body at once with whole body applied nutrition which made her books easier to read and understand. Often people think if 100 mg is good then 1000 mg must be better and in the cases of certain supplements like Potassium Chloride that is not the case. In almost all cases, the information Adelle wrote about is still considered valid today with very few exceptions. I have been studying nutrition now for 30 years and she is still my mainstay. She was an amazing, brilliant, courageous woman to be admired. As in ALL writings on any subject, use your common sense along with it. Don't mis- read what an author writes. I read, test, re-test and re-test again, starting in smaller doses and working up, while also researching other authors works on the same subject. I have never found anything Adelle wrote to ever be dangerous if applied properly as she described."},{"Title":"Let's have healthy children","review":"About a year before I got pregnant with my son, I began following the guidelines in this book and in her publication, Eat Right to Stay Fit. Surprisingly, the fatigue I had suffered from for a decade vanished and has not returned. My son weighed 10 pounds at birth with an APGAR score of 10. Today he's working on his PhD in bioengineering.Research now being done at McGill University shows that \\"the activity of a mouse's genes can be influenced by food supplements eaten by its mother just prior to, or during, very early pregnancy.\\" Specific food supplements given during critical development periods or with a single dose can potentially permanently change behavior or health, for the better or worse. While the reseach is limited to animals for now, future treatments for humans are possible.I would recommend reading this book even today but I would weigh her recommendations against newer research. For example, raw milk is no longer considered safe and honey is not to be given to infants. Also, a number of the supplements she recommends are incorporated into today's prenatal vitamins. But the focus on everything you eat as potentially influencing your child's wellbeing and future life is absolutely valid."},{"Title":"Let's have healthy children","review":"I followed this book when pregnant with my daughter.

My daughter was born full term, Apgar of 10, is now 30 and people always remark at her beauty. I don't ever remember reading to give a child only goats milk and barley water. She recommends healthy natural foods, too, including carbs, proteins, fats, etc. I nursed my daughter then gave her goats milk as she grew then switched to cow's milk along with a healthy diet. I also don't remember reading to give a child so much potassium! I gave my daughter a pinch of potassium and pantothenic acid in water whenever she had a tummy upset and it instantly cured it! No colicky nights. She slept 4 hours from birth, and through the night soon after. Of course you must use common sense in everything you do. With the Internet, you can check anything before giving it!

I hope it is published again soon. I believe Adelle Davis was brilliant, and her writings are still amazingly pertinent. I refer to them constantly."},{"Title":"Let's have healthy children","review":"Though her research is 50 years old she has some interesting theories on how nutrition affects your childs appearance and health. A good read!"},{"Title":"Let's have healthy children","review":"LOVED it!!! So informative. I don't understand why this book is out of print.

And see what I can do to change this."},{"Title":"Let's have healthy children","review":"I consider 'Lets have Healthy Children' to be one of the most valuable books in the world. Adelle teaches us how to insure our children reach their full genetic potential. The proof is in the putting and you should see my two children that were Adelle Davis babies. Both are well above average intellegence as well as extra healthy and beautiful. Now we start the next generation of Adelle Davis babies in our family. I must find a copy of this book to pass along so my new grandbaby can be the best she can be."},{"Title":"Let's have healthy children","review":"I used this book 33 years ago with my children. Now I have gotten a used copy for one of my daughters-in-law, and need to get more for others.It is absolutely outstanding!Extraordinary and critical information is provided which is crucial for you and your baby. Even thought it is \\"old,\\" it is timeless. Our bodies and needs remain the same.I hope someone will reprint it so that it will be more easily available."},{"Title":"Let's have healthy children","review":"This book is by far the very best book about nutrition during pregnancy, and early childhood. Adelle discusses how poor nutrition can cause homely children, and low I.Q. scores and a host of other &quot;common&quot; childhood problems. Premature birth, small birthweight, jaundice, SIDS, colic. . . all can be totally eliminated by doing what she teaches! I have two very healthy boys, both weighed 8 lbs at birth. My Nutrition was better the second time (after reading her book which I purchased used at a local thrift store for 50 cents) I had a great home birth, and have a beautiful boy who was totally breastfed for six months, and skipped commercial baby food altogether. I am just sick about not knowing this information with my first son from the beginning. I read everything I could get my hands on regarding pregnancy, childbirth, nutrition,breastfeeding and none of these popular, current books told me even half of what I gathered in just my first quick scan of this book! I am really desparate to get some new copies for some friends and for myself-- my copy is yellowed with age and the pages are brittle! I suggest this one even if you get NO other book during your entire childbearing years!"},{"Title":"Let's have healthy children","review":"When we learned we would be able to adopt a baby, I knew I couldn't breastfeed, so I began to study nutrition. I learned a lot, but as with any research, I learned that not everyone agreed. This was twenty-five years ago when doctors were still telling you that Vitamin E was totally unneccessary. After reading everything in our local library, I selected this book as the one that made the most sense. Following Adelle Davis' advice I raised a very healthy son and improved the health of the rest of the family as well. Now I'm looking for the book again because my daughter has misplaced her copy and is frantic to get it for my sixth grandchild--all raised on Adelle Davis, all remarkably healthy."},{"Title":"Let's have healthy children","review":"I have read this book and my wife followed the advice during the pregnancies of our four daughters. Each baby was strong and healthy at birth, able to raise their chest off the mattress by about one inch the day after birth. They each had full control of their heads being able to turn and look around at the light in the delivery room. I have not found another book to compare to the information provided in this, and believe that this book should be promoted strongly in the face of child birth defects and health problems."},{"Title":"Let's have healthy children","review":"This book has been a lifesaver! I own two copies, both belonged to my mother who purchased them when she had her children. They have been a valuable addition to my referance library. All of my pregnant friends call with nutritional questions that this book has answered accurately. I am amazed that no one recomends this book for pregnant women to read since this is the best nutritional guide I have seen. It is the perfect gift for all those who are expecting, or already have children."},{"Title":"Let's have healthy children","review":"One of the unique things about this book is its explanation of exactly which types of nutritional deficiencies cause children to look plain or even ugly, and which types of nutrition allow your child to be as beautiful as possible. It was unbelievable to learn how much of a child's looks depend on developing bone structure! Now when I look at children, I often see the results of good and bad nutrition, which I would once have blamed on genetic inheritance from parents. Considering the huge impact that healthy, attractive appearance has on a child's life, this book is worth ten times its price for this one chapter alone."},{"Title":"Let's have healthy children","review":"I followed Adelle Davis's advice thirty years ago when I was pregnant with my daughter, and then through the birth of her brother and both their childhoods. They have always been smart, healthy, and attractive people, and I think AD's advice helped.I generally keep an eye out for new studies on nutrition and, time and again, I find that something Adelle recommended, such as the importance of anti-oxidants and of folic acid for pregnant women, has become nutritional gospel. She even recommended PABA to combat sunburn before there was such a thing as sunblock on the market.What I wish would happen now is that doctors would read her comments on giving iron salts to pregnant women. She cites studies that implicate them in miscarriages, prematurity, and toxemia. I feel obstetricians should pay more attention to what's in the supplements they give their patients and how those substances interact in the body. In other words, I wish obstetricians knew more about nutrition and could help their patients have easier pregnancies and healthier babies. Their abilities to diagnose and provide emergency care are laudable, but as the new grandmother of a premature baby, whose mother followed her doctor's advice to the letter, I wish doctors knew about the kind of preventive care this book helps women achieve.As I understand it, this book is being reprinted. I hope it comes with a new foreword by respected physicians. It's a book that, ideally, should continue to promote research that will mean healthier babies. What could be more important?"},{"Title":"Let's have healthy children","review":"In 1978, two month old Ryan Pitzer died when his mother followed the advice in this book, giving him about three-quarters of a teaspoon of potassium chloride to treat colic. Potassium chloride causes cardiac arrest in large doses. Why would Adelle Davis publish advice that actually kills people? Please don't follow the advice in this book unless a REAL doctor approves it."},{"Title":"Let's have healthy children","review":"I bought this book originally in 1981 when I was pregnant with my first child because I was totally ignorant as to what nutrition was needed durig preganancy to have a healthy, normal baby.Adele Davis really opened my eyes as to how important diet is for EVERYTHING when you are pregnant from your child's facial structure to their brain developement, etc.It became my bible throughout both of my pregnancies, resulting in 2 beautiful children, who are now in their 20's who were perfectly developed, beautiful, healthy, strong and with IQ's way above average, (one tested at 137 when he was 5 years old).It was so rewarding to see that the way I ate while I was pregnant had such a direct effect on the health and well being of my children. I also breast fed them both, one for 9 months, the other for 8.I have now bought this book for both my daughter and my daughter-in-law, so that we can have healthy children in the next generation of my family."},{"Title":"Let's have healthy children","review":"Although this book, Let's Have Healthy Children - Expanded Edition, was copyrighted in 1972, the information on nutrition supplied by Adelle Davis through her own observations and the research available at the time is still valid today and it is even more important than ever for us to understand what it takes to provide ourselves with proper nutrition. In a society that has become reliant on processed foods that do not meet our nutritional needs, it is important to understand why these foods are not adequate for a healthy diet. In this book we learn not only what it takes for any person to gain proper nutrition, but also that it is important for a woman to gain and maintain proper nutrition well in advance of conception and to maintain the same high level of nutrition throughout pregnancy, as well as after, to make sure her body is able to supply adequate nutrition to her developing baby, while at the same time making sure that the baby does not deplete the nutritional resources of the mother's body. This book also explains how to give the baby the best nutrition possible after birth to reach his or her best mental and physical potential. In this book, Adelle Davis speaks plainly and uses language that is easily understood, so it is easy for most people understand the concepts she presents."},{"Title":"Let's have healthy children","review":"In this classic book for child nutrition, Adele makes understanding how to keep your child healthy so simple. Her story of how she brought both her adopted children back to health is touching and eye-opening. This is a Must Read for any Mother or Mother-to-be. It also gives you great insight applied to yourself. Keep your children and yourself healthy using information that works. It may have been published a while back but the information is still sound today. Human Bodies have not changed that much since she wrote this. In fact, doctors and health professionals just keep (re)discovering the basic truths she wrote about here. Alergies, asthma, building strong bones, preventing colds...is all here. This should be the primary healthcare book for keeping kids well. Give that index a good look. It is the quickest way to solving problems. Doctors should refer to this one and Let's Get Well first."},{"Title":"Salt: A Novel","review":"This novel was so beautifully written, that you almost didn't notice the lyrical, mystical and unique descriptions. The characters are wonderfully formed and the dialog is true to the time and the place. The history of the setting and era are well woven into the story. The reader is almost forced to form an emotional bond with Anna, her friends and family.Zuber is a rare and wonderful storyteller. I came her hoping to find more of her books, but nothing yet. Please give us more."},{"Title":"Salt: A Novel","review":"I am hooked on North Carolina authors, especially ones that take place in the western NC mountains. This book tops Cold Mountain, Thirteen Moons and Gap Creek. Anna's life is definitely one of hardship, especially being married to John as a step-mother to his children. She is a wonderful woman very interested in dancing and music and her husband tries to suppress her desire for anything other than square dancing. \\"Dancing in the round\\" with another woman was sinful in John's eye. The way Anna handles her life is remarkable and she is a lady to be admired. I can imagine my great-grandmother living in the same lifestyle."},{"Title":"Salt: A Novel","review":"Very interesting book. Speaks to the rise and fall of prosperity and how we set our priorities as viewed through the lives of the characters!? Historical fiction."},{"Title":"Salt: A Novel","review":"This novel is one of those rare reading experiences that will linger with its truths and insights for years to come. One of the things I loved most was the way it didn't hit you in the face with overwrought drama, but instead allowed you to sink into it slowly. Anna, the main character, was immediately someone I wanted to know more about and Isabel Zuber gave me time to know her well and left me wishing for her as a companion for life. Anna's ability to keep her real self intact despite the repression of her marriage inspired me - sometimes I forgot about the harshness of her life and was surprised when the story reminded me about what little she had other than her own integrity. For me the book was about a difficult life lived with dignity and I was very inspired by its message."},{"Title":"Salt: A Novel","review":"This book is absolutely amazing. It's the kind of book that I want to tell everyone to read. The writing is pure poetry and the plot is so incredible...by the last 3/4 of the book, I was completely overtaken to see what happened. You may find it a bit hard to get into, but once you're past the first 10 pages you will not be able to put it down. This is a debut novel but it reads like one written by a seasoned pro...it's so carefully crafted and well-done that I could hardly believe it. All I can say is PLEASE READ THIS BOOK. You won't regret it. Halfway through I knew it was going to be one of the best books I had ever read and when I read the last page, I was certain of this."},{"Title":"Salt: A Novel","review":"I read this novel over a year ago and I can't stop thinking about it and how beautiful it is. I compare everything I read to it and so far, all other fiction has come up short. I didn't write a review at the time I read it, but I feel that it deserves one if I'm still thinking about how much it touched me over a year later. It is beautifully written, the characters are well developed, and the story is interesting and touching and real. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Salt: A Novel","review":"Although Salt starts out slow, it picks up pace and I could not put it down. One of the main characters, John, is so self-centered it made me crazy. It was alright for him to do as he pleased, but Anna put up with so much. The children needed her. I don't want to spoil the plot for anyone who has not read it, but you will love it. Just too bad someone didn't do John in earlier in the book....."},{"Title":"Salt: A Novel","review":"Isabel Zuber's first novel makes most contemporary novels feel a little light-weight by comparison, like quilts without much batting in them. Even Robert Morgan's much ballyhooed GAP CREEK, an Oprah selection, feels threadbare by comparison. Zuber's novel is, on the other hand, a well stitched patchwork that has a satisfying heft to it. It pieces together the story of Anna Stockton Bayley's life, from childhood to deathbed and does so with authenticity and generosity. If at times some of the characters seem hard to keep up with, the central story of Anna and her husband John always keeps its focus and intensity. Whereas GAP CREEK's Julie, for example, is limited to her one year of marriage and never-ending hardship in Morgan's novel, Zuber's heroine must live through all the seasons of a woman's life, giving her a multi-dimensional poignancy that Morgan's character never achieves. These two Appalachian women, from two contemporary Appalachian fiction-writers and poets (Zuber is also a published poet) inhabit different worlds, Zuber's Anna a world of both suffering and lyrical beauty, Morgan's Julie a world of near unbroken drudgery and sorrow. Zuber's book deserves the accolades heaped upon GAP CREEK. It is the richer novel, the one that gives real scope and vision to a region and its people. I hope it receives the acclaim it deserves."},{"Title":"Salt: A Novel","review":"This is a beautiful book. I've started so many bestsellers lately and stopped halfway through them, disappointed in both the book and myself for my lack of persistance. I was starting to be afraid that I had lost the knack of reading. SALT restored my faith in my own ability to become immersed in a book and in the fact that there are still books which can totally entrance, amaze, delight, and humble the reader. SALT is the story of a woman who I would have dearly loved to have known. She had a life that was far from satisfying and yet she found beauty almost everywhere she looked and was a blessing to everyone around her. Thank you, Isabel Zuber, for this beautiful blessing of a book!"},{"Title":"Salt: A Novel","review":"Zuber weaves her tale with the grace and lyricism of a poet. Her intricate narrative flows smoothly. Her words capture the aura of the Appalachian landscape, the moodiness of its weather, and the supernatural beauty of its days and nights. Her characters, even the peripheral ones, are clearly defined, multi-faceted, and memorable.Salt's keen examination of the social norms that keep both men and women bound in their prescribed roles and its honest view of happiness and grief, past and present, hope and despair, fuse the story of one woman's awakening into a larger view of humanity. The novel ponders the consequences of actions and interactions in a way that speaks to us especially in these times of uncertainty. The deeply realized and mature sentiments of Zuber's work far surpass the flat mediocrity so prevalent in today's bookstores."},{"Title":"Salt: A Novel","review":"An interesting story that follows a woman throughout her lifetime. There was something very powerful about this novel that I can't quite put my finger on. It brings a longing for simple pleasures and the closeness of family.

Ultimately, he was dismissed as a professor from the Institut Catholique de Paris, his books were condemned by the Vatican, and he was excommunicated. (But of course, that simply whets our appetite even MORE to read what he wrote, eh?) He then taught the history of religion at the College de France until his retirement in 1931.Loisy wrote this book in 1902, and it contains his most famous statement, \\"Jesus foretold the kingdom, and it was the church that came; she came, enlarging the form of the gospel, which it was impossible to preserve as it was, as soon as the Passion closed the ministry of Jesus.\\"Loisy's disputes with the Catholic Church don't mean that he had Protestant sympathies, however; he wrote, \\"Jesus was the first to give his disciples a formula of prayer; He observed the practices of Jewish worship; He never recommended to His followers a worship without external forms, and never intended to establish such a worship.\\" He also concludes, \\"every advance is explained by a necessity of fact ... so that the historian cannot say that the total extent of the movement is outside of the gospel. The fact is, it proceeds from it and continues it.\\"This historically-significant book remains of interest to those interested in the life of Jesus, the Catholic Church, Catholic theology, and Modernism."},{"Title":"The Collected Plays Of Edward Albee: Volume 1 1958 - 1965","review":"Being a huge fan of Albee's work, the thought of having all of his plays collected in handsome hardcovers is a cause for celebration. I devoured this first collection with delight, and wait excitedly for the future volumes to be released. I did notice, however, some typographical errors that were disappointing in such an otherwise well produced edition, and I hope the people at Overlook will take better care with the future volumes. That aside, one can plainly see even with this early work that Albee was destined for immortality as a playwright."},{"Title":"The Collected Plays Of Edward Albee: Volume 1 1958 - 1965","review":"For those interested in the works of people like Harold Pinter and Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee is a must. The plays in this collection are for the most part, excellent and this is a must have for any student of modern theatre.There is much more here than just Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

Meanwhile, on a recently settled planet, unwitting humans are under attack from the devious AAnn. The Terrorist threats eventually dovetail, but sadly to do not come together as well as might have.ADF's final book in his Founding Trilogy is funny and entertaining, but lacks an energetic spark. His fans should enjoy it, but the tale could have been more."},{"Title":"Diuturnity's Dawn","review":"I enjoyed this book (it is the third book of a trilogy with Phylogenesis and Dirge as the first two), but I found it the weak sister of the group. Foster is certainly prolific, and I enjoy almost all of his work, but I get the impression that he has done so many Pip/Flinx and Humanx Commonwealth books by now he could (and sometimes does) write them in his sleep. I enjoyed some of the prequel tie-ins written into this series (the Tse-Mallory/Zenzuzex linkage introduced in his early book Tar-Aiym Krang is explicated in this series), and the book is written in Foster's usual light but quickly flowing style, but there isn't much new here. Go back to the earlier Flinx and Commonwealth novels for Foster at this best."},{"Title":"Diuturnity's Dawn","review":"Very well written book. Builds on the other two books in the series. Also helps in understanding the series the commonwealth. helps to read the other two books in series but can be understood without reading them."},{"Title":"Diuturnity's Dawn","review":"Diuturnity's Dawn contains many familiar elements found in ADF's previous commonwealth books. Never figured out what Diuturnity meant. Fringe fanatic groups bent on death and destruction, ancient alien archaeology hinting at an approaching great evil force, heroic female diplomat committed to bringing humanity and thranx together. All of that stuff was sorta boring actually. But the book was saved by ADF's introduction of the United Church... I love those guys! ADF didn't devote enough of the book to the Church and its founding, but he does include a couple of chapters that follow two of the first padres of the United Church, Briann and his thranx brother, as they spread the gospel of the Church and deal with the terrorists. I think the best part of the Flinx books were when Flinx traveled w/ Bran Tse Mallory and his thranx buddy, the two United Church Peace Enforcers. One especially memorable part in, I think it was Orphan Star? or maybe Tar Aiym Krang, dealt w/ Bran Tse Mallory's flashback to when he and his thranx bro were paired up in a Stingership fighter.anyways, if for nothing else, Diuturnity's Dawn is well worth grabbing for the few chapters that it deals with the beginnings of the United Church."},{"Title":"Diuturnity's Dawn","review":"This is a great book of Allen Dean Foster.

I like Alan Dean Fosters' writing. His work is consistent with strong character development and good plot pacing.The \\"Commonwealth \\" series concentrates on the early days of Human / Thranx contact and those events which shaped the formation of the \\"Commonwealth\\".I have found this author to be entertaining regardless of the genre he is writing in and have yet to be disappointed with one of his books.

The notes credit A. J. Arberry and R. A. Nicholson as well. Coleman Barks forms the translations in English poetry. This collection is of quatrains and odes.In this collection fewer of the poems use specifically Sufi imagery than in some collections; e.g. &quot;Late, by myself, in the boat of myself&quot; could as easily be Buddhist or Hindu; this makes the poetry more obviously universal than some collections. There are, of course, the more specifically Sufi tavern/wine images, e.g. &quot;They say that Paradise will be prefect / with losts of clear white wine and all the beautiful women&quot;.These translations are meant for, and work best for, the individual reading for the spiritual content of Rumi rather than the scholar interested in Persian poetry."},{"Title":"Open Secret: Versions of Rumi","review":"The open secret, available to all but few listen. That is the feeling you get when you let these wonderful writings flow over and through you.Some short, some longer, each writing is a treasure. The more you read (or listen if you've been fortunate to get the audio condensed version from this work) the deeper each verse becomes. I've owned the printed copy for years and every read brings new wonders and old friends.The cream of Rumi is brought to this work and Coleman Barks does wonderful interpretations. The work as a whole weaves a tapestry that, in the end, leaves you feeling part weaver and part thread. The possibility of the \\"Beloved\\" as \\"Lover\\" becomes manifest. The drunk, intoxicated by the bliss of the presence of God, overflows with sacred wine and wants to dance. The sharing of a deep spiritual presence at dawn with those nearest you becomes a yearning that you want each and every day.This book is a cornerstone in the rediscovery of Rumi and Islam for that matter. It provides a glimpse, from the lovers' point of view, into a world traditionally dominated by the warrior spirit.After reading you yearn for the association of others who have similar thoughts. You realize that \\"the pot drips what's in it\\" and you yearn to associate with gentle people who enjoy this book as much as you.Certainly \\"Open Secret\\" is a must read and a must own.

The detail of data that Dr. Sorokin goes into can inhibit appreciating the overall genius that he brought to sociology, but which was basically ignored until the 1960s. It may also be that the detail he went into was a result of Post Tramatic Stress Disorder and his resultant need to understand how the Russian Revolution came about and why the people did what they did to him and those he knew. His work is similar in nature to where I believe sociology is now headed. In my opinion, thanks to Talcott Parson's, the field of sociology has lost 80 years of useful development and is only now recovering. This is an excellent book from both a historical perspective and from the perspective of appreciating the concept of social space and the beginnings of a social model that supports Network Theory and social dynamical system modeling."},{"Title":"Son of Interflux","review":"One of the best books I have ever read!

If it is a new form of art what is new about it? how should art critics approach this new medium? To these questions, Arnheim offers a powerful and convincing defense of the idea that film is its own art form, with its own distinctive artistic potential. Now that \\"we\\" no longer need to be convinced that film is an art form, or is at least capable of rivalling any other art forms on occasion, his detailed and meticulous argument that draws upon a broad familiarity both with the history and techniques of film to his day may appear dated and reactionary. I think this need to prove that film is an art against a number of prominent art theorists is really what one of the other reviewers (\\"vampyroboy,\\" in an otherwise quite interesting review) is detecting when he describes the book as characterized by \\"self-hatred.\\"On the other hand, Arnheim's book is not merely a reactionary treatise intended to prove that film really is a unique art form. Moreover, the book does more than merely defend one of the classical positions in the \\"realist\\" versus \\"formalist\\" debate -- Arnheim's position in this debate is much more nuanced than the standard histories of film and film criticism tend to attribute to \\"formalist film theorists.\\" According to \\"formalism,\\" the essence of film art lies in the formalist techniques available to the filmmaker, and that allow her to manipulate and transform film from a merely mechanical reproduction of reality into something genuinely creative and meaningful. This is supposed to be in contrast with \\"realism,\\" according to which the essence of film art (and what makes good film art good) is its capacity to capture reality directly in its raw form. But Arnheim's position is much more interesting than either opposed position seems to allow.First, he argues that the apparent limitations of film -- the fact that it is two dimensional, that it was originally lacking sound (and later that sound had to be captured with great difficulty and lacking in the multidimensions that our experience of sound possesses), and that film is always a selection from what is visible within a frame, etc. -- these apparent limitations are precisely what open the space for and require creativity and manipulation on the part of the film artist. Because the filmmaker can't show all of reality or even a strict simulacrum of experience she needs to be creative in deciding which aspects of reality to select in order to capture the essence of a reality, and in order to convey the precise meaning that she intends from each shot. On the other hand -- and here is where the division between Arnheim's \\"formalism\\" and the so-called \\"realism\\" of Kracauer and Bazin begins to break down -- Arnheim insists that the very best filmmakers use the formal techniques of editing and selecting available to them in the service of reality. The very best filmmakers don't simply use their creative freedom to break free from the constraints of reality but employ that freedom in order to reveal something important about the reality they film. This is true even of experimental filmmakers who seem to break beyond representation completely -- there is something missing if their work does not in some way teach us to see the world anew and more clearly. This critical perspective on film remains valid -- and explains, for me at least, what I find unsettling about some of the virtuosic CGI effects in film that ought to impress me, and the difference between films that use their effects selectively to convey a genuine experience that would be otherwise difficult to imagine (e.g. Memento) and films that use their effects as mere dazzling artifice (the examples are too numerous to mention). Arnheim's Film as Art remains important and engaging reading for anyone interested in the nature and potential of film."},{"Title":"Film as art","review":"This book must be read by anyone with interests in film critiques and in Cinema in general.Arnheim argued that film comes from limitations , and ideed, I believe that he was absolutely right. Because film is not an unique art, but is builded up from other fields. The first thing that an artist must know is that you always have to leave something to be interpreted, you have to send a message. And how can you do that if you show everything?How can you possibly consider art something that does not need interptretation? Because like Arnheim said &quot;what does not have a meaning has no place in art&quot; Indeed, in his book , he explains that the composition of the film must be intermetiated between the margins of the screen. Also, that the black and white image is far superior to the coloured one.And here you can ask yourselves that how it is possible that the black &amp; white photography is still used even nowadays? I believe that anyone interested in film should read this book."},{"Title":"Film as art","review":"An amazing analysis of the perceptual principles involved in film viewing. Arnheim provides a fascinating and scholarly look at the psychological and physiological aspects of cinema. A profound and thought-provoking work."},{"Title":"Film as art","review":"Rudolf Arnheim's \\"Film as Art\\" is an important work of the cannon of cinematic theory. It should continue to be read, if for that reason alone; its influence on subsequent film scholarship is unquestionable and profound. It provides great insight into the aesthetics of the silent era, opening a window on the intellectual climate of the Weimar Republic. Paradoxically, it is, at once, both Comtian and Kantian. On one hand, it invites us in: Film is photography in motion and, as such, exists in the realm of the visual sense. On the other hand, it shuts us out: Film ART is a whole greater than the sum of its parts. The shot is greater than the sum of its frames. Montage is greater than the sum of its shots. The finished opus, production of the auteur's complete intellectual and emotional capabilities in perfect harmony, is greater than the sum of all of its episodes. In other words, to be considered art, film must demonstrate not only the perfection of each element, but the perfection of those elements in relation to each other... melody, harmony and overall composition. Each frame must serve the whole; one frame more or one frame less and the work would be irreparably damaged.And yet... how odd it is that the vast majority of \\"Film as Art\\" focuses on filmic techniques, the very idiosyncratic building blocks upon which the 19th century artist-photographer once mused. In a desperate attempt to justify the medium as capable of high art, Arnheim descends into a technical-scientific argument that, in effect, nullifies his efforts to establish its end product. That is to say: If film art is truly the production of the heart and mind in concert, such devices would merely be means to an end, the bridges crossed on a journey deep into the soul. Still, Arnheim time and again returns to the theme of the mechanical: \\"Three dimensional images projected onto a two dimensional plane,\\" distortions in time-space via cutting, lenses, filters, emulsions, etc. Vainly, he struggles with the idea of art in opposition to the mechanical reproduction of reality by enumerating the mechanical tools employed in dodging it.I find Arnheim thoroughly unconvincing, not only for the aforementioned reasons, but, more importantly, on a purely intuitive level. To Arnheim, the spectator is reduced to recepticle, the end-user of artistic production. Both the Kantian and Comtian in him should have provided the viewer with a more active role. He should have realized where the perception of light sensation resides; he should have understood that it is the mind that receives such perceptions that fashions them into complete images, actions, episodes and so on. Instead, he focuses intensely on cinematic tricks and devices which, by present standards, are part of the cinematographer's toolbelt. He is captivated by the means to the end rather than the end in itself. For example, he explains montage in terms of its formal aspects, failing even once to discuss what \\"montage\\" actually is (in the manner of Kuleshov, Eisenstein, Pudovkin, etc.) Curiously, the cinematic end becomes more of an afterthought than anything.I also find Arnheim's assertion of the universality symbolism (much like Eisenstein's artistic notion of ideograms as fundamentally monadic) rather silly, at best. Black is bad; white is good. For some reason, Arnheim never stopped to think of other paradigms or the very possibility of their existence. At worst, the book is downright dangerous. The blond-haired, fair skinned matinee idol is inherently striking whereas the brunette begins with a decided disadvantage. And this from a man of Jewish heritage amid a rising tide of Nazism! Can we forgive this the product of a \\"pre-semiotics\\" Eurocentric modernism? Or would such forgiveness, in itself, give substance to the insidious zeitgeits, serving as yet another relativist apology for the brilliant-yet-flawed?As a Jew, I sense \\"Film as Art\\" as the product of self-hatred. I sense that Arnheim was part of an intellectual community and yet APART. The pain derived, in that sense, from reading the book is interesting. Ultimately, however, it is another universalist blind alley: An attempt to speak in immutable terms about an ever-shifting medium of motion pictures. It argues for the preservation of the already-gone (e.g., black and white, silent film, etc.) It is illiberal, ill-conceived, unsatisfactory and unsatisfying. It can only read as yet another volley in the ongoing (and futile) battle between the formative and realistic schools."},{"Title":"Bourbon Street: The Dreams of Aeneas in Dixie","review":"I have read this book twice; once during summer holidays and then again this past weekend, and I enjoyed it in a different way very much each time. There is a greater maturity in the work than before; Lentz has learned to use dialogue effectively and with good wit, especially with the difficult dialect and idiom of places as diametrically opposed as Bayou Cajun country and Boston, Massachusetts are. His capture of local colour really washes well; I thoroughly like the story line, but even moreso the underlying, gurgling innuendo and hidden asides. The setting in New Orleans works really well too, and moves the book along."},{"Title":"Bourbon Street: The Dreams of Aeneas in Dixie","review":"Want one great reason to read this book? The first sentence. This handy bit of workmanship alone ought to be worth the price of admission, so to speak. I have always wanted to find a way to fit \\"reclining courtesan\\" and \\"perfumed mucksweat\\" into a single, opening sentence. And now, David's done it!Want more? How about: \\"It was almost as if the agency were at a cocktail party at the Plimsoll Club with an outrageous joke it was afraid to tell.\\"But, I understand how some readers may want more for their money. That is, investing in a book solely for the first or a single sentence isn't probably reason enough. Fortunately, Bourbon Street has many, many more reasons why you should buy it and read it ... more than once.If you have followed David's development as a novelist (officially, this is his third novel -- the others are worth reading as well, by the way) as have I, you can't help but recognize that he has a gift for plot, detail and characterization.His plots are richly woven tapestries. They twist and turn, dip and rise and, finally, resolve, but not necessarily as you might expect. They are engaging and enthralling.As for detail, David must be a research freak with a great memory. He certainly knows a lot about fishing in the Caribbean, investing in the market and now, living and revelling in New Orleans, or N'awluns, as the locals say it.And then there's his characters. This is especially true in his last two novels. As with any well-written, well-populated book, as is this book, once you get to know those who inhabit his world, you simply don't want to let go. Of course, then there are the women. David's female characters are strong, intelligent and beautiful. Better still, they are not at all averse to using those characteristics/skills, when necessary, as a businees tool or weapon. And why not? They bring to my mind the controversial role Christina Ricci (as Liza) brought to the small screen at the close of the Allie McBeal series. Hey, if you got 'em, smoke 'em. I must also confess that I'd seriously consider giving up my favorite prosthetic limb to spend an evening with any of them. I dream of Lavinia, Didi and Camilla from Bourbon Street, and Kate North from The Day Trader. OK, back to reality.More specifically about this book, Bourbon Street describes Aeneas Jack Jam's tortuous journey to maturity as an artist and, more important, a whole person -- not just a photographer with unusual vision, but a man who seeks place, peace and, of course, love. What gives this journey another texture or layer is that it is a modern tale told in an ancient template. It is no coincidence that the main character's name is Aeneas. His journey, metaphorically speaking, tracks the original Aeneas' journey as part of Virgil's great book, The Aeneid. But since David's work does not rely upon The Aeneid to stake out legitimate literary ground, I'll leave finding the many parallels in both stories to your own investigation. You'll have fun doing it.I really enjoyed this book. It will be especially meaningful to you if you appreciate ancient classical literature, photography, chicory coffee, warm beignets, fishing, beer, New Orleans and, of course, more specifically, the French Quarter.David deserves a great deal of credit for bringing this book to life. I look forward with great anticipation to his next work."},{"Title":"Bourbon Street: The Dreams of Aeneas in Dixie","review":"I am a long time fan of David Lentz!

Wie ich die Tragdie am Mount Everest berlebte.","review":"This is the German text edition of \\"Climbing High\\", yet another perspective of the 1996 Everest tragedy by a survivor of that fiasco. Written in journal style, the author at times frames her thoughts in a staccato, stream of consciousness, rambling fashion, coupled with new age psycho babble. At other times, she intones in a pseudo profound way about Everest. The author comes off as a silly, vapid individual.It is interesting to note that while the author refers to Scott Fischer's expedition (of which she was a member) as an environmental one with a mission to clean up the debris on Everest left by expeditioners, nowhere does she state what it was that those on Scott Fischer's expedition were going to do to ameliorate the mess on the mountain. While she climbs up and down Everest, acclimatizing herself, she does not appear to be doing anything that remotely resembles conservation or clean up. Nor does she indicate any affirmative interest in doing anything constructive to that end.She intones about the consequences of hubris up on the mountain. Yet, she, who had never before climbed Everest, was insisting that she would climb it without oxygen. She was even getting into arguments about it with Scott Fischer, who had the sense to tell her she would be climbing with oxygen. As it turned out, he was right. She could barely make it with oxygen. She should thank her lucky stars that he was so insistent that she climb with oxygen, otherwise she, too, would probably have died on Everest.She also incessantly refers to herself as a mountain climber, but she didn't even know what gear she should take, relying on the recommendations of others, and then criticizing their recommendations when they ran counter to her expectations. It is clear, no matter how she wants to dress up her reasons for climbing Everest, that it was just a trophy mountain for her. She hoped that climbing Everest would gild the path for her to some psuedo celebrity status in her country of Denmark.Her take on Anatoli Boukreev is much more sympathetic than was Jon Krakauer's in his book Into Thin Air. She saw Anatoli as an asset and misunderstood because of his taciturn demeanor. Anatoli comes off very well in this account. In fact, her take on him is much more sympathetic than her take on Scott Fischer, in whom she was apparently disappointed as an expedition leader. I must say if she acted the way she described in her book, then Scott Fischer, who was a true mountaineer, must of been heartily sick of her bravado about climbing Everest without oxygen. Her inflated sense of self is truly staggering at times. When she talks about hubris, she would do well to look no further than her own mirror.Notwithstanding all of this, her account has some merit. As an Everest junkie, I found parts of her journal to be of interest, which is why I rated it three stars, rather than two."},{"Title":"The Fortunes Of Francesca (Reader's Choice)","review":"Whew!

Sean, the boy with whom Cipolloni worked presented behavior that fit the category of Kanner's Autism. I didn't like the way Cipolloni referred to autism as an emotional disturbance. Many behaviors that appear to be rooted in emotional disturbance are more often than not coping mechanisms people with autism have taken on to desensitize themselves to overwhelming stimuli. Autism includes sensory integration and processing difficulties and for those on the spectrum who are either nonverbal or whose speech is severely delayed, responding to stimuli and communicating often is expressed in behavior that is puzzling to others.I didn't like the way Cipolloni blamed Sean's parents and started that tired old \\"blame the child's mother\\" routine. The long antiquated fortress metaphor is a judgmental and inaccurate portrayal of autism. There are many who subscribe to the school of thought that the sensory and communication difficulties are what preclude many with severe autism from communicating in ways the neurotypical world can understand. Suggesting that this is a \\"choice\\" and that the child with autism \\"kept others out\\" by building such an emotional fortress was something he wanted to do is doing a grave disservice to all. I would have thought that by the time this book was published, greater strides would have been made. Suggesting that anybody would cause their child to be autistic is not only preposterous, it is a downright fallacy. Living with autism is a major challenge, so the suggestion that anybody would cause this is just plain ludicrous.I also didn't like the way Cipolloni dismissed scientific research and evidence that has proven time and again that autism is a sensory-neurobiological condition. At no time does he acknowledge pioneers who have shared first hand accounts of living with autism, such as Donna Williams; James Williams; Raun Kaufman; Kenneth Hall; Luke Jackson; Temple Grandin; Georgiana Thomas; Ben Levinson; Sean Barron; Elijah Paradiz and John Pyle, whose mother wrote about his life with Asperger's to name a few.Cipolloni is highly judgmental and condemnatory in writing of Sean's parents and the way they interacted with their child. The book is rife with Bettelhemian fallacies such as blame the parents; the empty fortress and other tired cliches that have proven to be untrue. Plainly Cipolloni does not have all the answers; the boy remains severely autistic throughout the book and at no time does Cipolloni offer any reasonable sounding approach in working with and understanding autistic behavior.In reading this book, one gets the feeling that Cipolloni is eager to blame the child's parents for his autism. His own attitudes are negative and judgmental and he offers no room for them to defend themselves or to encourage them to feel that they are working on their child's behalf.The other thing that bothered me was Cipolloni's obvious view of himself as \\"saving\\" Sean and the other children with whom he works. Save him from what? Autism presents its major challenges, but it does NOT diminish a person nor can Cipolloni re-make and mold Sean into something he is not. To suggest otherwise is not only cruel, but unfair and unrealistic. Since Cipolloni closes by saying he does not see any of his young clients and has not for years, one wonders if he feels he has truly helped them."},{"Title":"An Extraordinary Silence: The Emergence of a Deeply Disturbed Child","review":"Cipolloni's picture of Sean, the boy he worked with and came to know and love, is beautifully-written and absorbing; his determination to blame Sean's parents (particularly his mother) for Sean's autism is shallow, ignorant and cruel.He dismisses all scientific evidence for the neurological nature of autism as reductive (ignoring, as well, the many first-person accounts by people with autism such as Temple Grandin) and instead propounds an even more reductive view of Sean's behaviour as caused by his parents (implicitly contrasted with Cipolloni, who we are to take as all-wise, all-caring and understanding). Writing that &quot;the ways they related and interacted were like a malignancy&quot; and that they were &quot;incapable of understanding needs, unable to correctly read them, satisfy them&quot;, he presents them as a caricature of the hen-pecked father and the unloving mother (who he describes at one point as &quot;rattling on, insensitive now as ever, patronizing, belittling&quot;).Despite his disingenous claim not to be blaming anyone, it is all too clear that Cipolloni's own attitudes are as patronizing and rigid as anything he attributes to Sean's parents. His own ability to see Sean truly is skewed by his obliviousness to his own emotional reactions, particularly his &quot;rescue fantasy&quot; in which he is the miracle-worker (&quot;invariably I did reach each child&quot;) able to save Sean from his wicked and uncomprehending parents.He admits at the end of the book &quot;I do not go to see Sean or any of the others, and have not for many years&quot;."},{"Title":"An Extraordinary Silence: The Emergence of a Deeply Disturbed Child","review":"This book (it is not written nearly rigorously enough to be considered a \\"case study\\"-- though it is a page-turner) is exemplary of everything that is wrong (and maybe one or two things that are right) with the so-called \\"treatment\\" of autistic children.Cipolloni makes two great advances over the prevailing psychological paradigm in his dealings with Sean. The first is that he does not refer to Sean as an \\"It\\" or as a human body with an animal mind (though there appears to be a discord between words and actions here; if you replace the word \\"Sean\\" with \\"my dog\\" in some passages, you can easily see how patronizing his behavior can be). In fact, he is overwhelmingly positive in his descriptions of Sean, a sharp contrast to the writings of some other professionals (Lorna Wing comes to mind, or those psychologists who insist that autistic children are less socially developed than chimpanzees) who have such a negative and distasteful view of autism that I, quite frankly, am disgusted that such people are allowed around children at all.Secondly, he actually CLEARLY states that he does not think that Sean's parents CAUSED his autism. This seems rather obvious to those of us today who are trained to understand biological approaches to psychology. Earlier reviewers seem to have confused Cipolloni's rejection of the \\"refrigerator mother\\" causation with his strong insistence (and I have to agree here) with the fact that his parents do NOT help Sean's situation. The parents are just as maladaptive as Sean, perhaps even more so, and refuse to encourage him to come out of his shell.However, in an attempt to demonstrate the repoire he develops with Sean, Cipolloni casts himself as a pompous, self-absorbed, wannabe martyr. He wants to portray himself as some sort of surrogate father to Sean, but he concentrates far too strongly on \\"curing\\" this child's \\"affliction.\\" Unfortunately, this is the dominant way of thinking (or at least acting) in child psychology. I believe that people like Cipolloni really do want to help, and really do (or try to) care for these children. However, they simply do not, or cannot, understand that they are working with a person who thinks differently, not a \\"normal\\" child with a disease that can just be cured.I realize that some of you who read this book may be doing so for a class or as research. CAVEAT LECTOR, burgeoning professionals! Though Cipolloni does an eloquent job of portraying a warm and friendly (if only partial) relationship with Sean, he fails miserably at truly understanding Sean as a person (though he insists that he does). If the inability to establish multi-directional, positive and constructive \\"relations\\" with Freudian \\"objects\\" is to be considered a disease, this man is just as \\"sick\\" as the child he attempts to treat.True, there is some communication that develops between the two, but treatment is focused too heavily on making Sean act \\"normal.\\" There is little attempt to explain to Sean why he should desire to act normal, much less why he should bother with the seemingly (to Sean) pointless tasks that Cipolloni constantly goads him to complete. To Cipolloni, it seems obvious that Sean should be able to figure out the practical significance of communication and participation. From Sean's point of view, these are meaningless 'hoops' to jump through, none connected to the next. When working with autism, the WHY is always much more important than the HOW. Please keep that in mind.

It gives a perfect overview of an old days Queen presentation since their first arriving to the RAINBOW Theatre 'till the last concerts in the WEMBLEY stadium in '86. The played material, the costumes, and the performance of the members are really great and supported by the hilarious chatting way of the young Mercury as complement. In one of the last interviews, the singer Freddie Mercury said that the way he looked in those days were ridiculous; but that isn't true. They looked very theatrical and outrageous. That's the way that the orthodox, good old fashion Queen fan like it more, so it's joyful to see the carefull treatment of the performance and the complete of the Queen sound listen when all the members of the band sing together and not only Freddie & Brian or Freddie & Roger, that happened a lot after 1974 with the SHEER HEART ATTACK album. The played songs in this concert were:Procession, Now I'm Here, Ogre Battle, White Queen, Medley: In The Lap Of The Gods/ Killer Queen/ The March Of the Black Queen/ and Bring Back That Leroy Brown; Son And Daughter, Father to son, Keep yourself Alive, Liar, Son And Daughter (end), Stone Cold Crazy, In The Lap Of The Gods (Revisited), and Jailhouse Rock.I'm not meaning that the performances after 1974 aren't good, just that the grupal sound of the cuartet sounded great but very different than in the first days... A concert highly recomended. Extraordinary!...

The map itself is useless. I don't know what they used for data or if they had it checked before publishing it but, on a recent trip to Guatemala, it proved to be full of errors. In one case it showed a road as paved which has never been paved and for which there are no present plans to pave. I drove the road and it is only suitable for high clearance, rugged vehicles. Another section of road shown as dirt has been paved for years. I had planned to take another road shown as paved but was told by locals that it was not paved and only suitable for SUV's and pickups. If a map does not reliably show roads, their location and type and if it has numerous geographical references wrong, it's not the worth the beautiful paper it's printed on. As a result of my experience I do not recommend this series of maps."},{"Title":"Tiger, Tiger","review":"Aurelia is born to riches and power, where slaves rush to meet her every want and need, and where every citizen of Rome knows and admires her. She is the daughter of Caesar, the ruler of Rome. And Caesar adores his youngest child, so he plans an exotic and spectacular gift for her: a wild tiger cub!Boots the tiger is born to the green wilds of the jungle, where he lies in the sun with his brother and learns to hunt and survive with lessons from his mother. But when their mother is murdered, he and his brother are taken captive and dragged miserably across the ocean in the dark, dank hold of a ship.Upon arrival, Boots is defanged, neutered and forced to wear leather coverings over his razor-sharp claws. But despite this, he is the luckier of the two brothers, ending up with the pampered palace pet of Aurelia. His brother Brute, on the other hand, gets caged in the dungeons of the Colosseum and is abused, tormented and starved in preparation for the deadly entertainment of the arena with the armed gladiators and other exotic animals.When sheltered Aurelia attends the Colosseum for the first time, the images of the cruel and horrid deaths of the gladiators, the outlawed Christians and the beautiful animals linger in her soul, haunting her dreams and days. It is then that she begins to realize that the father she's admired her entire life isn't as honorable as she'd believed, for he is the one responsible for the horrors at the Colosseum.Then comes the day when a seemingly harmless prank lands Aurelia's beloved pet tiger and her secret love right into the dangerous depths of the Colosseum's arena to face Brute, the hungry and angry brother of Boots, in a fight to the death. Aurelia is forced to watch and finally face the injustices of her society.As the author of THE INDIAN IN THE CUPBOARD, and over 40 other books, the talented Lynne Reid Banks is no stranger to writing awesome stories. Her style flows elegantly and almost musically throughout the pages. In TIGER, TIGER she travels back through time to the barbaric years of the Roman rule where fellow men were enslaved and forced in the bloody arena to fight to the death in the name of entertainment. Readers will love this attention-grabbing story, and will learn a bit of history along the way.A slight warning to those more tenderhearted readers: the cruelties done to animals (and people) in this time period can be difficult to read.--- Reviewed by Chris Shanley-Dillman, author"},{"Title":"Tiger, Tiger","review":"This is a youth book. I've been teaching 7th grade Language Arts this school year, and I wanted to coordinate their literature curriculum with their social studies curriculum, so they would have an interdisciplinary literature experience.Seventh graders here are supposed to study ancient civilizations from ancient Egypt up through Roman empire and medieval Europe. I must have read 25 different youth books to come up with the ones I chose. I wanted books that are historically accurate, while entertaining enough to keep a 7th grader engaged in learning.This book gives a picture of life in ancient Rome that is painfully accurate, but it is not appropriate for elementary school age children. They are not old enough to handle the hard facts of life in ancient Rome(e.g., people thrown to the lions when accused of a crime), just as they don't understand the Holocaust.The story is about twin tiger cubs captured in the wild, and brought to Caesar's palace. One is neutered, tamed and becomes the pet of Caesar's daughter. Tame Boots wears soft leather boots to cover his claws, and is in the constant care of a trainer who was hired to make sure that he will never harm anyone. His twin is taken to the dungeons of the Colosseum where he is bullied, tormented and starved to make him a killer, in preparation for his part in the \\"entertainment\\" of the day -- bloody battles to the death between wild animals and condemned prisoners or armed gladiators.The two tiger brothers do not see each other again until the day a childish prank causes gentle Boots and his trainer to face Boots' wild brother in a fight to the death in the arena.A strong reason for my choice of the book is a parallel story of the young princess (Caesar's daughter) who falls in love from afar with the young man who is her tiger's trainer. He loves her, too, from afar, but both of them recognize their own place in the society of the time and never step out of bounds.I think that books that show young lovers restraining their impulses are few and far between, and I like to support that type of perspective in a youth book.Plenty of both excitement and drama for the 7th to 9th grade student. Reluctant readers and others can enjoy this book on CD."},{"Title":"Tiger, Tiger","review":"We loved this book!

I don't even know how to describe my new profound love for this book. And it closely resembles the movie Two Brothers, a movie also about two tiger cubs that get put into captivity.

This novel strongly goes against the acts of the Roman Collosieum which is our modern day death penalty or any acts of violence in the world which urges readers onward.

The trick, as always, is a good story well-told, and content that would be of interest to any reader at any stage in their life.It's obvious Banks means for children to read her book as she slows down for them on occasion:To launch the entertainment, two tall, splendid gladiators were set to fight, one armed with a sword and the other with a net and a trident--a fork with spiked tines and a long handle.Yet, for passages such as the one above, where definitions are made explicit for readers, what I admire most about this book is that it does not talk down to the reader. As is characteristic of her writing, Banks keeps the pace moving forward. She presents aspects of history, the relevant information the reader must know, and goes on with the story with remarkable speed.And Tiger, Tiger contains a lot of complex themes and ideas. It's an epic tale of the Roman Empire, the beginnings of the Christian church (not exactly in favor of it), animal and women's rights, and true-to-life historical depiction. A lesser writer might've taken 600 pages to tell this story, but Banks trusts her reader to be smart enough to keep up with her. She insists children bring themselves to her level rather than lower herself to theirs and the result is wonderful book still being read and celebrated.The main story of Tiger, Tiger is of two tiger cubs later named by two-legged masters Brute and Boots. In the opening pages, the cubs are stolen and their mother is killed. They're dragged back to Rome where Brute is trained to be a killer in the coliseum (can you really have a Roman epic without gladiators) and other is de-fanged and fixed like a house pet to live with a princess in her palace. Much of the novel is devoted to the tiger's experiences in their new lives:On the fairly rare occasions when he was allowed into the arena, Brute killed again--not perhaps with the spectacular ferocity of the first time, but from the point of view of the spectators, satisfactorily enough. He developed, as man-eaters will, a taste for human flesh, which added to his enthusiasm for the occasions when he was allowed to hunt down and eat two-legged prey, and maintained his growing reputation as the sanguinary star of the circus.Only for Boots, nothing changed. His fortunate, pampered life continued. Catlike, he was content with enough to eat, comfortable sleeping quarters, and the petting and affection of his mistress. He no longer missed his brother or the beautiful, savage world he had been bred in. If things had continued as they were, he might have lived out this placid, unnatural life until he died of old age.But there were cataclysms ahead for him--for all of them.I love that last line, which, naturally, precedes a break. Banks may be giving a history lesson, but she still keeps the reader hooked and keeps the pages turning first and foremost. Of course, the nice thing about history is its filled with necessary violence and taboos. There is plenty of horrendous violence sprinkled throughout, all of it historically accurate, which also helps to keep pages turning.Over the course of the novel, Banks demonstrates her gift for putting the reader in the viewpoint of multiple characters both human and animal. What would it be like to be a nearly 13-year old princess in ancient Rome whom men thought eligible to be married? What pressures would that bring? Here is what the crowd has to say when poor princess Aurelia is dragged at last to the coliseum to witness for the the first time the slaughter of humans and animals for entertainment:\\"How lucky we came today! Imagine how excited she must be, to see the circus for the very first time!\\" Many were remembering their own first visits. There was a general feeling of privilege and rejoicing, as if the daughter of Caesar were passing through a sort of initiation into the glorious state of being a full Roman citizen.For much of Tiger, Tiger the reader comes to the story from the third person perspective of the tigers. They never talk nor have thoughts that a tiger couldn't conceivably have. Their take on the world around them in unique and interesting, but Banks makes no attempt to personify them. Instead, she presents their world as they would likely perceive it:The smells were bad because there was no way to bury their scat. And there was the smell of other animals, and their fear. And there was a strange smell they didn't recognize, a salt smell like blood. But it wasn't blood. It was bad being enclosed. All the smells that should have dissipated on the wind were held in, close. Cloying the sensitive nostrils. Choking the breath. Confusing and deceiving, so that the real smells, the smells that mattered, couldn't be found, however often the cubs put up their heads and reached for them, sniffing in the foul darkness.A coarse, loud voice shouted, \\"Quiet, you little brute, or I'll give you something to howl for!\\" The threat in it was unmistakable. The bigger cub urinated with fear, then found a corner, pressed himself tight to the cold wall, and lay down. He didn't sleep. He was too nervous. He shivered and all his striped fur stood on end. There had been something in that voice that filled him with dread.Ultimately, of course, Tiger, Tiger is more about humans than tigers--nearly all stories written by humans are. By putting us in multiple perspectives, both human and animal, Banks is cultivating in her reader a historical perspective. After all, those who do not lean history are destined to repeat it. By presenting us with characters as they would've likely been in their time and place, we're able to consider who they were and thus who we were:\\"All societies have hierarchies,\\" she was told. \\"All societies have higher and lower, masters and slaves.\\"\\"It must be terrible to be a slave!\\"\\"You must not entertain such thoughts. Waste no pity on slaves. They have no responsibilities, no traditions to maintain, no laws to make and keep. They have no concerns about food and shelter. They only have to do what they're told, and live out their simple lives in peace and order.\\"In the end, Esteemed Reader, isn't gaining perspective why we read stories in the first place? We want to know how we're to live, so we look to stories to teach us. By consider humans through history, we can learn to be better humans now.Tiger, Tiger is a wonderful tale sure to enthrall readers of all ages and teach them a few things they didn't know before while entertaining them. What more can a reader ask for? As always, I'll leave you with some of my favorite passages from Tiger, Tiger:Julius swallowed hard. The pictures in his mind almost unmanned him.Her mother smiled. \\"It should, perhaps, but it doesn't. People are bloodthirsty. It's the nature of simple folk. Blood excites them, and they love to be excited. It takes them out of their boring lives.\\"...appealed to Aurelia about as strongly as being tied up in the arena and fed to the wild beasts, like those strange, death-inviting ChristiansA spear that whistled past him-- reminding him of his trainer's proddings--simply enraged him more, so that he pursued the thrower in an avenging bound, and tore out his throat. But after a few minutes of frenzied whirling, pouncing, rending, and clawing, Brute's killing urge left him. He remembered his hunger, lay down--but warily--beside his first victim, and began to eat the man's entrails.Since he had held her in his arms he ached to hold her again. The little head he had pressed protectively to his chest had left an invisible imprint there that called insistently to be filled."},{"Title":"Tiger, Tiger","review":"This books was great for my fifth grade boy.

Matthews of The New York Times","review":"New York Timesman DePalma provides an excellent, balanced examination of his newspaper's controversial role in Castro's rise to power nearly five decades ago.The Times scored a journalistic coup in February 1957, when its veteran war correspondent, Herbert Matthews, landed an exclusive interview with Castro in defiance of the dictator Batista's censorship edict. Matthews's explosive page-one story revealed to the world that the young Cuban rebel -- widely thought to have been killed by Batista's forces -- was \\"still alive and waging a successful guerrilla campaign\\" in the Sierra Maestra mountains. It's clear that Matthews' story exaggerated Castro's strength and prospects, although it's not true, as Castro later claimed, that he was down to just 18 men and had them march around in circles in order to deceive Matthews.Matthews was guilty of gullibility, or worse. He had taken sides in the Cuban revolution. And in this regard, he was a repeat offender: his coverage of the Spanish Civil War had been biased in favor of the Loyalists. And before that, he openly supported Mussolini in his conquest of Ethiopia.Matthews was one of those reporters who saw himself as a shaper of events, not just a chronicler of them -- a dubious prospect for a profession founded on trust and objectivity. The Times compounded this situation by permitting Matthews to serve simultaneously as news reporter and editorial writer -- an experiment the paper soon abandoned. Although denied the paper's new columns to advance his cause, Matthews continued to write editorials in support of Castro, even when it became plain that the Cuban strongman had abandoned all pretense to democratic, constitutional governance.Matthews is still an object of opprobrium for many Cuban-Americans, and continues to be hailed as a revolutionary hero among Castro loyalists. It's disturbing that a seasoned journalist -- let alone one associated with one of the world's most influential publications -- would put himself in such an untenable situation."},{"Title":"The Man Who Invented Fidel: Castro, Cuba, and Herbert L.

How close can a reporter be to his or her source before bias surely intrudes? When does a reporter's decided notions of what ought to happen, prevent even-handed and clear reporting? How much backing--or control-- should be given an experienced reporter by a newspaper's editors?To me, the story of Herbert L. Matthews is of current interest not because of what happened with Castro over fifty years ago--but of how it informs today's debate over current journalistic standards at The New York Times and other major media outlets."},{"Title":"The Man Who Invented Fidel: Castro, Cuba, and Herbert L.

It makes me feel old when I think back to the newspaper reports that I was reading at the time, now fifty years ago.As I read this book I found myself full of random and somewhat conflicting thoughts.First was the thought that Castro was an expert at public relations and was able to find exactly the right man to publicize his struggle and at exactly the right time.Second was the attitude of the paper. Most of us, at the time, thought that Castro meant was was being written as quotations. It came as a surprise when he viered left. I find myself still puzzled. Was Castro a dedicated communist all the time and merely fooled the Americans? I believe that it was Truman who later said, 'I should have called him and asked him what he needed to make Cuba better.' Could that have changed things?Matthews was an unabashed liberal. His views on previous wars such as the Spanish Civil War unfailingly took the left wing side. And where does the responsibility of a journalist lie, what about that of a columnist, and Matthews was both?It also reminded me that Castro will be eighty years old in August.

Public Affairs (Perseus), Cambridge MA ISBN-10 1586483323, ISBN-13 978-1586483326 This book is a cornucopia of factual information rarely found in other English language studies on Cuban matters. The significance of Ruby Phillips a reporter far more experienced and attuned to the Cuban circumstance that Matthews is well described. In my view DePalma still accepts far too readily some of the nonsense on the repression of the country folk \\"Los Montunos\\" in the Sierra; apparently the author did not fully realize these mountain peoples had considerable legal and constitutional protection; which gave them access to lawyers such as Manuel R. Penabaz Tobio. DePalma falls into the common error of labeling the Sierra Maestra inhabitants as \\"peasants,\\" which is not an appropriate term for the once mounted and armed inhabitants of the area. However, to one has to give the author great credit for his mention of the background of Eutimio Guerra (pages 33 and 34 but apparently not included in the index); which is more than most give to this Aut&eacute;ntico Party agrarian reform activist. Still the author accepts, without caveats, the Castro version of events which were used to justify Guerra's execution. Pages 83-84 tell how Celia prepared the illusion of a potent and far more numerous guerrilla forces for Matthews visit. Such a careful function, plus her role as armed guerrilla leader before Castro landed, and her ability to override or direct Castro in the mountains (described in other sources) seems far more consistent with a minder role, than merely that of a woman in love as she is often portrayed. On page 265 for example the author, unlike many academics and other Castro apologists, DePalma calls it close to reality e .g. \\"... For decades, all but the most radical works about Castro have essentially balanced his idealism and uncanny ability to survive against the ruthlessness of his dictatorship.

Matthews of The New York Times","review":"Now that it seems likely Castro's regime is finally waltzing through its twilight years in Cuba, this book provides a timely look back at how it all started. It seems reports of his death were greatly exaggerated - back in 1957. That's the year he returned to the Oriente District of Cuba with the ragtag band of revolutionaries he had rallied to the cause of Cuban liberation. For months, everyone in Cuba assumed that he and his entire little brigade had been wiped out by Batista's soldiers as they patrolled that densely wooded part of Cuba's southern coast.However this book isn't really about Castro. It's about Herbert Matthews, the New York Times reporter who hiked into those woods, got an interview with Castro, and brought out the news that Castro was actually alive and well. It's about how Castro made such an impression on Matthews during that brief interview, that Matthews forever after championed and defended Castro to the American public, denying all the growing suspicions that Castro might turn out to be, not a liberator, but a Communist dictator.I had hoped that this book might shed some light on how Castro's presumed idealism (if indeed it ever existed) morphed into just another raw exercise of power. But there is no psychological analysis here. There isn't much insight into how yet another revolution turned into tyranny - other than DePalma's observations that Castro was always flexible, looking for the better chance to consolidate his power. You'll have to look to other books for deeper answers to why so many revolutions fail, if in fact such answers exist anywhere.This book stays more exclusively with Matthews. It tracks his dogged belief in Castro's overall good intentions. And it follows the public's reaction to Matthews' reporting - from initial enthusiastic acceptance of Matthew's heroic view of Castro, to repudiation and even revilement.DePalma's writing tends to be plain and reportorial, although he does get in the occasional telling turn-of-phrase - as for example when he compares Matthews to a pi&ntilde;ata that so many delighted in bashing for America's failed forecasting of Castro's intentions. Generally though, DePalma just writes good clear sentences that make for easy reading. In a relatively short time, this book will arc you the whole way from Castro's rebel retreat, through the Bay of Pigs, and on to the more recent stand-off between the U.S. and Cuba."},{"Title":"The Man Who Invented Fidel: Castro, Cuba, and Herbert L.

Always current reading!"},{"Title":"The Man Who Invented Fidel: Castro, Cuba, and Herbert L. Matthews of The New York Times","review":"It takes a lot of fortitude for a New York Times writer to tackle this subject, one certain to cast the Times in a less than shimmering light. Author Anthony DePalma notes that in his acknowledgments when he says that \\"Bill Keller, executive editor,...winced when he heard that I was writing about [Herbert L.] Matthews after so many unflattering books about the newspaper were being published but encouraged me anyway.\\" What DePalma reveals - through some magnificent research and writing - is a situation far more complex than one reporter's \\"self-confessed passion for underdogs,\\" which made him \\"easily won over by those he covered, regardless of their politics.\\"Matthews is pegged as the first of a long line of individuals taken in by Fidel Castro, who - as DePalma perfectly notes - \\"was capable of constantly reinventing himself and creating myths about his persona and his beliefs...he had become a political chameleon who could bedevil both friends and enemies.\\"DePalma's tour de force chapter is the penultimate one entitled \\"A Cordial Witness.\\" I have passages flagged on almost every other page. One standout is this one: \\"Che understood the value of Matthews' bias from the outset, as had Castro, because both men were masters of propaganda and manipulators of image. They were far more perceptive in this regard than Matthews. They exploited Matthews' bias while he never accepted the notion that his writing had created a skewed picture of reality that, for a time, had become reality itself.\\"Mr. DePalma does a fantastic job synthesizing original material from the Matthews Library at Columbia University (Matthews kept every scrap of paper he had ever scribbled on), the New York Times files (which reveal deep concerns about Matthews' partisanship throughout his long career), FBI files about Matthews (DePalma filed a request under the Freedom of Information act), and recollections from Matthews' son and daughter which included the big surprise of a last unpublished manuscript - in longhand - in the possession of Priscilla Matthews.This is an excellent book, surely the best I've read this year."},{"Title":"The Man Who Invented Fidel: Castro, Cuba, and Herbert L. Matthews of The New York Times","review":"Correspondent in Spain,Veteran New York Times correspondent Anthony DePalma has written a history book that could not be better timed for the future - the future of Cuba and the future of U.S. relations with the island nation 90 miles to the south of Key West, Fla., as well, perhaps, for the future of journalism.Anyone with any interest in Fidel Castro, or how honest correspondents view their roles in history as well as purpose, should buy this book. Anyone with any interest in Fidel's brother, Raul's, history in the making of modern Cuba, or U.S. attitudes toward Fidel - which even at the State Department changed from admiration to suspicion to outright attempts to remove him from power, killing him if possible - should read this book about The New York Times correspondent who was the first to report Castro's survival in the Sierra Maestra and how and why his personal attitudes helped shape those of some in government as well as in the American public.What happened to Matthews is an object lesson in what happens when correspondents believe they are the only ones who truly know what is happening, or who is causing it to happen, or why it is happening. Castro, according to the book, appears to be an early master at selectively providing access to \\"favorable\\" reporters and using that relationship to shape his \\"message.\\" That the messages contained outright lies to shape opinion in his favor did not appear to revive all journalists' best tool - a healthy dose of suspicion about the motives of the one providing the access, and the message.DePalma appropriately mentions modern reporters who have publicly been \\"burned\\" by their own egos or desires to burnish their public image with interviews or access, as well as felt the pressure of their employers to get information no one else has - singling out the recent cases at his own newspaper of Jason Blair and Judith Miller - and even the readers' lack of skepticism in what they read or hear from \\"trusted sources.\\"But he notes that, despite his own belief, Herbert L. Matthews did not actually invent Fidel Castro. And, in fact, there were forces at work jealous or angry of Matthews' access and real journalistic coup - \\"scoop,\\" in the old vernacular - of being the first to interview the young rebel before the ouster of Fulgencio Batista, the dictator favored by the U.S. government prior to Castro's successful taking of power.About the only flaw I could note in the excellent study presented almost as an adventure novel, or a modern tragedy, is the omission - either deliberate or by chance - of the pertinent fact that Matthews had personal enemies in Cuba prior to his interview with Castro. Matthews first gained notoriety covering Benito Mussolini's war in Abbysinia, during which he politically and publicly admired Italian Fascism; next, he gained notoriety covering The Spanish Civil War, in which he ultimately supported - as did Ernest Hemingway, his friend - the dying Spanish Republic, which lost the war to Generalisimo Francisco Franco.In Spain at the same time, and writing a book that was extremely supportive and understanding of Franco's invasion from Morroco to protect and defend the Catholic Church's influence and the monarchy from the increasingly left-leaning democratically elected Spainish government, was H.E. Knoblaugh - a correspondent for The Associated Press.Knoblaugh became eventually FBI Special Agent in Charge in Havana, Cuba. It was, in fact, Knoblaugh who kept \\"tabs\\" on his former acquaintances and rivals Matthews and Hemingway. It was Knoblaugh, then, who sent memos to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover about the activities of both men, as well as \\"profiles\\" of their personalities and behavior.If Matthews (and Hemingway) injected too much personal opinion in his articles - Matthews was, technically, an editorial writer for his newspaper by the time he went to Cuba, not an \\"objective\\" journalist - Knoblaugh appeared to eagerly and easily pass off whatever outlandish story he heard that fit his opinion as fact.So there you had it: Matthews, writing in the vein of other correspondents who became famous for their adventures, such as Richard Harding Davis (who covered the Spanish-American War), James Creelman (who personally, according to himself, led the charge up El Caney in the same war for William Randolph Hearst) and Januarius MacGahan, the \\"Liberator of Bulgaria,\\" and Knoblaugh, trying to paint Matthews as \\"a Red\\" for supporting the overthrow of a U.S.-friendly dictator.DePalma's book is, ultimately, a warning to journalists of the future - even if your coverage is subjective, so that you gain a name among your readers, remember a cardinal rule that should survive all debate about the value, falicy or noble attempt at \\"objectivity\\": the story isn't about you."},{"Title":"The Man Who Invented Fidel: Castro, Cuba, and Herbert L. Matthews of The New York Times","review":"In this book we gain a semi-sympathetic portrait of an old dinosaur print media journalist who was NOT fair, not balanced who himself decided to \\"puff\\" up Castro.Others have noted how Castro \\"used\\" Matthews. To wit while in the tent with Matthews Castro had the same formation of men march around them repeatedly, to create the impression of a battalion instead of a platoon or company.Castro came along at a time when for the first time ever the media could create and annoint a heroic idol figure. The image captivated just enough folks so that inquiry into and analysis of policy, ideology was deemed un-necessary. Castro appealed to the long-suffering Cuban hopes for change.As to whether turning Cuba into a Cold War Soviet satellite/missile base was the plan from the git go? Who can really say? I think as with the current president there was a lot of \\"make it up as you go along\\" improvisation by the Castro brothers [although Raul appears to be far more sadistic, brutal and at the same time less ideological than el hermano grande] Many who worked so hard to bring Fidel to power werent communists: Raul Chibas and Huber Matos come to mind.To counter-balance this book make sure you read \\"Against All Hope\\" by Valladares and \\"Waiting for Snow in Havana\\" by Carlos Eire.In modern day journalism I'm sure ea and every statemt made by a Castro would be \\"fact-checked\\" by another writer who would have been detailed to go along with the Batista forces.

From The very start of the book Mr.DePalma goes out of way not to Be too Harsh on His Subject.(Apparently the Times has the same problems before*Walter Duranty* and Since).Of Course Mr.DePalma is Married to A Cuban which I guess gives him carte blanche with Cuban History,he Mistakenly Says that it was reported 20,000 had been killed by the Brutal Batista(A Commie Sympathizer himself pero un nino de teta- A Kid sucking a teet-Compared to Murderous Goon Castro).Are we suppose to feel sorry and redeem Mr.Matthews? and Forgive the Liberal Fascist Times?I don't. The book is intelligently written but is more polemic nonsense for The Typical Modern journalist since,All who can't sadly hide their Elitist Smug Liberal Agenda.

Matthews of The New York Times","review":"This is some good reporting about the facts associated with what Herb Matthews did to paint a phony picture of Castro for consumption in the USA during the height of the Cold War. There are many good details that show that Matthews really followed in the tradition of Walter Duranty who mislead the world about Stalin's mass murder of Ukrainians which was on an even greater scale than Hitler's treatment of Jews, Roma, and others during his attempt to conquer the world and rid it of non-Aryans.The problem with this book is that Depalma gives Matthews way too much the benefit of the doubt when it comes to whether he was just naive, or if his political agenda, in a newsroom full of Communist sympathizers at the Times, led him to write fiction instead of honest reporting of Castro.Matthews is one of many whose dishonest reporting should have made the Times fall by the wayside as many papers did all over the country, but when you have such deep pockets, and a politically driven leadership in a very liberal town, you don't need honest reporting when preaching to the liberal choir.But in any event this is a good read as long as you recognize the editorializing vs. the reporting."},{"Title":"The Man Who Invented Fidel: Castro, Cuba, and Herbert L. Matthews of The New York Times","review":"Having visited Cuba several times and seen the political and economic basketcase up close and personal, I find the history of the Cuban Revolution and of that whole era endlessly fascinating. Although I suppose some would say that's like finding a really ugly car crash fascinating!This book tackles the subject from another angle and a very interesting one at that. But it's a little misleading. The provocative title would have you believe the New York Times is alone responsible for decades of misery and repression of the Cuban people from the Castro regime. Not to mention the everpresent Cold War thorn-in-the-side for Uncle Sam.As for \\"inventing\\" Fidel. . . well, that famous NY Times article came out in 1957. But Fidel Castro was a prominent figure in Cuba for years before that, especially from 1953 onwards with the storming of the Moncada Barracks and his now infamous \\"History will absolve me\\" speech which was published and read widely throughout the country at that time.The fact is there were scores of American journalists who portrayed Castro as a popular liberator. And more importantly, there were several Cuban newspapers that were supportive of Castro as well. Most Cubans on the island probably didn't get their ideas of Castro from reading the New York Times! It's more likely those perceptions came from the prominent Cuban magazines and newspapers of that era, such as Bohemia, not to mention Cuban radio.What's painfully ironic is that many of Castro's Cuban supporters would soon go into exile in southern Florida once it became apparent the Revolution was not democratic in nature. Castro was using his immense charisma, skills at demagoguery, and his political cunning to consolidate power. Can we blame Herbert Matthews for this too?The fact is if Mr. Matthews is guilty of being hoodwinked by the nefarious Mr. Castro, then so were millions of Cubans. While many middle-class Cubans got out soon after the revolution, it would take some years for the disillusionment to spread down the socioeconomic ladder -- as at the height of his powers, Fidel was quite the populist in Cuba. Imagine listening to George W. Bush for 4+ hours straight! Yet Castro's long-winded speeches would hold his ardent supporters rapt in attention for hours during the early years of the Revolution.Nowadays, Mr. Castro still makes long-winded speeches but today, Cubans listen only half-heartedly if at all. They're more concerned with putting food on the table and survival than with the principles of socialism or Marxism. It's too bad he's still around screwing up a potentially beautiful country. But to excoriate Mr. Matthews for \\"inventing\\" Fidel is not only misguided but condescendingly ethnocentric."},{"Title":"The Man Who Invented Fidel: Castro, Cuba, and Herbert L.

He was Victorian England's most renowned historian and political thinker. Acton was a Roman Catholic educated under the Catholic historian Ignaz von Dollinger in Munich. Acton found the idea of Papal Infallibility to be appalling. To Acton, holding the Vatican on a pedestal as the infallible arbiter of religious and moral conscience was detrimental to the cause of liberty. Acton was a classical liberal who seems to possess the prescriptive wisdom and prudence of Edmund Burke when it comes to politics.This collection of essays and commentary features a selection of Acton's thoughts on the interrelation between church and state, religion, politics and morality. The first section features essays on Liberal Catholicism; the second section includes Acton's commentary on the Vatican Council; and the third section features Perspectives on History, Religion and Morality. The fourth and final section features an intriguing collection of quotations on various topics like Liberty, Conscience, Church, Democracy, Federalism, Nationality, Property and Socialism to name a few. This final section makes the book very useful resource for Acton's witticisms. I don't wholeheartedly embrace all of the ideas of Acton, but this book is nonetheless an eye-openning window into European Old Whig political thought during the 19th century."},{"Title":"Brain mechanisms in diachrome;","review":"This is a reprint of the classic Krieg neuroanatomy introduction.We would give five stars are for the original work, but this edition was a bit of a disappointment (3 STARS).Unfortunately, unlike the original, this edition does not come with the color diachrome (plastic) overlaysthat made the original such a treasure.If you can, get a used copy of the original with the diachrome overlays (5 STARS).Krieg's color transparencies look very much like those diffusion tensor imagesthat have lately come onto the neuroscience scene, and the book makes one appreciate how much wasknown about brain structure and connectivity 60 years ago.This edition is a good reproduction of the rest of the book, and Krieg's descriptions and 3-D drawings are worthwhileeven without the color plates."},{"Title":"The Surprise Garden (Molly and Emmett)","review":"I bought this book for my 8 yr. old daughter, and she loved it!

Little fun things to do, like make a square pumpkin out of a milk jug, and turn your garden into a surprise garden. Wonderful Book!"},{"Title":"Understanding Words That Wound","review":"Hate words are not primarily racial jokes, slurs, or mean \\"comments\\" (that seems to be a pattern), there are nasty words used against whites as well. 'Spik,' 'kike,' 'wop,' 'dummy,' 'idiot,' 'Polock' all cause extreme mental and emotional hurt. Of course, we all all familiar with the N word, but the blacks use it the most to describe one of their own who won't do right, 'nigger.'The play, 'Green Grow the Lilacs,' which was turned into the musical, \\"Oklahoma!, was spiked full of the N word, as were many of Mark Twain stories and nothing was said about \\"hate\\" or racial slurs. These were literary works and thus immune.In the town of Skokie, Illinois, outside Chicago, where many Jewish people live, there was a Nazi march showing swastikas and Nazi uniforms (probably used the Nazi salute, as do the KKK groups, a lot of which are from Chicago and places unknown). The KKK do not go to predominantly black towns to show their allegiance to our right of being a white country. At least, we started out that way, then the blacks multiplied staring from the age when a girl had her first period so that her mother could draw welfare on the illigetimate child, over and over and over. Now, there are more of them than us; the joke is that the Latinos have infiltrated this country and they are the majority!Hate speech is not merely unpleasant or offensive. Sometimes it can be the truth couched in words not at all offensive, the truth finally being brought to the attention of anyone who will listen.Bigots suffer when their narrow, categorical thinking and expressions etches a little deeper. If you observe the way blacks treat the whites they think are dominant, you will understand why there are more of us speaking out -- and will continue to. They take care of their own to the detriment of the rights of others, because they are the wrong color. It happens here in Knoxville, Tennessee, every day with the bus system. Racial abuse can come from either or both sides. It's not the whites now doing the abusing; the blacks have been put into positions to take their hate out on little old ladies who are just the wrong color. They use the worst language and have nasty minds and mouths. They don't care who they hurt.So, to conclude, the blacks are not being abused. The Jews are not being abused. The tables have been turned, and now the whites are suffering for a few bad speakers and the elderly are fair game to hurt and harm in any way they can.Written by racial theorists, Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancie from the University of Pittsburgh, it explores a host of issues but not from the viewpoint of the person being abused. The abusers are never punished. They don't lose their jobs. They are not reprimanded. Free speech has turned into hate speech because the person doing the talking has been abused by the other group repeatedly. And nothing is done!"},{"Title":"Harry Heathcote of Gangoil: A Tale of Australian Bushlife (World's Classics)","review":"Trollope wrote this very short novel (only about 45,000 words) for the Christmas issue of a London magazine. Regarding Victorian sentimentality about the holiday as &quot;humbug&quot;, he presented a very different sort of Yuletide tale, one in which there are no snow flakes and no sleigh bells - and in which fires are not cozy but frightening.The hero is a prosperous young sheep rancher in Queensland, where December is the hottest, driest month of the year, when a careless match can spark a ruinous blaze and in a few hours wipe out all that a man has built through years of labor.Careless matches are not the only danger. Harry has just as much fear of malicious ones. He is an imperious ruler of his domain (120,000 acres leased from the Crown) and prides himself on his unflinching candor. Not surprisingly, he is at feud with his shiftless, thieving neighbors, the Brownbie clan, and is quite willing to quarrel with Giles Medlicot, another neighbor, when Medlicot hires on a hand whom Harry has dismissed for insubordination and suspects of plotting arson.In other Trollope novels, &quot;war to the knife&quot; means snubbing an enemy in the street or not inviting him to a garden party. In this one, conflict is simpler and more violent. With the grass growing more parched by the hour, Harry's enemies gather, scheme and strike. Because Trollope is not a tragedian, they are thwarted - narrowly - and there is even a Christmas dinner to conclude the story and incidentally seal a budding romance. But the pacing and atmosphere are very different from the Trollope that readers expect.The picture of a frontier society, living almost in a Hobbesian &quot;state of nature&quot;, is vivid, and the moral consequences of that state are clearly drawn. Harry's refusal to compromise with what he believes to be wrong is a principle that can be safely followed only where the structures of law and order offer shelter. Where a man must be his own constable, high principle is a dangerous luxury. The appearance of two colonial policemen at the end, as helpless to punish the malefactors as they were to forestall them, underlines the impotence of the law and perhaps reminded Trollope's audience of the excellence of their own social arrangements.Alert members of that audience will perhaps have noticed that Queensland displays ironic inversions of English certitudes. Most notably, Harry leases his land and _therefore_ considers himself socially much above Medlicot, who has purchased his. In the home country, of course, a land owner who farmed his property (Medlicot is a sugar grower) would have looked severely down upon a man who kept livestock on rented pastures.Unfortunately, despite its excellent qualities, &quot;Harry Heathcote&quot; suffers a defect that reduces it to the Trollopian second class (albeit that is no low place to be). In so short a work, nothing should be wasted, and too many words are wasted here on a perfunctory romance, one of the least interesting that Trollope ever devised. Medlicot's courtship of Harry's sister-in-law not only adds nothing to the narrative but is positively detrimental, as it gives the neighbor a self-interested motive for his decision to take Harry's side against the Brownbie conspiracy rather than maintain a &quot;fair-minded&quot; neutrality.Anyone who has never read Trollope should not begin here, but the author's fans will not regret passing a few hours with him in the Australian bush."},{"Title":"Harry Heathcote of Gangoil: A Tale of Australian Bushlife (World's Classics)","review":"Having spent a year reading the entirety of Trollope's most famous works, the Barsetshire and Palliser novels, I found it hard to jump into a new novel from the same author. I took about a month and a half \\"off\\" before trying to get back into my plan to read his entire library of 46 novels.Somehow I stumbled upon this one at a used bookstore, and was alarmed at its brevity. The World's Classic edition comes in at a mere 125 pages, shorter than even The Warden. So, I figured this would make a good re-introduction to the author. Indeed, I polished it off easily in two days, and found it much more light than what I was used to.This is, in fact, Trollope's shortest novel (I believe today it would be called a \\"novella\\"). As such, there is only one main story, and because of the brevity it moves along very quickly. Trollope notoriously embellished many of his novels to stretch them out over many installments for magazine publication (see also today's primetime drama TV programming). As such, it can often be hard to keep track of his stories in such lengthy works. But here we see him capably telling a concise story.Billed as a \\"Christmas story,\\" it really only tangentially includes the holiday as a time setting. The action is set entirely in the Australian \\"bush lands,\\" where Harry Heathcote, a sheep rancher, lives in fear of his surrounding enemies attempting to destroy his property with fire. Early on, he antagonizes his neighbor who has hired a man that he himself recently fired. Convinced this man is actively seeking his destruction, Harry spends every possible moment riding his enormous acreage hoping to catch his enemy in the act. The best portions of the story follow his inner monologue as he slowly comes to the realization that his entire time spent in Australia has been one of making multiple enemies, and how he has come to a point where there are few people he can trust.The action builds to a climax with a much more intense and exciting altercation than Trollope has been known for. From here the story rapidly wraps up with what has to be one of his more tacked-on romance conclusions. I suppose novels of the day simply could not exist without some form of romance, for this one has absolutely no bearing on the story as a whole.Concise and entertaining, it's one of the easiest Trollope's I've read. It certainly isn't a banner example of his style and talent, but it's very enjoyable as is, and I recommend it, especially to those who are fans of the author, if only to see him in a different setting and atmosphere."},{"Title":"Harry Heathcote of Gangoil: A Tale of Australian Bushlife (World's Classics)","review":"I liked this better than my rating indicates but only because I was born in Australia and have \\"rellies\\" there, and that made the story more interesting to me than it would have otherwise been. The other reviewer made me realize some important points that were made in the story, but when I read it, I saw only my personal interest in Australia being gratified, for the plot was too simple to be satisfying, and the characters less interesting than those of most Trollope books. But the picture of \\"the bush\\" in Australia at that time of history was really well rendered, and for that reason I don't regret the time spent reading this book. If you've never read Trollope, however, don't start here (unless you, too, have a strong interest in Australia)."},{"Title":"The Leadership Genius of George W. Bush: 10 Common Sense Lessons from the Commander-in-Chief","review":"I am an avid reader of biographies and this book provided a biographical sketch of President Bush's lifestyle and then used that foundation to show how his management skills transformed his life. I grabbed a pencil and highlighter half-way into the first chapter and began writing in the margins. I liked this book because I could open to any page and find a nugget of information with a down to earth example. Some of the examples were just real funny and actually made me laugh out loud.Then after reading the first few chapters, I realized that this book was not about President Bush's politics (although there was some strategies revealed) or about his faith (although his personal convictions are the heart of his core values) or even about his IQ level (his emotional intelligence is recognized as highly intuitive). This was a book was about how an average person can become the leader they want to be.I finished the book quickly from a purely biographical point of view and now am going back over each chapter to concentrate on the leadership competencies and how I can learn from the examples. The authors know what they are talking about but they also made it real easy for the reader to put into practice the lessons that need to be learned.After reading this book, I also came to appreciate and admire President Bush and how his personal discipline is one of the timeless principles of his leadership.

Perhaps this is becuase the BE has no particular psychological nuance to display? Perhaps.Leadership, as Fred Nietzsche once opined, is about breaking the rules when others think that rule breaking would be a mistake.Bush's \\"leadership,\\" as noted by the author, consists of learning the rules and efficiently applying them with charm and gingerly worded disinformation.

He is probably one of the only presidents I know that has defined his values and applies them to his job and his life. Both Carolyn and James has shown us that George \\"Dubya\\" has defined and communicated his management style and values to those that work for him. In addition, Carolyn and James has clearly laid out a plan or process I could use with my team to identify our values to assure we are working together. They have shown how not only defining these values and living them by \\"walking the talk\\" can make your organization or team successful.Carolyn and James have written a book that not only identifies the specific management style that made GW so successful, they have given me a process to utilize these skills in my own position. They have used all the resources available to them, admitedly most of them are negative, to show specific examples of GW's leadership style and how they have impacted decisions he has made. More important, they have taken examples where GW's critics have taken shots at the prez (and there are several) and used them to show how the president has changed his style and his views not to please the general public but for the common good of the country.I am sure that many of GW's critics won't want to read this book.

Yet, most of us have no real idea of when or where the wheel was actually invented and how it came to be used in transportation.While the potter's wheel appears to be the earliest use of some form of wheel, the earliest of these didn't actually pivot the wheel on an axle. The first use of axle-pivoted wheels appears to have been on a peculiar two-wheeled \\"chariot\\" in the region of what is now Kazakhstan in central Asia nearly three thousand years ago. From there, the concept of wheeled transport spread east to China, where it appears as a two-wheeled chariot only 1-200 years later, and south to Babylonia, where it shows up as a four-wheeled war wagon drawn by asses painted on the side of a 2800 year old harp. (Interestingly, when I researched the domestication and spread of horses, their use follows almost exactly the same timeline and geographical distribution.)The book goes on to show the spread of wheeled vehicles throughout the world, with the development of improvements such as the spoked wheel, systems for pivoting the axle so that the vehicle can make turns and methods for cushioning the ride to make it easier on passengers. It continues on through the development of motor vehicles, up to the present, all with clear diagrams and pictures.This book provides a fascinating survey of the history of an invention that surrounds us every day, one basic to all of our technology and yet, one we take for granted. The idea of running a pole through the middle of two round slabs of wood, with a box on top for passengers or cargo, seems simple and obvious to us now, yet it's only been around for about the last 5,000 years. I salute the anonymous genius in Kazakhstan who came up with the idea! We owe him (or her?) a profound debt of gratitude."},{"Title":"1,001 Facts Somebody Screwed Up","review":"This book proves the adage that a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. Many allegedly &quot;screwed-up facts&quot; are simply cute, too-clever-by half twists that the author has cooked up on familiar subjects, and many of these twists are just as screwed up as the facts that the author is allegedly debunking. For example, on page 2, the book asserts that &quot;there are only forty-six states in the United States. Virginia, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and Massachusetts are commonwealths.&quot; Well, okay, those four states do call themselves commonwealths, but doing so obviously does not deprive them of statehood. (A &quot;commonwealth&quot; was simply a term popular in the eighteenth century, particularly around the time of American independence, for describing a political community whose form of government was based on the consent of the governed.) The book contains dozens, if not hundreds, of instances of equally threadbare research and thinking. The author offers no credentials, other than thanking a list of &quot;Mensans&quot; in his acknowledgments; and the book nowhere contains any citation, documentation, or other authority for its &quot;facts,&quot; other than a barely page-long introduction in which the author writes that he relied on &quot;encyclopedias, standard references, and specialists.&quot; The book's &quot;facts&quot; may supply fodder for some meagerly amusing cocktail-party conversation, but just don't start that conversation in a contentious crowd, because nobody will take your argument seriously if this book is all that is backing you up."},{"Title":"1,001 Facts Somebody Screwed Up","review":"I don't think this is a book of facts somebody screwed up.

I came upon the cover of Hasting's book 'Three Women' featured on the cover of a book about book covers - Jaye Zimet's study of the cover art of lesbian pulps entitled 'Strange Sisters: the art of lesbian pulp fiction'.Hastings style is confident, and her pace does not flag. For the usual hurriedly written books of that genre, her plot is surprisingly layered. The designation of 'overwrought' so dismissively applied to the prose of lesbian pulp fiction is in some cases - and in this particular instance, blatantly undeserved and unjust. Ann Bannon of Beebo Brinker fame, a cynosure of lesbian pulps, after all, possessed a Phd in linguistics! Nor does Hastings disappoint.During the 'fifties and 'sixties, so-called lesbian 'pulps' were the the 'plat du jour', catering to the pressing hunger of lesbians for visibility. It was a hunger so urgent that it could be met even under the cover of blatant animadversion.I have to admit that what compelled me to get this book was its cover, and specifically the face on that cover: Coincidentally (?!) its amazing resemblance to Anna Foss Wilson, who played Beebo in the theatre production of Ann Bannon's Beebo Brinker.This was a face which perfectly captured the secret dream of love between women in the 'fifties: The ravishing curve of sweeping lashes, the lowered gaze of concealed passion, the inwardly turned expression of banked intensity, which were then the apt symbols of lesbian love. Ann Bannon refers to these affairs as 'a flaming romances' - and 'Three Women' is nothing if not a work of un-aplogetic female for female passion.Even so, I had to overcome a reflexive reluctance to trudge once more along the cheerless and dispirited path of lesbian fiction of that era, with its themes of happiness blighted, hopes dashed, women expelled from the warm arms of other women into the starkness of the hetero wilderness and condemned/compelled to join the plodding ranks of stepford-wifedom which was the treasured ideal of the 'fifties.But this book has what Carlos Castaneda refers to as' A path with a heart', and thereby delightfully exceeded all my expectations.Here's the synopsis. Protagonist Paula is a lovely young girl from a blue-collar background, living with her parents and teen-aged brother in a cold water flat, which is in fact a tenement . Paula is beautiful and a budding artist. Her father, to whom the family is devoted, is terminally ill as a result of a lifetime of drinking. Her resigned and long- suffering mother is worn out by a life of hardship and penury. Paula's younger brother Mike is a bit of a jerk, but in a way that sixty years ago passed for standard male behaviour.Phil, Paula's handsome upper-class boyfriend and soon to be fianc&egrave; with whom she is 'in love', is a thoroughly upstanding guy. Phil is Paula's ticket out of this dreary life.Phil has ambitions of owning his own business, a paint store, but he lacks the capital for this venture. He takes Paula along for the ride when he goes to visit his spinster aunt Bernadette, in the hope of tapping her for the down payment.The reasoning behind Phil's Freudian slip is that he hopes Paula's presence might tip the scales in his favour.Paula is expecting to meet a wizened old biddy, but what she finds (though she still doesn't quite get it ), is what we instantly recognise as a fabulously ravishing dyke, elegantly dressed in the high 'fifties dyke couture of white silk shirt and charcoal grey slacks. Byrne, as she likes to be called, is compellingly beautiful. She exudes that species of magnetically irresistible charm lesbians (and perhaps some straight men) dream of encountering. Byrne is aptly named for her smouldering beauty.Needless to say Paula is irredeemably smitten: Though she surrenders to Phil in a misstep of displaced passion, things are obviously not right. For her Byrne is a 'coup de foudre'. Byrne's upscale flat also features the portrait of a naked woman. Byrne, we find out, is a gifted painter.Somehow for Paula, the mix is both heady and incendiary. She is instantly captivated and drawn like a moth to the flame of Byrne's presence, even to the point of (very innocently ) stalking her. Paula's seemingly hitherto unexamined heterosexuality is demolished in a passionate conflagration ,Paula pursues Byrne, and Byrne yields to Paula's persistent importunities, as a consequence of which the two fall in love, They begin an affair with all the expected charm of a same- sex May / September romance and many accompanying flying sparks. Paula studies painting under Byrne's artistic tutelage. She seems even to play a naive Galatea to Byrne's indulgent but understated Pygmalion.But alas the path of true love never did run smooth did it? Paula's discovery that Byrne's past still haunts her makes her jealous and insecure.In order to reassure Paula, Byrne recounts to her (in what is a chilling cautionary tale), the blossoming of Byrne's first love with Greta. It is a story which ends tragically, due to the homo-sadistic interference of Greta's mother, an interference which Byrne's psyche manages to survive, but Greta's does not.By the time we come across Greta she is deranged. She is a grotesque, shattered, occasionally violent ruin, whose life is sustained by Byrne's pity - and guilt. Byrne suffers Greta's unpredictable and sometimes frightening intrusions with kindness and forbearance. Byrne is determined to spare Paula the terrible fate which overtook her and Greta.Here I digress a little in order to interject a personal observation or two, but only because I am convinced of their contextual relevence: Besides, such a richly textured plot as this, makes one's hermeneutical impulses impossible to resist!I readily admit, I shrank from reading part three of this book, anticipating the dreaded ectoplasm of vicarious repression that would ooze out of the pages and engulf me in the feeling of hopelessness and loss of lesbian love gone wrong, replete with the heaviness of other-imposed shame and guilt.I didn't want to subject myself to feeling the sense of paranoia of the 'gay' 'fifties, when simply a whiff of one's homosexuality could lead to the kind of discovery culminating in social decapitation. Being gay was after all, in those inquisitorial times, a pathology, for which one could be quite legally lobotomized.Lobotomy was then considered a cure for otherwise incurable homosexuality, and concomitantly, the 'schizophrenia' of the double life of homosexuals.The sinister Dr Walter Freeman ( the wizard of the 'ice pick' lobotomy) said of his 'patients' \\" They cannot dream\\" - and this must have been an additional inducement - if such a thing was at all required, to those who reveled in the sight of sexual heretics being sacrificed on the pyre of heterosexist dogma.I knew I couldn't' stomach the story of another such lesbian disaster.But somehow I made myself go on reading, and as I did, I couldn't escape the feeling about Greta that I was gazing at a palimpsest. I had the feeling that something beneath the surface was seeping through, that was sensed but not quite seen.Then it came to me, that sure enough, this was an intertextual reprise of Charlotte Bront's classic, 'Jane Eyre'!The figure of Greta is surely something out of a gothic novel: A travesty in the real sense - of something wrongly clothed.The echo I had heard inside my head was the sound of footsteps: Those Mr Rochester's insane wife Bertha escaping her warder and running around the manor at night. Bertha, who would in a fit of jealousy and rage destroy Jane's symbol of love, her wedding veil, just as Greta destroyed a treasured painting of Byrne's.But will the parallel continue? Will Greta, like Bertha, nearly destroy her former lover just as the lover was about to begin a new life with a much younger woman?Do we as readers hear the literary equivalent of the first four notes of Beethoven's Fifth? Could this be the dreaded past making it's unwelcome intrusion into the present solely in order to confound one when one is on the verge of attaining a dearly longed for and long deferred happiness?Old lost loves, now turned grotesque and sinister, but also tragic, can serve as warnings to us of the terrible wreckage love can leave behind. In this case, the wreck is the damage wrought to the psyches of sexual dissidents (lesbians like Greta and Byrne) by the sadistic and punitive eruptions they unwittingly unleash in people like Greta's mother. Could the same fate overtake Byrne and Paula?I held my breath waiting for the wolf-note of cynicism to interject itself into the narrative as so disappointingly and repeatedly happens in the lesbian novels of the pre- Stonewall lesbian dark ages, including Ann Bannon's. I gritted my teeth for the compulsory commissurotomy that comes at the end of the lesbian relationship, when love is kicked aside and ground into the dirt. Would Hastings/Singer also step on that particular mine?Will Paula's and Byrne's touching adoration of each other remain alive?Will Byrne show herself to be as ethical and constant as she as well bred?Will Paula remain starry-eyed? or will the homophobia of their word defeat them?Will Byrne do better by Greta than Jane Eyre's Mr Rochester does by poor lost Bertha his insane wife? Or will she disappoint us after all?Will love conquer all - or will it fight hard only to be defeated in the end?This book is remarkable for its purity and sensitivity. It never succumbs to debauchery or cheapness, and its little clich&eacute;s are endearing and forgivable.Though 'Three Women' is a hi fidelity reverberation of the 'fifties, will this particular song stay fresh, or strike a sour note?Will the denouement break our hearts - or merely disappoint?Read this book and find out!When Hastings published 'Three Women' in 1950, 'Nevertheless' by The Mills Brothers, was number 17 on the top 40."},{"Title":"Three women","review":"As with most books dealing with lesbian love in the 50's, this book seems to say 'yes, there was lesbian love affairs, but the female were really straight'.

Well, you might try 7,000 CLAMS, the first novel by college history professor Lee Irby. And that's \\"clams\\" as in bread, dough, scratch, jack, moolah and dinero. Seven thousand of which was a pretty good chunk-of-change in 1925 at the height of Prohibition, the era during which this story is set and which is depicted with accuracy and lavish detail by the author. A few pages into this book and you will hear the rattle of a Tommy gun, the throaty roar of a Model T down-shifting as it careens around the corner making its getaway and, last but not least, smell the booze being dispensed from hundreds of local speakeasies in blatant contravention of the Volstead Act. So hop up on the running board and hold on tight, you're in for one wild and entertaining ride!Frank Hearn is just an ordinary guy trying to make an honest living. Well, as least as honest a living as is possible for a bootlegger in Asbury Park, New Jersey during the roaring Twenties. Set to make a big score on a shipment of top-shelf hooch, Hearn is double-crossed and his booze is hijacked. Frank finds the mug that set him up but it's too late to get either his liquor or his money back. What he does get, however, is an IOU for $7,000 in gambling debts signed by none other than the great Babe Ruth himself. With his prospects looking pretty dim up North, Hearn decides to make the trek to St. Petersburg, Florida where the mighty Yankees are set to begin spring training. There he hopes to brace the Babe and force the slugger to pay up before Frank goes public with the story. Along the way Hearn hooks up with ex-torch singer Ginger DeMore, a dame with curves in all the right places and the guts to use the gun she packs in one of the few places she has that doesn't curve.7,000 CLAMS is both entertaining and evocative. Irby's guys and molls not only talk the talk but they walk the walk as well. Most impressive is the manner in which the author subtly portrays the schizophrenia of the era - a faade of morality and law and order covering a situation rapidly deteriorating into anarchy and lawlessness. Portrayed here is a country of seemingly limitless possibility but one which is at the same time beset by a palpable sense of desperation. Those larger cultural issues of the day are deftly reflected in the chaotic personal lives of the characters in this story. All of those elements more than make up for the places in this novel where the plot - which takes a long time to get rolling in the first place - nearly grinds to a halt.That being said, anyone looking for a good, old fashioned hardboiled story set in an era when the men did what they had to do to get by and the women were as dangerous as they were glamorous will enjoy this novel. Irby expresses a special interest in the 1920's. The quality of his stylish first effort -a few minor blemishes notwithstanding - should leave most readers hoping that he will return again to that same era in subsequent books.

At first it seemed a bit scattered in its narrative technique: it is all in the first-person like Damon Runyon and moves from character to character, people who do not seem connected for a time.The central figure has to be Babe Ruth himself, because everything that happens revolves about him, one way or another. A bootlegger in Asbury Park, New Jersey, in winter, has his latest shipment of booze stolen and sets out to find it. Instead, he comes into possession an IOU for $7,000 signed by none other than the Bambino. At this point the bootlegger, his sometime girl friend, Babe Ruth, and Chicago mobsters descent upon St. Petersburg, Florida, where the New York Yankees are in spring training and where there the Florida real estate scam is near its acme.The plot is complicated and fascinating. It never drags. The characters are marvelous and multi=dimensional. The atmosphere of the Roaring Twenties feels right on the money. There are some grammar and syntax problems, e.g.: \\"A few pelicans descend on the deck of the speedboat, wiating to be fed.\\" That last phrase should refer to speedboat, but surely the watercraft is not waiting to be fed. There are other similar problems that the publisher's editor should have ironed out, but no matter. This is still a very, very good book. that's two verys, as Woody Allen would say.

Khalil runs a highly effective terrorist network that bombs Israeli targets throughout Europe in order to advertise the 'Palestinian' cause.John le Carr&eacute; bases his story on the false historical claim that there is such an ethnic group called the 'Palestinians'. The only 'Palestinians' to have existed were citizens of the 1922 League of Nations' 'Mandate for Palestine', the Jewish Homeland. The term 'Palestinian' was only used for legal purposes to describe those living in the Jewish Homeland between 1922-1948. As such, Jews were also defined as 'Palestinians'. When Israel became a state in 1948 (changing its name from Palestine to Israel. The name Palestine was given to the territory in 135 AD by Emperor Hadrian as an insult to the Jews, who had just revolted against Roman rule for a second time. Palestine is the Romanized version of the name Philistine, the land of Israel's ancient enemies), the term 'Palestinian' became defunct, but was then co-opted by Arab governments and used to fool ignorant observers that the 'Palestinians' had lost their land to the Jews. John le Carr&eacute; presents the 'Palestinians' as an actual ethnic group with justified land claims against the Jewish state, when in fact there never was a 'Palestinian' ethnic group present in the Middle East. And here's the proof of the Arab governments' lie: Unless those who take the anti-Israeli side in this discussion can produce what should be the easy to find documents from the early 1920s where the 'Palestinian People' are demanding their state and being denied their demands by the League of Nations, then you have just proved to yourselves that the 'distinct Palestinian People' canard is just that-a canard.The Little Drummer Girl does have one saving grace, however, and that revolves around the Mossad recruitment of 'Charlie', an unknown actress with Vanessa Redgrave-like politics. Due to the latest bombing by Khalil of an Israeli target in Bad Godesberg, the Mossad must quickly neutralize Khalil and his network or else the politicians in Israel and the IDF will take matters into their own hands, which means indiscriminate reprisal attacks on Arab (not 'Palestinian') refugee camps, resulting in the deaths of women and children and another black eye for Israel in the court of world opinion.On the trail of the elusive Khalil is the Mossad's best operative-Kurtz, and his Mossad team. Kurtz's plan: use Charlie to infiltrate Khalil's network and hope to luck that once inside Khalil can be found."},{"Title":"A Practical Course in Wooden Boat and Ship Building","review":"I really liked the actual construction techniques demonstrated in the book.

The style of this work is very similar to his work about the Messerschmitt Bf 109, so I think that comparison would be true.Now for the \\"bad\\". This volume has no great number of photographs of combat aircraft. If you want to see the aircraft flown by ace pilot buy some of the Osprey books. You won't get any real amount of technical information, but you will get aces. The next step to take, if you want more technical detail, more political detail, and combat photographs MIGHT be to buy the 3 volumes by Deitmar Harmann (I can't be sure, as I only own one of the three, and it has been a few years since I read it). However, for a beginning primer, this is as good as any would be."},{"Title":"The Doctrine of Grace in the Apostolic Fathers","review":"Torrance examines early Christian writings and how they view grace. Contrary to another reviewer, there is nothing narrow or Calvinist about this. The New Testament abounds with usage of the word grace, but most of these Church Fathers seem to avoid the term and rather emphasize works. Paul would not have approved, and in fact foresaw this coming, as he warned his readers multiple times to be on the lookout for those who would lose the Gospel of Grace. Evangelicals will be disconcerted by how far from the John's Gospel these writers had already drifted by the third and forth century."},{"Title":"The Doctrine of Grace in the Apostolic Fathers","review":"This is one of Torranec's earliest works, and his claim that the apostolic fathers (those church leaders who succeeded the apostles) lost the core of the gospel has been challenged and refuted from the time of the book's publication. Nonetheless, it has been used again and again in Reformed circles to support their own claims, and for this reason it is worth challenging once again.To understand the whole of this book all you need to do is read these few quotes. \\"In the Apostolic Fathers grace did not have [the] radical character [that it had in the New Testament]. The great presupposition of the Christian life, for them, was not a deed of decisive significance that cut across human life and set it on a wholly new basis grounded upon the self-giving of God. What took absolute precedence was God's call to a new life in obedience to revealed truth. Grace, as far as it was grasped, was subsidiary to that. And so religion was thought of primarily in terms of man's acts toward God, in the striving toward justification, much less in terms of God's acts for man which put him in the right with God once and for all.\\" Torrance continues, \\"In the Apostolic Fathers grace lost its radical character. They developed a doctrine of salvation by works of righteousness... A Christian ethic was codified, and the charismatic life under the constraining love of Christ [was] reduced to rules and precepts. The centre of gravity was shifted from the mainspring of the Christian life in the person of Christ Himself to the periphery of outward conformity and daily behaviour.\\" He continues, \\"In the Apostolic Fathers grace became related to the continuance of the Christian life, rather than to the decisive motion of God's love as the presupposition of the whole Christian life... Grace became an ad hoc matter, an aid to the main work of sanctification, a donum superadditum. In other words, grace was something given by God to those who worthily strive after righteousness to enable them to attain their end [heaven]... Grace was taken under the wing of the Church in an official way...as the depository of pneumatic grace, dispensed in sacramentalist fashion. The Church...possessed the means of grace.\\" Lastly, \\"What facilitated the syncretism of Judaism and Hellenism was the idea, common in principle to both, of self-justification, but it was Christianity which provided the sphere in which the two could come together, for as opposed to Hellenism it brought the principle of revelation, and as opposed to Judaism it did away with the ceremonial law. As opposed to both, the Gospel of Christianity was so astounding just because it taught a doctrine of justification by grace alone. This was unpalatable to both sides. Judaism refused to accept it because of its revolutionary character and its attitude to the law. Hellenism simply failed to see the New Testament problems. Both of these attitudes to grace are found in the Apostolic Fathers. Their theology represents a corrosion of the faith both from the side of Judaism and from the side of Hellenism, because the basic significance of grace was not grasped.\\"Upon reading the book I was struck by the narrow, Reformed, definition of the concept of grace, salvation and free will employed by Torrance. His whole theological worldview is, as much as it may seem hard to believe for Reformed fans, unapostolic. It is really more of an Augustinian/Calvinist analysis of how the earliest church fathers understood grace and salvation, and why it is wrong because it isn't an Augustinian/Reformed approach; quite anachronistic but sadly popular among such studies. The Semitic mind, and how that was transforming the Hellenic mind among Christians, is almost entirely missing in this study. Had he started with the biblical/apostolic worldview, that mankind is created to be free in the grace of God, that grace makes nature what it is, that humanity is not a massa damnata, then he would not see deification as a Hellenic carry over or be shocked by the lack of forensic talk about justification. Although he paints the fathers as a bunch of semi-Pelagians at best, it turns out he was in this early days of his writing tone deaf to the whole of the gospel in its historical/cultural setting. Salvation defined as \\"saved\\" by faith alone is NOT to be found in any of the church fathers of this period, not the NT/OT. It is an Augustinian invention taken up by the Reformed camp. So based on this approach, it is all but impossible for Torrance not to misinterpret the fathers as believers in works righteousness and unChristocenric. But by his (narrowly Reformed) definition of Christocentrism he would be forced to jettison or downgrade the Epistle of St James as proto-Pelagian for the same reasons.Another approach is to understand that from the beginning the Church has not posed grace and freedom against each other, that a sacramental system rooted in the liturgy was present, and that the transforming nature of grace was central, and all of this wrapped up in a solidly Christocentric understanding of everything, beginning with the incarnation and continuing with the life of Christ in the Spirit; with issues of (self) justification largely missing. St Paul is of this same tradition, which is abundantly clear if read according to his own words and not through the lens of Aquinas, Luther, Calvin or Augustine.Readers would be better served to seek outGrace and Christology in the Early Church (Oxford Early Christian Studies),Bible, Church, Tradition: An Eastern Orthodox View. Volume One in the Collected Works of Georges Florovsky,Partakers of the Divine Nature: The History and Development of Deification in the Christian Traditions,Christus Victor: An Historical Study of the Three Main Types of the Idea of Atonement. Christianity is a way of life, not an idea that God has about us based upon an idea that we have about God."},{"Title":"The Water Road","review":"If you've ever thought about traveling around Britain on the canals and waterways of the 18th century industrial era, and haven't done it, this book will convince you that you should. And if you have, and you enjoyed it, it will bring back all sorts of memories. Gogarty spent 4 months to travel 1,000 miles in a narrowboat (at a max. speed of 4mph), and the book describes the world as seen from another perspective. You will also meet the hundreds of delightful characters he discovered populating the inner waterways. He's a descriptive writer with a good turn for memorable phrases and his descriptions of the canals, the boats, the people and the surroundings are evocative and irresistible.And the even nicer thing is that every year, the British waterways seem to expand, with old canals slowly being renovated, restored and brought back into use, and this book sends a very positive message out about this revival. It's a great book and a very entertaining read that brought back a lot of memories from the odd couple of canal boat trips I did myself in the UK some years ago (being stoned in 'bandit country' - the Wigan Flight being one not so fond memory - as in, having stones thrown at me, not the smoked version :) ). Fish and Chips and Mushy Peas being another (fond one, that is)."},{"Title":"The Water Road","review":"Could not put this down.

The Soviets hated him so much that the final chapter of the course is a scathing article about him in Pravda.

Trilling in the introduction focuses on understanding Keats relation to suffering and beauty. He takes the concept 'geniality' and shows how it is especially applies to the life- enhancing work and attitude of Keats. The Keats who spoke of life as a 'vale of soul- making' was as Trilling shows a tremendously vibrant, energetic and positive soul. In terms which he might be criticized for today Trilling speaks of the 'masculine quality' of Keats.The letters have an incredible richness of percepted reality. Trilling points that for Keats all the senses came into play in writing about the world. This is felt in the letters' also. Also Keats great human quality in relation to others.I was most moved by Keats parting words to Joseph Severn who so faithfully cared for him in the last months of his life.Trilling quotes the exchange in the introduction as follows:\\"As he lay on his deathbed he asked Severn. \\"Did you ever see anyone die?\\" Severn never had. \\"Well then, I pity you, poor Severn. What trouble and danger you have got into for me. Now you must be firm for it will not last long. I shall soon be laid in the quiet grave. Thank God, for the quiet grave... And at the end. \\"Severn , lift me up, for I am dying. I shall die easy. Don't be frightened !Thank God, it has come.\\"The letters show Keats not only as great poetic soul but as true human being.They belong in the same library as the letters of Van Gogh, and Kafka."},{"Title":"To Wed A Viscount (Zebra Historical Romance)","review":"Everything I normally look for to enjoy a book was evident in this book save one or two elements, but that did not deter me from thoroughly enjoying this book. The synopsis of this novel is on the product review page, it's pointless to repeat it here.This book had enough accurate information for that Genre that is was easy for me to safely enjoy the book without consciously looking for mistakes. No more accurate dialect for that genre could have been written, Adrienne really put a great effort on her research, for that alone the book deserves a two star. (and adding). The drama was a little too minimal for my taste, but since it existed in the novel overall I was willing to overlook that minor detail. Her usage of the Peerage ranks and social class was as accurate as well. Nothing irritates me more than an author who does not do enough minor research to make sure the peerage title usage is accurate.Lastly, this most important thing for me (it is a love story after all) is the passion between the characters. Ms Basso once again nailed it dead on.This book seems although independent to be part of a series, there was a character \\"Harriet\\" the sister of the Viscount who I really didn't care for at all. Fortunately I read her story in \\"to tempt a rogue\\" before I got my hands on this book and I must say that I would not have wanted to read about her after the role she played in this novel.

She's working with material that seems to mean a great deal to her here --and it shows. The book is basically several character's reactions to a very tragic death. Each character is drawn exquisitely, coming alive through his or her own point-of-view chapters. In fact, this is the only one of Godwin's books to present the point of view of so many complex characters. I saw her in a bookstore seveal years ago and asked her what the origin of the book was, and she said she was working from a similar incident in real life--the death of her half-brother. So in this book she seems to be trying to come to terms with family conflicts by bringing each family member to life on the page. She does a wonderful job, going beyond any kind of therapy for herself into true art, taking her own pain and making it universal. I reread this book every once in a while, and found it especially useful recently because I was going through my own reactions to a death in my family. Yes, to respond to one of the other reviews, there is hatred here, and conflicts are not resolved. It's very, very true to life that way, complex and rich."},{"Title":"Southern Family","review":"Not for those looking for a suspenseful thriller, Gail Godwin is one of our best modern day writers, who is interested in character driven novels as opposed to those focusing on plot.

Even though the book is rather long, I did not want to leave these people, even in their grief.If you enjoyed this book, I would also recommend Stuart O'Nan's \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" as well as three Susan Howatch books: \\"Wheel of Fortune,\\" The Rich are Different,\\" and \\"Sins of the Fathers,\\" which are all excellent examples of rotating the first person in each chapter (as is done here)."},{"Title":"Southern Family","review":"If you are looking for a cheerful fluffy book ~~ this book isn't it.

Adriaan is a secluded character who does not wish to discuss or read his poetry in public, who doesn't feel compelled to advertise his writing in literary journals. He isn't interested in so-called \\"admirers\\" of Afrikaans literature either and he is thus a fairly isolated figure in the small community of writers and artists of Cape Town. The fact that his companion Stephan left him a short while ago makes him feel even more lonely. Among his friends, Nico is a superficial and conceited actor relentlessly looking for an improbable lover in the latest cruising points in the city. The atmosphere of sadness and desolation is increased by the fact that Cape Town is becoming slowly depopulated and continuously invaded by the homeless and dispossessed who set up their camps among the empty, neglected and decayed buildings. The squatters' filthy shelters pop up everywhere in streets and in parks. Hawkers, peddlers, hucksters, thieves and beggars slowly creep into the city centre. As the oppression against the natives increases, bloody corpses litter the streets, blood is smeared over the pavement. \\"We learned not to ask questions; we learned to keep silent, we learned to accept.\\" writes Mr. Schoeman. At the same time the members of the white community remain securely barricaded with their money and their comfort behind the high walls surrounding their properties. Gradually, acquaintances are leaving: Bernard's wife Marisa is leaving for Holland. She wishes \\"never even hear the name South Africa any more.\\" The days of the small museum where Adriaan works are numbered, a decison taken by some official in Pretoria.

What I really liked is that Scott did not do the usual dream interpretations such as a dove means peace; if you see a boat, you're going to travel, etc. This type of noncense is most annoying to those of us who are awakened dreamers.

After retirement he spent ten years supervising training and performance of Zen students in Honolulu and London. This book evidences his professional mastering in the art of teaching. This book has a very clear structure and facilitates the understanding of many details that currently are absent in conventional books because they are exchanged in face-to-face meetings between teacher and disciple.

The working on koans is approached keeping in mind that many Western Zen practitioners rarely pursue their training in a monastery. Cognitive aspects involved in the process of samadhi, awareness, awakening, knowing and being without thinking are broken down, analyzed and illustrated thoroughly and accurately. The final manuscript was reviewed by a collaborator, a lecturer at the University of Cambridge.

However, I do agree with a previous reviewer who recommends the practice of Qigong as an important support for meditation. Qigong will most efficiently and powerfully supply the energy the tanden requires to produce samadhi. You may not find these two disciplines (Zen and Qigong) melded anywhere, which is a pity since they compliment each other perfectly and accelerate progress on the path. Therefore, Sekida's book together with \\"Energy Medicine...\\" (Hiew/Yap) and \\"Opening the Energy Gates...\\" (Frantzis) will provide the foundation for Samadhi."},{"Title":"Zen training: Methods and philosophy","review":"I learned to do zazen from this book a long time ago. While I now have had a couple of teachers, the approach to zazen that I learned from Sekida has served me well on this path. I'll probably wind up teaching zen myself someday, and this is the book that I will be giving to my students. All of the other philosophical and historical books about zen are certainly useful, so we all know where the tradition came from, but this is the only really clear book about how to do zen meditation that I have ever read. Everything that Sekida explains about the long-term results of meditation, from off-sensation (which Sekida describes wonderfully) on to positive and absolute samadhi, I can verify that all of it is correct. There's no mumbo-jumbo here. For anybody who really wants to try zen meditation but cannot find a teacher (or doesn't want a teacher, which is also fine) then this is the book you should be reading and re-reading."},{"Title":"Zen training: Methods and philosophy","review":"I bought this book a year ago have read it 3 times already. This is a critical book (along with 'On having no head') for starting a western approach to zen . He clarifies the mystery of zen training and places the foundation stone for us in the west to move forward and away from slavish adherance to the eastern approach to zen. A must have and must not loan book."},{"Title":"Zen training: Methods and philosophy","review":"First of all, I have to say that I've enjoyed reading this book. I am a student of Zen and practice Zazen myself. I found Sekida's discussions of breathing, the tanden, and his approach to the samadhis illuminating and interesting. Specifically, his take that what he calls \\"absolute samadhi\\" is actually the center of all Zen training is unique and somewhat compelling. His basic claim is that this state represents extreme wakefulness but with the basic elements of ordinary consciousness (time, space, causality) shorn away. He calls this state \\"pure existence\\" and indicates that thoroughly going through this state is the substance or content of the Zen way, it being the ground of kensho.I have two issues with his work that prevent me from giving it five stars. First is his almost total neglect of presenting Zen in terms of its tradition and philosophy in a satisfying way (he does reference standard Zen themes but introduces them in an off-hand sort of way, and only in the context of his own hypotheses). I am also intrigued but not in any way convinced by his presentation of Zen in terms of philosophy and epistemology. His attempt to cover this ground in terms of the nen-theory, while commendable for novelty, is marked by some frustrating inconsistencies and seems in the end to place the Zen revelation as a return to the naive realism of children. I would be very interested to see what other teachers and masters in the Zen tradition would have to say about his views (indeed, his work seems to be fairly obscure, for some reason or another, perhaps related to the whole biographical ambiguity I discuss below).This brings me to my second, less important gripe. That is simply that it would be nice to know under whom he studied. He makes reference throughout the text to \\"we\\" \\"our\\" and a Zendo in Honolulu. Yet, the reader is given no basis to determine who this \\"we\\" is. He seems to have been a layman who studied in the Rinzai tradition, but it would really be nice to have a handle on where he's coming from. He is refered to as a \\"Zen master\\", in several places, but I can determine no basis for his having this title other than as a sign of respect by some people. This is not necessarily to impugn his accomplishments at all, but it would be nice to know more biographically.This book has some excellent guidelines for the practical points in Zazen practice, and some intriguing commentary vis a vis samadhi and kensho, and I recommend it to anyone seeking to gain more practical advice in their Zen practice. I would not, however, recommend it to beginners in Zen. For those, the works of D.T. Suzuki, Shunryu Suzuki, Philip Kapleau, Thich Nhat Hanh, and others would be better. Additionally, reading the sutras first-hand is also highly recommended (esp. the Diamond Sutra, and the Platform Sutra of hui-neng). Against a broad Zen background, I think Sekida's work can shine out best."},{"Title":"Zen training: Methods and philosophy","review":"This book provides one of the best, most detailed explanations of the practical, technical realities of zen practice. As others have stated, he is is extremely precise and analytical in his analysis of every aspect of the experience of zazen. This can sometimes seem overwhelming, but if you are serious about zazen, then this book is serious about how to support you. It is defiantly worth the time that I spent poring over it, though it was nice to have a someone around with some anatomy knowledge to help me through his explanations of optimal breathing in meditation.I recommend this book to everyone that I know who is actually serious about deepening their zazen practice. This book is not for the person who is casually interested in meditation or for the armchair Buddhist philosopher, however."},{"Title":"Zen training: Methods and philosophy","review":"This is a no frills guide to the practice of zen meditation. There is very little in the ways of metaphysics within this treasure. Zen at it's core and beginning was a revolt against a bureaucratic metaphysical form of Buddhism that had become commonplace at the the time of Zen's creation. Zen's attempt to strip away the 'buildup' of any sort of reflexive knowledge is exemplified in the first half of this book. The formation of one's sitting posture and breathing patterns is an absolute requirement for practice and this is the only book that I have ever seen that talks at length and quite deeply about these two subjects. The breathing section is most interesting as diagrams are used to describe the uses of the various forms of lung volume such as reserve and residual volume. The book also flows well because he talks about the neurological activity of the brain during the various forms and courses of breathing; mentioning also the whether the brain is using alpha waves, beta waves, etc.My favorite part is that the author is a simple school teacher that has practiced for many years making his advice practical for the average Joe. I will warn that the book is heady on material because of its applicability therefore it is good to take time out for this one. A difficult task for any bookworm."},{"Title":"Zen training: Methods and philosophy","review":"Ranks as one of the finest books on zen philosophy in english. Definitely a classic that is clearly written and highly practical. Other books in this category would be Suzuki's Zen and Japanese Culture, Kapleau's The Three Pillars of Zen, Chang Chung-Yuan's translation from The Transmission of the Lamp (under Original Teachings of Ch'an Buddhism), etc."},{"Title":"Zen training: Methods and philosophy","review":"Mr. Katsuki Sekida was a ZEN master who wrote a training manual for ZEN that is comprehensive; and Mr Sekida taught zen at Robert Aitken's zendo (the diamond sangha.Here is a list of Zen books I recommend.\\"Zen Training: Methods And Philosophy\\" Katsuki Sekida\\"The Three Pillars Of Zen\\" Phillip Kapleau\\"Zen: Lessons From A Modern Master\\" Katsuki Sekida\\"Taking The Path Of Zen\\" Robert Aitken\\"Zen Meditation in Plain English\\" John Daishin BuksbazenI rate this book head and shoulders above the rest because it is better than the rest in my opinion.Those five books are the only Zen books I can recommend in a good conscience.Am I 100% happy with this book? NO. The Author spoke Japanese as his first language; so English was his second language, and you will find some words and phrases that do not make sence at first. You will have to dig for the gold nuggets in this book; so please be patient to read and re-read the book until you get what your personal teacher is trying to teach you.The ONLY two ZEN books in my private library are \\"Zen Training: Metrhods And Philosophy: by Katsuki Sekida, and \\"Taking The Path Of Zen\\" Robert Aitken.I see there is some debate whether Katsuki Sekida was a zen master or not.I DO remember reading in one of Robert Aitken's books that he wanted someone to teach zen to members of the Diamond Sangha; and he asked his friend and zen master Nagakawa Soen to come to Hawai'i to tech Zen. Mr. Soen was too frail to make the voyage to Hawai'i; so zenji Soen sent Katsuki Sekida to teach zen to those attending the Diamond Sangha.I can not imagine a zen master would send a teacher to teach zen UNLESS the teacher was qualified to teach.Lastly; some people mention reading the works of D.T. Suzuki.Mr. Sukuki may have been a zen master; but in my opinion; Mr. Suzuki was NOT qualified to teach Zen.I sincerely believe this book will help you attain the state called \\"no mind\\". It did for me!"},{"Title":"Zen training: Methods and philosophy","review":"The first book you must read if interested in zen and zazen practice. Very easy to follow and pretty intellectualy seductive.Illustrative in the \\"right way\\" of sitting and breathing, but better yet in explaining what is zen all about. Great for beginners."},{"Title":"Zen training: Methods and philosophy","review":"thist is the most excellent nuts and bolts explanation of sitting meditation that i have encountered (and my bookshelf is full). if you read this and follow its instructions you will have no physiological barriers to success. my copy is dogeared and underlined to excess."},{"Title":"Zen training: Methods and philosophy","review":"There are a lot of books out there on zen; one may wander the aisles of any of the big book chains and see how the word has become a bit overused. However, if I were to suggest one book on zen that should be found on your shelf, this would be it. No fluff and/or preaching here, just solid information and discussion on the fundamentals of zazen.I particularly like the fact that Sekida emphasizes breathing and energy flow from the tanden; for someone who practices Qigong this seems obvious but I think many who practice zazen take years to catch on. The sheer amount of practical advice in this book make it well worth the money and the discussion of three nen make it indispensible. In fact, I think this is a better place to start than many of the more esoteric zen books since really, this is all about the practice, not the theory.Combine this with a book on Qigong, &quot;Mindfulness in Plain English&quot;, and perhaps &quot;Zen and the Brain&quot; and then find a master; I don't think you'll ever regret the decision."},{"Title":"Zen training: Methods and philosophy","review":"For me, this book is the best book on zen I've read,because it deals with a topic that is essencial for learning zen, and that is not discussed in detail in most of the other books: how to practice zazen. It explains methods for breathing, diferent postures, what you should experience in zazen, and many other interesting things. I start practicing zazen a while ago under the direction of a zen monk, and I even went to a ten days sesshin (retreat), but I learned to breath in zazen through this book. I greatly recomend this book for anyone who is interested in zen, beginers and who has some knowledge alike."},{"Title":"Zen training: Methods and philosophy","review":"The text is written by a laymen who taught high-school English and practiced/studied Zen in Japan. He later taught at several Zendos in Hawaii and in London.There are several benefits of this text. First, the writer's cultural background bridges translation problems and he focuses on accurate translation of the ideas and concepts. Second, the writer is a laymen which may help the more cynical reader be more open to different ideas. Third, he discusses the fine points of meditation technique in a semi-scientific approach that appeals to a western mechanistic paradigm--we aren't caught up in flowery, artsy-fartsy instruction which does have a place but not for many Westerners interested in the actual practice methods. Fourth, I found the author has suggestions for improving that I haven't seen anywhere else. Fifth, the text describes practice that allows the practitioner to improve the technique to adapt to their special needs which I believe is realistic and very much in-line with the original intent of Siddartha--this is to help free the practitioner from the small inaccuracies always found in a mechanistic approach.I recommend this as one of the best methods texts I have ever had the privlege to come across."},{"Title":"Zen training: Methods and philosophy","review":"There are Zen philosophers and Zen practitioners. This book is for the practitioner. After you have grown tired of the philosophical and intellectual musings of other authors, read this book to understand the absolute essentials behind Zen and why it works as no other approach does. Katsuki Sekida explains the three nens, and how the practice of Zazen breaks down our conditioning that keeps us in delusion. He goes on to explain the science of entering samadhi, and the role that posture, breath, and the Tan Tien play. With this understanding, it becomes much easier to bypass the chaos of rising thoughts and emotions, and quickly enter absolute samadhi. This book will help you, in weeks, to gain a depth of Zazen that might otherwise take years. You can take that quite literally; that is not an exaggeration or meant as hyperbole."},{"Title":"Zen training: Methods and philosophy","review":"I have read many books on Zen, and this book is truly a unique treasure. It is beautifully written and translated and comes from a well regarded, long-time lay practitioner who also was a school teacher. What makes this book unique is the detail and clarity with which the author explains the techniques and theory of zazen. He integrates his knowledge of Zen with modern physiological principles producing explanations for what occurs in zazen that are satisfying spiritually as well as scientifically. I have not found this type of detail or several of the concepts and techniques described in any other source. Particularly for the student trying to develop a home practice without a teacher, this book will prove invaluable. There are also several excellent chapters about the philosophy and psychology of Zen, with nice connections to existentialism and depth psychology. This book is essential reading for anyone interested in Zen practice. For a more rigorous and detailed physiological account of zazen, see Zen and the Brain by neurologist James Austin, an excellent companion book."},{"Title":"Zen training: Methods and philosophy","review":"This is one of the best books I've read on meditation, be it Zen of other. The author, a Japanese student of Zen, collected a seres of articles published in Hawaii on the topic of Zen Meditation, and published this great book. Starting from the very, very beginning, he will teach you how to breathe, how to sit correctly for meditation, how to count breaths and many techinques needed for correct achieval of Samadhi. He will also discuss spiritual and physical issues of Zen Meditation. In all, a very instructional book on the subject. Great for beginner or advanced meditators."},{"Title":"Zen training: Methods and philosophy","review":"This book is a milestone in zen literature for the western student. Mr. Sekida was a layman who wrote primarily for the zen student who does not study regularly with a teacher. It is a detailed but practical book. This was one of the first books on zen I ever read, several years ago, and at that time it was probably too detailed for me to appreciate. Now, with the benefit of more experience and a little personal instruction, I can appreciate the book much more, and it serves as a source of both practical and philosophical information and inspiration. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the theory and practice of zen."},{"Title":"Zen training: Methods and philosophy","review":"Many books on zen focus on the philosophy behind it. They are much like most philosophical books. My opinion is that any philosophy can be believed. Words can be put to the reader in a way to make them believe anything. Zen is the one philosophy that I have found that does not. The problem with most books on zen is that they use only words to descibe. They make the reader debate what zen and reality is in their heads. The idea is to experience zen. That is where this book comes in. It teaches you how to practice zazen. This is the only way to know zen. To feel it. And this is the best book to learn the proper techniques without a roshi (a zen teacher). For anyone who is probing the depths of thought, defintely give this one a go."},{"Title":"Zen training: Methods and philosophy","review":"You won't get this kind of instruction even if you are lucky enough to have a teacher. Zen teaching tends to glance off the practical and let you stumble around looking for your own way. This book -- and only this book, of all the books I have read or considered reading -- imparts practical, step by step instruction on exactly how to practice zazen.The three jewels are buddha, dharma, and sangha. Sekida cannot hand these jewels to you on a silver platter, but he can spare you many frustrating hours on the cushion if you're beginning -- or continuing -- your practice.If you're serious about zazen, shove those guided meditation and newage [sic] music CDs to the bottom of your wish list, and buy this book.My qualifications: Four years of daily practice, one year of practice with a sangha. That parses out to three years of stubbornly stumbling around on my own. I recommend a little less stumbling and a lot more practice."},{"Title":"Zen training: Methods and philosophy","review":"I avoid modern texts on Zen because too many of them are meaningless ramblings written by frauds to whom Zen is a business. I especially dislike the new age pretentiousness which seems to pass for Zen among many modern 'masters'. I believe that Zen is practiced by doing zazen, pure and simple. Reading books, going to retreats, being a vegetarian, etc. is all just 'window dressing' and has nothing to do with real Zen.As a result, I've kept my Zen reading to minimum. I have some koan collections ('The Gateless Gate', 'The Blue Cliff Records'), a slender volume of works attributed to Bodhidharma, and a few translations of ancient texts. That's about it! Not saying my way is the best way or anything, but I'm setting the stage for how hard it would be for a modern book to cut through my defenses. Despite all that, I found this book to be amazing!Many things I've learned through zazen are woven into the text, so this is clearly an authentic person writing a legitimate treatise on Zen. Some key terms mentioned in Zen texts are described in a very straightforward manner. While I haven't yet appreciated the hardcore physiological passages on breathing, the focus on the tanden is dead on. Interestingly, this focus mirrors what I have always been instructed to do in my martial arts training.I would not recommend this book to someone starting out with Zen. Rather, I think it's best to read it after spending some time on your own (or with a master) in zazen and figuring things out for yourself. After you have some experience, I think this book would then have more positive impact. A person new to Zen might end up using the text as a 'how to' manual or adopt its content with a dogmatic attitude, neither of which was the author's intent (or would move your work in Zen in the right direction).For me, 'Zen Training' has provided some valuable guidance and compiled many key concepts I have found to be important into a single volume. While this doesn't make me interested in checking out more modern works, I'm certainly thrilled to be proven wrong about my blanket dismissal of modern Zen texts. This is a very thoughtfully written book by someone who clearly has spent a great deal of time practicing Zen.PS: I was led to the book because I own the author's translation of the koan texts mentioned above. His commentary in that book resonated with me enough to make me curious what else he might have done."},{"Title":"Nathaniel","review":"For an author who has been called by some as a &quot;wanna be Stephen King&quot; this was definitely not what I expected. Sincerely chilling and disturbing I don't see how Mr. Saul's fanbase isn't much, much larger than it is. This is a serious case of critics being wrong, (and when I say wrong I mean they missed the freakin' moon on this one) A superb tale of supernatural intrigue in a small town setting.

Although, it's not quite as good as I remember it's still a good read... As an adult I have a problem w/ 1 thing, the main character - Michael Hall. One might think he is 6 or 7 at times by the way he acts when he is really suppose to be 11. That inconsistency drives me crazy (short drive). That IMO is the only real flaw & doesn't take away from the story itself. From the beginning John Saul hooks you in & the story has a surprise twist at the end. The characters are well developed & Saul describes everything in vivid detail which pulls you into the story. I think what chills me the most is I can relate to this tale growing up in the city & moving to the country. The Halls & Mr. Findley remind me of people around here which makes the story all the more creepy..."},{"Title":"Nathaniel","review":"I was so excited to finally read a great ghost story!

I recommend this book to all ghost story lovers!"},{"Title":"Nathaniel","review":"Johns Saul Nathaniel: Let me just say that i bought this book because of all the good reviews......It was a let down. I thought the beginning of the book was good. But the story starts to get confusing when Saul claims that Nathaniel is real and not a paranormal entity like he leads the viewer to believe. He also focused too much on the past of the town and included Nathaniel a little allowing the viewer to feel there was more hidden secrets, when in the end there was nothing but confusion. I reality i think he \\"Saul\\" for go a bit of writers block and changed the story like 100 times and then just gave up."},{"Title":"Nathaniel","review":"I have read just about all John Saul's horror novels.

I recommend it to anyone and everyone. This is not just for horror story lovers, it's very well written and it keeps you coming back for more."},{"Title":"Nathaniel","review":"I love Saul and I was not disapointed by this book either. He weaves a loose web through out the novel and just when you think you might have a handle on things...bam! Very cool and I do recommend it, especially if you liked RL Stine as a teen or Stephen King as an adult."},{"Title":"Nathaniel","review":"The ending was a let down. Saul brings the reader to believe on thing throughout the plot, but as revealed toward the end, the truth of the matter is different. However, the setting of Prairie Bend was captivating and realistic. Some characters such as Amos were believable, but others such as Janet and Michael were annoyingly two-dimensional. I found it hard to identify or root for any characters in this novel. However, Nathaniel was written well and the pacing was fast. There are several mysteries revealed with crafty subtlety throughout. I found that I needed to keep reading, especially past page 150. I would give Nathaniel 3 1/2 stars if I could."},{"Title":"Nathaniel","review":"I've read a few Saul books 3 newer ones and now 2 older ones. Black Creek Crossing, In the Dark of the Night and The Devil's Labyrinth were good, but Creature and Nathaniel are great.This is a story of a wife and son who go out to a small town called Prarie Bend. Her husband died in an accident in his father's barn and as she talks to the in-laws she's never met she learns of a life that she never knew her husband had. At the same time her son Micheal is being strangely drawn to the barn on a neighbors property, he hears a voice that may belong to a ghost named Nathaniel. The story turns as you learn the family secrets, hidden deeds, diaries and a hushed mother. Great book, this should have been a movie back when it was written, I loved it."},{"Title":"Nathaniel","review":"characters were great, setting was especially creepy, and the entire book's body was well put together. I've met John Saul once and he seems as mysterious as his books. This is the best book of his to date for me. I haven't read all of his, but quite a few. I also suggest Black Lightning. Not as scary as Nathaniel, but a overall easy story to follow with some scary parts."},{"Title":"Nathaniel","review":"John Saul has done it again I have read just about every book ever written by Saul and I think he is in a league with King!

That is one of my requirements for a &quot;good read&quot; and Nathaniel was exactly that!"},{"Title":"Nathaniel","review":"This book was so good I couldn't put it away"},{"Title":"Nathaniel","review":"I suppose what makes a horror novel successful, above all other criteria, is the degree of suspense felt by the reader; this, of course, varies from person to person. Nathaniel was virtually free of suspense: most of the scenarios that Saul tosses at us are suspense of the cliffhanger variety. That is to say that although there is suspense by virtue of the situation, the reader more or less expects the outcome of each and every situation. This applies to all elements comprising the conclusion as well. It simply isn't a very good book where the story is concerned. But, in order to balance out the review, the writing skill must be mentioned. John Saul can, in short, tell an unenthralling story incredibly well. The details are drawn out to the very last strand of hair, the pace of the story varies incredibly well and, most importantly, Saul keeps a consistent third person tone. Unheard of! If only the story had been better."},{"Title":"Nathaniel","review":"At first glance, Nathaniel appears to be a good scary ghost story. However, it comes down to being a first-class soap opera in which the main character is manipulated by a relative with psychic powers. There doesn't even appear to be a hint of the supernatural about this story as the synopsis would have you believe. The characterization is good and are well-developed, but instead of a flowing storyline, the book gets entrapped in a complex maze of family history. The ending didn't pack the punch of other Saul novels --- only showed the viscious circle of life."},{"Title":"Nathaniel","review":"This was the third John Saul book I have read, and like the others I found the plot very promising but the ending disappointing. I was put off by the fact that Nathaniel was real, and not the ghost of Abby Randolph's son like you were led to believe. Despite the story not living up to my expectations, it was still an enjoyable enough read. However, I would recommend reading a book by King or Koontz before giving John Sauls world of demented children with mind powers a try."},{"Title":"Nathaniel","review":"I am going to be brief as possible.This book is not as good as it seems,or as the cover might make it appear.Some of the reviews are so positive about this mad dumb book.I beg to differ.I must warn you if you haven't already realized it.But,John Saul's greater novels are his newer novels.If you could,please keep away from these old novels,they are terrible.John Saul is no Stephen King,but I can gurarantee you this,his books get better with time..So feel free to read books like\\"The homing\\",\\"Guardian\\",\\"Midnight voices\\" etc...They are worth the read.But if you are just looking for a book to read for reading sakes,then this is your book.Its plot is simple:a boy is called by the spirit name Nathaniel.There are alot of legends about Nathaniel in the story but alot of things are vaguely written and not satisfying at all.The book seems to contradict itself,so if you can,keep away from this book.I think I am the only one writing a negative review for this book.And it is only because I am being honest.I know a good book when I read one.And I don't expect you to make a decision about buying books by reading reviews,so read the book and see if you like it.That's my advice.But in my opinion,I didn't like this book much.I rather play with my miserable grandchildren that read this book again...Enjoy...................................Nigel"},{"Title":"Nathaniel","review":"I RECENTLY FINISHED THIS ONE, AGAIN.

She injects her performance with just the right amounts of fear and curiosity in this story of evil both real and imagined.Just who is Nathaniel? No one in the small town of Prairie Bend seems to know for sure, but the majority fear him. Some say he's part of a folk tale that has been circulating for generations. Others swear that his spirit is very real and will bring havoc upon the innocent in an effort to avenge past deeds.Still grieving after his father's accidental death young Michael Hall arrives in Prairie Bend. It is he who clearly hears the voice of Nathaniel calling to him, urging him to venture where he has been forbidden to go. Michael obeys and therein lies this terrifying tale.Listen and discover the dark secrets that refuse to stay buried.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Nathaniel","review":"My opinion of this novel vacillated somewhat as I read it, but John Saul pretty much won me over in the end. Initially, I worried that the main characters lacked sufficient depth, and this made me question some of their decisions and actions initially. When Mark Hall mysteriously dies back in the hometown he left years earlier, his widow Janet and son Michael journey to the small farming village of Prairie Bend for the funeral. Mark had never spoken about his home town or family to his wife, so Janet's grief is accompanied by a growing sense of amazement as she discovers things about her husband she never knew. Michael's grandfather Amos is a towering figure in the novel, seemingly loving yet stiff and mysterious, while his wife Anna's importance grows as Janet, Michael, and the reader begin to piece together the events of a night twenty years earlier. Although she is a city girl seemingly oblivious to the obvious weirdness of folks in the rural community, Janet decides to live there on the farm she never knew her husband owned. Her son soon begins to hear a voice calling to him in the night, and he braves the danger of a shotgun-toting hermit to sneak into the man's barn. After meeting the mysterious Nathaniel, a boy regarded by the community as a legend dating back a century, Michael begins to have headaches and begins to change. He sees visions of what happened to his father, and-more importantly-what has been happening for years to a significant number of newborn babies in the creepily quaint village.The things Michael sees and the confrontations he has with his grandfather are well told, although his whining can get tiresome in places. The grandfather is a menacing figure in the story, one who is more complex than I initially thought. Everything in the plot doesn't hold together perfectly, but there are no holes large enough to really matter. There is more to the story and the legend of Nathaniel than expected, and it is worth the wait to hear the women of the family finally reveal the stories they have kept bottled up inside of them for many years. I was especially pleased by the ending, which featured a twist I did not foresee. I wouldn't consider this one of Saul's best novels, but it does make for very interesting reading once you get past the somewhat dull opening pages. I didn't find any of the characters particularly likeable, but my ambivalence didn't matter much in the end. While the novel intentionally left some questions unanswered, Saul's painstaking attention to detail and commitment to reveal his secrets only in due time makes sure the patient reader's interest is peaked at the very end."},{"Title":"Nathaniel","review":"Nathaniel is one of the worst horror books I've ever read. The plot is great. The execution is terrible. Michael Hall is an annoying kid, and since he's the main character, the one we are suppose to fear for and identify with that'a flaw. He's supposed to be a preteen but reacts and behaves like a little boy. The womenfolk in this book are all ineffectual victims. There's suo much oddness and death in this town it's ludicrous that the cops and a possee of social workers don't make an appearance. The single most interesting character, including Nathaniel is Amos the grim grandfather who was not above killing to fulfill his vision of how things ought to be and he's one of the bad guys. This book was an all around dissappointment that has put me off Sual's books for good."},{"Title":"Nathaniel","review":"What a spooky book this is! John Saul always comes through when it comes to scaring people to death and his book Nathaniel is no different. I was practically clinching my eyes shut during the barn scenes (I know!

He accomplished that much in a startlingly effective way. But what has he really told us? What actually made Stalinist Russia turn out the way it did? Was the evil in the &quot;animals&quot; that meted out their torture to the rank-and-file, or was it in the IDEAS that spawned these animals? Orwell does not explore these ideas at all, so he never gets to the root of what happened on the farm, or in Soviet Russia, for that matter. He compellingly shows us that tyranny and murder are horrible, but we KNOW that already. He never comes close to the real issue here: what ALLOWED these horrible things to take place, and how do we prevent it from taking place on other &quot;farms&quot;? Orwell, unfortunately, offers his readers no insight there.Orwell even seems to imply that, had Snowball (or Trotsky) been able to wrest power away from Napoleon (or Stalin), that everything would have been better. He fails to recognize that giving ANYONE that kind of power over individuals necessarily ends in disaster. Any ideology that demands the self immolation of the individual for the &quot;good&quot; of the collective leads to the destruction of the individual, and, eventually even to the destruction of the collective (i.e., all individuals). Unfortunately, with Orwell's book as our only guidance, we are left scratching our heads when looking for the answer to &quot;why&quot;, and left helpless against any POTENTIAL dictator who tells us he has the REAL answers.Read this book for its sensory value, then pick up THE OMINOUS PARALLELS by Leonard Peikoff (non-fiction) for a credible response to the questions Orwell leaves, not only unanswered, but unasked."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I have read this book at least 3 times a year since I was in the fourth grade.

This book represents any government system, and not just a fascist or communist regime as some suggest. George Orwell tells the story of a group of animals that hear a message to rise up against the humans. As they rise up, the pigs become the power hungry on the quest to rise up from their oppression. The pigs take advantage of their power, and they also betray their own rules.This book could say that one has to be a true saint for communism to work effectively, but in my opinion it states that if you give anyone power over another group of people, you will discover that we do not differ from the pigs in this novel.This is a true classic that everyone should read and feel inspired by. If you haven't read this, you don't know what you're missing."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Many people think that since the basis of Orwell's classic story is about the failure of the Russian Revolution, it is not really relevant to the post-Communist world, particularly the Western Democracies. NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. Orwell, one of the most perceptive observers of human society who ever lived, was describing political life as it is lived in ALL political systems. It is true that democracies generally do not use force to impose their will on their populations the way dictatorships do, but their manipulation of public opinion, propaganda and \\"well-meaning\\" social engineering are all reflected in Orwell's \\"fairy story\\". For example...\\"Surely you don't want Jones back!\\". Many politicians use this to justify breaking their promises by claiming that \\"true, I did the opposite of what I promised, but you don't want the OTHER guys back in, so you still have to support me!\\"Or, how about \\"Snowball is responsible!\\"? This is a case of a political leader demonizing some \\"enemy of the people\\" and blaming all their problems on this person (or religion, or class, or ideology, etc) and using this to mobilize public opinion to support the leader's policies, even if the people really don't want it, fearing that things would be worse if Snowball is allowed to act freely.This book is a warning of how unscrupulous leaders (or even basically well-meaning ones who can succumb to the temptations of power) can hijack the most idealistic movements and twist them around to benefit themselves alone. All concerned citizens who care about freedom should read this book and learn how to identify the threats to their society."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Hi my name is Max Mordini and I just got done with the book animal farm. Now I will tell you about the spectacular book. The story opens up with the owner of Manor Farm locking up the gates for the night but he was too drunk to lock them properly. Meanwhile the animals were getting prepared for a meeting with the Old Major the most highly respected animal on the farm. He opened the meeting by announcing that he did not have much longer to live and that he wanted to share his dream with them before he was gone. His dream was about all animals living free lives and not be a slave to the man, he says that man is the only creature that consumes without producing, and that its time to join together and take over. He said that he can see England with only animals roaming and human free graceful land all to themselves. He ends his speech by singing Beasts Of England. A couple days later Old Major died, and the farm animals decided to put the plan in action. So now the animals decided to hold meetings almost every night and the plan happened when they did'nt even plan it. It happened when Mr. Jones was so drunk that he didnt feed the animals for two days so Boxer and Clover sneak in the food shed, but they cause too much noise and Mr. jones and his men ran out with whips. Then Boxer and Clover freaked and attacked them and scared them out of the farm. After this they start making the land theirs. They change the name of the farm (Manor Farm) to Animal Farm. Then they listed seven rules on the farm house. They were Whatever goes upon two feet is an enemy, Whatever goes upon four legs or has wings is a freind, no animal shall wear clothing, no animal shall drink alcohol, no animal shall sleep in a bed, no animal shall kill another animal, all animals are created equal. Then the animals learn to farm without man and have the most sucsesful harvest ever while enjoying themselves completely. Soon the news of the rebellian is spread across half the county and now half of the county knows about Animal Farm. This inspires the other farms and they start acting up by throughing their riders off of them and not listening. Now the threat of other animals taking over is big and local farmers and townsmen decide to try an regain control of Mr. Jones's farm, but the animals sucsesfully defend their farm. When winter starts coming around, Snowball has an idea to build a windmill for electricity so the work on the farm will be less strenuous and that they could live more comfortable lives. Napolean disagrees and soon the animals go to two halfs one for Snowball and one for Napolean. They decide to have a debate and after snowball finished Napolean sent the dogs he had been training after Snowball and chased Snowball off the farm. Now Napolean was the farm leader and decided to go through with the windmill plan after all. Through the winter the animals were working like slaves to finish the windmill and still have a good harvest. Then Napolean suggests voluntary work on sundays but even though it was voluntary you would lose half of your food if you didnt work. Then Napolean says that they will begin trading with other farms for supplies. The animals dont want to because in Old Majors speach he says there should be no trade but squeler convinces them that there imagining it. Then the pigs move into the farm house and are sleeping in beds but Squeler convinces them that they are imagining it. Some go and check the rules, but they had been altered and the animals didnt know. Then a disastrous winter comes were they come to near starvation and have to fake that they had food to the neiboring farms to make themselves look better. After animals are executed they go look at the rules and again they are different they say no animal shall kill another animal without cause. Now Napolean is taking even more leadership and is making more rules for them to follow. Now Federek the local farmer decides to attack Animal Farm. The animals win just barely. After they win Napolean drinks alot and changes the rule to no animal shall drink exsessively. Now there food rations are dropping and dropping except for the pigs who are allowed to drink daily wear ribbons on sundays and they are actually gaining wait. Also Boxer is ill and Napolean promises to send him to a hospitol but the truck that takes him is actualy a butchers shop and they never see him again. Now the older animals die off and Squeler assumes leadership. The farm name is changed back to Manor Farm and the animals still work harder than any other farm and get less food than any other farm.That was the summary of the book, but the book wasnt just made up it was actually a metaphor of the Russian Revalution. I thought this was an awesome book though sad at the same time. I think it was a great idea by George Orwell to make the book a metaphor, and still have it be a great story. I would recomend this book to both genders 10-15 years old. Animal Farm ROCKS!"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This book calls out Uncle Sam. It should be a must read for the aspiring politician."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm is a timeless classic, published in 1946. The book was motivated by the author's disillusionment with communism in the Soviet Union. I first read the book in my secondary school days over thirty years ago. I have re-read it several times at various intervals since then and I enjoy reading it all the time. In fact, as I grew older and wiser, my understanding and appreciation of the seriousness of the message behind the story became deeper.The book is a fable about how animals successfully rebelled against human oppression. The animals of Manor farm overthrew the often drunken farmer and established self-determination. All the newly liberated animals were filled with joy and jubilation as well as optimism and they managed to organize themselves very effectively and worked very hard to produce a bumper harvest in their first year of self-rule.The animals came up with seven commandments to ensure that all animals adhere to a high moral and ethical standard in conformity with the egalitarian principles of fraternity, equality and justice for all. These seven commandments were: any creature that walks on two legs is an enemy; whatever moves on four legs or has wings is a friend; animals are forbidden to wear clothes, sleep in a bed, drink alcohol or kill other animals. All animals are equal.Soon afterwards, things started going seriously wrong. Social classes started to emerge with pigs at the top of the social ladder. Then conditions at the farm started to deteriorate until they grew worse off than before the revolution.This is a very entertaining book with a very serious message. The book shows the terrible life under communism that people in the Soviet Union had to endure, with terrible abuses, corrupt ruling elite which did not account to anyone but itself, and that such a set up ultimately ends in failure when people say enough is enough.This book is written in simple English making it easy to read and understand for all readers ranging from school children to adults."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"It really hits hard and is so accurate when compared with how people act today. What people (or the animals on the farm) will believe when the truth is too painful. Truly frightening because this isn't just what happens in a communist society as so many have written in their reviews. It's about facism and religion, why do we believe what we're told so easily."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm is the story of farm animals that reject being ruled by humans and think they can do a better job themselves. They construct their utopian society and make sure the rules are fair to all. Eventually there are compromises and social classes emerge. A force is developed to protect the upper classes from the lower classes. Eventually conditions match what they had replaced and then get even worse.It is so sad that a book of this length and simplicity in story line completely dispels the myths of communism and all those that follow it. This allegory does just that. It shows how for the very briefest of time revolutionary zeal for this cause can give good results. Then reality sets in. Life under communism is awful, it is ripe with abuse, corruption and ultimately doomed to failure. History has proven this over and over again.Communism to me is similar to the people in America that were suckered out west to farm bad soil. They cut the sod and had a great year or two of farming. They were deluded into thinking life would always be like this. After the first 2 seasons nothing would grow and the people's lives were decidedly worse than the lives they had left. Lives they could no longer return to and so they were left suffering year in and year out. That is communism in a nutshell."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm is a great story of a revolution brought about by the animals of a farm.

It makes you think more deeply about the meaning of slavery, and the nature of human beings. Although pigs are the evil characters in this book, it is obvious that they represent dictators (specified in other reviews), and the characters' actions show us how trust can be misleading, and therefore that something of the same magnitude of the Holocaust or Rwandan genocide could happen again.I thought the ending was surprising, but leaves you wondering if the author is using a metaphor. Read it!! Doesn't take too long."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"The story of \\"Animal Farm\\" is set on Manor Farm, where the animals are badly treated by their cruel and incompetent owner Mr Jones. A spirit of revolt grows among the animals, inspired by Major, the old boar, who develops a philosophy known as \\"Animalism\\", which urges animals to revolt against their human masters, to take control of the agricultural system and to run it in their own interests. After Major's death the animals seize their chance to rebel against Jones and succeed in ousting him and taking control of the farm, which they rename Animal Farm. The leading role is taken by the pigs, portrayed as the most intelligent of the animals, and after the success of the revolution a power-struggle breaks out between two of their number, Napoleon and Snowball. With the aid of a trained pack of dogs, Napoleon banishes Snowball from the farm and makes himself a barnyard dictator. From then on, the farm is run in the interests of Napoleon and the pigs. One by one, the principles of Animalism are abandoned and the other animals are treated as badly by the pigs as they were by Jones.Orwell intended the book as a satirical allegory of the Russian Revolution and of the way in which Communism had developed in the Soviet Union under Stalin. Major personifies Marx, Snowball Trotsky, Napoleon Stalin and Jones the Tsar. Other animals on the farm stand not for individual historical figures but for types- for example the simple-minded but strong and good-hearted horse Boxer stands for that section of the Soviet working class which continued to support Communism wholeheartedly even during the Stalinist era. The dogs represent the security apparatus of the Red Army and NKVD, the pig Squealer the propaganda system, the mare Mollie who deserts Animal Farm the Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; community, and so on. The allegory is somewhat simplified- there is, for example, no character precisely equivalent to Lenin- but most of the main developments in Soviet history have their equivalents in the book- the revolution, the Stalin-Trotsky split, the Five Year Plans (symbolised by the building of a windmill), the purges, the Nazi-Soviet Pact and the German invasion of 1941.Orwell wrote the book in the winter of 1943/44, at the height of the Second World War. To criticise Russia in Britain at this point in history took courage, as there was a consensus on both Left and Right of the political spectrum that Stalin was our gallant ally; many on the Left still clung to the illusion that the Soviet Union was a utopian workers' paradise, while the Right regarded criticism of a British ally during wartime as unpatriotic. Orwell himself was politically on the Left, but he had become disillusioned not only with Stalinism but also with what he called \\"violent conspiratorial revolution, led by unconsciously power-hungry people\\"; such a revolution could only lead to the people exchanging one despotism for another.Orwell not only satirised the history of the Soviet Union up to 1943, he also used the book in order to predict the way in which the Soviet system might develop in future. He correctly predicted that the Soviets would defeat Nazi Germany (represented by the vicious farmer Frederick). The book ends with the pigs becoming indistinguishable from the humans who still run the other farms in the district; this can be taken as a prediction that Stalinist Communism would inevitably end by reverting to a capitalist system indistinguishable from that prevailing in the West. When he wrote \\"1984\\" a few years later, however, he seems to have changed this view, because the system over which Big Brother presides is not capitalism but what Orwell called \\"Oligarchical Collectivism\\". Although Orwell continued to believe in democratic Socialism, it seems that by the time \\"1984\\"was published he no longer believed that Socialism and democracy were indivisible, but rather that it was possible to sustain a totalitarian system in which property would nominally be owned collectively but would be controlled in the interests of an elite group of Party leaders.A few years after Orwell's death, \\"Animal Farm\\" was made into a cartoon. Although the film was a success, it was criticised for reversing Orwell's ending by having the other animals rise up against their pig masters. During the Cold War, an implied prediction that Soviet Communism would ultimately be overthrown was obviously a popular message in the West. So who was right, Orwell or the film-makers? In a way, both were. As far as post-Stalin Russia was concerned, the film-makers appear to have got it right. The Soviet Union and its satellites never re-introduced Western-style capitalism, but remained collectivist oligarchies until the system collapsed in the late eighties and early nineties. As for the other Communist superpower, however, Orwell's prediction was spot-on, even though Mao's regime did not exist when \\"Animal Farm\\" was written. In recent years China has transformed itself from a Marxist dictatorship into a capitalist one without a revolution or even a change in the name of the ruling party.Orwell himself described the book as \\"a fairy story\\". It is very brief, a novella rather than a novel, and is told in a deceptively simple style. It can, in fact, be enjoyed by children who know little or nothing about Russian history, but it is clearly more than a children's story about animals. It is, in fact, in my view, the most devastating piece of political satire in twentieth-century English literature. By showing that even the most brutal dictatorships have something ridiculous about their pretensions, Orwell did for Stalin what Charlie Chaplin did for Hitler. Since \\"Animal Farm\\" it has no longer been possible to see Stalin as a heroic revolutionary leader, or even as a grandiose figure of heroic evil, like Milton's Satan. He was simply the biggest pig in the barnyard."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"The book \\"Animal Farm,\\" had its up and its down, meaning half of it was good and the other half was not so good. The book is about animals who aren't treated right by their owners, and they start to rebel, then the animals have to get along and help each other out to survive. It just makes you want to be kinder to animals if you own them or not. Old Major is one of the characters who wants nothing to do with humans, and doesn't want any of the animals to turn into a human. Later on at the end of the story one of the characters you would least expect gets as close to human as any other animal possible."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm definitely deserves a 5/5 rating. It is a wonderfully exciting read that exemplifies totalitarianism in an adult fairy tale. As you get deeper into the book, you discover what can happen when a government corrupts. Not only is this book educational, George Orwell has turned a serious topic into a hilarious comedy, making it an enjoyable read. The story line of Animal Farm is also a strong aspect of the book. You cannot put this riveting page-turner down. For the first time in years, I found myself hooked on a fairy tale about talking farm animals. Animal Farm is a one of a kind book that is an essential read for everyone. Animal Farm is a five star winner on my list and I hope it will make it to yours too."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This story of the struggle between humans, their pigs, and the other animals on the farm is both a general and specific critique of the evils of communism. It is general in the sense that Orwell takes the reader through the cycle of what's good about the promise of social equality, as well as the power issues that make a dictatorship the wrong way to get there. The specifics come from the close parallels between characters in the book and Stalin, Trotsky, the secret police and others.So what makes this book a classic?- Orwell was actually a very solid socialist. His critique is not the type we see today where right wing bashes the left wing on all fronts. He writes as one who understands and appreciates the goals of the left, but hates the methods used to attain them.- The book was well ahead of it's time. Today everyone knows the evils of Stalinism, but even thirty years ago there was still active discussion about the pros and cons of the Russian economic system. Written in 1954, Animal Farm called out an insidious leader and his corrupted system well before the rest of the West was on to it.- The book concisely captures the message. A lazier writer could have written a 400 or even 1000 page treatise on the evils of communism. In 144 pages, Orwell nails it.In summary, it's a genuine classic that deserves it's place on so many recommended and mandatory reading lists."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"An Excellent novel.

It shows in a more humorous way using animals on a farm what happened during this time period. The story begins on Manor Farm which is run by a human. The animals on the farm were fed up with having to listen to a human and do his work. After a speech given by Old Major the oldest pig on the farm the animals build up the courge to revolt. The revolution is successful and they ran the human out. Once this occured the animals were free. This was untill the pigs took control. The pigs whose leader was Napolean (Stalin) and his friend Snowball (Trotsky) make up a set of rules to fallow. In the begining these rules were the ideal rules for a perfect nation evryone was equal. These rules were written on a wall for all animals to read and obey. This is all well and good until the pigs start to stretch the rules and even start to erase them from the wall. There perfect society goes down hill from thier.

It was described by George Orwell as a \\"fairytale,\\" is one of the thinnest books you'll ever read, and is filled with talking animals who want to work together to run a farm. However, this book is actually something more; it is an allegory of the Bolshevik Revolution and the following years in the USSR under the rule of Stalin. To understand this book and get the most out of it, you need to be understand the following things:1) The Bolshevik Revolution and how Stalin corrupted the communist dream. The Bolsheviks seeked communism and Stalin perverted the dream into totalitarianism.2) This is not just a book full of talking animals who don't like humans because they don't get enough food.3) What communism is. Communism is not what happened in the USSR. It is not what is happening in China. It is not what is happening in Cuba. These countries more closely resemble fascist or totalitarianistic states than a communist government. Under communism, ALL people are completely equal in all regards. Because everyone is equal, there is no need for a military or police. Also, everyone voluntarily works for the promotion of the country and society. Thus, in the strictest sense of the word, there actually isn't a government at all because everyone voluntarily works together out of the kindness of their hearts to contribute to the good of their utopian society.That being said, I highly recommend this book to anyone willing to read it with an open mind.

Though its setting is fictional and cast largely made up of talking animals, \\"Animal Farm\\" presents startlingly accurate and icily clear comparisons of the quadrupedal characters to famous Communists and Bolsheviks, and other totalitarians from Karl Marx to Vladimir Lenin to Tsar Nicholas II. Every event in the book springs from the mind of an aging boar on Mr. Jones' Manor Farm known as the Old Major. Representing Karl Marx, Old Major projects the same learned, compassionate air towards the lowly farm animals that Marx held for the peasantry. The boar tells the oppressed masses of The Manor Farm of a revolution he believes to be imminent if not at their collective doorstep. These predictions come true shortly after the death of the Old Major, with the pigs, being the most conceited and among the most intelligent of the animals, naturally fall into leader's roles. After only a year, however, a pig named Napoleon stages a coup d'etat against any pigs that opposed him, after which he set about reversing the improvements made by the system of collective government and gain. All of this is told in the style of a children's fable, but George Orwell slips cynical humor into it throughout the plot, turning what should be a simple book into an emotionally complex narrative. Though some of the characters are based on outdated information, \\"Animal Farm\\" remains an engrossing story, a fairly accurate history (on the whole, one only needs to substitute names of people and places to get an accurate history of the Soviet Union), and a dire warning against totalitarianism."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This is an old one but one everyone needs to read, we get so confortable with our life to the point we do not reconize what is in front of your face...

Old Major, an elderly boar, tells the animals of a dream he's had when the animals will revolt and no longer work for humans. Within a few days he dies and soon thereafter the revolution occurs. Two young pigs, Snowball and Napoleon, take charge and organize the animals and their laws and make the farm more prosperous than when humans were in charge. But when conflicts arise, Napoleon drives Snowball out and before long their laws (7 commandments) are changing and the animals realize the oppressive farmer has been replaced by even more oppressive pigs.I was first assigned to read this in a 9th grade Civics class. This was back in the early 1980s when Soviet communism was a fearsome enemy. But in spite of the fact that this story is an obvious parallel to Stalin and communism as seen in the 1940s, I doubt I fully appreciated it back then - I'm not even sure I actually read it back then. But I've corrected that shortcoming now, and was very impressed with the story.The pig Napoleon is compared with Joseph Stalin and the way he abused his power to gain control over the people, setting himself up in comfort while encouraging the other animals to labor harder. When he is faced with opposition he reacts violently by using the puppies he's been quietly training, a close corollary to the secret police employed to silence dissent, particularly during the bloody purges. The pigs excuse the privileges they allocate to themselves by explaining to the animals that their \\"brain work\\" is the hardest of all, and therefore they require the cream and apples (luxuries) to be mixed into the mash they eat, even while the others are asked to sacrifice. Squealer becomes the minister of propaganda, and he trains the stupid sheep to bleat \\"four legs good, two legs bad\\" to drown out any complaining that arises, and frequently announces fabricated production numbers to deceive the animals into believing their lives are better than before.But there's also a strong parallel with labor movements in general from the late 1800s and early 1900s, and the way promises were made to manipulate the working classes into supporting violence and revolt. I think it's also entirely appropriate that it ends without a happy resolution, given that communism didn't end in the USSR for another 40+ years and that socialism is still being advocated in many circles today.Although Orwell was a socialist himself, the book exposes the ease with which propaganda (and threats and actual violence) can control the opinion of otherwise enlightened people in a totalitarian state. I thought it was interesting the way the account of the \\"Battle of the Windmill\\" was spun by Squealer to sound like a great victory for the animals - an allusion to driving the Germans out of Russia despite an enormous cost in lives. Also, Napoleon awards himself a ribbon for his own bravery during the battle (his tail was nicked, possibly by buckshot) although no such recognition is given to the horse Boxer who was seriously wounded. In the end, even the promises of a comfortable retirement aren't honored, as Boxer is sold to the \\"knackers\\" and the pasture previously set aside for animals in their old age is plowed for barley to make alcohol for the pigs (the law at this point has been changed from \\"no animal shall drink alcohol\\" to \\"no animal shall drink alcohol to excess\\").I listened to the audio book narrated by Ralph Cosham, and I'm glad that I finally made the time to listen to this interesting and important story. I'm not sure that it can fully be appreciated by high-schoolers, but hopefully teachers will make the effort to explain the background behind the book and the parallels with Soviet communism."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"If you love this book, I would consider buying the unoffical soundtrack to the book. Pink Floyd Animals. Roger Waters based his lyrics of the album on this book and was inspired by the basis of Orwell's writings. Pigs (Three Different Ones) was based on the pigs in the books.

Orwell's talent amazes me in this classic about (on the surface) animals taking over the farm they live on. When reading this book though, it becomes very clear that it is actually based upon the real events of the Russian Revolution, each animal representing a special person in history or a certain genre of people. I would recommend this book to anyone who hasn't already read it. It's a shame that Orwell had to die so young; I bet that he had a lot more classics to come."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"For those without much time to spare might I suggest Animal Farm, a vicious little satire on the pros and cons of government and society. As always Orwell has a lascerating wit and a smooth narrative pacing that makes everything important and nothing dull. Despite the short length there is a great deal of information imparted in glowing, shivering language, simple and yet dignified; chatty and yet sometimes overwhelmingly lofty. And yet the pace of the story will have you racing through it like a 600 page crime novel where everything just keeps getting uglier. Read it in a day, over a weekend, during quiet time on a several day beach vacation.The metaphors aside, this book relates a profound understanding of the very human motives that make community government always aimed toward personal corruption."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This book gives you an excitment. Together you and the animals can experiance a story filled with suspense, thrill and interest.Some important animals stand out from the other animals.Others just sit around in the story. Although the last two pages are boring, I still reccomend it. The ending will give you feelings of some of the bad things that are happening in our lives. The utopian society the animals try to create turns into monstorous problems. A nine fits this book for the suspense with interest and excitement.

This book looked like an easy way to save time on a book report I had been assigned. It was short, comical, and full of illustrations. Heck, this report might not be so bad after all. Animal Farm took two days to read and several more to ponder the significance of it.I was already aware that Animal Farm was a polotical satire, and I could not help but notice how closely the plot-line resembled th state of Russia while under Stalin's rule. After doing an ample amount of research I discovered that Animal Farm was anti-Stalinist propaganda. The way Orwell portrays how manipulative a person (or a group of people for that matter) can be when kept politically blind is just awesome. Orwell displays keen observation on how a corrupt government sucks all the energy and life of a country. Sure, sure it all starts out looking like every decision made by authority is just and will benifit the people, but, as proven time and time again, there will always be someone at the top whose ambitions become... to self-serving. It's an exellent book, and a person's age would not affect their comprehension of it in a negative way. If I had read Animal Farm in the second grade, it still would have made sense to me. Animals take over a farm, live a happy life, become steeped in hardship, and are eventually betrayed by the the one who they thought would protect them. That is essentially what Animal Farm is about. Definitely a good read, open to interpretation. Read it for the story, the deeper message, the humor, or for whatever reason. Animal Farm will not fail to amuse."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"The book was way ahead of it's time, it was written around the second World War. At the beginning a pig named Old Major gives the rest of the animals on the farm the idea to revolt against the humans running the farm. Old Major soon dies in an accident, but his memory doesn't, and the animals conduct the revolt. It's succesful! The pigs immediately are recognized as the leaders of the farm. There are two major pigs that never agree on anything, their names are Snowball and Napoleon. One day the two pigs are in a heated argument over whether or not to build a windmill. Napoleon sees that the animals will vote for Snowball's idea to build it, so Napoleon chases him off the farm. It then becomes a communistic enviroment where everyone slaves away in the fields all day and barely get enough rations to live, except for the pigs. By the end of the book Snowball is used as a scapegoat for every little thing piece of bad fortune. By the end of the book the other animals can't tell the difference between the humans and the Pigs. This book is very interesting and very good. I would definitely reccomend it. One great thing about the book is that the characters are all animals. Napoleon is very interesting, because even though he's a pig he teaches himself how to read, write, and trains himself in architecture and battle tactics. If you want to read a book that will leave you saying, &quot;Whoa,&quot; or if you just want to read a great book Animal Farm is for you."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"George Orwell's classic satire of Stalin's Communistic state of the old USSR still can teach us a lesson.Orwell uses a farm and its animals in a well thought out parody substituting animals for the main characters involved in the Russian Revolution unto the establishment of a Communistic State.For example the prize Middle White boar named the Old Major is suppose to represent the father of Communism Karl Marx. The Berkshire boar named Napoleon represents the long time Russian Dictator Joseph Stalin.Orwell uses these characters to show the development of a treacherous and diabolical form of government. In his quick and concise prose, Orwell shows the evolution of political brainwashing to develop a totalitarian form of government.The Author presents a rather less than desirable picture of a government who at this time was indeed a major Ally of both Great Britain and the United States.Indeed when this book was published in Great Britain in 1945 and the USA in 1946 it was censored by many governmental and non governmental organizations. This book indeed did touch the very essence of the political turmoil in the beginning years of the Cold War. It represents a brazen look at a brutal form of government.I realize that this form of Communism is extinct. But please take heed, we all can learn from Orwell's satirical dissertation of a dysfunctional farm.A Classic read!

I have yet to discover one flaw in his sizeable collection of tales and if you're thinking that &quot;Animal Farm&quot; might happen to be the chink in his armor, then you're wrong. It's a wonderfully well told &quot;little&quot; story(little in that's it's less than 150 pages)about the happenings of an english country farm and the animal inhabitants who find it their duty to rebel against the sometimes cruel owner and prove themselves every bit mankind's intellectual equal. &quot;Boxer&quot; demonstrates strength in a submissive yet likable way, &quot;Moses&quot; shows a cowardice wisdom, &quot;Snowball&quot; is the farm citizen's true hope for a fair democracy, and &quot;Napoleon&quot; destroys it all. You won't be able to help getting drawn up into the lives of these and the many other good hearted characters, but the book isn't meant to be a feel good study on the nature of nature. It's an example, a sad and realistic view of collective reasoning and the corrupt leaders that we sometimes follow, even to our easily predicted demise. The pigs of Animal Farm(the name given to the farm after the human inhabitants are forced out)are a cruel and manipulative lot who, led by the Big Brother type propaganda of the character Napoleon, seek to enslave the citizens of Animal Farm much like the owners before them. They fabricate events and change decrees too their own benefit and nary a whimper is heard from the Animal Farm populace who all the while swallow Napoleon's meaningless speak with awe struck dumbness. &quot;Animal Farm&quot; as with many of Orwell's stories is cautionary(a word I've used in many a review). He's warning us against accepting everything we see and hear and read at face value. As you follow the story you'll begin to sympathize, and then maybe empathize, with the poor fortune of those lovable souls who only wish to live good and productive lives but lose even that at the hands of a dictator smart and cunning enough to convince them that his will is superior and thus must have priority. If you have the time, pick this book up. It's a quick and easy read that will keep you thinking."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I finished reading Animal Farm with one critique: there was no emotion, which is unlike George Orwell. BUT, upon further dissection of the book, I understand why Orwell wrote it so. It was apart of his central theme. Other than that, the book was great. Great story and lesson that should be taught worldwide. It is a classic that truly earns this title."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"When in high school the head of English lit. deemed it a wiser or safer choice to go with 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' and Laurie Lee's 'Cider With Rosie' than Orwell's classic. What a regrettable decision that was; because it was not until 20 years after graduation that I finally got to read this seminal work. A work that has such profound possibilities to shape the minds of readers both young and old alike that I wonder if we shouldn't be prescribing books like that in our schools instead of Shakespeare? To call a work 'seminal' or to say that it is worthy of actually making a 'prescribed reading' list is no mean feat and there are really comparatively few books worthy of such adoration; this though is surely one of them. Whether you agree with the books political or moral standpoint or not is an irrelevancy that should have no bearing on your desire to read or prescribe this book.In being desirous of understanding this text, it is firstly important to understand just what we are presented with here, for this book is NOT an overtly political or subversive anti-communist thesis (despite what Orwell may have originally intended). What it is in fact, is a precise, poignant, cutting and very astute examination of human nature; the motives, desires and inner reflections of humanity and the internal struggles we all face. What I found most impressive about this work was that as a critique of humanity and the complexities of hierarchical societies it is an examination that resounds as strongly now as it did in 1946. Especially in the wake of 11/9 and the measures that have been introduced to 'protect' and 'guard' the people by various governments around the globe, not to mentions how far from the truth we have been lead by the 'news' media. When one considers the impact the media had in back in the '70s, in bringing the terror of Vietnam home to the news-stands and the enormous social and political repercussions that spread outwards from that; who would have thought that a mere quarter of a century later the public would have gradually succumb to the acceptance of what before was seemingly unacceptable... sound familiar?

His results at Eton weren't very remarkable - hence he didn't persue University, instead headed off to Burma for 5yrs working with the Imperial Indian Police. During his time there he became very cynical about the empire, and the role required of it's expats in keeping the flag flying - particularly the attitude of the Brits to the natives.On his return he wrote a number of pieces which had the empire under direct attack. He began to embrace the ideals of socialism - as a result he was sent on assignment to report on the life of the miners living up north in Wigan: their horrendous working conditions and similarly poor housing.Orwell was also known to go off \\"tramping\\" for a few days at a time in London and in Paris, where he would rough it with the \\"bums\\". His experiences moved him such that when the Spanish Civil war broke out he had no hesitation in volunteering to go off and fight with the socialists against the Fascist Franco.The war in Spain was not as clear cut as he had originally believed - rather than the socialists/communists fighting under one flag against Franco and his supporters Hitler and Mussolini - instead the socialists were split into various factions and as such were often fighting amongst themselves. Indeed, the group that Orwell had originally joined - POUM (the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification) - became the subject of scorn and derision after Stalinist Russia had condemned them as being Fascists. This rumour intensified to the point that they became targets of the guns of the other socialist movements, causing them to seal themselves up in their building. Finally, Orwell, his wife, and others decided to flee Spain as things were getting too hot - they were under surveillence etc. They managed to escape Spain, with it seems only hours to spare as papers were being drawn for their arrests for treachery against the socialist movement.It would appear that it was his experiences in Spain and in particular the actions of Stalinist Russia that form the backbone to the book Animal Farm. The Russian Revolution, in it's initial form, was respected by Orwell - however once Communism, and in particular Stalinism came to the fore then the cause was lost. As Orwell states - the best thing the revolutionaries can do is get rid of their leaders once the rebellion is complete - otherwise the leaders get power hungry, become self serving and before you know it the conditions are similar to the pre-revolution days. In Orwells eyes Stalin was as Fascist as Hitler, Mussolini and Franco. So with the above in mind, without further ado, \\"Animal Farm\\". Excellent."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm is a novella which will instantly and perpetually go down in history as one of the classics of fiction, allegory, and satire. Written at a time when Josef Stalin ruled effectively half the world with an iron fist, this book was written by the socialist George Orwell as a picket sign to criticize the Soviet Union for its human rights abuses and its crimes. It is evident that the characters in the book are modeled on those from the Soviet Union and Orwell makes his point masterly. Never have I seen such a book that can take a farm (something that is completely irrelevant to politics) and compare it to a communist dictatorship; but somehow, somehow, Orwell, with all his genius, managed to do just that. A rebel government promises to give its people (or in this case, animals) freedom, and then they are corrupted by the reigns of power. This book has many lessons to learn, almost as many as history itself has to offer.Orwell's socialist views do not correspond with my social conservative politics, but when I see a book that accomplishes its intended goal with such ease, I must commend it and its creator. If only Orwell had lived long enough to possibly create a sequel."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Personal Interest Assessment: 10Response:This excellent book is about the concepts of revolution, lies, and totalitarianism. In Manor Farm, all of the animals decide that they had enough of human rule and declared a rebellion against the Jones', who were their masters. After driving them off, they were amazed and renamed the farm to Animal Farm. At first, the animals enjoyed independence and decided to start a constitution with a simple message: All Animals are Created Equal. The three deceitful and cunning pigs, Napoleon, Snowball, and Squealer, wasted no time to mislead the other animals. While the animals struggled as Snowball fled, the pigs take advantage of this and start taking advantage of the other animals. Eventually, the others realize the errors of the commandments. One example is that they cannot sleep in beds. They realized it was that they could not sleep on beds with sheets (sheets was a human invention). Another was that they thought an animal shall not kill another animal; they found out that it was really an animal shall not kill another animal without cause. As many other double standards were being discovered, they all lead to the greatest error of them all. All Animals are Created Equal... But Some Animals are More Equal Than Others. By then, it was too late when the pigs reestablished totalitarian rule and renamed the farm back to Manor Farm.This amazing book is an unforgettable one as it moved and interested me a lot. The book talked with vivid detail and it shows the hypocrisy of Communism/Totalitarianism. The book was also finished within days, because it was for once, an extremely addicting book. The message the book says is clear, jaw-dropping and well done. Perhaps the most shocking parts of the book was how the pigs lied about the healthcare for Boxer. Boxer, the hard-working horse, was instead sent to a glue factory, where he will die. To conclude, this book is by far, one of the best I read thus far.P.S.

The book Animal Farm by George Orwell makes this old saying true. Beyond the old tattered pages lies a timeless classic. This story is about the life on a farm. The animals and the farm duties are neglected and the animals are fed up with Farmer Jones. Lead by a prize pig Major, the animals decide to revolt. The animals take over the farm and run the farm for themselves. When doing this they change the name to Animal Farm and now they are completely in charge. Later in the story some of the animals break the rules and make their own rules for life on the farm. This only leads to problems with the operation of the farm. The story of Animal Farm is told in a simple straightforward style. The sentences are often short and simple. &quot;Old Major cleared his throat and began to sing.&quot; This story is a fictitious story that is a fable. This means that is usually has a moral and animals act like humans. Orwell did a great job of making these animals very much like humans. In the story for example the dogs still bite and growl, yet the still support Napoleon's drive for political power. Another example is how the pigs eat mash and they also drink whiskey and walk on two legs by the end of the story. I feel the moral of the story was revealed in the last lines of the story. &quot;Twelve voices were shouting in anger, and they were all alike. No question, now, what had happened to the faces of the pigs. The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.&quot; I hope I didn't ruin the ending of the story for you. This story also has great description that kept me interested. &quot;With the ring of light from his lantern dancing from side to side, he lurched across the yard, kicked off his boots at the back door, drew himself a last glass of beer from the barrel in the scullery, and made his way up to bed, where Mrs. Jones was already snoring.&quot; I felt that this book was very easy to read; yet the meaning behind it took more time to grasp. It is only 118 pages and can be finished on a rainy afternoon. The story's ending summed up the plot of the story very well. This happened when the last commandment was written &quot;But some animals are more equal than others.&quot; This had been proven true when the pigs rebelled from all of the other farm commandments. I liked this book a lot because it seemed to be very realistic. Even though these were animals, their actions were almost just like humans. This story might not be for everyone because of the deep messanges portrayed at the end of the story. Yet I would recommend this book to most anyone because it makes you see that there isn't a perfect society anywhere. There will always be someone that breaks the rules and tries to be better than everyone else."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Orwell's _Animal Farm_ is brilliant. Its genius works on several levels: it is easy (and dare I say it? fun) to read. It is an accurate commentary on power and is a biting criticism of post-revolutionary Russia.After the animals take over a farm, rules are established to create an egalitarian society. Gradually, the rules are amended, dissent is estinguished, and ultimately, the pigs rule as brutally and ruthlessly as the farmer.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"If you know zilch about the history of the late, unlamented USSR, skip this book, you're not going to get it. The more you know, the more you're bound to admire one of the 20th century's great satires---maybe its greatest. Capitalism, Communism, Lenin, the October Revolution, the Interventions, Stalin, Trotsky, Beria, the KGB, Hitler and the Fascist invasion---all these and more are in there. Orwell savagely attacks the Communist system as it turned out in fact in the USSR, not as it was originally envisioned. Along the way, the various foibles of human nature and fatal tendencies of ruling classes everywhere are held up to his pitiless examination. I will not give a runthrough of the story, but the idea is that animals, representing the working class, overthrow people, representing capitalists, and establish a workers' state---called Animal Farm. Overall, Orwell leads to the question: haven't we gone beyond our abilities to control technology and scientific knowledge ? Our political skills have not kept pace.Since Orwell completed his novel in 1945, the last section of the book, about what would happen to the Soviet Union under Communist plutocrats, was necessarily speculation for him (not for us). In some ways, ANIMAL FARM turned out to be uncannily correct, but in others, pass&eacute;, because we know what happened thanks to our 57 years' hindsight. Orwell did not predict the rise of the satellite states in Eastern Europe and elsewhere, nor did he see that the building of heavy industry would be co-opted by the armaments race, bankrupting Animal Farm and ultimately bringing it down without a war. But the pigs eventually did turn into humans (i.e. workers became capitalists). Because Communism has crumbled, especially in the former USSR, people may feel ANIMAL FARM is no longer relevant. That would be wrong. We can't justly distribute resources or maintain the planet's environment. Think of the billions of impoverished people, massive pollution, the unending ecological destruction and the menace of genetically engineered everything. Now, more than ever, it seems that our world is an Animal Farm. When we protest, it is made perfectly clear to us---all animals are equal, but some are more equal than others. The Pigs, Dogs, and Sheep are always with us. If you don't understand what I'm talking about, read this book."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I recently read Animal Farm, having missed it my entire life, as a selection in my local book club. I breezed through it on a Sunday morning; the text, written as a parable, was, while perhaps not literary, easy, and can be enjoyed by adults as well as young adults, and perhaps, because of the story, should be required reading in our public schools.Orwell uses the animals on a farm in England to describe the workings of communism, with Stalin, Lenin and Trotsky all assuming roles, while Czar Nicholas II is depicted as the farmer, Jones, whom, at the outset, is overthrown by the rebellious animals.A fascinating read, Animal Farm is timeless and could've been written in Caesar's time, depicting his rule of ancient Rome, or about any despotic ruler throughout history. Indeed, that its focus is communism seems its only shortcoming, as its message is clear: absolute power corrupts absolutely. The current administration in Washington practices many of the same tactics depicted in Animal Farm - the same slight of hand speeches, the subtle removal of human rights and freedom as \\"good for the populace,\\" the outright lies and attempts to write history by withholding, or manipulating, the truth.I'm certain that Animal Farm accurately depicts rule under a communist regime, but the larger message is this: No government is benign, and no government should be trusted, including our own.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Recently, I read George Orwell's famous novel, Animal Farm. I was amazed at how much I liked reading it. Orwell has an uncanny ability to present a seemingly simple, entertaining story, and embed in it with deep philosophical and political issues. I have read two other works by Orwell, Shooting an Elephant and 1984, both of which possess the same type of political allegory that is demonstrated in Animal Farm. The use of allegory in Orwell's story about an animal uprising in a typical British farm serves to enlighten the reader about common political issues in society. When Animal Farm was first sold, some shop owners mistakenly place the novel in the children's section due to the simplicity and \\"fictional\\" nature of the book. In actuality, the novel was written as a political allegory concerning old Communist Russia.Although the novel parallels perfectly with the Soviet Union's history, many social and political commonalities can be seen between the pigs and dogs and the governments of many modern countries. In the beginning of the story, all of the animals take over the farm and establish a society in which all of the animals are essentially equal. Each animal pledges to do equal amounts of work and do his/her part in creating a better life for themselves. Much like the theories of Communism, the plan seems perfect, but as always, there are animals that strive to manipulate the system and gain more power than the other animals. In the initial stages of the creation of the new farm, the animals write the rules which they pledge to follow on a wall. As time progresses and the pigs want to gain power, they alter the rules slightly so that they will coincide with what the pigs desire. For example, the initial fifth commandment of the animals read \\"No animal shall drink alcohol,\\" but after the pigs taste alcohol and decide that they like it, they alter the text so that it reads \\"No animal shall drink alcohol to excess.\\" The other animals feel like something is different about the rules but the pigs convince them that the rule has always been written that way. Much like in 1984, the leaders (pigs) brainwash the other animals into forgetting about the true history so that it will not contradict what they say during the present. This element of Animal Farm instills a sense of doubt in the reader that maybe the history that has been taught to him during his entire lifetime is simply a biased or cleverly fabricated story created by the corrupt leaders of the past.The most alarming twist of Orwell's novel is when the pigs decided to change the fundamental teachings of Major that four legs are bad, and two legs are good to the exact opposite. Although pigs walking on their hind legs might seem humorous on the surface, it is a quite disturbing example of how the beliefs of someone can be completely altered by corrupt people who desire power and strive to achieve their own personal goals rather than the goals of the community.The fundamental purpose of Orwell's writings is to present politically and socially important issues disguised in well written stories to raise questions about our society and government. Raising such questions is sometimes harder to do when speaking about those issues directly. The use of literature to speak about important issues is very effective in that the reader can let his guard down while reading a work and see for himself the important issues presented in the work without having other people directly saying the same thing. In presenting the issues in symbolic or metaphorical ways, the impact will be greater and the viewpoints will be more highly understood."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I can hardly improve on the other reviews posted here, but I wanted to add an important note: this wonderful classic is one of the few books out there that can be appreciated by adults and children alike. My ten-year-old and my nine-year-old both devoured this book. Then I had the pleasure of explaining the allegory to them, and they loved it even more! An absolute classic you'll read more than once."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"George Orwell's Animal Farm is the story of Communism and Stalin put into an easy-to-understand fairy tale form. The book starts out with the hope of a rebellion, animals against humans. Major, the famous White Boar of the farm, tells of his observations over his lifetime. He tells how humans expect everything and give nothing, and how one day all the animals must rebel and become their own masters. Major also tells of a song, Beasts of England that has come to him via a dream. Beasts of England soon becomes an anthem for a new kind of Government, Animalism.With the quick overthrow of Mr. Jones, the farm is completely taken over by it's animals. The sign announcing \\"Manor Farm\\" is painted over with \\"Animal Farm\\".And so the story goes, winding its way through the story of Stalin's reign. Things start out near perfect. Group debates are held weekly, there is a surplus in food, everyone is equal, and most importantly: everyone is their own master.Everything stays great until a dispute between the two smartest animals on the farm, Napoleon and Snowball, both pigs, begins. Snowball would like to build a Windmill, saying that once it was complete it would save much work. Napoleon's opinion differs. He thinks that a windmill is too much work for not enough payback.In the final windmill debate, Napoleon says almost nothing, while Snow goes into a long and convincing speech about how they should build the windmill. All of a sudden dogs Napoleon has trained are unleashed and chase Snowball off the farm.Slowly, under the new leader Napoleon, Animal Farm becomes a full-fledged communist community. It starts out with simple things, like Napoleon getting apples and the others not. Then it turns more serious.Napoleon insists that all along he was for the Windmill, not against it and that Snowball was a cheating liar whose only goal was to deceive the animals. Everything becomes the former hero Snowball's fault. When the windmill is broken during a storm, it's Snowball sabotaging it.When Money is lost or there's a loss of food, Snowball must have been behind it.The pigs eventually break every one of the original Seven Commandments. Every time they do, they get a pig to paint a new clause onto the commandment they have broken. The unfortunately stupid animals can't understand what the pigs are doing. Every time one protests, they are forced back down by lies from the leaders and their minions.Confusing facts about how really the animals are living better lives and they can't tell are released. More and more lies are told until the animals can't even remember the \\"good old days\\".Finally the pigs step over the line and change the commandment, \\"all animals are equal\\" to \\"all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\\"Soon it is impossible to tell the human farmers from the pigs. The transformation is complete.This book is an amazing look into the horrors of Communism. It shows both how great and awful it can be, all it takes is a fabulous or fabulously awful leader to change the way.I recommend this book to EVERYONE. It's a must-read to fully understand what Stalin's reign must have been like. Five stars are fully deserved and awarded to this amazing author, George Orwell."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I picked up this book with mild interest because it was recommened to me by my father. I told him how much I liked Lord of the Flies, especially the sybolism. He told me to read this book and he doesn't know how right he was. Animal Farm starts with an animal uprising on an England farm. The animals are led by the pigs into a short time of hard work and equality. They have a set of seven commandments (banning human behavior) and the sheep bleet, \\"Two legs good, four legs bad!\\" to symbolize their rebellion against humanity. But soon, the head pig, Napoleon, begins abusing his power. He has some of their commandments changed so that he can get away with whatever he wants. Some examples are when he allows the pigs to consume alcohol and when he allows the pigs to sleep on human beds. The final straw is that the pigs start walking on two legs and the sheep bleet \\"Two legs good, four legs BETTER!\\" and they begin acting like humans and even trade with other farmers. Eventually become so much like humans that the other animals cannot tell the difference.On the surface, this would be a very boring book. But it is much more than meets the eye. This is really a metaphor for government. Stalinistic Russia is usually cited, but it works for and dictatorship and many other types of government. The pigs represent the leaders of the govenment who abuse their power to get whatever they want and eventually betary their people for their own personal gain. The sheep represent the media that broadcast only what the leaders what the public to hear, spreading lies in favor of the pigs. And the animals of the farm are the public, believing it all."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"A generation ago, the sight of the cover of George Orwell's \\"Animal Farm\\" was common in junior high school hallways, along with \\"Lord Of The Flies,\\" \\"A Separate Peace,\\" and \\"Catcher In The Rye.\\" Re-reading the book today reminds me of why Orwell is considered so brilliant and beyond-his-time in a Mark Twain/Jonathan Swift way. But for me at least, this remains the least fun of all those junior high masterpieces.The animals at Manor Farm have had enough of Mr. Jones' despotic rule. Inspired by the deathbed speech of the prize pig Major, they rebel and kick the farmer and his wife out, rename their home \\"Animal Farm,\\" and declare they will henceforth not have any interaction with humans, creating an animal utopia that will hopefully inspire other farm animals in England, Ireland, and points beyond.\\"Animal Farm\\" is a short book, told as an allegorical fable, and Orwell's tone in telling his tale seems exactly right, depicting without emotion the gradual corruption of this supposed paradise. The novel presents clear parallels to the then-existing situation in the U.S.S.R. and contains a dead-on attack on its despotic leader, Josef Stalin, here presented as an opportunistic pig named Napoleon who bends the animal's classless utopia to his own self-aggrandizing ends.The book holds up today, long after the toppling of Soviet communism, because it's an elastic comment on how those hungry for power can manipulate altruistic ideals with the help of shameless propaganda and a population that is either fooled into believing its leaders, or too cowed to do much more than mutter about them.Most of the fun I get from \\"Animal Farm\\" is in the form of trying to guess what specific characters and events are meant to represent. Major seems to be based on Karl Marx, while Snowball, the pig who leads the Revolution before being betrayed and exiled by Napoleon, seems to combine the early Soviet revolutionaries Lenin and Trotsky. You can quibble with some of Orwell's apparent parallels, like the strained interaction between Napoleon and the neighboring farms, meant to suggest Hitler's Germany and Chamberlain's England. Stalin, for all his faults, didn't completely overturn the Soviet ideals he inherited.But he does get an awful lot right. It's noteworthy that the corruption of the Revolution begins even before Snowball's ouster, when we learn about the fate of the milk and the pigs' appropriation of the apples for themselves, a rare point of agreement between Napoleon and Snowball. While Stalin is the focus of Orwell's scorn, clearly he sensed something was rotten in the situation up front, before the purges and show trials.Except for the part when the pigs discover booze, \\"Animal Farm\\" lacks humor. More problematically, the characters lack sympathetic dimension, even the noble horse Boxer. Orwell wants us to get the point Boxer represents the dim-witted common man, bending himself to Napoleon's will, but since he has little to say except \\"I will work harder\\" and \\"Napoleon is always right,\\" it's hard to care about his sad fate, or that of the others.Orwell was a brilliant man, but a depressing one, and that holds true here. Orwell later called \\"Animal Farm\\" his attempt \\"to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole,\\" but my one caveat with this otherwise terrific book is that the political accomplishment clearly outweighs the artistic."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Not many novellas - this one is just 100 pages - attain such well-deserved fame. Orwell used this as an early effort to combine political awareness with the art of writing. In many ways, and maybe not the ones he wanted, he succeeded.He wrote this in that scary time when WWII had just ended, and WWIII was starting to look likely. He never drew the animal parable in fine detail, but used it as a broad brush to pain what he saw of the Soviet Union arising as a world power. Pigs took control of the Animal Farm, and became more piggish at every step. Sheep emerged as a faceless flock, bleating slogans as if repetition meant more than understanding. Dogs, the farm's only carnivores, stood for the secret police and public goon squads. The strong, stolid horses came away with my sympathy, though. To my mind, the horse Boxer created the defining moment in the ideal's fall. He certainly wasn't the first to suffer a violation of the sixth commandment, \\"No animal shall kill any other animal.\\" Quiet, strong Boxer was the first to 'disappear.' After a lifetime of service, he was quietly retired to the glue factory, and for a fair (if un-named) price. That covert, scheming callousness sank as low as the rulers ever went. Every perversion of trust after that one differed in kind, but not depth.These days, 'Animal Farm' is usually considered high school fare. It's brief, and a bit of a blunt instrument. It's still good as a reminder of its time, when the Red Menace was rising and solidifying its control over that bizarre regime, now long gone. Or so we hope.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm by George Orwell is thought-provoking and an interesting read. By giving a well-known topic of becoming your own worst enemy to animals at the Manor Farm, Orwell has put a new light on the subject. Horses, goats, cows, ducks, geese, chickens, dogs, and the pigs- all of which are a metaphor for the different types of people and their antics during such an uprising as the animals against their \\"beloved\\" farmer. Orwell's classic should be a reminder to all of how easily something that may look wonderful at first, but turn horribly wrong within the progress of time.Old Major, an old pig on the Manor Farm, has given a meeting for all farm animals to tell them something- something he believes to be of upmost importance. He tells all of them what animals had dreamed before their time- a free animal state. A few days later, Old Major dies, but his last will and a song titled \\"Beasts of England\\" push these common farm animals to the brink of uprising over their master, and from what they hope, humans. However, with most of these animals not being a ten on the intelligence scale, the pigs take advantage of them to get what they want... slowly, but surely. These pigs have a plan... and a plan that will decide the fate of the newly named \\"Animal Farm\\".Plenty of humor is mixed in with the one teaching that surrounds the premise of the book, with the goats saying, \\"Four legs good, two legs bad!\\" at random moments (which happens to be very good for the pigs' well-being)and other side-items such as the fruit of work and toil, and plenty of danger and deception. Animal Farm is to remain a classic for years to come; and for many years after that."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This superb and concise classic should be read by every person that cherishes freedom or fears abuses of government power. The novel centers on a group of animals that take over their farm and establish their own government. One of their commandments states that, \\"All Animals Are Equal.\\" This lofty slogan soon changes as the pigs, who are in the position of great influence, become tempted by privilege and power. Soon the pigs run roughshod over the other species, and twist their commandments to justify violence against the other animals, who find themselves violated and betrayed. The analogies to the 1917 Communist Revolution in Russia are unmistakable - workers foolishly believed Lenin's slogan (\\"Peace, Bread, Land\\") only to find themselves betrayed by a brutal dictatorship that crushed freedom with secret police killings, forced collectives, and Stalinist gulags.Author George Orwell (1903-1950) understood treachery, power, violence and greed. Sadly, this readable story contains a remarkable ring of truth."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"What is amazing as I read through this book was not so much how well it related to the events of the past, but how perfectly it defines our current condition today. The ability of an elite vanguard/oligarchy to covertly impose it's will and subjugate an entire population utilizing atrocity, propaganda, and a rampant, unrelenting nationalism hand-in-hand-- under the false pretext that all such sacrifices truly are necessary to protect and serve the whole from further suffering, and that any who would oppose such a view should be considerd immoral, treasonous or much worse.In the edition I have, the introduction begins by explaining how Orwell turned out to be basically wrong in his assumption of how things would turn out, but I could not disagree more. The buffer between what is truly happening and what we are being told has never been greater, and too many of us are only too willing to blindly accept this under the justification that at least things are better now than they used to be, or could be-- or are they?Often times today I find myself reminded of the qualities of a population described in Adorno's \\"Authoritarian Personality.\\" How so many could possibly allow and even be complicit in atrocities taking place both by and among them.In my mind this book could not have much more relevance than it does now. I also never read this in school, but it provides much more insight and meaning now than it would have ever afforded me as a child. The literary prose and profound symbolism found within so few pages is truly a reflection of a very talented and inspired author."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I thought Animal Farm was by far one of the best books i ever read.Instead of living the rest of their lives in slavery the animals stoodtogether in a daring rebellion against mankind.

Animalism, Orwell's take on Communism, is an illusion used by the pigs as a means of satisfying their lust for power. At the beginning of the book, Mr. Jones, the master of the farm, is irresponsible toward his animals, so old Major, a white boar, informs the other animals of the need to form a rebellion against Mr. Jones and the human race. The other animals embrace the idea of a revolution and develop a scheme to overthrow Mr. Jones. After the revolution is complete, the animals feel an immediate freedom, a set of commandments is developed for the new \\"Animal Farm,\\" and they all begin working together for a common good. However, it does not take long for the new society to begin to corrupt. The satisfaction of removing Mr. Jones from the farm prevents the animals from noticing the politics still going on within the farm. The animals are convinced by those in power that their memory of the original utopia and commandments are false. So long as the animals cannot remember the past, because it is being continually altered, they will have no control over the present and future. George Orwell is making a great political statement in Animal Farm with specific emphasis on mass rebellion. It personifies Karl Marx's ideas for communism and illustrates what can happen after a revolution with specific attention to the fact that every society is political and contains \\"pigs\\" who will always grab for power. This satirical fable leaves the reader with a better understanding of communism and the anatomy of political revolution in any culture."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm, by George Orwell, is a novel that ridicules communism. Animalism, which represents communism, was a revolution that didn't work. Animalism was supposed to make life better for the animals but instead the quality of life only decreased. By the end of the story, the government had become corrupt, there was a dictator, and the animals had become slaves to the pigs.The story begins with the animals going against Mr. Jones, the farmer, because of the way they were treated. The animals felt that the farmers received all the goods for the work they did. So they created a government named Animalism. In Animalism, there are no owners, no rich, but no poor, workers got a better life, and all animals are equal. The animals established the Seven Commandments, which were laws that intended to give basic rights to animals and protect them from oppression. The goals of the governmentwere also set up. The goals said that everyone was equal, there would be more food and sleep for all, there was to be respect for all animals, and they would build a windmill to make life better for all. All this didn't exist by the end of the book. The animals were getting less sleep, less food, and less respect. The windmill became a source of money for the leaders, not for all the animals. The seven commandments were gradually changed to suit the just the pigs until there was only one commandment left. This commandment said that some animals are more equal than others. This was the exact opposite of what they originally intended to achieve. Animalism no longer existed.At the beginning of the story, there were two pigs that led the animals. Snowball was honest, inventive, and good with words. He stayed in touch with the animals, and truly wanted to make things better for them. Napoleon, however, was dishonest, bad with words, and was not inventive at all. He wanted to be above all the animals. He never wanted to make things better for them. In order for Napoleon knew that in order to be above all the animals he had to get rid of Snowball. He did so by getting his dogs to scare him away, making it so Snowball would never return. Napoleon was then in total control of the farm and the animals. Napoleon and the pigs started acting like humans, their enemies. They did everything that they had once said was wrong. Things were worse for the rest of animals than when Mr. Jones was running the farm. Once Napoleon takes over and forms the dictatorship, the animals are forced to work. Napoleon and the pigs owned the farm and the others became slaves to them. The animals &quot;volunteered&quot; or they got less food. The dogs used force; and Squealer, another pig, would lie to them to make them work. The pigs weren't fair to the other animals at all.Orwell shows that revolutions are not always for the better, which was his intent. He wrote this to show his opposition to the communism in Russia. The outcome of the book shows what happened in Russia, as Stalin and Lenin turned into Napoleon, trying to dictate a country."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm was a riveting story of the struggle between the hopes of determinated, loyal, farm animals and the over-powering, corrupted, group of pigs that cruely ruled the farm. Both exciting and touching, dramatic and entertaining, so imaginative yet so real, this stort not only entertains the reader, but makes you think about life and its state of reality. With startling resemblance to the events surrounding the Russian Revolution, this story takes you on a trip into the minds and souls of animals that you never believed could think. The novel is written briliantly and discriptively which allows the reader get to know the characters, feel their pain, think their thoughts, and live their lives. After the animals on the Manor Farm rebel against their cruel owner, they believe all hardships are over and they worry no more about suffering from hunger and being visiously over worked. But their hopes were proven false when the new power comes to play and seems to be slowly evolving into what they each know and fear. With their new found power the pigs become corrupt. Maybe it was the power, maybe it was the freedom, but whatever it was that drove them to be the selfish, cruel, depriving, nearly abusive, and quite desceptive rulers that they turned out to be, it must have been strong. The animals were loyal to their rulers, the pigs, though they surely resented them. They never betrayed them, but recieved betrayal in return. Breaking the set rules that the pigs themselves made to keep animalism pure, they diseaved and betrayed their loyal followers. The outcome of the story was sad but true when the pigs finally reach the point of corruption with no return. They became cruel and heartless to their fellow animals. The pigs evolved into what the animals feared most, the corrupted by power, greedy, selfish, man; thus leaving them with a future even scarier than their lives once were. Power corrupts all."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Needless to say the book needs no introduction, much less a review. But the main reason I am writing this is to set the minds of a few reviewers straight. I could not believe that people read this book without any thought or idea that there may be parallels to the book and our reality. They seemed to not understand that Orwell was using the fable as a device. It's funny they say that they could draw no meaning or lesson out of the book at all, because it sounds exactly like the stupid animals on the farm that could not see what was happening before their eyes. There are so many allusions to events in history the fact that they could not see even a few of them makes me cringe. Anyway I've finished ranting."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"On general this book is interpreted as a satirical story about the way Russian communism (didn't) work. I do believe that this view misses a deeper layer, namely that Orwell is describing the 'working of a revolution'.In the book Orwell describes how at first flaws in the current system are found, a new ideology is born and a plot is formed against the existing powers. When the revolution succeeds, the leaders of the revolution also become the leader of the country. These \\"great leaders\\", however, can hardly be questioned because of there role in the revolution. Slowly the unchecked power corrupts, leading to an opportunistic interpretation of the ideals and the self maximisation of wealth (just as the former rulers).Although - clearly - primarily based on the Russian revolution, the book also reveals the way hypocrisy arises after the French revolution (Freedom, equality and brotherhood, but - for instance - how 'equal' was Napoleon) and the rise of Racism/Fascism (note that \`four legs good, two legs bad' is essentially a racist remark, and compare this with the German believe that blond blue eyed people are superior, except of course ....).I do believe that Animal Farm is primarily a warning against unchecked power (see also \`1984') that in this case arises after a revolution. Probably Orwell based \`Animal Farm' on communism, just because the ideals are more universal and more appealing as those of Racism, and because it is more recent as the French revolution."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I enjoyed reading 'Animal Farm' by George Orwell. It is a book that if you don't read all that carefully can just be mistaken for a book about the revolution that happens in just one farm, but it is really much much more.George Orwell was a very political writer in books such as '1984' and, this book, 'Animal Farm.' He was a socialist that was critical of Communism and hated Totalitaianism. He thought that the modern man was unable to deal with demands of his history, so it is interesting that he chose animals to tell this interpretation of government.I see it as an interpretation of what went down in Germany during and prior to World War 2, starting with Stalin and going to Hitler. The different figures from actual history are sometimes blended into one character, but it still follows the same principles. The way that Orwell does this is very clever and creative. It takes the idea of talking animals to the next level and shows them using some extreme personification.If you are contemplating this book, I think that you really should. It is a great way to see not only an interesting way to look at the government, but as the book progresses you will see a very interesting comment about human nature. I give it a good two thumbs up. It may not be that long or that thick of a book, but it is really good with good statements. ENJOY!!!"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm is an easy-to-read book,and on th surface it seems like it's about animals.Pigs and horses and moles fill the story.It definetely looks boring to a person who's older than 13 and who's looking for depth in books.But,as I said before,it just seems boring on the surface , however no reader can deny how deep the book really is.Obviously it's about the Russian Revolution and what happened afterwards,and it's a must to read about Soviet Union in order to understand the book thoroughly. Surely it's possible to see the power fight among the pigs and relate it to real world,but that's not understanding it as a whole.After you read about the Soviet Union,you'll have a different enjoyment figuring out who's who.For example Napoleon the pig is representing Stalin,and Snowball the pig is representing Trotsky.Overall,first read about &quot;the&quot; revolution and what happened afterwards,understand who did what,and then read this fabulous book.You'll definetely have fun and a strange smile will form on your face after you read the last line."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"One of the marks of a great work of literature is that it can be read on different levels. George Orwell's Animal Farm is such a work. We can read it as a child's fable or as a description of the 1917 Russian Revolution with Snowball-Trotski, Napoleon-Stalin, Old Major-Lenin (or is it Marx?) and Squealer-a collection of various Stalinist toadies- providing the history lesson. That can be instructive and we come away feeling that we understand the fundamental dynamics of totalitarianism, in all quite contented with ourselves.That would however be missing the most important point for Americans today that is brought out in the book. Dictatorship doesn't arise in one fateful moment, people don't become manipulated pawns overnight, rights are not eroded or even reversed with one blatant stroke of a pen on a governmental decree. If anything the history of 20th Century dictatorships shows us that this is a gradual process as in Orwell's book. Napoleon's plans are put into effect slowly; the laws are changed methodically one by one, at night when the animals are asleep. History itself is taken away and washed of any conflicting elements that displease the powers in control or bring up uncomfortable questions. Gross inequalities are said to be necessary, unavoidable, even positive, while a strong police presence backed with cruel punishments discourage any overt opposition. The most important element of control is to convince the people that things are \\"better\\" than before without actually telling them what the \\"before\\" was like. Convince them that theirs is the best of all possible worlds without really comparing it to anything else. Arouse their sense of patriotism and use popular symbols to distract and confuse. All this is shown in the book to be very effective in establishing and maintaining control, all the while the real condition of the animals/citizens only worsens, the manipulation and domination only becomes more obvious, more difficult to rationalize and explain away.Now for the clincher - How has OUR country changed in the last 20 years? Are we as a people more manipulated and dominated by unseen and unaccountable plutocratic elites, less in control of our supposedly democratic government than in 1980? Are we, the common people, not confronted today with a far more refined, more subtle type of control and domination, which allows us steadily decreasing room to move about, a constantly constricting pen so to speak, whose artificial veneer of \\"liberty\\" is wearing increasingly thin? Is it even allowed in polite company to pose such questions?A biologist friend of mine tells me that if a frog is put into a pan of hot water it will jump out, but put the same frog in a pan of cool water and gradually increase the temperature to boiling, the frog will stay in the pan until his eyes burst. Perhaps we Americans should ask ourselves where we are, metaphorically speaking, in the Animal Farm herarchy. Are we at least hard-working horses who occasionally question what is done supposedly in our name, or are we simple frogs, sweating now, only semi-sentient, but still smug and stupid in our belief that things will only get better?"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"The novel Animal Farm is set in England on a farm called Manor Farm, owned by a Mr. Jones. The Novel starts out with Mr. Jones, after a long night of excessive drinking, fails to lock up the farm properly. Old Major, a highly respected wise old pig, takes the chance to call a big meeting for all the animals. He points out that men take all the benefits while the animals, whom were the cause of such profit, are rewarded with just enough to keep from starving. Old Major suggests a rebellion against the human race, which if succeeded, would let animals live in peace and be free from the tyranny of men.Three days later, Old Major dies and two pigs, Napoleon and Snowball, emerged as leaders of the animals, made sure that Old Major&iexcl;s revolutionary dream stayed alive. The revolution was successful as Snowball and Napoleon then introduce to the animals the seven commandments of &iexcl;animalism&iexcl;:1. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.2. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.3. No animal shall wear clothes.4. No animal shall sleep in a bed.5. No animal shall drink alcohol.6. No animal shall kill another animal.7. All animals are created equal.For a while, all the animals could feel that life has improved. However, things take on a dramatic change when Napoleon starts to contradict the animalism constitutions set at the very beginning including killing one of his fellow farm animal for attempting to revolt against him, or so he claims. Before anyone could say anything, numbers 4-6 on the animalism constitutions were changed to:4.) No animal shall sleep in bed with sheets5.) No animal shall drink alcohol excessively6.) No animal shall kill another animal without causeAs the years pass, the pigs have now all moved into the farmhouse where Mr. Jones once lived. The last constitution was soon changed to &iexcl;All animals are created equal, but some animals are more equal than others&iexcl;. The utopian government the animals were wishing for has turned into a totalitarian dictatorship rule.This book, published in 1956, was a satire towards Stalinist Russia, but using animals as its characters. The book can be seen as a fable, wonderfully written mocking the communist regimes at the time period. The novel also hides the horrific scenes of communist regimes and illustrates what Russia went through without being too direct. Russia, from a revolution against tyranny to a dictatorship just as terrible, is what George Orwell is trying to convey to his readers.

A lesson from history."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Blood, violence, revolution. As an allegory of the violent Russian Revolution, George Orwell's Animal Farm is a call back to the fairy tales of times past. Animals that possess the ability to think and act in a humanlike manner are the main characters, and their personalities and the events of the story directly parallel the events of the Bolshevik take over--and that is all. By sticking so closely to the original proceedings, Orwell has failed to create a story with any sense of originality.In Animal Farm, the animals of a man named Mr. Jones have grown tired of the cruel way he treats them and decide to revolt. Gaining their ideas from the teachings of a pig named Old Major and their leadership from two pigs named Napoleon and Snowball, the animals successfully take over the farm. Over the course of the book, the animals fight amongst themselves and against the humans, work to achieve prosperity, and eventually end up in a situation very similar to where they started.The animals of Animal Farm are so similar to famous figures in the Russian Revolution that it becomes possible to predict what they are likely to do next. It is easy to get caught up in looking for parallels between the animals and the Bolsheviks, rather than read the story for its own sake. To look at only the pigs, Old Major, with his talk of \\"Rebellion! I do not know when that Rebellion will come, it might be in a week or in a hundred years, but I know, as surely as I see this straw beneath my feet, that sooner or later justice will be done,\\" and point of addressing the other animals as \`comrade', is a clear parallel of Karl Marx, from whom the Bolsheviks gained their ideas of socialism. Snowball and Napoleon, also, with their arguing and the eventual forced exile of Snowball, strongly resemble Trotsky and Lenin.For a reader looking to read about the Russian Revolution in a format more interesting than typical nonfiction historical accounts, Animal Farm is a good start. It is also good for a quick read, particularly if one wishes to learn a bit more about Orwell's writing style and perspective on socialism. It is not, however, a book that will appeal to a reader wanting to read an entirely unique and creative story."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Everyone has to read this book!

It all began with a dream by Major, a Middle White boar, of equality, and freedom from oppression. Maybe not in our life comrade, but eventually.The dream brings a song. Intolerable conditions lead to revolution. As time passes things change; not exactly as planned.There are two striking parts to this tale that stand out. First when Boxer is sent to the hospital and Benjamin reads the side of the van \\"Horse Slaughterer.\\" Secondly there was a party in the farm house as the pigs were playing cards with the men, two aces of spades showed up. An argument ensues. Then the creatures outside looking in as they \\"...looked from pig to man and man to pig, and from pig to man again drew a realization...\\"1984 Nineteen eighty four"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"The animals on the manor farm are tired of being treated like slaves and after hearing a speech from an old pig named Major about a revolution and a place where the animals were in charge, they actually thought about doing something about it. They ran Mr. Jones and his men out of the Manor Farm and changed the name to Animal Farm, the pigs take control of things since they are the smartest they use their wits to get their way out of working and little special benefits that they gave themselves.In the beginning things didn't seem that bad, the animals were somewhat equal with the exception of the pigs not working, two of the pigs would plan things out and the other animals would vote on which idea they liked better. Then one of the pigs got greedy and chased the other one out and took control of the farm things went down hill from there. Even though the other animals were being treated worse then they were when Jones ruled the farm they never complained because of false figures the pigs would give them and tell them how much better things were.This was a great read enjoyable at some parts and chilling at others.

Many of the real life people in the revolution are portrayed as farm animals. For example, one of the people who had the idea of revolution is portrayed as a lazy, fat pig named Major.Many of the big events during the revolution were portrayed but in different ways.For instance, the battle of the windmill could have been like the workers storming the Czar's palace.You will fall in love and learn to hate the characters throughout the story. It was an excellent book."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This book is a ferocious satire of a state with a one party system, built originally on the principle that 'all animals are equal'.The ideals of the revolution are quickly betrayed and the one party state turns into a work-camp. First, one ethnic group takes control of the system and after, one individual within this group wields dictatorial power.To consolidate his power, the dictator controls the media (spreading false information and blatant lies), organizes fake elections (one candidate only), creates fear and terror through forced confessions and public executions, puts all internal problems on the back of foreign agents, rewrites history and erases the memory of his old revolutionary companions.Orwell's perfect model was Stalin's USSR.The choice of the roles of the different kinds of animals is not less than brilliant.Unfortunately, this deadly satire is still very topical today. Most of the world's independent states are ruled partially, or even totally, as a copy of Orwell's nation of sheep, dogs, workhorses and pigs, with one pig more equal than all other animals together.A must read."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Imagine a farm run completely by animals...completely by animals. A rebellion against humans starts it all. In Animal Farm this idea was started by Old Major, a boar, whose dream was that animals ran the farms. \\"Man was their only enemy,\\" was the inspiring quote that helped them through the rebellion. George Orwell uses a real life rebellion experience, with people, and converts it into a more simpler way of explaining it...with animals on a farm.Days after Old Major made his speech, he died a peaceful death in his sleep. Then the rebellion started. They successfully took over the farm and even wrote up their own \\"Bill of Rights\\" which was called the Seven Commandments. The leaders of the farm were pigs, they were mostly the only ones who could read. Snowball was one of the leaders who was intelligent, passionate, and eloquent. Napoleon was another leader who had a reputation of always getting his own way. Eventually, Napoleon and Snowball stopped seeing eye to eye on the way things should go. Before long, Napoleon starts to use force and manipulation to gain power. It didn't take long for Napoleon to start resembling his \\"enemy.\\"Animal farm is a book that focuses on description. The author, as the story unravels, makes it easy for me to picture the scenes in my head. In the end I think that the author could have taken the story into more details, because it would have been easier to see what happened to the animals.I chose this book because the plot was different from other books I have read. I was also interested in what was going to happen at the end of the story. I think that it was partly the genre and that I liked it because it was about animals, which interests me a lot, and that I kept reading it because of the whole story. I think that there would be a way for me to appreciate the book more. For example, if I lived on a farm, it would be even easy to appreciate it because I would be around the animals that the book talks about. George Orwell does a fantastic job of explaining what happens thoroughly, throughout the story.

George Orwell seems to have been the only one ready enough and intelligent one to take on Hitler and Stalin. While others hid in their cupboards in fear of an air raid. Orwell spent longs hours at his desk putting on the finishing touches to his masterpieces. Even if Hitler had taken over the world (thank God he didn't), Orwell would have been there making the brainwashed realize the evil and wrong doing behind the Nazi beliefs. In my personal opinion, Orwell affected World War II as much as Eisenhower and Churchill did.

The story centre's around several animals living in a farm yard, each of whom represents a certain socio-political aspect of society. For example, Napoleon the pig (ironic use of his name!) represents despot dictatorship, Boxer and Clover, the horses, represent the manual, unthinking &quot;mass&quot; needed by the dictator to physicalise the desired tyranical society, and so on. Orwell effectively structures his social microcosm in such a way that the danger of the dictated government are released in their full desperate and miserable potential, which in turn expands the political awareness of the reader. His decision to use anthropomorphism grounds the story, not relating it to any specific human codes of time or structure.

The animal there found that their lives were harsh just because human were selfish. Therefore, they toke revolution to overthrow human. The farm was renamed as Animal Farm. Under the leading of Snowball, which was a pig, the farm ran successfully: all the animals lived happily, freely and equally. However, this made another pig, Napoleon, become jealous. He driven away Snowball and became the new leader. Then he changed all the rules and gradually made all other animals to work for the pigs. Their lives became harsh again. At last, there was no difference between ruling by human or animals.It seems that this is just a simple fairy story. Actually, there is an important message behind it,&iexcl;All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than the others'. In the story, Snowball suggested that all animals in the farm were equal, nobody could kill the others, even cats could not kill rats. However, Napoleon changed it. Pigs became more equal than the others. It just like our real world. All the animals in the world have their right to live. However, human can kill some kinds of animals for food, can control the lives of their pets, or even use other animals to do experiments. This shows that human actually are more equal than the other animals.This story actually is a reflection of our real lives, just presented in a different way. Readers can understand this world and the reality of human more easily and clearly from this story. I would recommend it to you all."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Having read this book and comparing it to today's reality, I hate to say it but our government here in America and most governments all across the globe have done a superb job of imitating the worst elements of \\"Animal Farm\\". Not to worry though, not all of us Americans are too dumb and/or ignorant to let this go on as more are waking up to the fact that Conservative ideals are just as dangerous to the nation as communist ones.It's interesting if you listen. A decade of propaganda has so misdefined things that even liberals - who are by now so completely battered they are afraid to use the \\"liberal\\" label and instead call themselves \\"progressives\\" - echo the nonsensical lies.\\"Fiscal conservatism,\\" says the lie, equals fiscally responsible. \\"Socially conservative\\" equals socially responsible and compassionate.Even on \\"progressive\\" talk radio, when the policies of the Bush/Limbaughians are assailed, these lies about what conservatism is and isn't are usually echoed. When the GOP's reckless spending ways are pointed out, the commentators often say, \\"I thought they were supposed to be fiscal conservatives.\\" When Pat Robertson calls for an assassination or when people who do amoral and illegal things in the Bush administration are not held accountable, liberal commentators and columnists ask, \\"I thought they were supposed to be good conservatives who care about morals and the law.\\"Again and again, as conservatism further and further erodes America - economically, socially, and politically - commentators and politicians on both sides of the aisle say that the problem is that Bush/Limbaugh conservatives are just not being real conservatives, that if they were being real conservatives, we would have a balanced budget, a kind, compassionate government, and things would be great and very American.Nothing could be more inaccurate. In fact, this dishonest, inaccurate line of thinking, bred by the endless Bush/Limbaugh/Murdoch lie-and-spin propaganda machine, is the single biggest threat to our nation at the moment.Fiscal conservatism does not equal fiscally responsible; fiscal conservatives are fiscally delusional and never have, and never could, be capable of making a budget that functions usefully in the real world.Fiscal conservatism is Arnold Schwarzenegger saying he can eliminate the $10 billion plus debt in California while cutting taxes, without cutting necessary spending on things like education, just by eliminating \\"unnecessary, wasteful spending\\" by \\"liberals,\\" only to end up borrowing not ten but sixteen billion dollars due to the fact everything he said was delusional and dishonest.Fiscal conservatism is Tom Delay and the Washington Times, as seen in this article. With massive deficits on one side and massive disasters due to underfunding basic needs on the other, Tom Delay is calling the situation economic \\"victory\\" for conservatives.To conservatives, there is no talk about fiscal responsibility or balancing the budget or restoring funding to essential things like protecting the homeland. Instead, the article offers a glimpse into the true insanity and destructiveness of conservatism, which is really nothing but irresponsible greed cloaked over with sweet talk.Look at this debate between the Bush/Limbaugh conservative Tom Delay and others who are defending even purer conservatism:\\"Mr. DeLay was defending Republicans' choice to borrow money and add to this year's expected $331 billion deficit to pay for Hurricane Katrina relief. Some Republicans have said Congress should make cuts in other areas, but Mr. DeLay said that doesn't seem possible.\\"To conservatives, the lesson of Katrina is not to acknowledge that we need to restore some of the funding they cut from vital things that can prevent disasters - like levee construction - but that, due to the disaster caused by their spending cuts, we need to cut more.Even DeLay, one of the most irresponsible cutters in our nation's history has a, \`You got to be kidding,' moment. From the article:\\"My answer to those that want to offset the spending is sure, bring me the offsets, I'll be glad to do it. But nobody has been able to come up with any yet,\\" the Texas Republican told reporters at his weekly briefing.In other words, he is acknowledging what Schwarzenegger had to acknowledge and what moderates and Democrats have been saying all along: the claim that just cutting unnecessary waste can cover the cost of tax cuts and necessary spending is bunk.But conservative groups will have nothing to do with reality. Not the lesson of Katrina, not DeLay's breaking the reality of the current deficits and added Katrina costs. No, fiscal conservatives exist in a fictional realm where taking more and more money for themselves is all that matters, and their dishonest pretending that somehow balancing a budget is their ultimate goal is shown to be the fa?ade that it is.The article continues:\\"Congress has passed two hurricane relief bills totaling $62.3 billion, all of which will be added to the deficit.\\"Republican leaders have been under pressure from conservative members and outside watchdog groups to find ways to pay for the Katrina relief.\\"Now that sounds nice, like the fiscal \\"conservatism\\" you were sold as being equal to fiscal responsibility. But continue on to the next sentence:\\"Some Republicans wanted to offer an amendment, including cuts, to pay for hurricane spending but were denied the chance under procedural rules.\\"This is hardly a well-oiled machine,\\" said Rep. Jeff Flake, Arizona Republican. \\"There's a lot of fat to trim. ...\\"American Conservative Union Chairman David A. Keene said federal spending already was \\"spiraling out of control\\" before Katrina, and conservatives are \\"increasingly losing faith in the president and the Republican leadership in Congress.\\"And just in case you try and put some sanity or logic into their thinking, assuming that maybe they are just upset about how much is being spent in Iraq or in the War on Terror, Mr. Keane clears that up in the very next sentence:\\"Excluding military and homeland security, American taxpayers have witnessed the largest spending increase under any preceding president and Congress since the Great Depression,\\" he said.\\"No, these are people who want to both ignore the costs of the Iraq policies they supported and not acknowledge how the underfunding of domestic priorities - like fixing levees - created disasters while, incredibly, at the same time, claiming they are really just trying to balance the budget, and that more cuts in domestic spending are what is needed to do it.Doesn't matter that they can't present things to cut, or that their leader, Tom DeLay, is even telling them, \\"...bring me the offsets, I'll be glad to do it. But nobody has been able to come up with any yet.\\"No, for fiscal conservatives, neither responsibility nor reality are things they begin to grasp. Like Communism sought to undermine society with delusional claims of equality for all while promoting systems that ensured success for none, Conservatism uses delusional claims of fiscal responsibility to promote bankrupting policies that leave the nation broke and in tatters.Social conservatism is as delusional as fiscal conservatism, nothing but a dishonest philosophy that makes you a criminal for being an ordinary citizen while pretending to be protecting you. Prohibition, seatbelt laws, banning dancing, restricting sexuality, permanent curfews for our young adults, 21-year old drinking ages that leave even the President's own daughters as criminals for wanting margaritas with their Mexican food. They are standing up for the good people - that only exist in dishonest, delusional-conservative-Fantasyland.There was nothing wrong with the Bush daughters - who are of college age - wanting a drink with their dinner; and even more importantly, they displayed that this is something that good people regularly do. Thanks to social conservatives, your son or daughter are made into criminals for acting normally.The general idea of social conservatism is to render everyone in the nation a criminal for doing what they would ordinarily do. This creates a setup where anyone can be arrested and given harsh penalties at the whim and choice of the government. For example, one of the biggest problems regularly cited by conservatives is the horrible drug problem in poor, minority neighborhoods. Drug users, drug dealers. Horrible.That's nice, except look at reality: both Al Gore and George W. Bush used drugs. Because they were white people in rich neighborhoods who used drugs, they got to go on to run for President. In the meantime, a fifteen-year old who does the same in a poor, black neighborhood is busted and run up with a criminal record, his future ruined, his reputation assailed, and he is labeled but another horrible part of the nation's poor minority drug problem.And no, this is not some exceptional example. Central to conservatism is intentionally dishonest hypocrisy. They let their kids drink, they use drugs, they don't abide by nor really agree with the laws they pass, but they pass them anyway and then scream bloody murder when others break them. It is more than lying. It is a truly brainwashed delusionality in which they honestly convince themselves that condemning actions by others that they actually practice themselves is not insane nor dishonest. They can go on and on about those horrible criminals, how they should be locked up, shot, how they are worse then animals, all the while being delusionally disconnected from the fact that they do the same things themselves. You don't have to run down the whole list of multi-divorced drug addicts like Rush Limbaugh preaching on and on about family values and the need for harsher penalties for those drug addicts, or the Bushes/Cheneys/etc. who ran from serving their nation in combat who preach how doing so is un-American. The point is plain and easily observable, and it is a basic tenet of conservatism.And finally, political conservatism is such a juvenilely small-minded view of diplomacy and the world that it can never have useful application in the actual world. It is Pat Robertson thinking we should just kill people who oppose us - but do it covertly, and that will really fool people and free us from consequences or guilt. It is Eisenhower deciding to undermine the entire nation of Iran for the sake of keeping oil prices down and thinking - honestly - that it is a good bargain in the long term; and then his fellow conservatives refusing to make the connection to the hostage crisis, the Iran/Iraq War which led us to fund and arm Saddam Hussein, the arming and training of Osama bin Laden, the having to put troops on Saudi soil to stop Saddam from using the arms we gave him, the anger that instilled in the man we had armed and trained named Osama, and the leading of all this to 9/11. Yes, conservatives have a real, delusional belief that they are the solution to Iraq and 9/11, refusing to accept the inescapable reality that conservatism was directly responsible for the hostage crisis, both Iraq Wars, and 9/11.Communists once sought to undermine the American government, bankrupting our coffers and values. Now, it is conservatives - the communists of the modern era - that our government must defend itself against.Conservative philosophy is one that believes freedom is a threat to a nation, that dictatorship is a better, \\"easier\\" form of government - as both George W. Bush and Donald Rumsfeld have said - and conservatism preaches that hate is to be put before facts, anger before reason.While the true ultimate goal of communism was a totalitarian state, as witnessed everywhere communism flourished, the real ultimate goal of conservatism is dictatorship, as witnessed everywhere conservatism dominates, such as in the nations of the Middle East. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, indeed, Iraq, are all conservative-dominated nations.The outcome of conservatism is always the same: forced religion or creed, lack of freedom, lack of democracy, and fiscal disaster for all but a few.The nonsense that conservatism stands for all things good, that fiscal conservatism means fiscally responsible, that social conservatism means socially responsible, that politically conservative mean superior on foreign policy is all just the echoing of lies fed to us again and again by the lying right-wing propagandists that entirely dominate the American media conversation.The successful nations of the world all are - as America has been - moderate nations. They are nations that keep leftists and rightists, communists and conservatives, at bay, vocal minorities without much actual power.During the Cold War, America was under threat by communists, both abroad and at home. Now, in the age of the War on Terror, we are under attack by conservatives, both abroad and at home.Except so far we have only defended ourselves against them abroad. With two-thirds of our nation now aware that what is going on at home is not good for America, it is time for all of us to join together to begin to fend off the attack on America by the insidious, destructive, reckless, violent, delusional propagandizing and assault on our government by the evil that is conservatism.And in case you don't really want to believe it, look at who is ensuring that FOX News continues to operate as the propaganda outlet it is. From CNN via Netscape News:\\"Saudi Arabian billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal said Tuesday he now holds a 5.5% voting stake in Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.

Because however involuntarily amusing it is in this wrapping, the Russian revolution definitely was action-packed. You can also choose to read the book without considering the historical framework.

Many of the beliefs the animals share are parallel to my own; I do not agree with the killing of animals for meat, forcing them to produce an absurd amount of milk for human consumption, or placing them in servitude to satisfy our own needs. While I find it gratifying to discover another who agrees with my ideas, the ending was so sad and incomplete I became depressed. Boxer, the hardest working animal on the farm, is slaughtered because he is no longer useful, and the pigs become absolute monarchs of a rule of terror enforced by attack dogs. Then the animals look on while their leaders mingle with humans and can no longer tell who is a pig and who is a human.

The book's main topic is not life on the farm; it is about more worldly topics that unfortunately too many have to deal with everyday: greed, power, and corruption.It is a satire of communism and the Soviet Revolution. A satire not in the sense of poking fun at those events but sharply criticizing them and those responsible. While reading the book, you cannot help but feel the animals who are being governed are partially responsible for the naivety and negligence.My eleventh grade class had to read it as a part of the syllabus and we all enjoyed it. We read it not only because we had to in class but many even went ahead and read it on our own at home. We would often question the animals for putting up with it, but it is hard to realize that so many humans did for so many years in communist countries.

This book far exceeded my expectations."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Due to the ingenious mind and masterful writing of George Orwell, Animal Farm is one of the greatest books ever written. At a glance, this book is a \\"fairy tale\\" about animals taking over a farm and turning the farm into a utopia. Without Mr. Jones (the owner) taking his share of the profits, the farm, under the tutelage of the pigs, thrives diligently for a year. But the pigs become selfish and end up breaking all of the commandments that they had set forth, and life for all of the animals, except the pigs, worsens to the point that it is worse than when Mr. Jones ran the farm.In actuality, this story is about Orwell's disgust for communism. Animal Farm describes the Russian Revolution that began toward the end of WWI, and also describes the leadership of the Bolsheviks under Stalin. Stalin promised a society in that everyone is of equal worth, but he became greedy, as did the pigs in the story. His rule became better known as totalitarianism, or tyranny. Though Orwell dies in 1950, this book prophesizes the eventual fall of Russia. Orwell's ideas can be summed up in one sentence, \\"A communist society will inevitably fail because of greed.\\""},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal farm is a story to make you think. This book is the truth. It lays human nature out on the table, as if it were a four-course meal, explaining each and every detail, which show just how greedy, selfish and oppressive one can be. For these reasons I loved this book. Joey-bet cha can't guess..."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This anthropomophic tale is a satire of communism in Russia, expounding upon the author's view of communism's evil through the actions of animals who represent the people caught in the Russian Revolution. They revolt against man (the Czar) and the pigs become the leaders. They paint the rules on a fence, but gradually it seems that the rules change. What horse remembers as each rule no longer exists; they have been replaced by subtly differently worded rules, with decidedly different meanings. The horse remember the rule that \\"All animals are equal.\\" When she returns to look at the barn wall, however, it says \\"All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.\\" The pigs become the government and one pig secretly trains dogs that kill \\"traitors\\" who confess. The dogs are his army and his KGB. There is a Lenin pig, a Stalin pig, and a Karl Marx pig. In the end, it is impossible to tell \\"man from pig or pig from man.\\" I liked this book because of its topic and Orwell's writing style. The satire is obvious and the point is clear."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"A quick glance at the title, cover and general thickness (or lack thereof) of this novel may suggest this to be little more than a young reader's book abouty animals on a farm. Any of you people remember the old saying &quot;don't judge a book by its cover?&quot; Far from that initial impression, Animal Farm is, in fact, a very intelligently written social commentary, one which may actually even surpass Orwell's other socially aware novel, 1984.Without revealing too much, the story is set on a farm in England. The animals there, inspired by an aging pig, carry out a revolution to oust the cruel human owners and claim the farm, as well as their independence. They immediatly set down laws, mostly discussing the equality of the animals and forbidding certain acts which may lead to human like behavior, and beging to run the farm for themselves. I won't go on, but rest assured, this is not a novel about the peaceful farming lives the animals lead.As I stated before, I found this to be even better as a social commentary than 1984. The unusual premise, which uses humans only when absolutly necessary, and more interesting characters give this book a much broader appeal than 1984. Like that other book, though, there is a very important lesson to be learned from this. I personally was somewhat reminded of the United States' history, how originally it was supposed to be a nation of freedom and equality, and how we wound up using other humans as slave labor.Anyway, this is an excellent book, and I wholeheartedly reccomend it to any and all readers. In fact, I would label this as essential."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Look, I'm not going to sit here and write yet another review gushing about how I \\"got\\" the socio-economic message in this book. It was undeniably present from the first page to the last. What I enjoyed most about this book was that it was a fun read. You do not have to have aspirations to be a UN delegate to enjoy this book. I mean, lets face it, reading about animals taking over a farm is fun stuff. Couple that with the fact that this book is a short 140 pages well, I think it is just about the perfect read for anyone. With a book this good and this short the traditional excuses of \\"too much school work\\" or \\"too busy at the office\\" just don't fly. Turn off the TV, power down the video game and take you mind on a journey.Oh, and try this little experiment, once you have read it keep it on the shelf then read it again in 10 years or so, it will be like a whole different book."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I'm not going to give a synopsis of the whole book, you can read other reviews if you're looking for general information. But I'd like to expound upon on character in the story, Mollie. Mollie was the horse who ran away from the farm after it was discovered that she was receiving sugar and petting from the humans from the adjacent farm. Orwell is using Mollie in the story as a metaphor for capitalism. Surprisingly, Orwell was a socialist, but his ultimate belief was that man was simply unable to govern himself no matter what the ideology.Mollie is a reminder of the excesses of our government in the 1990's, and a warning of what eventually comes from it. Much like the U.S populace, Mollie was unconcened about who ran the government, or what polices were in place (like the 60-70 percent of the US population that doesn't vote). As long as she was getting her 'ribbons' and 'sugar' (i.e., money and material possessions) she was quite content to live in any regime, even a corrupt one like the humans had created for the animals. Remember the Clinton years? Who really cared what the President did, as long as the economy was swell? Orwell was more prophetic than most of us realize. Of course, in a communist society, sugar and ribbons are the first things to go. So Mollie heads over to the other farm, not caring about how she will be treated, but only desiring some more of that sugar.A book that should be read to every child once he/she is old enough to understand its implications."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm, by George Orwell, tells a story of the once peaceful Manor Farm. The animals decide to overthrow humans, and take on the job of supporting themselves by themselves. Day by day, the social imbalances start to emerge, such as the pigs determining themselves as the thinkers of the society; therefore they should get more priorities. The revolution was created to change society to where all animals are equal, but through the seven commandments, Napoleon, the leader boar, takes absolute power over the animal society.This story explains the Russian revolution in average English, where almost anyone can read it to understand the story, but there are many real meanings to it. Each animal represents a character in a revolution; such as Squealer representing the one who gets to a high status buy simply obeying the stronger side. Slowly it explains how their so-called equality becomes hard solid dictatorship. This idea of communism is easier said than done, as this book implies, since at the end, there will be someone who stands up to be a leader.There are many reasons that I recommend this book, but mainly because it compares real life to a fiction in a perfect way. Also as some minor positives, the book is short, very short so you won&iexcl;t be looking at a half ton book thinking do I want to read this? for slow readers like myself. Lastly, as I stated above, this book is written in not very complicated English, so almost everyone can read it. On the five star scale, this book is definitely a five star, so read it!"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"George Orwell has written a very interesting story.

Whoever watches the film should read the book first though in order to learn the real facts."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I enjoyed reading this book because it shows very good the political, industrial and economical situation in Russia in the beginning of Communism. It's a story about a farm with animals. The animals try to free themselves from the cruel and unfair human beings. In the Russian history, the human beings represent the so called capitalists, while the animals are the communists. During the story, the animals try to create a state where everyone is equal and free and where no one has to be hungry. But exactly like in Russian history, there are always people who think that they are superior (or even are), and consequently try to dominate and oppress the others. In Animal Farm, these superior beings are the pigs, who, at the end, behave like there former enemies. So you could say that at the end, the situation for the animals (except from the pigs) isn't better at all, it's even worse! This development is also to be seen in Russian history! That's why I like this story, because it's kind of authentic!"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"We give this book four stars because it contains many true elements of history and illustrates them cleverly using animals. Since we have just spoken about USSR in our history class we found it interesting to recognise the parallels between the characters of certain animals in the book and the real historical figures. Old Major, for example, stands for Marx and Napoleon for Stalin (whereas his megalomania is already contained in his name). What we further like about the book is, that the development of the farm with it's inhabitants is realistic. The film, on the other hand, ends unrealistic. A revolution would never have been possible at that time, because the leaders were too strong."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I enjoyed reading the Novel Animal Farm by George Orwell. I like the Idea to show the past in a totally different way: animals representing (dangerous) people from the past. At the beginning it was difficult to find out which animal &quot;belongs&quot; to which person. It's odd how people (animals) develop and react when the get the chance of possessing the power. The result of it may turn out very horrible and cruel.

Unfortunately there's no happy ending for the Russian population, neither for the working animals in the book, a fact that makes the reader think about humanity. It's also very entertaining, especially the way the animals are describes and how they communicate."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This is one of those book, like 1984, that you pick something up, or learn something new every time you read it. I've read the book about 20 times.The very essence of this book was not to promote capitalism, as the first movie intended. It was written as a scare tactic against a totalitarian society and for &quot;democratic socialism&quot;.It explored why socialism, with power in the hands of a small group of people could be corrupted. Human nature dictates that people are greedy, and will take advantage of others whenever in the proper situation. The seven commandments that put Napoleon into power were broken in the end. The whole idea that there can be leaders in socialism is ludacris. Socialism is about equality.Snowball, on the other hand, seems to have had good intentions. But these are clouded by greed. Snowball dosen't object at the first time the commandments are broken, when the pigs recieve all the milk and apples.Very well thought our characters, a good symbolic story line and other ironic twists make this a good story."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This is now the second time that I have read Animal Farm and now that I understand what the book was acutally about, I liked it even more then I did the first time. I encourage everybody to read this book because it is very good and you can learn a lot from it. It is about the Russian Revoulution and each of the characters in the book symbolizes, in one way or another, a specific person or group of people involed in the Russian Revoulution. The book is about a group of animals who are led by the pigs to revolt against Mr. Jones, their master. After they drive him and his wife out of the farm, the animals take over. I liked this book because it was interesting and fun to read.

Animal Farm is a vivid depiction of the horrors of communism that occurred in the Soviet Union and currently occurs in communist countries.

Communism couldn't have gotten as far as it had, if people had just thought for themselves, and hadn't had the attitude of especially Boxer who would always say, &quot;Napolean is always right.&quot;. They just accepted their rules and their commandments. Most of the animals could not read either, which became a major problem when it came to the way the rules were made. This was one point I thought it portrayed greatly...the importance of education...if we are ignorant and just go along with whatever the speaker/leader is talking about (when Snowball was still there, it was said that the animals always seemed to believe whoever was talking at the time), then things like this are pronned to happen."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm is a perfectly argued description of how revolutions decay and are corrupted.

Old Major's fiery speech inspires and defines the animals' revolution. He hopes that one-day they will live in a communal society run by the animals for the animals. In the society that forms after the revolution, Napoleon (who represents Stalin or any leader like him) achieves absolute power. Napoleon and the other pigs distort Old Major's dream, changing the original concept from doctrine (Animalism), to \\"unalterable law\\" (the Seven Commandments), to slogans (Four Legs Good, Two Legs Bad). By the end of the book, the reverse of what Major originally intended occurs. Animal Farm testifies to the power of language to change and control society, for both good and ill. Major first uses language to free the animals; Napoleon then uses it to enslave them. The wrongs that Major denounces in his speech, the pigs eventually commit, using distorted forms of his views to back up their actions. Napoleon gains power through the twisting of language and the rewriting of history in order to control the future.

Orwell has combined his creative imagination with historical fact and has created a work that has lived well beyond his years.Aside from Orwell's historical overtones, I believe there is a more universal focus that applies not only to the Russian Revolution but to every single conflict of the world in human history: abuse of power.Acton's Law dictates, &quot;Power tends to corrupt; absolute power corrupts absolutely.&quot; The purpose of this &quot;law&quot; is not to stress how power over anyone is wrong, quite the contrary. A mother must have the authority to discipline and protect her child, even against the child's wishes, and the same principle can be applied on a larger scale. The focus lies with the absolution of such power and with the authority that goes unregulated.If a law is to be deemed just, what applies to one member of a society must apply to all members of a society. Animal Farm shows us what happens when members of a society are exempt from certain &quot;laws&quot; and even when those &quot;laws&quot; are broken they are exempt from appropriate punishment. Orwell tends to show us the more negative side of politics and like his work, 1984, Animal Farm is no exception. I liked this book and I recommend it to anyone with even a passing interest in politics."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"In 1944, George Orwell wrote Animal Farm, although it was not published until 1945. It took a year to find a publisher for the parody of a Socialist society. The story is centered on a farm in England. A secret meeting is held by the animals of the farm. The animals are rallied to rebel by Old Major, the prize winning pig of Farmer Jones. Old Major tells the animals of a dream he had in which all animals are free from human control. The animals conclude that man is the enemy and all his bad habits must be avoided. All animals are equals. The animals band together and revolt, driving the terror stricken Farmer Jones from the farm. The pigs take command of the new society, setting up rules of conduct and assignment of duties. Commandments are established based on the theory \\" Animalism \\" promoted by the pigs. The rules of conduct established by the pigs slowly change to best serve the ruling class of self important pigs. Questions by the other farm animals concerning the commandments are quickly put to rest by self promoting propaganda distributed keenly by the shifty pigs. To the animals own horror the utopian society they dreamed of is just that a dream. Orwell has the unique talent of making politics interesting and entertaining. Animal Farm is obviously a comedy of Stalin's Russia, but also a criticism of Marxism. It is evident that Orwell studied Marx's theory closely. In reading Animal Farm you can see that Orwell favored a Socialist society, but thought it would fail. Orwell' s Animal Farm reads like a good history lesson dusted with enough fairy dust to make it entertaining. I would recommend this to anyone interested in the effects of a totalitarian government or just a good read."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This book had some of the things I like best encorporated into it.

This utopian ideal proves to be short lived as the pigs begin to take power and soon there are denunciations, show trials, rationing, special privileges for pigs &amp; finally we find that while all animals are equal, &quot;but some animals are more equal than others&quot;.It's a simple, but brilliant, satire that pretty much devastates Marxism.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I've read animal farm so many times, and I still love it.

Farmer Jones represents Czar Nicholas the Second and the Animal Revolution represents the Russians kicking out the czar. There are many more similarities that you can come up with and it ends the same way the Russian one does. Another thing about Animal farm is that Orwell had some magical ability to predict the cold war. This makes that book enjoyable and something that I would recommend. When I read it in seventh grade, I could easily pick out the similarities and differences.

So immediately after finishing \\"1984\\" I went to the book store and was able to find \\"Down and Out in Paris and London\\", \\"Animal Farm\\" and \\"Keep The Aspidistra Flying\\" which I still have to read. But staying on topic, \\"Animal Farm\\" is nothing short of pure GENIUS! It grabbed me from the first lines and had me disappointed when it ended so quickly because it is a very fast read, but totally enjoyable through out! If someone had told me to think quick and name a book where animals are depicted as having human personalities prior to reading this book, my first response would have been \\"Charlotte's Web.\\" Now however, it is definitely \\"Animal Farm!\\"It starts out with Old Major, a prize boar having a dream and wanting to communicate that dream to the rest of the animals on the farm. From there all the animals are filing in and it is totally apparent in his descriptiveness that not only do they each have very distinct human personalities and quirks, but that the story itself is going to be a Master Piece! Which it is! I wouldn't want to ruin it for any one that hasn't read it but the song that Major (The Prize Boar) sings called \\"Beast of England\\" sets the perfect back drop for the story to unfold. And also all the various slogans that he coins are as powerful today as they were when they were written. \\"Four legs good, two legs bad!\\" is just one of the things that will stick with you long after the book has been read.From the stand point of a politically educating work, this book should be required reading for any one who just doesn't quite get \\"politics\\" whether they care for them or not. It's laced with serious issues like life and death, betrayal, patriotism and an entire gamut of beliefs that are of course far better understood from the inside out. Meaning those who acquire power ultimately end up being like the ones that previously had the power they didn't have, but once coveted. Witty, serious, comical and again, as important now in today's world despite when it was penned as anything ever was!

For all of those things I can add nothing. Instead of that I'm going to make this book review about me and what Animal Farm did to me - what it made me think - how it made me feel.Orwell's genius is in simplification, while his passion was to anti-authority. He wrote a simple story about animals in a farmyard and showed that authoritarians come in two types, those who abuse authority and those who are victimized by them. His simple truth is that individuals fall into their same roles regardless the government or organization that surrounds them.It made me think about what kind of authority I crave and what kind of authority I'd be. A book that can prompt that kind of introspection is a special book indeed. Unfortunately I've read Animal Farm a dozen times and I still don't have suitable answers. But I don't think answers are what Orwell had in mind. I think the import of the book was to raise the questions, to get people to think about it, and to get them to talk. If you're aware of your tendencies as individuals and as communities and as nations, then you can resist the slide into familiarity and disaster.Animal Farm taught me to question authority and to make decisions for myself. It taught me to learn things for myself and to never believe what I'm told by a single source. It taught me that \\"for my own good\\" rarely is.It's an important book to read and even more important to understand.- CV Rick, March, 2008"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"\\"Animal Farm\\" by George OrwellOne night on Manor Farm, a farm owned by Mr. Jones, all of the animals gather in the barn for a meeting. Word had gone around earlier that Old Major a prize Middle White Boar, had a strange dream whose meaning he wanted to explain to the other animals. Major is so highly regarded by the other animals on the farm that everyone was happy to show up.Major tells the other animals that his time on earth is short and that he will be dieing soon but that he feels compelled to pass on the wisdom he has gained. Major points out to the animals that there life is one of misery with most of their time devoted to the gain of others, primarily Farmer Jones. Major tells the animals of his vision of a farm not run by humans but instead by animals. In this utopian society, no animal will be over worked or under fed because all of their toil and work will be for their own collective gain. Major advises that sometime in the future, the Animals must band together and make the utopia a reality, and that is just what the animals do......Animal Farm is an allegory about communism as viewed through the eyes of George Orwell (Eric Blair). It has been rumored that the two conflicting leaders on the farm young boars named Snowball and Napoleon are actually based off of former Russian leader and Politician Joseph Stalin and Politician Leon Trotsky. Like Stalin and Trotsky Snowball and Napoleon are at constant odds and are always trying to move the farm in opposite directions with the price for their bickering being bore by the other animals on the farm.The Good: This was a good short read lending insight to how Communism can and did unfold. I think \\"Animal Farm\\" provides readers with the most painless and to the point outline of Stalinist Russia available even though it is in allegory form. It isn't trying to point out all the details but just trying to show you the briefest version of the big picture.The Bad: Nothing really comes to mind. It certainly isn't the most action packed book but that doesn't really appear to be what Orwell was aiming for.Overall: Give \\"Animal Farm\\" a try. It is a quick, enjoyable read with a real moral behind it."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"A sister of sorts to Orwell's monumental 1984, Animal Farm is an engrossing, entertaining, at times hilarious, and utterly scathing satire, a brilliantly aimed, razor-sharp literary poisoned dart. Although its target was Stalinist Russia (anybody who even paid a little bit of attention in their European History class could see the parallels), specificity hasn't dated this novel by an instant; As a darkly moralistic fable, its message still resounds with crystal clarity to this day (and all the days to follow, I imagine, until humanity falls off the face of the earth). What we have here is a depiction of hope at its most nave, revolution at its most futile, fascism at its most dangerously subtle, and human (er, animal) nature at its most dangerously human. Of course, it doesn't hurt that the story is both hilarious and heartbreaking, full darkly skewed fairy tale dynamics and all-too-human characters. Plus, you can read the whole thing in one or two sittings.

It is not so often that one can read about drunken pigs in the true sense of the word.Even though the end of the story shows the pigs and humans playing cards together, a handful of human heroes believe, that the farm would go bankrupt sooner or later and pigsticking can't be avoided. And they are right, even despite the pigs beginning to walk on their hind legs, thus completing their transformation into undistinguishable creatures.

Allegory upon allegory is subtley thrust at you, some I got, some only after my teacher explained things furthur for us. I read this years ago and still remember everything.

I actually understood the literal meaning and symbols of the book, and am also a huge world war 2 fan. I've always had an interest in the dictatorships and communist countries of Europe during the war, and this book taught me something I never knew. Communism started off as a huge breakthrough for equal rights and trying to keep everyone under control in a fair way, and everyone gave in becuase it seemed like the perfect society where nobody would be enemies and everyone would be able to have the same benefits. Communism worked well at first, and everyone seemed happy, but as time progressed, the government twisted its laws and made the people like slaves, where they were manipulated and controlled by the governments actions. People who weren't able to benefit everyone else were executed, the dictator made alliances with their so called \\"enemies\\", and went against everything they fought for in the first place. This is all seen in the novel, and teaches america why communism fails and why there can never be a such thing as everyone is equal, but more as everyone is equal, but some people are more equal than others.

That's really what is at the heart of this book: the slow methodical creep of ever more constrictive, exploitive, and oppressive laws which transform a free society to a totalitarian dictatorship. Each step is slowly introduced, and introduced to the public in a calm and well-reasoned manner. If done skillfully, no individual step will incite the public to stand up and oppose the overarching plan to enslave them. Joesph Stalin came to power around 1922-26, depending on the criterion applied, but it took him another 10 years to really cement together his ironclad dictatorship. So it is with Napolean the Pig, who becomes the barnyard leader with the slogan \\"All animals are created equal\\", and only later quietly adds \\"...but some animals are more equal than others.\\" The book unfolds in baby steps, slowly constructing a regime no better (indeed far worse) than the one it replaced. Once he removes the Farmer, Napolean purges potential rivals (e.g. the popular and beloved horse), trains a private army of attack dogs answerable only to him, and starts to set himself apart in a seperate and superior class from the other animals by walking upright like the Farmer did"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This book was quite different fromGeorge Orwell's 1984 (Max Notes), the only other of Orwell's works that I have read.

The animals are sick of the humans controlling them. They are underfed and caged up and just generally mistreated. The animals decide to start a revolution and they successfully drive the humans away. The pigs are known as the intellectuals so they quickly become the leaders of the animals, Napoleon the bore being the one in charge. With the pigs in charge how much will life really improve?Orwell's prose in this book is absolutely flawless. The scenes really jump out of the pages. Right in the beginning Orwell drops quite a large cast of characters for such a quick read but he fleshes them out so perfectly (and succinctly) that you won't become lost.This is a blazing fast read!

It's an allegory depicting the Bolshevik revolution using pigs, dogs, horses and other farm animals. The much expected revolution had animals in the beginning saying \\"Four legs good, two legs bad\\" and towards the end of the satire the sheep's were bleating \\"Four legs good, two legs better\\" and the pigs (the ruling class) were walking on their hind legs. It's the story of a revolution gone bad, the wicked and the scheming taking over and the lot of the ordinary working class staying as is or perhaps even worse. The characters Napoleon and Snowball represent Stalin and Trotsky while Squealer and Minimus represents Stalin's sycophants. It's fairly good; however, I'm not sure why this book is a literary masterpiece though. It's a fairly simple mapping of the main characters of the Russian revolution to farm animals with a decent dose of humor sprinkled here and there. It's popularity (and addition to the school curriculum) could perhaps be attributed to the \\"Red scare\\"?"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Orwell is taking one step more here than in \\"1984\\". He describes the rebellion of the animals of a farm against the brutal, steadily drunken farmer who exploits and oppresses them violently. The usurpation against this rule of violence is successful. But to fight the evil it does not mean to attain the emergence of the good.When in 1917 the Bolschewiki and Menschewiki overthrew Czarist Russia they removed a system that had brought for most of the people only hardly bearable conditions. In their place they set a regimen with an ideology that promised a wonderful future but created more terrible conditions than had ever existed before. The same goes with the animals on the farm. The freed ones installed a much worse rule. This happens not at once, it is a creeping and scaringly not avoidable process!Is this the fate of any free order, that it deteriorates into dictatorship? Is this what Orwell wants to tell us? Not quite! He is about showing us that this is only inevitable when the conscience for freedom values is undermined. But then it might be an imperceptible process which is all the more successful in case of a skilled use of language. The individuals should get accustomed to the wrong and adopt it. This makes them assessable. In the end they have no more own voice and bleat \\"mee\\" and \\"moo\\" in lockstep until they can be lead to the butcher unresistantly. At first it is the turn of the unadopted, but in the end all others are in for it, even the rascals. They leave a desert behind. Enough examples in the younger history! Especially the 20th century has excelled in the realization of much promising but less promise keeping ideologies, whose devastating effects will last long.Orwell\`s book is an appeal to all to understand and treasure the freedom rights of man as superior sanctity of human possession and to restore them as the most precious good that people have. He hopes that man is wise enough to do it. It is a pious hope.Freedom is always endangered if one or a group of people, a party, a majority etc. has the presumption to connote oneself as only owner of \\"truth\\". And freedom is getting lost, if it becomes a political will, transformed and applied by the power holders. Ideologies promise always to bring people to their true greatness. In truth they belittle them to unrecognizability. This can be seen in our times in Islam how it is lived by the Islamists where the individual is nothing, although promised paradise.

For his novel '1984,' Orwell envisioned a future where a government structure has almost complete control over the saturation and consumption of it's people, causing them to belive all manner of nonsense. In 'Animal Farm,' he takes his concept of human beings and government and turns it into a somewhat chilling satire on society.On Mr Jone's farm, a dying pig expresses her feelings about the thought that animals should unite for the common good, and go against the slavery of their human oppressors and develop a collective for equality among animals. AFter staging a rebellion against their owner, the animals take over Manor Farm, and rename it Animal Farm. Under the leadership of Snowball and Napoleon, two pigs who took the old sows words to heart, a chain of commandments and other ideas are put forth. However, this newfound style of government soon gives way to corruption and deceit, which is soon mirrored in sudden changes to policy, conspiracy theories, and more.Orwell has done such a great job of crafting a simple yet short story, that you find yourself double-checking what the policy for Animal Farm truly is a story that shows what happens when a government becomes corrupt and forces in power can take over the citizenry, preying on those of weaker intelligence and making a mockery of the very ideals they strove for. But then again, ORwell is bringing up a reasonable point: Man cannot hold to his ideals. Not to his own, and not to his Creators."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"What do you do with \\"Animal Farm\\"?

In its 50th Anniversary Edition, Harcourt Brace comes up with the perfect solution: make it into a children's book. The trade size and large type gives this edition the eerily appropriate look of bedtime story, and the accompanying watercolors by Ralph Steadman (illustrator emeritus of all things swinish) are a perfect touch. The extra material-two prefaces, one a translation back into English from the circa 1947 Ukranian edition-is somewhat superfluous, but doesn't detract from the overall effect.

With Animal Farm, he cements himself as a pithy and moralistic speaker for a tumultous sociopolitical era. Animal Farm, amazingly written so soon after WWII, when much of the West was still blind to the horrors of Russian communism, not to mention the truths behind the failing experiment.Orwell is a historian who analyzes history as it occurs - a risky endeavor, but his exceptional capacity for discerning truth from chaos and for clairvoyance are unrivaled. Animal Farm tells the story of farm animals who rebel against their master and set out to achieve an animal utopia based on equality, hard work, and good will. As their project is executed, though, it reveals features reflexive of human evolution - greed, ambition, the need to chart differences and draw borders, and the eternal desire to have dominion over all others.Animal Farm is not only a good general outline of human political flaws, but also a keen study in some of Red Communism's specifics. Orwell shows knowledge of his subject, not settling for vague inferences and over-obvious dichotomies. Rather, his satiro-ideological allegory portrays the entire social spectrum of masters and slaves, rulers and masses, idealogues and tyrants. A great counter to the Communist Manifesto, it answers with enough verbal economy and irony."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This book is the best educational tool of the value of freedom and what happens when we choose to compromise it in favor of other &quot;higher&quot; goals of society.

That is what earned a star. It all starts out on a cold night when Mr. Jones goes in the house without noticing that the gate to the animal barn was left unlocked. This automatically got my imagination zooming on what could happen with the gate unlocked. You will have read the book to find out. Onthe farm there is a pig named Old major. His real name is Willingdon Bueaty. He is a prize winning middle-white boar OWNED by Mr. Jones. He has thick fur/hair with black and white spots on him.Old major likes to share his dreams with the farm, because he feels that they have great and powerful meanings to them. He is very respected on the farm also.The detail in this book is so grand also. For example, I think the best detailing is done when George Orwell is explaining what the farm looks like. Also when he describes what Old majors' living space is. The dtiling is so great in this book that I give it two more of the four stars, that I rated it. Most books you read only give settings at some of the locations in the book, but this book details almost every change of setting.The fourth and final star i give this book as with all books goes to the autgors credit. He deserves this star for putting forth the effirt to give us this amazing piece of literature.The only reason i did not give this book a fifth star is because no book is perfect, there is always things that can be added to it.

It is a good literature book.This means I highly recommend it to school readers."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"The book is interesting, especially if you have good background knowledge about the Soviet Union. The book was so interesting until old Major (Marx) died, and unfortunatly he died at the begining of chapter 2. The rest of the chapters were talking about how the smart animals learned from his ideas,and followed him, although they fought with each other and each animal wanted to control the farm by himself. I think old Major is the hero of the story,because he was the one who cared about the animals rights, and then all the other animals followed him."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"In this book, George Orwell has basically just written a fable. He has used animals to portray people and happenings of Russia in 1917. Many people read this book on a child's level, but if you read on a higher level you understand it is more than just a story about animals rebelling against the farmer and setting up their own farm. Although I actually just read it on a child's level so I didn't confuse myself, because basically I dont know a thing about Russia, but if you think more about it as you read, you seem to get the basics. The Author has also been exceptionally clever at making the animals seem to be like important people in the Russian Revolution, each having their own individual character. Even if you dont know anything about Russia, it is still quite an interesting book because it is funny to see the difference in people's ( or animals in this case) actions between when they were defenceless, and when they had power."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Although short, Owell provides a good description of the Russian Revolution. Using the pigs as a metaphor, Orwell uses the pigs as a metaphor to describe the totalitarian power the Russians had. A great book, and a classic by Orwell."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Some of you reveiwers expressed a deep resentment at Animal Farm. Some I can understand, because you are socialists and feel that the book misrepresents you. (little known fact. George Orwell was an ardent Socialist himself. It really wasn't socialism he was condemning but the follies of Human ambitions and wants, shown in the form of totalitarianism.) I want to assure you he didn't.Want annoys me is that most you didn't like the book because it was assigned to you for English or Social Science. So immediatley, you don't understand it, don't think it's worth your time, or don't care. Some of you question the use of animals as characters (&quot;it doesn't sense&quot;). The same reason why any fable or satire would use animals. TO MAKE A POINT! And if you don't get the point from the entire book one sentence from the book should be enough:&quot;All Animals Are Equal, But Some Animals Are More Equal Than Others.&quot;'Nuff said."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm, a direct translation of the Marxism and Socialism of late Russia, presents a story of animals whose ultimate quest, to create unity under one organized race, fails to be reached. Orwell, A Democratic-Socialist with liberal objectives, organizes this story in perfect proportion, providing unique symbolism and abstract ideas. Perhaps his purpose for the use of animals more easily represents itself by forcing the human readers to look at another group of beings and recognize the wrongs of a popular political force."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Lets say that right now you are in school, and &quot;Animal Farm&quot; you have to read it for your english class i recomend reading it only in SCHOOL and not at home, couse if you are going to spend 5 hours to read it at home you'll hate the book and your teacher couse she took five hours of life out of you.

But if you read it on a political and social level, you will see how Orwell wants to show how the ideas of a Utopian ideal society can eventually be transformed by manipulation into a totalitarianist government. It starts off as equality to all animals, but it ends up with the pigs having all control and receiving everything the farm produces. The best characters are the totalitarianist, supreme leader, Napoleon. And the other one is his head broker of ideas, Squealer.

It begins with oppression and a totalitarian government with the master of the farm as a dictator. The animals manage to overthrow their master and for a while everything seems fine. The animals are equal and happy. This cannot last because of greed. The animals go through many different types of government and then end up right back at the begining. This shows that communism does not work.

Orwell is a genius"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Throughout the book, Animal Farm, George Orwell keeps the reader guessing and analyzing. Will the animals revolt and if so who will be the leader? This is an example of the endless possibilities of the plot. It is also well thought out and has many deep and descriptive allegories. With a little background on Russian history, I could see that an animals actions well describes the person in real life. Napoleon, also Stalin, is very greedy for power and manipulates the beliefs of the animals to get what he wants. Some examples show how wrong and ridiculous Stalin's actions were such as Stalin's Great Purge. Boxer, representing the working class was subject to Napoleon's propaganda and was taken advantage of many times. George Orwell often showed his point by creating interesting characters.By reading Animal Farm, I learnt lots about the rise and flaws of totaltalarism. It began with the people being mistreated, as the animals were by Mr. Jones. Then they developed an idea for a revolution, as Major did, and later carried it out. Once their empire was established, it seemed to be perfect. In Animal Farm -the animals had the food they wanted, the freedom they wanted, and controlled their lives. However this utopia did not last and soon flaws begin to appear. Stalin and Trotsky fight for power and eventually Trotsky, Snowball, is thrown out. From there on Stalin's power only gets greater and by the end the way the animals lived is back too or even worse then before the revolution began. The book Animal Farm shows the reader how the totaltalarism system rose and defeated its purpose.The book was enjoyable because it was interesting and easy, being able to relate to everyday life, while making a strong point. I could picture the animals have daily jobs such as weeding the fields or harvesting the crops. This was a lot easier than reading about a society and time that was a lot different than today. I also liked the development and depth of each of the characters. For example, although old and quiet, Benjamin lived long and always seemed to be unchangeable I his view. Boxer was a hard worker that, although not very smart, cared about his farm and comrades. Animal Farm, easy to relate to and having deep characters, taught me a lot.While reading Animal Farm the events and characters change my feelings and emotions towards everyone. At first I favored all the animals hoping they would rebel and live a successful happy life. However as Napoleon became over-powerful and created an unpleasant life. By the end of the book I felt that the farm would be better still under the control of Mr. Jones. Napoleon, my least favorite character, did not have dignity or honor. He took advantage of the animals, who couldn't read or write and worst of all, sold the life of Boxer for money. Overall Napoleon was an untruthful character that only cared about himself.Although the book was well concluded, displaying the main point of the book, it was very unpleasant to think of all the good things wasted and turned bad. All the work the animals completed, all the energy and sacrifices made, their goals and dreams, disappeared. I felt bad for the animals such as Boxer who were made to believe that everything they did helped themselves when it really only made things worse for them and better for the cruel leader. However this sad ending wrapped up the entire story. I would recommend this book to any friend, George Orwell presenting the information of Russian totaltalarism in a very interesting and intriguing way. I would also read other novels written by the author because he was very creative in this writing. Animal Farm, even though presented in a silly way, was very informative and influential."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"The title may be a little deceiving; Animal Farm is no children's fairy tale about a farmer happily living in symbiosis with his animals. Animal Farm's main objective proves to be a satire about the totalitarianism and an allegory to the communist rise in Russia. Through surreal circumstances, George Orwell conveys the development of a totalitarian society on a farm in England. The animals oust the farmer while the pigs, which are the cleverest and wittiest animals, assume power, just as Stalin took hold of Russia after the fall of Tsar Nicholas II and death of Vladimir Lenin. Throughout the book, unexpected and deplorable events plague the farm, as the animals are mistreated unknowingly through the use of propaganda. Orwell keeps the reader engrossed in the novel as events are ceaselessly happening at every twist and turn. A perfect villain, the pig napoleon, portrays Stalin and slowly destroys the moral and the will of the animals through perpetual and ever growing subtle oppression and manipulation. Napoleon was the obvious choice for least favorite character, while Benjamin, the old donkey added to the novel with cynical comments and remarks foreshadowing of events, was a favorite character. I liked the constant action and flow of events, as well as the underlying morals and messages conveyed through the animals' actions. It was also interesting to trace Russian history with the events of the book, and one will find that Orwell slyly incorporated many events into the book, such as the exile of Trotsky and the formation of the KGB. However, the ending, although politically satisfying to the satire aspect of the book, leaves much to be desired about the well-being of the farm; for Orwell closes with the animals unable to distinguish the pigs between the humans, whom they were trying to liberate themselves from in the first place, yet the future of the farm appears just trail off spiraling downwards. Also, the fate of Snowball, the pig who assumes the allegoric character of Trotsky, is left unknown. Orwell mentions Snowball's whereabouts in passing and many times it is possibly misconstrued through Napoleon's propaganda. Through reading the novel, I gained erudition in the area of Russian history as well as knowledge into the character of humans and the corruption that can be caused by power. I also learned much about the concepts of propaganda, totalitarianism, and communism. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys books with profound philosophy towards the character of humans or those who enjoy political satires. For those just looking for an entertaining story, Animal Farm does not lack in a compelling storyline, but has symbolism that is much deeper than the literal action. This being my first George Orwell novel, I would look forward to reading any other books written by him, for I enjoy his style of writing and enjoy the greater morals dealing with society and human character. Though ironic that such a profound lesson can be taught through the simplest of creatures, this book is another reminder that sometimes the simple things in life are the most important."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"\\"Four legs good, two legs better!\\"While reading the book Animal Farm by George Orwell, I was bewildered and enlightened by the historical significance of his representation of key figures in Russian history with animals on the farm. He used these animals to portray the evils of a totalitarian government, and what happens to society under one. He was also able to explain many other issues such as the use of propaganda to deceive the lower class, which is what my opening quote is an example of.I'd have to say my favorite character in the story was the faithful horse Boxer. He was not the brightest of animals, but worked as hard as he could down to his dying breath. He may not have been working for the right reasons, but he always did the best he could no matter what. His motto was \\"I must work harder\\" which is a perfect example of how he always tried to do his best.My least favorite character, on the other hand, was the horse Mollie. Mollie was too interested in the affairs of humans, and was not very faithful to her companions on the farm. She was easily lured into slavery again by being bribed and petted by a farmer. She did not really like life on the farm without Mr. Jones because she was unused to not having any care or assistance from humans.I like Animal Farm a lot. Not only was it a good story, but it also provided some excellent examples of the totalitarian government at work. From previous discussion, I was able to associate the animals with the specific historical figure they represented, which made my reading much more interesting.I think George Orwell is an excellent storyteller and his writings have great influence on people, even today. His expertise and writing satires and allegories are apparent in Animal Farm, which pokes fun at the totalitarian governmental system, and each character and event in the story is representative of something deeper than the literal meaning.I learned much about the history of Russia in the early 1900's and the rulers that took power. I also learned about key figures such as Josef Stalin and Carl Marx, and their political backgrounds. All of this information I would have never known and never researched had I not read Animal Farm.I thought George Orwell did an excellent job of creating a cliffhanger to end the story. The way he ended it may be interpreted as incomplete to some, but really it represents how the cycle of revolutions continue, because cruel leaders continue to take power and oppress the people (in this case, animals).I would recommend this book to anyone that is interested in history or politics because of its political and historical content relating to Russian history and the Soviet Union.I think I would definitely read more books by George Orwell because he is brilliant when it comes to using his imagination to recreate past events in history in different scenarios, like he did with the animals on the farm.Animal Farm is an excellent piece of literature and should be read by everyone interested in politics."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm, a book full of &quot;pig&quot;-headed beasts! When reading this book my emotions ranged from being sympathetic with the animals in the beginning to pitying the animals for their stupidity. I felt bad when Mr. Jones would work the animals hard and only feed them enough to get by. But my sympathy turned to pity when the animals fell for Napoleons propaganda (squealer's speeches). After finishing the book I realized how bad totalitarianism is and despised Napoleon for becoming such a power hungry &quot;pig&quot;.My favorite character was probably Clover. She was my favorite because she was pretty smart and didn't always agree with Napoleon right away. She questioned his and the other pigs' behavior. She was the only animal that would realize every time Napoleon changed a commandment. She was also very nurturing and mother like towards the other animals.I really liked how everything in the book paralleled something in Russian history. It was really interesting to try and figure out what everything meant. I also really liked the book because it was an easy read and I had no trouble trying to figure out what happened.George Orwell did a wonderful job showing how totalitarianism is bad and eventually will not work in favor of the people or animals in this case. I really enjoyed how he used a story about animals to explain the effects of totalitarianism. It turned something that otherwise could be a boring subject into a story about a farm.I learned a lot about totalitarianism in this book. I knew that it was bad prior to reading the book but I had no idea how it affected the people the so badly. I always used to wonder why the people never fought against a dictator but after reading this book I realize that sometimes the people don't even now how bad they have it.I thought that the end of the book was sort of disappointing. I wanted the ending to include a big downfall of Napoleon since he was such a horrible leader to the animals. But instead the book ended with Napoleon being happy and still in control.There are a few things I still don't understand. I don't know what the windmill in the book represents in Russian history. I also didn't understand the ending. Why couldn't you tell the difference between the pigs and the humans? and What does that represent in history?I would definitely recommend this book. It is a very interesting book to read in either an English class or a history class. I wouldn't recommend this book to someone to read outside of school because the book is much more interesting when you can compare it to the Russian history.I don't know if I would read another book by this author. This particular book was interesting because it was so accurately representing an actual country's government. I might read another book by this author if there was another book that included this quality.Overall Animal Farm is an &quot;oink&quot;-ing good time to read!"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Have you ever seen a horrible movie, watched a great movie or even read a repulsive book, or read a breathtaking one? You can always have ideas or feelings on what you watch and read. These feelings are known as movie or book reviews. After reading the book Animal Farm by George Orwell, I have many different feelings on this book, which is going to be known as my book review. In the process of reading this book, I have various emotions on the book and the author. George Orwell brought the real life events into a book by relating the books characters to those of real life. I feel this was a spectacular way to teach readers about outside events that were occurring. Each character mirrored a real life human or a representation of an event. Examples of this are in Russian History there were leaders of communism and that all people were equal. Leaders of communism were Carol Marx, Lenin, and Trotsky. In Animal Farm, a pig known as Snowball mirrors Trotsky. Lenin and Marx were both represented by the boar named Old Major. Overall, I feel that George Orwell was a good writer in being able to mirror real life events. Throughout the whole book, I could realize as the reader what point George Orwell was trying to get across. To any upcoming reader, in giving advice I would definitely brush up on some Russian History between the times of 1850's - 1900's.I had many emotions for this books text. At the beginning of the book when Animals took over I really enjoyed reading of the leadership skills and what happened around the farm. After everything during the middle of the book, I noticed this book was very page turning, which led to me being frustrated of what were the upcoming events. In the middle-end part of the book, when Napoleon took over I noticed what was happening to the animals and it caused me to feel very heartbreaking and discouraged of the way they lived. Generally, the book made me have various emotions. For the ending however, it was a very different ending then most books, which made this book exciting, you basically had to think like you are in the authors mind. I liked everything about this book, except that for some parts where it tended to drag onward and left the readers confused in the path that is going to lead ahead. This frustrated me, but probably for most people made the book more exciting.I learned actually a lot from this book, in first learning about the Russian History before I read about it and then knowing that the animals were reflections of real people. I could actually feel and relate to how they must have felt during the time of dictatorship. If someone didn't understand clearly about this portion of Russian history they learned about, then Animal Farm was a good way to clear up any not knowing or mystification. I would surely recommend this book to anyone that likes books that relate to real life. There also was a bit of humor, and eye events that caught me tight into the book. If you do not like to relate things to real life, this definitely would not be a book for you to read because personally if you didn't like to relate to real life events you would be left in confusion of where the author was going with the book.This book was difficult to pick a favorite character because some characters were not explained well, or didn't have enough information to grasp about that character. Personally I feel my favorite character was Mollie the mare. She loves being pampered and groomed by the humans and didn't like the change of the new farm. On some aspects, but not all I am like Mollie. I don't like change what so ever and when I get used to something I have difficulty in liking the change. Another character that I liked was Snowball the pig because he shows many leadership qualities and knows when to take charge. My least favorite character was Napoleon since he was so power hungry. In life I dislike any person that is so power hungry that they don't care of aspects or other people beneath them, which shows they are not true heroes. Specifically, I had a clear understanding of the book, which didn't leave me with any questions what so ever on the novel. But, I would have had a difficulty understanding if I didn't comprehend the types of meanings George Orwell was trying to give to the book. I would without doubt read another book by George Orwell, if they had the same aspects of Animal Farm. I enjoyed reading the book, knowing and grasping the aspects of real life to the book. Books are your own opinion if you are going to like them or not, it all depends if you like how the author writes. The books I like mostly relate to reality, and as Oscar Wilde once said, \\"The books that the world calls immoral are the books that show the world its own shame.\\""},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm could quite possibly be one of the best satires ever written. Published in 1945, Orwell's purpose in writing this book was the abolition of totalitarianism. Through the use of allegories in his writing portraying a farm where the animals rebel, Orwell is able to make logical arguments against the political tyranny happening during his time in Russia. Orwell's work is a very exciting piece of literature. Orwell's genius was able to create a children's book that had a much deeper message than those common to children's books. Orwell uses action to keep his readers involved. Action is constantly happening throughout the book. Every page turn reveals an unexpected twist. Without the unexpected surprises, this book would not be the legend that it is today. My favorite character in Animal Farm is Boxer. Boxer, a horse on the farm, is a very interesting character. While not very smart, Boxer is the workhorse (no pun intended) of the operation. His motto, \\"I will work harder,\\" frequently inspires other animals to do their part in the operations of the farm. Boxer exhibits qualities that the other animals wish that they had. I also admire the effort and devotion that Boxer puts into his everyday tasks. I learned a lot from reading Animal Farm, especially about the history surrounding the rise of totalitarian governments. It is interesting to parallel the events that occur in the book with events that happened in the real world. From the Bolshevik Revolution to the exile of Trotsky, Orwell doesn't forget any events. The book is written very well and gives a very good lesson at the end. Orwell masterly weaves the book together in the last chapter when the animals realize that they can't tell the difference between their new rulers (the pigs) and their old ruler (Farmer Jones). They realize that they are not better off than they were before their revolution. There is only one question left in my mind. I wonder what happened to Snowball, the pig that represented Trotsky. Once he is exiled, Orwell never mentions his whereabouts definitely.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys stories with underlying morals. It is amazing how complexly Orwell was able to write this book. Readers will enjoy the parallels to historical events. I would recommend looking over the history of Communism before reading this book; then you will be able to appreciate the great thought that Orwell put into this book.Although I have not read any other books by Orwell, I would definitely not hesitate to read one. I have heard great reviews of his other books, and am convinced that he is a great author. Just after reading Animal Farm, I would recommend any Orwell books to anyone. Orwell spent much thought when writing this book; don't let this go to waste. Through satires like Orwell's, we may be able to prevent other mistakes from happening in the future. This book has influenced me in more than one way. Not only have I learned about totalitarianism, but now whenever I think about slacking off I remember the words of Boxer and think, \\"I will work harder.\\""},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm by George Orwell is a very entertaining, informative book that can be read quickly and accurately.There were many points throughout the book where different emotions could have been forced upon the reader. There were pointswhen I felt sad, such as when boxer was taken away to the horse slaughterer, shocked, when the animals were executed, andhappy for the animals after they had triumphed in chasing Jones from the farm. In the end, however, I felt dissappointed in theway one did not get to see the animals start another rebeliion against the new &quot;humans.&quot;Boxer was my favorite character in the book because of his optimistic attitude towards all elements of Animal farm. His hard-working attitude is something to be proud of, and is demonstrated through his motto, &quot;I will work harder.&quot;I enjoyed the overall plot line and particularly how simple it really was, in itself. However, when applied to Russian history it requiresa higher level of thinking. The ending did not give too much closure, but the book was written to show the cycle of totalitarianism, andgiving closure would signify that the cycle ends, which is not the case.By reading the book, it helped me to understand more fully the events in Russian history dealing with Stalin, Lenin, and Trotsky, inaddition to other elements of the situation.Although it is safe to assume that the animals begin another rebellion against the changed Napolean, it is not specified in the bookwhether they do so or not.I would recommend this book to a friend and I would like to read other books by this author because of his clean-cut, straight-forwardstyle, which is a welcome break from more complex books. It is also effective in illustrating not only the events in Russian history specifically, butalso the steps leading to totalitarianism.If you are reading this review and have not yet read Animal Farm, I urge you to stop reading reviews, go out and acquire a copy and startreading today."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"\\"Political language. . . is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.\\" This quote was spoken by George Orwell (Eric Blair) who was the author of the novel Animal Farm. Orwell always opposed the idea of both capitalism and communism. His distorted feelings showed throughout this novel by using characters such as Snowball and Napoleon to represent historic figures of Trotsky and Stalin.Throughout the novel, my feelings were torn on which character to side with. At the beginning, I felt a shot of sadness when Mr. Jones is unexpectedly forced away from his house. He and his family are corrupted by those that he thought he could trust. However, soon my emotions sided with Snowball. Snowball felt that all animals were equal and wanted the farm to prosper. However, Napoleon was more concerned with himself and taking the authority from Snowball. I felt anger towards Napoleon and his selfish power struggle with Snowball. He disregarded any of Snowball's accomplishments in order to raise his own ego. For example, after Snowball is removed from the farm, Napoleon produces Snowballs idea of a windmill as his own. Near the end of the novel, I resented that the other farm animals did not stand up to Napoleon after his power hungry acts. The fear that these animals held, due to Napoleons zero tolerance of being challenged, was horrific. As one can see, feelings of anger, sorrow, and trust were all obtained when reading this novel.My favorite character in the novel was Benjamin. An old, cold-hearted donkey that was quiet yet very intelligent. He was able to see the changes in the pigs and how the rebellion against humans was failing. He is able to comprehend the power struggle between Napoleon and Snowball and see the unpleasantness of life that was to be in the future. Benjamin's stubbornness and intelligence to be persuaded to enjoy life under Napoleon made him my favorite character.The best part of the book was the commandments. I thought that the making of commandments served as the grounding for the book. I found it interesting how Napoleon was able to slip through the loop holes of the commandments in order to do what he pleased. The fact that the animals did not oppose Napoleon, even though they had a distinct feeling that he had rearranged them, was unusual. The commandments showed that many power-hungry leaders will change policies and regulations in order to better receive what they want.Conversely, my least favorite part of the book was the absent-minded animals, who did not assume responsibility for overthrowing their leader. Even after dreading each day's heavy workload and receiving a meager amount of food, the animals did not question the actions of their leader. The killing of fellow animals, sleeping in a warm house, and trading with humans did not even send a slight occurrence of rebellion. If I was one of the animals, I would have tried to overthrow Napoleon, in order to receive a better life for all.I thought that George Orwell did a fantastic job at writing Animal Farm. Considering the time period it was written, it took a lot of courage to write such a contrasting novel. His ideas on what world would be like without capitalism was very impressive. I enjoyed how Orwell wrote about his feelings towards the world he lived in and how it could be improved.From reading this book I learned many things. I never knew of the contrasting leader, Trotsky and Stalin. This novel taught me many things such as the Bolshevik revolution and the overthrow of Czar Nicholas. Without reading this novel, I would not know of the past Russian history.The ending of the book caused a slight disappointment. Orwell's ending seemed to argue that life will never be better than what it is. He writes that the pigs are the same as the cruel human farmers. The frustration that life and government will never become great is a sheer lack of trust of better tomorrow. Although this book is well written, the ending is slightly pessimistic.Animal Farm was an easy read that was not very confusing. The only trouble a reader may have is relating this novel to Russian history. However, even by having a brief background of the revolution, this novel is straightforward and uncomplicated.I would certainly recommend this book to a friend. It fairy-tale imagination of pigs running a farm was funny and intriguing. The humor and information in this novel was what made it interesting to read. I believe that no matter the gender, students and adults would enjoy this novel.Later I would like to read another novel by George Orwell. His humorous content and informative writing caused me to strive to finish the novel. I thought this novel was very well written in the fact that it was very organized. I could easily read Animal Farm without being confuse. If Orwell's other novel is like this one, I would definitely read it.Orwell portrays in this novel, that although Napoleon and the other pigs start out with good intentions, they soon change. The existence of power can cause people to hurt others in order to gain it. Power can corrupt anyone into doing wrong at any moment of time. As George Orwell once said, \\"On the whole human beings want to be good, but not too good and not quite all the time.\\""},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"A short novel of only 130 page, Animal Farm is not a difficult book to read. George Orwell was well-known for ANIMAL FARM and 1984. The book is very symbolic. You find the revolution of the animals on Manor Farm is a symbol of the Russian Revolution. The book is an example of an allegory and a satire. The book has memorable characters- Boxer the hard working horse symbolizing the Russian people, Napolean the cruel and manipulating leader symbolizing Stalin, Snowball the ambitious and outspoken pig symbolizing Trotsky, and the idealitic Old Major symbolizing Marx.This book is a classic work of literature and is an excellent short novel to read. George Orwell wrote this novel meticulously and put in it criticism and a great deal of thought. A clever book, and a great read. I strongly reccomend it."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm was an intresting book about how animals take over the humans and run them off of their farm. Even though the book refers to animals, it is very ture about our human nature and how we like to take over and control things. The book was written after World War Two it is very ture in today's world."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I decided to read this book when I found it in a book that lists literature classics. When I told my parents to buy it for me, I was surprised to see how short it was. I finished it in only two days Some argue that the book ends with pessimistic view. I say who cares? George Orwell was writing about how he feels about things in his time and decided to write this book based on that. It talks about how people take advantage of thier power (in this case the pigs). It's a short book that wont leave you unsatisfied and is kind of a moral type story. Now go read the book."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"It's interesting that this is thought to be a child's book, as the themes are so adult. The first time I read this, I was about 13 years old. Fifteen years later, as I look at this with a fresh eye, it's amazing how much better the book has gotten with time.Orwell covered some things that have been talked about at great length by other authors (people that you've never even thought of, such as F.A.Hayek) in a way that was understandable and mercifully concise. In another way, the book also predicted a lot of things that materialized in later regimes. I don't know if Orwell's conclusions were based on writings/ observations of what happened in the Bolshevik Revolution or if they correctly predicted what would later happen. If it's the latter, then the book should've gotten a Nobel Prize.All of the metaphors are good and clear, and some of the better ones are:1. Public works projects funded by the state. The windmill was something that was touted as the end-all and be-all and great pains were sacrificed to achieve it. This sounds familiar to public works projects that have taken place in the Soviet Union and China over the last 2,000 years (Great Wall, anyone?)2. The effortless separation of meaning and words of leaders who have emerged from the forefront of varied revolutions. And how this is achieved by the propaganda department of varied government arms. (Squealer).3. The way that revolutions tend to lose their momentum over time and need periodic refreshers to keep the people inflamed, and therefore in need of a leader. (I doubt that the President of Iran has anything against Jews personally, but he needs some type of rallying point to keep the Islamic Revolution fresh-- it is about 27 years old at the time of this review.)4. The spread of constant misinformation by actually creating false numbers consistent with the vision of the leadership. This is exactly what happened during the Great Famine in China nearly ten years after the publication of this book.(Can you guess who I'm talking about when I say 8-9% growth every year, come rain or shine?)5. The need of some people to have some Great Force to tell them what to do is something that happens in real life in places to numerous to mention and their willingness to repeat meaningless slogans. (World Trade protesters starting to look like the sheep, anyone?)6. The intellectual component of state-controlled governments. There was a lot of argument between warring camps over very abstract ideas that were not necessarily based on having observed something real. (Snowball and Napoleon). Later regimes have turned much more destructively into camps of sheep warring over the intellectual ideas of pigs. (Trotskyites and Pure Communists. Liberal and Conservatives)"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"If you want to sit around and drink strong coffee and talk about different forms of government with your compatriots, then you simply have got to read this book."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"In Animal Farm, Orwell applies personification throughout the entire novella and shows the idea of Utopia. The animals aspire after a perfect farm where they could rule themselves and their work would be guerdoned rather than be given more tasks. The perfect farm is a flawless society where everyone is joyful and cooperated. Orwell ingeniously contextualizes the twice conversion of Manor Farm to imply the inauguration of Animal Farm and its downfall. Manor Farm was managed by Mr. Jones, who is a drunkard. Animals endure in an extremely terrible condition. Old Major, as the sainted initiator, deems that the farm without human is the solution of all the problems. He assembles the animals and tells them, \\"All the habits of Man are evil\\", such as living in a house, sleeping in a bed, drinking alcohol, smoking tobacco, touching money and engaging in trade. Then, they're getting preparation for the rebellion. However, the rebellion comes much earlier than they've ever expected. With desperation of Mr. Jones' deviltry, the animals can't suffer from the hunger of scarce of food and indignation of Mr. Jones' inhumanity any more. Eventually, they succeed and they are about to build a Utopia among the animals. Regrettably, the Mollie, who is a mare, defies working so hard and becomes the first one to leave the farm because she can't adapt the life style of Utopia. \\"Mollie...was no good at getting up in the mornings, and had a way of leaving work early on the ground that there was a stone in her hoof.\\" Mollie is still concerned about the luxuries like eating sugar and wearing ribbons. However, she's told that the luxuries are the symbol of slave and are abolished in the Utopia. With disappointment of the new Utopia and the beguiling of sugar, Mollie finally leaves from the farm. This incident illustrates that Utopia is not as perfect as it seems, the system of Utopia is not able to please everyone such as Mollie. Similarly, the cat is not willing to volunteer, \\"when there was work to be done the cat cold never be found\\". The cat tries to goldbrick and when she's found she always has excellent excuses because she thinks she's never starved in the Utopia. Thus, this Utopia, which is in an effort of being perfect, results in the indolence of those like the cat, who never pains but wants to gain. It's the corruption of the Utopia since either human or animal, has an instinct of selfishness. In some extent, beings usually may need some impetus to contribute.In Animal Farm, the pigs, who are considered as the cleverest animal in the farm, particularly Napoleon, who represents a totalitarian, has strong leadership, but he goes to depravity because of abusing power. At the very beginning of the story, Napoleon claims that the animals should not have maintained any habit of human and constitutes Seven Commandments to unify the Animal Form. However, it doesn't last for a long time, there's some discontent within the farm since the pigs drink milk and eat apple, which other animals can't regale on. The more ridiculousness is the pigs' chicanery, which they assert \\"We are brainworkers. The whole management and organization of this farm depend on us\\". What they explain seems to drop a hint of their superiority, which is the violation of Utopia, among the animals. Moreover, they profess that they dislike the milk and apples, as other animals do, but they drink milk and eat apples because they preserve on their health, and \\"Milk and apples (this has been proved by Scientist,) contain substance absolutely necessary of well-being to a pig\\". From here, we could have an insight that the pigs like other beings, have instinct of selfishness, and when might is seized in one's hand, the Utopia must go to its perdition, instead of the rebirth of Totalitarianism. By bloting out the scandal of incident, the pig Squealer, who's the propagator of Napoleon, threatens the other animals with some deceit since Squealer learns the vulnerability of the other animals that they're afraid of the returning of Mr. Jones."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"ANIMAL FARMGeorge Orwell nothing on a farm is what you think it is.Animal farm is a good book.

This book is really for grown-ups telling satiric fables ever penned. It records the evolution from the revolution. Against tyranny to a totalitarianism just as terrible. A pig named napoleon try's to talk to his friends because he had a dream about the farmer having a dream that he was going to try to talk to the other animals. When he found out, he was asked to gather the other animals on the farm to tell them about it. Therefore, the two dogs on the farm gather every body to talk. In the middle of the book the pig, the cat and the two dogs try to save the farm from the farmer. In the end, the two dogs stop the farmer from trying to talk to the other animals.Some reasons I like this book is because it is a good book for young adults, it is humorous, and very funny. Some reasons I don't like the book is because it was in small print and on the back, it says for adults. Also in the end, they could have put it a little different.

I think that this is a good book because it has so many hidden meanings. It is interesting how the author, George Orwell, used the book as a clever allergory on the Russian revolution.

I read that Orwell himself was a socialist so I believe his intent was to confine the story to just Stalin. However, I interpreted the story as a condemnation of all socialism.

I'm sure I wouldn't learnt about it in high school, but that was a long time ago and I've long since forgotten. Therefore, I started reading the Preface, but since it was pretty meaningless to me (and such things tend to bore me to tears), I skipped to Chapter 1.This book blew... my... mind! I'm struggling to come up with things to say about it that wouldn't give too much away for the few people who haven't read it yet. It really doesn't take any understanding of the historical events to understand what this book is about.It's extremely easy to read and quite short. It truly ropes you into the lives, hopes and dreams of the characters in a way that few other books have.It conjured up thoughts in my mind of people like Saddam Hussein and Robert Mugabe, both freedom fighters and struggle heroes of their own time. It shows that a socialist state will never work because of the simple human flaw: Power corrupts. It shows that the vast majority don't actually want freedom, don't know how to be free, and quite possibly don't understand what freedom actually is. People need to be led, and that those leaders will always take advantage of that.I'm glad that people (and really, there were around four or five people that simultaneous suggested I read this book... and then I started seeing it everywhere on Goodreads) finally convinced me to read this book.

It is a satirical fable that uses the story of animals rebelling on a farm to tell a version of the Russian Revolution and the rise of Joseph Stalin. Most of the major characters are loosely based on real life people. Major, the boar who dreams of a farm run by animals, is inspired by Lenin. After his death, Snowball (based on Trotsky) and Napoleon (based on Stalin) take over command of the animals and lead a rebellion against the farmer. The animals are collectively in charge of the farm in a form of communism (referred to as \\"Animalism\\"). Eventually Napoleon plots to oust Snowball, and then gradually erodes the rights of the animals to assume a position of dictatorship, paying only the merest of lip service to the origin tenets of the rebellion.This is a very short novel (the version I read had fewer than 100 pages although this varies depending on the typeface), which takes only a couple of hours to read. It skips along in a highly readable fashion and is amusing in parts, but at the same time it's also moving and thought provoking.

The pigs, by force of their army of dogs, use their positions to turn their rule over the other animals into a Stalin-like dictatorship.This book points out the dangers of a system of government (socialism in this case) that is supposed to be great for all &quot;comrades&quot; but inevitably can turn horribly wrong by the corruption of the leaders.I recommend this book for anyone who is interested in politics (it may make you question your own political leadership), the study of people in other positions of power or anyone who wants to read good literature in general."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This book by George Orwell is about a farm (Manor Farm) where a revolution takes place, but a very DIFFERENT kind of revolution.

Old Major, the oldest boar on the farm, inspired them with a song and a speech about how everything should be blamed on men. Then he dies, leaving Napoleon and Snowball, two young boars, in the position of power. They revolt, due to Farmer Jones not feeding them, and invent a new system of government where all animals are equal, everyone can get an education, and everyone works for the common good.Snowball and Napoleon are in conflict all the time, though, and Snowball gets run off while the animals are voting on whther to build a windmill or not. Napoleon and Squealer, his propaganda minister, slowly and steadily convince the animals that Snowball is a terrible, terrible pig and very cowardly, even though he was the best of the two, and all the animals that object are murdered. Napoleon makes deals with humans, but he gets cheated by one of the humans.At the end, all the pigs, who had moved up to a position of power, and all the humans, who had debased themselves, all looked and acted exactly the same. The pigs even dressed up in people-clothes and paraded around on their hind legs.The purpose of this book is to tell of the evils of Communism; it usually starts out okay, but eventually ends up in totalitarianism. (I did a book study on this). Old Major represents Karl Marx, Napoleon represents Stalin, Snowball=Lenin, and Farmer Jones the czar of Russia. When this book was published, people thought that it was ridiculous, but then when they figured out that it was about the Russian Revolution, everyone realized exactly how brilliant it really was. If you're interested in history or classics, I really recommend this."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm: A Fairy StoryTracy ByrneGeorge Orwell called Animal Farm a fairy story, and it can be enjoyed simply as a tale about how animals try to take over a farm from men, and find they cannot manage it. Many children read it this way, siding with the animals against the farmer, saddened when things go wrong because of the nasty pigs, and weeping at the fate of Boxer. But the tale was devised as a satire on the Soviet Union, and although the country no longer exists, the influence it exerted on our ways of living and thinking certainly stayed with us and probably will for many years.Although Animal Farm was a satire on the Russian Revolution, it was also intended to have a wider application. That kind of revolution as Orwell defined as \\"violent conspiratorial revolution, led by unconsciously power-hungry people\\", could only lead to a change of masters. He went on: \\"I meant the moral to be that revolutions only effect a radical improvement when the masses are alert and know how to chuck out their leaders as soon as the latter have done their job\\" (Orwell xl).Animal Farm is an accurate portrayal of the Russian Revolution and is probably one of the best novels ever written. All of the characters represented a figure from the revolution. Old Major is Marx, Boxer and Clover represent the proletariat, Napoleon is Stalin, Snowball for Leon Trotsky, Farmer Frederick is Hitler Germany, etc. Even the windmill and the farmhouse represent something from the revolution. Mr. Jones' house becomes the Kremlin and the building of the windmill corresponds to Stalin's variousPage 1Page 2plans for rapid industrialization.Orwell succeeds in conveying the right message, not just about the Russian Revolution, but of any revolution; there is always going to be a person or persons that take advantage of their power and of the people that believe in them. Most of the time when there is a new leader that person wants to help the people, but as time goes on they get greedy and power hungry and could care less about the people. At the beginning of the novel one of the animals commandments were \\"All Animals are Equal\\" (Orwell 16). They all did the same amount of work, received the same amount of food, etc. Then the pigs decided that because they were smarter they should receive more food, do less work, etc. Soon enough the pigs were living in Mr. Jones' house, drinking alcohol, wearing clothes, while all the other animals were made to do all the work. By the end of the novel the commandment stated \\"All Animals are Equal but Some Animals are More Equal Than Others\\" (88). This is true with most governments. The leaders make the people believe that they are just like them, but in reality the leaders sit their in their big comfy chairs reaping all of the benefits, while the working class is doing all of the dirty work and getting the butt end of the deal.In conclusion, Animal Farm is a novel of importance. It is a classic that will be read for decades more to come. One reason for its mass appeal is the classic simplicity of its language and style. The vocabulary is ordinary and commonplace without being so basic and limited as to be interesting only to children. Another important quality is its imaginative power. Anything can be done with a little bit of will. If the animals could overthrow humans, I'm sure humans could overthrow a government. But it also has aPage 3pessimistic quality. The animals give up so quickly and refuse to put up a fight against the pigs. They are so ready to accept it, which is what we humans do with ourgovernment. I think Orwell was not just writing a novel about the Russian Revolution or revolutions in general, but a book about human nature."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Those who know the story of Animal Farm will need no recap of the plot details, so I will stick to the additions of this particular edition instead. There are other reviews that do well to document the genius of the story. I first read this in grade school, but had no idea about the political and historical context of the tale. The first reason this edition shines is that you get Orwell's original preface to the Ukrainian edition. Ukraine was a direct victim of Bolshevik policies under Stalin, and throughout the famine that occurred there due to Stalin's collectivization started in 1929 and carried out through 1932-33 at least 6 million lost their lives, while others were displaced and scattered across the world. Orwell basically says that the book is for them more so than anyone, although he chooses his words carefully. Another reason why this edition shines is Ralph Steadman's art. He is well known to many, but most will know him through his work on Hunter S. Thompson's books. The book is also printed in hardcover and has weight, unlike the paperback edition. It is a great edition to add to a collector's library, and it cannot hurt anyone to read this amazing piece of literature more than once in their lives. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm witten by George Orwell is a very good book. The way that Orwell wrote this book makes it feel as if your a part of it. The deceitful ways of Napolean and the pigs almost pisses you off as if you are being deceived. Orwell's view of communisim in Russia is one that must be respected.I would reccomend this book to anyone that is intersted in history and/or government. As well as to anyone that enjoyed Orwell's book 1984. Which was another genius peice that he has written.The way Orwell showed how the pigs changed all of their commandments and then fooled the other animals into thinking that they are too stupid to remember what the commandment actually said was genius. As well the pigs convincing the other animals that everything they are doing is for the benefit of the public. Orwell really reflected the way things were with communisim in Russia, he criticized it pretty accuratley.He exposed it's flaws, how better could it have been done than the line saying that &quot;all animals are equall but some are more equal than others&quot;Once again I feel it is an important book to read. It is always good to hear others views and this a good chance to be able to do that, while reading an entertaining story as well."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"\\"All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.\\" That is the theme throughout Animal Farm. The book Animal Farm, written by George Orwell, entertained me throughout its entirety; because of the straightforward writing style and the way he compared totalitarianism to a group of farm animals. My favorite character in the book was Napoleon. He was the leader of all the animals on the farm, because he was the smartest and most manipulative. He had the ability to make people do what he wanted them to do regardless of whether or not they wanted to do it. The character that I disliked the most was Boxer. Boxer took everything at face value and was extremely gullible.The thing that I liked most about the book is the simplicity of the book and straight forwardness of the book. The author did an excellent job in writing the book by making it simple and to the point. From the book I learned how easy it was for Stalin to manipulate people and keep them on the side of communism. The one thing that I did not like about the book was that you don't find out what happened to the farm and the animals at the end of the book.Animal Farm is a book that I would recommend to a friend because it is an easy read and once I picked it up I could not put it down. I would read other book by George Orwell because of how much I liked Animal Farm. Animal Farm is an excellent book, written with great description. \\"The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but it was impossible to say which was which.\\" This book is truly a great read."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"It is a misrepresentation that &quot;Animal Farm&quot; is anti-communist. It certainly is anti-stalinist, but it is as much anti-capitalist. It is written from a historical perspective of a trotskyite and even uses common trotskyite terminology, in many cases (representation of Stalin as Napoloen is a very common analogy in Trotsky's works who likened Stalin's usurpation of power to that of Napoleon more than 100 years earlier). The story is not much more than a fable version of Trotsky's &quot;Revolution Betrayed&quot;Also, there are not a lot of meanings to the book. The story line is simple and very predictible, if you know Russian/Soviet history of 1917-1943.The events in the book almost have one-to-one correspondence to what really happened to Russia. Under the leadership of the bolshevik party(pigs) animals(people) depose capitalists (Mr. Jones) and establish the first ever worker's demoracy (Animals' Farm). Then, the deposed leaders attempt to gain the power back by getting capitalist countries - England and France, among others- to invade the newly found Russian Soviet Republic (&quot;Jones and all his men, with half a dozen others from Foxwood and Pinch-field&quot; invade the Animal Farm). However Trotsky/Snowball proves to be very able as Comissar of War and saves the newly found regime. In the impending power struggle Trotsky loses out to Stalin(Napoleon), who goes on to slowly get rid of all the principles on which the USSR (Animal Farm) was founded on.Even the personal characteristics of the two main bolshevik leaders are very accurate, albeit allegoric - &quot;Napoleon was a large, rather fierce-looking Berkshire boar, the only Berkshire on the farm, not much of a talker but with a reputation for getting his own way.&quot; Stalin was not a good speaker, but had a strong will, and the Bershire is definitely a reference to Stalin's Geogrian Background - he was the only bolshevik leader from Georgia and spoke Russian with heavy accent. Trotsky on the other hand, was the greatest speaker of the Russian Revolution, a brilliant writer, but wasn't suited for intraparty struggles. (&quot;Snowball was a more vivacious pig than Napoleon, quicker in speech and more inventive, but was not considered to have the same depth of character.&quot;) Orwell also doesnt forget to mention Stalin's ability to amass support behind the scenes - &quot;At the Meetings Snowball often won over the majority by his brilliant speeches, but Napoleon was better at canvassing support for himself in between times.&quot;Orwell describes the events quite meticulously - intraparty struggles, usurpation of power by Napoleon/Stalin, stalinist vilification of Trotsky/Snowball, falsification of history to suit Stalin's goals and to downplay Trotsky's role in defence of the revolution during the Civil War and the Intervention, industrialization (the building of the Windmill), the betrayal of the revolution's ideals, the purges and the stalinist terror by the Stalin's secret police (Napoleon's dogs)- all of them are described and are easily recognizable.The book ends with Napoleon being involved in a dialogue with with humans from the neighbor farms - Mr Pilkington (Churchill) and others. This is probably a reference to the Yalta conference, where Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt forgot their differences and divided spheres of influence. &quot;The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again: but already it was impossible to say which was which&quot;. Stalin, a representative of a country that was supposed to have a higher form of government than capitalist democracy is a tyrant, just like leaders of capitalist countries; and for Orwell the only positive (and tragic) character in the book is Snowball/Trotsky."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Stubborn obedience to a failed system and to individuals within the system who will quickly turn on their subordinates is clearly portrayed in this classic book which uses an animal farm to describe the mindset of Communist thinking. This book is not difficult to read and even though Soviet Communism is not the threat it was at the time this book came out, as a historical work this book remains a worthwhile read. In fact, this book helps show how such a dysfunctional system was destined to fail! It is to Orwell's credit that he is able to evoke such empathy from his readers for farm animals. He succeeds in doing so. Sometimes an anology can highlight truths that a straightforward journalistic approach cannot. This is an interesting little book that will not require much time commitment to complete."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Good book.

The animals living there inspired by the ideas of an old pig (Carl Marx) revolt against Mr. Jones who owns the farm (Nicholas II and his supporters). As soon as Mr. Jones runs away the farm is renamed from Manor farm to Animal farm (Russia-USSR) and the seven commandments are set up, which should keep the animals free and equal between each other, but as you can guess the novel doesn't end like this \\"...and they lived happily ever after.\\" In fact the end is very pessimistic (as to the existence of communism in the near future).This book shows us that no matter how good the original ideas are (Marx's ideas for example) for the governing of society, leaders always get corrupted if too much power is given to them (Stalin). In my opinion Communism came into this world too early and in the wrong place (Russia in 1900 was certainly not ready for Communism and I think that no country in the next 5 or 6 centauries years will be ready for any of the forms of communism). For instance what would happen if you turned Medieval-feudal England into a democratic country? Nothing would work this regime would be overthrown and there some King on the throne again who return feudalism, same thing with communism. \\"Animal Farm\\" shows us that pure communism is impossible and that it has to be heavily \`mixed' with capitalism. Thus creating a mixed governing system like the NEP in 1920s USSR (It wasn't called USSR in those times).The novel might also be interesting to children (8+) even though ending will disappoint them and they won't understand the story behind the book. The only thing that I didn't like about this book that it was a bit short (97 pages and the font is quite big). But I still think that this is a superb book but it would be even more outstanding if Orwell would have made it a bit longer.I would give it 4.5 stars if I could!"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"The book is well written and I like it. But I think that not everyone will like the book-it is more about people having a revolution and people gaining power than about animals living on a farm.

If nothing else, 'All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others' will live forever. The later '1984' tackled a similar theme in a bleaker, more monotonous manner, and seems to lack the sense of disgust that permeates 'Animal Farm'.Despite being a 'classic', with all that entails, it's actually quite short, to-the-point, blackly comic, and written in a clear, crisp style that makes you wish all political allegory was so easily-approachable. A generation of schoolchildren were probably put off this book by school (for a time it was a popular, slightly-controversial choice amongst English teachers), and traumatised by the sad fate of Boxer, the horse.There was an aminated film, too - equally effective, it stuck faithfully to the novel, with the addition of a more optimistic ending, one which seemed to mirror the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This book is excellent and was very well written.

He published this short political satire in the mid-1940s and it was required reading for many students when I was in high school in the early 1960s. I even discovered that it was required reading for eighth graders in one of the local schools just this last year. It is still having an impact. This classic fable of animals who take over a farm is a satire of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution and of Communist rule in the Soviet Union. Since the U.S.S.R. has now broken up, one might feel that this book is now outdated. However, I think that is far from the case. First of all, the book is a part of history. The satire has had an influence on the world's perception of this form of government (and on any form of totalitarianism). Thus, in a way, the novel has played a role, perhaps minor, in the ultimate fate of the Soviet Union. In addition, I find many instances in politics, in other totalitarian governments, and even in personal interactions in business and in academia that can be perceived in a new light through this fable. In the tale, the animals on Mr. Jones's farm revolt and oust their human master. In the beginning, all the animals have a deep revolutionary zeal and all attempt to work for the common good. A list of Commandments is formulated that all are to follow. But, the pigs, led by a pig named Napoleon, begin to take over the leadership and begin to edit the Commandments for their. They subvert the Revolution for their own ends and for the sake of power. A new tyranny has replaced the old. The downtrodden remain the downtrodden. The pig Napoleon represents the ruthless Stalin and the idealistic Snowball represents Trotsky. The doomed horse Boxer represents the characteristics of the common man. But, as mentioned above, the book brings up issues that go far beyond that of the 1917 revolution. Perhaps the most famous line is &quot;All the animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.&quot; An earlier reviewer gave the book only a single star, using this line as an example of how the book was so &quot;dumb&quot; since how could things be more equal than others. Of course, that was Orwell's point but it seems to still elude some of our young critics. This is a book that everyone should read and it is incumbent that teachers get some of Orwell's points across. There are some reviewers who gave the book a single star simply because it wasn't realistic in that Orwell used animals as characters. It is as if these students had never heard of satire, imagery, allegory, or metaphor.

The animals and the farm duties are neglected and the animal are fled up with Farmer Jones. lead by a prize pig Major the animals decide to revelt. The aminals take over the farm and run the farm for thenselves when doing this they change the name to Animal Farm and then they were completely in charge. later the story of the animals break the rule and make their own rules for life on the farm. This only leads to problems with the different operation of the farm.This story is told in a simple strahtfoward style. Also this story is fictitious story that is a fable. This means that is usually has a moral and animals act like humans. Orwell did a excellent job of making these animals look like humans. An example of this is how the dogs still bite and growl and the still support Napoleon's drive for political power. Another example is how the pigs eat mash and they also drink whiskey. Also how they walk on two legs by the end of the story. For me, the moral of this story was reveled in the last lines of the story. &quot;Twelve voices were shouting in anger, and they were all alike. No question, now what had happened to the faces of the pigs. The creature outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again, but already it was imposible to say which was which&quot;(p.p,139).

In Cuba they committed the same mistakes and some new ones. Then I realize this where not mistakes. Given the same rules you always end up with the same result is like a mathematic theorem deduced from the axioms.Cuba is not the Soviet Union but their communism inherited all the same defects.

But as with the real Soviet Union, the leadership begins to become corrupt, conditions deteriorate, and freedoms slowly slip away. By the time anyone outside the leadership realizes what is happening, it may be too late.This interesting and easy to read book provides fascinating political commentary on Orwell's time-period and the failures of communism (specifically the USSR). The reader's ability to see where things are going and the ability to spot the parallels of the characters from the novel in history only enhances the book and George Orwell gets his point across without mentioning the Soviet Union, its leaders, or communism even once. His warnings on the dangers of any form of totalitarianism show through in his writing, and this book almost reads like 1984 (another Orwell classic) in parts.Those who read this looking for a happy fairy tale where a bunch of talking animals live in an utopia of their making will probably not be satisfied, nor will the story be rewarding if the reader ignores the historical context of the novel.

Rather, it is a story about controlling the means of production. Throughout, the reader is reminded that the animals were never better off then when the means of production were socially owned and distribution of duty and goods was decided upon &quot;democratically.&quot;I do not believe that Orwell understood why a socialist state must inevitably fall to dictatorship - had he made that clear, then the story would earn four stars.

He ends up basically turning into a human and things end up just as they use to be with a human master.I think that the real turning point is when Snowball is kicked out. He was much more loyal to the animals than Napoleon ever was.Snowball would have kept things not only prosperous, but content. The animals would have been much more happy with Snowball. Napoleon takes advantage of hispower and uses it against his fellow animals.George Orwell is an incredible writer. He has an amazing imagination. Just how everything ran together was great. He made sure that there were plenty of turning points and chapters to keep you reading. His idea of animals ruling anything over a human was brought out to be the best. He did an excellent job choosing characters and making them out to be so different from one another. Each personality foreshadowed their future. I also like how he made the ending a little depressing but realistic.I would definitely recommend this book to just about anyone who can read. It's agreat book for kids, teenagers, and adults. It really expands your mind on the possibilities of an animal's world. This is the most imaginative book I might ever read. I had no idea it would be such a page-turner. Every animal's personality interacted with another's and that's what made it so interesting. I give it a 10/10."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"My book is Animal Farm by George Orwell. It was 140 pages long. It was about farm animals that want to have freedom, so they overthrow the alcoholic farmer and the pigs become the leaders. Even though the animals again become slaves to the ruling pigs, they are under the illusion that they're better off then they were before. The use of the animals is a creative way to tell about the time of communism in Russia. I liked it because it was alot funner to read and more interesting than a textbook. I would recommend this book to anyone, and it was probably intended for high school age and up."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm by George Orwell was on a highly controversial subject when it was published in 1945. The book itself is a metaphor to the communist regime in Russia. For example the pigs are the communist leaders, the dogs are the secret police, and the other animals are the peasants just trying to survive another day.I liked this book because of the author's ability to show the themes without much in-between the lines reading. Plus, the metaphors are obvious and exaggerated. For example, one of the themes in this book was that people can and will go to any means to seize and maintain power. Orwell shows, Napoleon, a pig resembling Stalin, takes new born puppies with him to the attic of the barn for several months where he gains their trust and teaches them that he is always good and Snowball, Napoleon's brother, is bad. Once Napoleon had trained the puppies he had them go out and exile Snowball, and when four pigs protested that Napoleon had no right to do that he quickly ordered his dogs to silence them. Once that had been taken care of some animals confessed to seeing Snowball in a dream, he put them to the same punishment as the four pigs. At some points the food in the farm was so scarce that Napoleon had the animals on quarter rations and himself on obesity rations, the reason he did this was to brag to other farmers how much better off his farm was than any human's.In my opinion this was a great book about how communism is another totalitarian government because people can and will go to any means to seize and maintain power. I give George Orwell a lot of credit for writing this book criticizing our former World War II allies at the time he did."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"My class read it in class together and i personally thought it was a good book and would like to read it a second time.My class is making a summary book on Animal Farm because ny techer loves the book!Animal Farm is a book about andimals that represents the cruelty during the Russian Revolution.Each animal in the book stands for a person who played a role in the Russian Revolution.The pigs,the leaders, are taking over and it is the same as when Mr.Jones was there they'll find out.I also reccomend the move Animal Farm.It has alot a differences from the book but is a good movie."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I read this book as a class assignment and found it to be a thoroughly engrossing and thought-provoking read. It is very short, but at the same time very satisfying.

The only point to find fault with is the book's disturbing qualities, with battle scenes and executed (innocent) animals. In conclusion, this is an excellent book that I recommend for all ages."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal FarmThe Shroud for Deeper MeaningAnimal Farm, as any educated reader could understand, is a novel about communism and the inherent problems that many communist governments face. George Orwell used his allegory of the Soviet Union to create a novel that addresses issues like hypocrisy, abuse of power, freedom, and betrayal.In order to understand the content of Animal Farm the reader must understand the context in which Orwell wrote it. Orwell began writing Animal Farm in 1943 in London England. At this point, World War II was well underway and the Soviet Union was effectively holding the lines against the German army. Orwell, an active anti-socialist decided to write Animal Farm in order to voice his opinion on socialism and perhaps prevent the people of London from accepting the Communist values of the Soviet Union. Unfortunately for Orwell, when he tried to get his book published in 1945, it was turned down because the English attitude towards the Soviets was that \\"hey, they're helping us win the war\\". However in 1946 the war was over and slowly the public was beginning to see the deficiencies in the Soviet Union and Animal Farm was picked up by Harcourt Brace& Company.Although the Soviet Union was largely established on principles that would benefit the common man, Orwell showed through Animal Farm that the principles of a communist government were not necessarily admirable. The infamous \\"All animals are equal but some are more equal than others\\"(92) quote shows how Orwell used Animal Farm to convey deeper meaning than just having the novel be a pointless allegory about the Soviet Union. By having the government in Animal farm be ruled by poor, fat leaders who's only asset is that they're incredibly persuasive, Orwell was able to show how easily power can be abused.Animal Farm very effectively achieves its goal of outlining the deficiencies of Communist government. Animal Farm suggests that that although initial reasoning can be good faithed, safeguards must be in place to prohibit leaders from becoming over powerful persuasive hypocrites. Orwell effectively used Napoleon and all his underlings as tools for his abuse. With Squealer who constantly \\"spoke so persuasively\\"(42) with \\"the three dogs who happened to be with him\\"(42) that \\"growled so threateningly ... they accepted his explanations without further questions.\\"(42) Napoleon was able to manipulate his way into becoming an over powerful persuasive hypocrite who, at the end of the story where \\"the creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.\\" (97)Animal Farm comes full circle when Napoleon comes out of the farmhouse \\"majestically upright, casting haughty glances from side to side\\"(91) with a \\"whip in his trotter\\"(91) and the lambs shout \\"Four legs good, two legs better!\\" (91) At that point the very basis of animalism has been demolished and Orwell effectively proved that although a communist government can be founded on good ideals, ultimately the power instilled on a single person will corrupt and those ideals will ultimately be lost."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Once you start reading Animal Farm you'll never want to put this book down.

The author, born in India of English parents, was a socialist and wrote this profound piece of political satire with the aim of destroying the Soviet myth. George Orwell wanted to show that the Soviets were using the rhetoric of socialism to veil their vicious statism and that the Soviets were not at all socialist, despite their claims that they were. One senses that if Orwell were alive today, he would write an Animal Farm that could strip away the myth from Tony Blair and George Bush doing war in the name of freedom when they are actually waging state terrorism and killing tens of thousands of civilians. Cutting through what Orwell would later term \\"Doublespeak\\" in another book (1984) is Orwell's aim.The tale begins by introducing old Major, a talking boar who describes the horrible conditions all animals live under at Manor Farm. Major dreams of a socialist-type revolution where the \\"Man\\" can be overthrown by the animals: \\"Only get rid of Man\\" and everything would be peaceful for the animals. Major dies but the other animals are left inspired.Their opportunity arises when the Man goes on a drinking binge and neglects the feeding of the farm animals. Starving, they must act and action is inspired by a combination of remembrance of Major and of dire straits; the animals take over the farm. Manor Farm is renamed Animal Farm. So far this is an allegorical retelling of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia when the starving peasants took control of the state from the decadent ruling class. The remaining events in the story mirror events that actually happened in Russia under Soviet rule. In the end, the pigs are no different from the Man.Historically, this has been the fate of all revolutions. Crafty word-pushers see that seizing control of the state is a valuable prize because it results in a cudgel beneficial to whoever wields it to the detriment of those it is wielded against.I miss Orwell. I wish he were around today to write about the British sleeper cell in Washington, District of Criminals that has gotten us Yanks to provide the brawn to British empire in all those quagmires created by the British - Afghanistan, Iraq, Sudan, etc. The Anglo-American wordpushers are creating a world as oppressive as Adolf Hitler's with no end to deaths and destruction being visited upon innocent peoples whose misfortune is to live atop oil fields."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm is an excellent literary analogy of human nature, not just communism. Definite mandatory reading at some point in your life. Orwell's work is short and informative and written in an entertaining easy to read format."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"One wonders if, when writing pieces opposing communism, Orwell wasn't a bit clairvoyant. It is interesting that he chooses pigs to run everything into the ground, using deceit, force, and witch hunts to keep others in line. This book is brilliant because it uses animals--who already had breed distinctions akin to those of human classes--to bring home the point that there is no Utopia, and there never could be.Time and time again to this very day we see it; the author's words ring as true now as they did during the first half of the 20th century. They use up the poor Boxers of the world and then send them off to the glue factory as a reward for their dedication, accusing the honest of lies, and glorifying in their wickedness and greed. I see it in my own workplace every single day, and that's a rinky dink family owned business. Big business and our very own government are doing it to us.\\"All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.\\" Does that line send a shiver down your spine when you think of it applied in human terms? A chilling and eye-opening book about greed and corruption, the ending is very telling indeed, but I won't give that away if you haven't read it yet. Considering that most of the low ratings of this important book were given by kids who need to learn how to spell before they attack a book they can't understand, I have to agree with them in a way. Yes, the book probably is boring for them (I would have thought so at 16 as well), which is why I think it shouldn't be required literature until they reach college, but you get even more out of it if you actually WANT to read it."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"There is a misunderstanding among some...this book does not symbolize communism. It symbolizes the Russian Revolution. Communism does not call for totalitarianism, but it calls for the absence of the state. The title of this review should tell you that you should learn about Russian history before reading this book. A few reviewers critisize this book because there are talking animals in it. They obviously don't know what the book is supposed to symbolize. Aside from the Russian Revolution, this book symbolizes the dangers of totalitariansim in general. Some totalitarianism exists today...not only in &quot;communist&quot; states but in the US as well, even if it is to a very minute degree.George Orwell, by using animals to represent humans and a farm to represent society, teaches us all a lesson...a lesson of what can happen when people give up their common sense for the sake of social well-being.

Of course I had heard of it, but I never really knew what it was about. Now that I've read the novel and learned how it is related to communism I have a much better understanding of it. The way the characters fit perfectly with real life characters gave the story a better meaning. The dogs were like K.G.B., and Molly represented the group of people that didn't care as long as it was good for them. Napoleon and his followers used their position to get luxuries and respect. The leaders of communism also used their position for control and luxuries. It was even suspenseful when the animals fought in the battles.

And when worse comes to worse, the system itself purposely provokes a war with those unforeseen enemies in order to keep the those that work under them in line.When George Orwell wrote Animal Farm, he was directly speaking about Communism and the Red Revolution in Russia of 1914. But after reading the book, we can easily apply it to our Establishment here in the United States and most Western European Countries today.The basic plot of the story is rather simple. The animals of a farm, owned by one Mr. Jones, speak stories of revolution and throwing off the human masters. They speak of slavery and oppression. Most importantly, they speak of equality. Equality for all animals, or as they put it, &quot;Four legs good, two legs bad!&quot;During the whole course of this book, it is always the pigs that decide how things are run, although in the beginning a minority, they grow to be a majority in time. It is the pigs who end up living in bliss while the other animals they work hard everyday and live with nothing, but all the while they are told by the pigs that they are in fact living with more than they were before the revolution. How can the other animals argue with that, they say to themselves, they scarily remember the days before the revolution, so the pigs must be right.In the end, the animals learn a harsh lesson in life, as they look upon the barn wall were in the beginning of the revolution, the pigs wrote down seven commandments for the way the animal world should be, they learn that over time the words that they all swore to live by have slowly changed with time. &quot;All animals are equal&quot; no longer stood alone, but now had an additional line added to it, namely, &quot;but some animals are more equal than others.&quot;I strongly recommend this book to everyone who wishes to think and stop being a lemming in society. This book will give you a strong understanding of how the System works, and when applied to present day Western governments, it bares a strong resemblance. Whether or not you believe the Jews are the System, when Orwell points out one species of animal as being the masters and manipulators of that animal society, he isn't talking about class, but race."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I just read the Animal Farm for a novel project.

Communism persecute all religions as superstition and lies. They deny god, killing human being is a snap because they are intellectual ANIMAL. It's sad that so many people nowadays try to change this nation into communist or socialism ( same role, just different name) not really knowing the truth, just based on some political ideology that human history had repeatedly proved to be failed. In fact communism is the worst political system that ever presented on earth. Because of its brutality, I escaped from that regime. And I am happy to be in this country where human freedom is mostly respected, and protected. Communist lies saying every one shares equally: In fact only, those few comrades who caused the shift of power enjoy the wealth and power, but the rest of the general citizens have no equality nor basic human right. Any one speak against government---disappear next day to \\"concentration camp\\" w/o fair trials nor justice. Communist shut down all religious freedom, or freedom of speech ( all medias are government controlled) Communists deny any form of gods but instead, they set the status of Stalin or Ma chiding, or Kimjung ill, and have to sing songs and salute for them, worship them. From elementary children to elders... Anyone dares to go against the government, ---labor camp! Several millions who stand for their freedom were killed brutally in early 20th century, during the communism overturn. Stalin communist government killed 90 millions including the vicinity nations that were turn into communism, Macho-tong communist killed 100 millions, 2 millions by North Korea, by Cambodia each, 2 millions in Africa, 200,000 latin America..so on . But most of all they all became terribly poor after communist regime,oppressing the free capitalism, except China, because they started to adapt the partial capitalism from 10 years ago after they realized the harsh economic state. Now history tells also other evil regime; Hitler killed 6 million jew with other 4 million of Europeans; Japan' imperialism killed 20 million Asians during WWII, ..so on.Men can't govern themselves.They are very selfish, greedy and evil by nature. If any political party, government have too much power, they will certainly hurt others unless they truly know jesus who always teach love and peace. That's why our America's constitution is truly great, because it was written by the God's fairness and wisdom protecting basic human rights that is originally from God . I realized only those who hate God fall into \\"deny the constitution, or change it because it's old ideas\\". Too old constitution? Then why the whole world always look upon America when it comes, most well practiced freedom and human right? Please have reasons.Research the communism nations' history. All the nations turned into communism fall into worst human rights and economic state from their establishment. Any communist countries in the history ever get better as decades go by?China is the only seemingly doing well now. Why? because from 10 years ago, they realized communism was failed with extreme poverty, started to adapting the partial capitalism into their system-free competitive capitalism. That's the reality people. If USA turned into communism, the power will shift to only those who hate the existing American system. They secretly controlling communicast-medias ( I already see it happened ) and brainwashing the youth with distorted facts in textbooks last 20 years. They keep change their names, their activity, and theory. Why? if they openly speak up, they know they will fail because any normal mind people will see the deception and its perversion. Look at these behind scene head members:They are mostly angry people with extreme hatred. Before you get associate with these kinds, study the actual communism history and the result of those countries over last 100 years. then you might understand why people escape from those communist countries despite the danger of their lives, come to USA. Americans seem so ignorant , don't even know what kind of freedom or dreams that anyone can pursue if they want. I can't believe how americans are lazy and stupid (sorry for my expression) not protecting their precious freedom and the wealth that whole world envy. Pretty sad to see this great nation is stumbling by the smooth, deceitful talking, present government and together with mostly blinded, deceivedmajority. My last word: America wake up and protect what your forefathers gave to you. Don't get robbed by those haters of your wealth and power. If America had been the most wealthy and liberal nation in the whole world so far, doesn't it already proved what you have is the best national system already?Do you have to be a rocket scientist to see this simple truth?

The ten chapters of 128 pages is far too long for the classic fairy tale that has a few pages, occurs in a short space of time, and has a moral. The original fairy tales were often quite gruesome and were bowdlerized for children so they wouldn't ask embarrassing questions. You can read the original \\"Hansel and Gretel\\" and compare it to 20th century stories.The story about a society with hunger, hardship, and disappointment could be true of much of world. Does a society with plenty of food produce happier people? Disappointment, the result of not getting what you want, is ever part of human nature. The \\"Santa Claus\\" legend may teach children to live with disappointment. George Orwell's death of TB suggests a failure to eat nourishing food (like butter and eggs) or get proper medical care.Like \\"Brave New World\\" this book has a reputation in excess of its real value.

I think Sinclair Lewis did a better job attacking the corporate state (\\"It Can't Happen Here\\"). Orwell's moral seems to be \\"politics doesn't matter\\" or \\"be happy in your work\\"."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I love this book!!!!!(age nine) It is a book that tells people that animals are superior too.

The sheep saying &quot;four legs good, two legs bad&quot; and at the end this motto changing into &quot;four legs good, to legs better&quot;, the change in the commandments such as the &quot;to excess&quot; addition to &quot;no animal shall drink alcohol&quot;, and the 7 commandments changing into only 1.

The story of a rebelious group of barnyard animal provides a mere smokescreen for George Orwell to attack Pre-WW2 Russia and their communist society.For someone not familiar with Stalin's reign and dictatorial manner, such as myself, Animal Farm provides a concise and factual portrayal of the situation, without delving into areas best left for discussion in a Philosophy PhD convention. As well as informing readers of how all-powerful Stalin was, Animal Farm offers an intersting story and gives a clear of all characters invoolved, from meer workers to the highest figures on Manor Farm.Recommended to anyone who has an interest in history, especially teens, as Animal Farm will give you an introduction to some of the darker days in history, without requiring years of research and reading beforehand.Very interesting read, and an eye-opener to younger readers, as we realise how lucky we are to not have experienced such conditions."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Don't let any preconceptions discourage you from reading this book.

However, this book remains important and enjoyable. The the story of the animal revolution (and the gradual erosion of the values it once stood for) is a thinly veiled allegory for communism. However, more broadly it can represent the unpleasant mutation of any social or political movement.Bottom line: this is a classic that still rings true.

What makes this a four star book is the human characteristics and ideas(tactics) of each animal.

In fact, when the book starts, the reader is hopeful for the animals and for their new government.Slowly, sinister things start happening, and then one can see the true face of communism.Once again, everyone should read this book! My review cannot do this book justice!Favorite quote from the book (besides the ones the earlier reviewers used):\\"The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.\\"(last sentence of book)Read It!!!"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This novel is a sheer delight! I love the layers here, the story that is simultaneously a fable, a fairy tale, a fantasy, a satire, AND, of course, a stark morality play that denounces the evils of Soviet Communism, which in Orwell's lifetime had sold out the Socialist dream he once embraced and on that foundation of betrayal enslaved an eighth of humankind.Orwell's great joke on the world is a classic for all time. In Animal Farm, the slightly paranoid man who died confident history would vindicate the fears that made him author 1984, gives us a short, rapidly-moving piece about a collection of farm animals who rise up under the inspiration of a Marx-like barnyard prophet, an aged pig named Comrade Napoleon, and overthrow the Czar-esque farmer who has tyrannically ruled over them for decades. The gleeful animals establish a utopian community in which \\"all animals are equal\\" and \\"four legs good, two legs bad.\\" They allocate resources according to need and divide labor according to ability, and then set about enjoying this casteless paradise. At first things work well, with all beings enjoying fairness and egalitarian ideals in action. The animal join to resist an invasion from humans who try to re-establish the reign of the farmer, and then return to their dream existence among the green pastures and well-tended barnyards.But then, as in real life in this thinly-veiled mirroring of the early USSR, things change. The pigs, kin to the great prophet Comrade Napoleon, begin to emerge as a ruling elite. Even while they still proclaim to live by the ideals of the glorious revolution, these animals centralize authority more and more. There is a power struggle between two pigs, with one, the Stalin -like Comrade Snowball, rising supreme with the aid of the vicious barnyard dogs, who work exclusively for him. \\"Comrade Snowball is always right\\" becomes one the new phrases under which the animals must live and \\"all animals are equal\\" is eventually altered to \\"all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others.\\"Before the conclusion of this imaginative masterpiece, the pigs are driving cars, meeting with farmers who live outside the working beasts' paradise, and after their cruel betrayal of the working class (symbolized by a horse named Boxer) the pigs are last seen wearing clothes and WALKING ON TWO LEGS, the final symbol that these one-time idealists have utterly abandoned their revolutionary rhetoric and become tyrants far beyond the scope of the farmer who once ruled the land."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This book was a real eye-opener for me when I read it in 6th grade. I'd never really thought about how the government works or how people organize themselves. It's an easy and entertaining enough read for a 12-year-old, making it an amazing vehicle for its message."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Through this wonderfully written fable, Orwell argues that even the grandest schemes to overthrow an oppressive regime often results in the creation of something even more tyrannical. Though the story in Animal Farm has a stark resemblance to the Russian Revolution of 1917 - Napoleon is obviously Stalin, Snowball is Trotsky, and the farm under farmer Jones symbolizes the rule of the Czar - Orwell hated the fact that the message of his book was often used for crude anti-communist propaganda, when in fact, it's equally applicable to a number of different regime and governments all over the world.In a farm in England, called the Manor Farm, the animals are instigated by an old and wise pig, old Major, to rebel and overthrow the human masters. Old Major reminds the animals that human beings are the only creatures who consume without producing: they do not produce milk for others, they do not lay eggs, they are not strong enough to pull the plough, or fast enough to catch rabbits. Yet, they control the other animals and make them work to death, don't feed them enough, flog them, and when they are old, slaughter them.The animals manage to drive farmer Jones and his human companions out of the farm, and come up with seven commandments to govern their lives and conduct. Slowly, however, the initial euphoria of freedom dies when one of the leaders of the revolution, Napoleon, a pig, establishes a brutal and suppressive rule with the help of some other loyal pigs and dogs.At Napoleon's behest, the seven commandments are slowly changed (for example, \\"No animal shall drink alcohol\\" becomes \\"No animal shall drink alcohol in excess\\"; \\"No animal shall kill any other animal\\" becomes \\"No animal shall kill any other animal without cause,\\" etc.), and finally, they are replaced with just one commandment: \\"All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others.\\" Napoleon and the other pigs even start walking on their hind legs and carrying whips in their trotter imitating the humans they had dislodged. When the pigs invite humans from the neighboring farm for drinks and a game of cards, the rest of the animals - who are not invited - discover that now they could no longer tell the difference between humans and pigs.They both look exactly the same.The message in this book is as relevant today as it was in the troubled times of 1940s. Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal farm follows suit with the rest of George Orwell's books, as a book with a good storyline but a gigantic amount of hidden meanings and symbolism. The plot of the story develops quickly which is a must if the book is to grab your attention and pull you in. The book is a quick read which makes it even better because you can finish it in a day or two at most. However the best part of the story has got to be by far actual plot and how the story takes place.The story begins on a farm called Manor farm where animals are put to work as usual, just like on any other farm. Something however is different on this farm, the animals on this farm catch the wind of rebellion and decide to rise up against their masters. Together they run out the owners and workers of the farm and continually repel attacks by their human owners. They rename the farm Animal Farm hints the name of the book and everything is going smoothly. All the animals are fed and are happy except for a select few. The hunger with these few is not of food but of power and they crave it with a passion. Slowly the pigs begin pulling themselves up the power ladder one step at a time being careful not to offend anyone. However these acts go unnoticed so long that eventually the power hungry pigs are the ones with complete control and begin to rule over the animals just like the humans had, and that's how the book closes with the pigs toasting wine to mankind itself.The vast symbolism and intriguing plot are two reasons why Animal Farm is a superb book that is greatly worth your time. You will root for the animals and hate the pigs and love every minute of it. That is why I am rating this book the highest rating five out of five stars for Animal Farm."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"As allegorical novels go, George Orwell's \\"Animal Farm\\" is one of the best. Animals are the main characters, but they act and think just like human beings. Don't imagine those Disney-type cute little animals. These here are greedy and dangerous - everything to have power and money, just like the human nature.In a farm in England's countryside, pigs defeat human beings and with the help of the other animals develop a virtually perfect farm. Everything they produce is for the own consume. There are no rich animals, no poor animals - they are all equal. It is just like a dream. But this utopia turns out to be a nightmare to the less fortunate who has no strength and power.It is widely known that the writer was inspired by the Russian socialism. There are many direct parallels between characters and events. A pig named Napoleon outs another one named Snowball from the farm and later on uses Snowball in his purges - just like Stalin used Trotsky. And, Napoleon becomes a dictator and Snowball is never heard again.However much Orwell agreed with Marx's Socialism, he didn't agree with the Russian communism in which he saw many similarities to between the communist governments and the previous czarist regimes in old Russia. This view is very clear in his \\"Animal Farm\\". Not only is Orwell's allegory important to literature, but it was also very important to international politics. Thanks in part to this book, the Westerner world could see and understand the danger of communism.Language and its use play an important role throughout the narrative. The use of formal and accurate language is a tool of domination. The most powerful animals are those most educated who can manipulate the ones who aren't. The governing pigs twist and distort the socialism in order to justify their acts and keep others in the dark. Orwell also dealt with the language and manipulation in his \\"1984\\".With \\"Animal Farm\\", George Orwell explores a dream that went wrong in the wrong hands. He shows that even the road to the socialist hell can be paved with good intentions, no matter if those intentions taste like bacon."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal farm book reviewGeorge Orwell's Animal Farm is a good read and the way he chose animals to represent the many different types of people that make up a society today is very brilliant. Besides George Orwell being a great author the book itself was a masterpiece. The setting takes place on a farm that is full of mistreated animals. One day the under the influence of each other's mob mentality decide to break free from the tyranny and totalism of the farm. Once they are free they will build a democracy and control it for themselves. The story of how the animals establish and run their new government is told in the third person and makes for an interesting and great fairy tale for adults. This book shows how easily the minds of people can be fooled into believing certain aspects do to certain amounts of pressure either created by daily life and or the need for a better life.The rebellion starts shortly after an inspirational speech given by one of the farm's eldest and most respected animals. The animals gather in their barn to devise a plan that will get the humans that run the farm out, and the animals that work the land in power. The tired and over worked animals soon snap and execute the plan and ride the farm of the Jones's. After the rebellion the animals are so full of self-pride and team moral that they are unaware that they are being taken advantage of and being recklessly thrown in to a dictatorship. The animals soon get so tightly wound up in new rules and expectations that it is too late for change.This short but sweet book is a story to remember, it is full of hidden meanings and goes a lot deeper than a bunch of animals that can run a farm by themselves. Once you get past the fact that the animals can talk, read and write on there own the story unwinds up into a world of real life dictatorship situations and blows the reader away. As the reader read the book her or she will be amazed with the many connections between real life countries around the world and the plot and story of the book. Readers will also make the connection between the personalities of each animal and how it represents and models the personalities of the different types of people that make up the world today. I was impressed by the complication of Animal Farm and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a short yet controversial read about the greed of humanity. The end was a little rushed for my tastes and could of lasted longer but never the less if got the point across that I as a reader was looking for.

The novel itself was very enjoyable to read and was thought out completely with a creative mind. The symbolism is ever present in the story helping it to produce the fairy tale affect. This book I thought was a real (relatively short) page-turner because along with the excitement throughout the story there are many characters developing to go along with the farm itself changing as well. George Orwell's masterpiece was a subtly rebellious novel of the times, he was telling the world what he felt about the current events, which he did not agree with. Orwell's ability to combine many different aspects of spinning a great yarn makes this a must read."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"\\"Animal Farm,\\" by Goerge Orwell, is a modern adult fable about a farm that is taken over by the animals on the farm. The animals then set up a system where some animals gather food, others build equipment that will help on the farm, others help plant the food in the spring, and others, mainly the pigs, run the farm. At first, all the animals have equal say in what happens on the farm, but as the years go by, the pigs gain more and more control over the farm. The farm evolves from a communistic setting, to a place where there is a dictator that runs everything. At the beginning of the book, the pigs decide on seven commandments that the farm will go by, and by the end there is only a single commandment.Orwell uses satire in order to make his point known: that communism will never work, nor will a complete dictatorship. He explains that in order for anything to work, everyone must be able to have a say in what goes on in their \\"country\\". People will have to find a medium between communism and dictatorship. Orwell does this subtly by using animals and showing how they interact with each other. For example Orwell shows the owners of businesses or leaders of counries by Napolean and how he controls everything, and over works the other animals."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"\\"Animal Farm\\" by George Orwell is an adult fable. In a unique way Orwell describes Soviet Communism using farm animals in place of humans. The animals take over a farm with their motto, all animals are equal. The new Animal Farm seems to be running beautifully; all the animals respect one another and life has never been better. Overtime, the pigs create a new motto that some animals are more equal than others. The dream of once being equal and for all animals to live in luxury is soon forgotten.Using satire, George Orwell portrays barn yard animals in a political fairy tale. With humor and wit, he discuses Communistic views in attempt to state his somewhat bleak yet historic tale. The overworked animals set out to create their own paradise. All goes well for the animals, better than ever until the pigs decide to form a dictatorship saying they are the intelligence of the farm. The pigs end up changing the rules previously set and become more uncaring and more controlling than the former human master. Orwell's unique way of reiterating a historical event is brilliant indeed."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Though 'Animal Farm' allegedly is a story about dictatorships in general, the resemblance to the Soviet Union is remarkable. That is probably the reason why I appreciate it much more than '1984'.

It's one of those books where when you read it you get a different perpspective every time!. I think the author got this piece of literature off to a grand start.

That is the name of the prize winning middle- white boar that was OWNED by Mr. Jones. The old pig always liked to share his dreams with the farm animals.

I didn't have the opportunity to read it in High School like many people have, but have always thought about reading it. Let me tell you... it is worth the wait!I find it interesting that Orwell subtitled this book a Fairy Story. This \\"Fairy Story\\" has more reality in it than some history books. Orwell uses animal characters to give us a startling picture of how an idealistic system of thought(Socialism), became a frightening, all consuming machine (Communism).What's so interisting is that the actions of these animals are so indicative of how man reacts to power and privilige. I don't necessarily agree with socialism, but it is a system of thought that does have some merit. When you take it on it's own it can lead to real equality and humanity. But, the truth is, when power hungry leaders get their clutches on it, the result is less than humane. That is what happened to communism, and it happened so quickly!Is Orwell a political prophet? His book was written just before WWII and well before the Cold War. But he surely had a good take on where communism was going and how it would manifest itself.Read the book... you won't be disappointed. It is a very quick read. If you have been wanting to read the classics, this is a great book to start with! Take the time to add this to your reading experience."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"\\"And so I understood, more clearly than ever, the negative influence of the Soviet Myth upon the western Socialist movement...it was of the utmost importance to me that people in western Europe should see the Soviet regime for what it really was. Since 1930 I had seen little evidence that the USSR was progressing toward anything that one could truly call socialism...[I am] convinced that the destruction of the Soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement.\\"--George Orwell, from Russel Baker's preface.Upset with what he viewed as Stalin's perverse interpretation of socialism, Orwell wrote this brilliant, allegorical attack on the effects of Soviet socialism (i.e., communism) in the USSR. In fact, Orwell had personally seen and felt its impact during the Spanish Civil War, where he nearly lost his life fighting against the Stalin supported Spanish government.The story is about farm animals who mistreated by the human farmers unite and run the humans off the farm, creating a small seemingly Utopian community where all animals are equal. Unfortunately, as the story unravels trouble befalls the animals as some animals become \\"more equal than others.\\"For students of socialism and Soviet history this is an entertaining and insightful must read. Moreover, its friendly unpretentious language should be a welcomed respite from the boring, often esoteric pages found in history books and scholars' essays.At the same time, even if you have no background in these areas you will nevertheless find that Orwell's message is omnitemporal, applying to all times, and also to all systems of government. It is a frightening and foreboding warning that all people must head: Those who claim to be our leaders, working for our benefit, will in the end have us working for their benefit; with once altruistic motives for assuming leadership turning to absolutism.Animal Farm is a wonderful book for both adults and children, to be read on many levels, and at many points in one's life.

After not receiving food one afternoon, the animals rush the farmer's house and take the food they need along with the entire farm. Reorganizing as a race of animals, the higher-class pigs rank the other animals into classes and give them duties to perform. The fate the swine decide for the animal society gradually turns bad when they socialize the others into low-class laborers and forget their original needs to be equally independent. This proves devastating for the pigs as the other animals revolt in the end. Widely known as an interpretation of the Russian Revolution, this tale indirectly attacks the Stalinism of the late Soviet Union."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm is a very interesting book about how a group of animals rebel against their owner. The animals of Manor Farm believe they are being mistreated and would be better off if they ran the farm themselves. They successfully chase the humans off the farm. Over time the pigs become the leaders and grow obsessed with power and control. From that point in the story, the government of Animal Farm goes downhill. In the end, the animals are no better off than they were when the humans ran the farm.Animal Farm is an excellent book.

The book is based on animals acting like humans. The animals rebel and end up taking control of Manor Farm, getting rid of Jones. The animals on Animal Farm each had positions in relation to a government. The pigs were the leaders and all the other animals were the followers. I found the book intriguing because to picture animals in the position they were in and the power they had allowed me to read on. The example Orwell sets is to show how humans also can be manipulated and, how it happens everyday, in different situations. The meaning of the book changed in the ending. The animals began acting like humans. This was a disappointment because it lost the whole meaning of the book. They used to say &quot;four-legs good two-legs bad&quot; the meaning changed to four-legs good two-legs better.&quot;"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"ANIMAL FARM is a great book that shows the type of government that was going on in the 1940's.

The book is easy reading and it stays with the same theme till the last two chapters. The main theme of the book is \\"four-legs good, two-legs bad\\". The animals get so mixed up in working around the farm that they end up acting like humans which destroys the theme of the book. In the last few chapters, the pigs are drinking and playing cards with the humans and saying \\" four-legs good, two-legs better\\".

I was told by so many people that they hated it but I would have to say that has to be directly connected to how young they were when they read them (8th grade).

I had a conversation with my Mother after I read this book and she kind of laughed and jokingly said \\"well do you think Orwell's predictions came true?\\" I honestly had to laugh in response. I told her of course what he wrote has come true. That's because the topics of discussion in this story are ones that will continue to cause havoc to our world for as long as mankind is around. It will happen over and over again. The most recent thing I can associate this story with is the Patriot Act. That's what I was thinking about the entire time I was reading this. You've got a bunch of \\"people\\" who are willing to just believe whatever anyone tells them and never ask questions.

But through the fable, Orwell critiques not only communism but also any corruption of power, leaders highlighting real or imagined threats to instill fear in followers and solidify power. As often repeated throughout history, people out of fear often would submit to the state's unchecked power in exchange for security real or imagined. In the end, Napoleon exploited the animals just as Farmer Jones previously had and even emulated humans when he gave a dinner to neighboring farmers, who represented the leaders of other nations and would gladly play poker with the tyrant as long as they can benefit from the friendship.

But one particular aspect of Orwell's work scares me more than the fading scepter of totalitarianism: namely, the ability of Napoleon to manipulate language to increase his power and authority. Orwell recognized the importance of language in an informed, intelligent society; he also recognized that when language was tampered with by those with ulterior motives (see advertising today), the meaning and relevance of words were injured. Note in particular the Seven Commandments; they begin as idealistic mantras, indicative of high ideals and toting meaning in every word. But soon they are &quot;dumbed down&quot; to one simplistic phrase: &quot;Four legs good, two legs bad.&quot; After the exile of Snowball and the end of all meaningful discussion on the farm, Napoleon takes liberties to slightly alter the commandments, and with just a few words he essentially negates them. Only a handful of animals can even detect the alterations to their core ideology, and this small group is not about to speak out against Napoleon, whose power is virtually abolute.This warping of language is a primary tool for the pigs of Animal Farm, and is a predecessor of the extreme sterilization of language evident in &quot;1984.&quot; This terrifies me. My work with words is some of my best work, and I mean what I say; thus, seeing how language is able to be distorted and devalued makes me wary of advertisers and politicians, both of whom are notorious for spinning the truth. In the end, &quot;Animal Farm&quot; is not only a testimony against Soviet communism, but against the distortion of language. Words were invented to convey reality; when they are tampered with, so is reality, so is the truth."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I found Animal Farm one of the most incredible books i've ever read!

What George Orwell had in mind when he sketched this book, was to portray the big difference there is in the political world in what regards political intentions and political deeds.The story is in fact a very original political fable, where the animal characters are in a disguised way impersonating key political figures of the late USSR.The optimism of the beginning of the Russian revolution, with a lot of colorfull overtones inherited from the works of Marks, Engels and even Lenin, subsides later into sheer persecution of the characters not fit for the revolutionary task, in a shadowy remembrance of the blatant persecution Stalin engaged himself against people suspected of being dangerous to him.This book along with 1984 immortalized Orwell as a creative and preocupied man of his time against the danger of totalitarianism."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"The great thing about Animal Farm is that it can be read at a number of different levels. I suspect that the majority of readers these days are not particularly interested in matching up the characters of the various pigs with Marx, Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin etc., or the events of the tale with their corresponding historical moments, though it can certainly be done. It can, and has, also been read and enjoyed by children as an amusing and cautionary tale without any political significance.But I suspect that most readers these days will appreciate the book as a thought provoking rumination on the corrupting effects of power.Orwell, the man who gave us the phrase 'the Cold War' as well as 'Big Brother is Watching' wrote this fairly late in his career, just before his magnum opus 'Nineteen Eighty-Four', when he was at the hight of his creative powersAnimal Farm remains an entertaining, if brief, read, and every literate person should read it at least once as a child and once again as an adult."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I believe that good literature can often provide a deeper understanding of the implications of history and political/philosophical ideas....Animal Farm is an easy to read fable which quickly conveys how the most well intentioned ideas can be turned into a means of social slavery in the hands of the wrong people (as they say,'absolute power corrupts absolutely')who coddle and finally coerce gullible followers.....a lesson on the vital importance of real democracy and the need for literacy at every level of society.So read the book, and save your hide.

It's about what happens when a well-intentioned but clueless cultural elite presumes to speak for everyone. It's about what happens when the masses &quot;go along to get along&quot; instead of standing up and fighting for what is morally and ethically right.

Written about the communist revolt that established the Soviet Union, The characters mirror real players on the world stage. And as I was reading the book, it seemed like an interesting way to observe and analyze the evolution of the communist state established by Stalin - who in this story, is named Napolean.But as the book progressed, I started realize that it represented much more than just the communist revolution. It was about the human condition.The endless tension between resources and allocation.I'm surprised that none of the other reviewers saw the ending as easily showing a room full of \\"capitalist pigs\\" as totalitarian elite.In the end, they are not so different - as I think this book seems to demonstrate extremely well."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"During the year 1946, during the Second World War, a small book called Animal Farm by George Orwell was appearing on bookshelves throughout the country. Soon afterward, attempts were made to tell Marshal Stalin about this piece of Western literature, deemed a work of genius and a masterpiece. Stalin paid polite interest to these remarks made to him and did not ask any questions. If he had known anything about the book, surely his reaction would have been more drastic.Animal Farm starts out on a farm where one of the prize pigs gets an idea in his head to revolt against the human owners to make the lives of the farm animals better. The other animals, especially the pigs, agree, and soon the prize pig dies. Quickly afterward the animals successfully have their Rebellion and the pigs take charge. However, two of the pigs, who are the leaders of everyone, keep getting into disagreements. Eventually one of the pigs, Napoleon, raises a litter of puppies and as soon as their big enough, he uses them to chase off the other pig, Snowball. Through this way, Napoleon gets supreme power over the other animals. He forces the animals to work and things start to go badly, making it necessary to trade with the humans and rations have to be cut. Of course the pigs are well fed. When some animals start to speak out against Napoleon, he holds a meeting to get rid of the traitors. While the other animals watch, the dogs murder the outspoken animals. Upon seeing this, other animals confess to their treachery and are killed. Life continues to get harder and harder on the farm. Near the end the pigs start breaking some of their rules, called the Seven Commandments, making them increasingly like human beings. The other animals are powerless to respond. As the pigs were one day playing cards and discussing business with some humans, all ties with the animals are broken and the pigs turn into humans. Animal Farm is very powerful and penetrating with its message.The lucid, clear writing in Animal Farm helps make a big impression. Extremely well written and concise, the book is impossible to put down and easy to absorb and think about. The message is obvious and expressed in the best way, using simple language and events that smash home their point superbly.The references to a totalitarian rule are illustrated in a devastating way and brilliantly executed. There are countless examples and the whole story fits in so neatly with the events of the time. The Russians had their Revolution mainly because of unhappiness with their tsar. The animals had the Rebellion because they were unhappy with the farmer who ruled them. Afterward, the pigs took charge, which is no accident. Napoleon is also an odd name and an appropriate one, showing Orwell is not just against the totalitarian rule in Russia. It's interesting that one of the questions the animals against revolting asked was, \\"If the Rebellion is to happen anyway, what difference does it make whether we work for it or not?\\" This question was also asked of the Marxist theorists about communism. The next major event on the farm is Napoleon chasing off Snowball with the vicious dogs he raised. Stalin killed his rival leaders. When Stalin was declaring many members of his party traitors, he also intimidated hundreds of peasants to confessing imaginary crimes against the State. Napoleon did the same. There are many more instances of the connections between Stalin authoritarian rule and Napoleon's rule.Animal Farm isn't only about totalitarian rule. The novel also puts forth opinions on human nature. After Napoleon killed the traitorous animals Boxer, a dim-witted horse, said, \\"I do not understand it. I would not have believed such things could happen on our Farm. It must be due to some fault in ourselves.\\" This statement relates to the question whether the situation shapes who we are or as individuals we shape ourselves. Unknowingly Boxer is supporting the latter opinion. The readers have to decide whether the events were a result of the evil of just one person (Napoleon) or a result of the free situation. In other words, if Napoleon hadn't done what he had done, would someone else have taken his place?To sum up, Animal Farm is an illuminating story on totalitarian rule and human nature. Brillantly written and possessing a wit to rival Swift, I highly reccomend this little masterpiece.A.M."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This book is not about the failure of the ideals of Communism or Socialism--Orwell was indeed a Socialist. It is about the failure and shortcoming of any totalitarian system imposed upon human beings. A totalitarian system can be imposed by ruthless, selfish rulers regardless of the economic system. To be sure, Animal Farm is about the failures and shortcomings of the USSR, an experiment in state capitalism, monopolistic socialism or whatever you wish to call it. The point is it led to suffering at the hands of its elite, suffering that is unnecessary, brutal and senseless.Orwell's somber humor (\\"black humor\\") is always refreshing. His books remind us that after all, we are all human beings and as such deserve respect. A government that does not honor and respect its own citizens is doomed to failure just like the USSR and Animal Farm."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm is a story about authority and how it affects people and the way things work. It also makes fun of the government and what some people think the government is like. In this book, the animals overthrow Manor Farm and rename it Animal Farm. The animals want to prove that they are better than Man and can do everything he can. The pigs take charge and come up with seven commandments that they and the rest of the animals must follow. They also determine the retireing age and how rations will be divided amongst themselves. The pigs end up evil and do away with a few characters that they feel are not assetes to the farm. Overall, Animal Farm was a great book.Animal Farm makes you think about different things a lot. It makes you wonder if the world you live in is as diplomatic as you thought it was and how many things are kept secret from the public. It also makes you ask yourself what would happen if animals really were smarter than us and suddenly had a revolution. Everything would be turned upside down and the world would be crazier than it is today.George Orwell depicts the characters in such a vivid way, that you can see everyone deliberating and doing their work and whatnot. You can see all of the battles against the farmers and the pigs talking to everyone and everything else that's going on during the story.Animal Farm is a book you have to read a few times so you can make sure you didn't miss any of the many underlying themes it has. It gives you a bigger perspective of the world and makes you realize that things may not always be the way someone makes you think that they are. This book is great if you like that kind of thing."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Animal Farm. It was very well written and the author, George Orwell did an excellent job with his complex plot. Animal Farm is not really about animals. Although all the characters are all animals, the underlying theme is a goverment's descent into Communism and totaltarian dictatorship.This story begins with the animals of Manor Farm overthrowing their cruel master and creating their own form of government. At the begining, all is fine and dandy until strange things begin to happen. The pigs, who are in charge of the barnyard government, slowly begin to twist the rules and the truth for their own benefit. Strange disappearances and executions lead up to the ending of this thought provoking book.I highly recommend Animal Farm. It's fast moving plot and underlying themes pulled me in until the last page. Its graphic images and an intense storyline are not for young readers. However, for anyone interested in politics it would be an excellent read."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm is Orwell's allegorical satire based upon the USSR during the era and events surrounding WWII.From beginning to end it's saturated with symbolism that is unmistakable. Orwell takes harsh stabs at those he disdains, characters such as Stalin (Napoleon), and those who spew propaganda (Squealer) - possibly the government-controlled media. Additionally, there are major characters in the book that represent other aspects of the communist state during that time. Snowball is obviously Trotsky and Boxer is obviously the ignorant working class.Boxer is perhaps the character readers are supposed to dislike the most. As with the ignorant working class, Boxer is willing to believe and swallow every lie, every modification of past truths. Instead of challenging the new leader's (Napoleon) ideals, Boxer is willing to always believe and trust him, vowing to work harder and harder at every setback.A particular setback in the book is the Animal Farm's attempt at building a windmill. Much like Stalin's \\"Five Year Plan\\", the windmill is a total failure. After each setback with the windmill's construction - much like Stalin's multiple \\"Five Year Plan\\" setbacks which were supposed to solve all of Russia's problems - the animals are told to rebuild the windmill that will eventually make their lives easier.The plot of this book is very simple, very straight-forward, and very enjoyable. From the beginning of the animals' realization of their mistreatment, and subsequent coup, to the final conclusion - where Orwell makes it clear that the adjacent farms are supposed to be Hitler's Germany and Chamberlain's England, the reader is led through the painful corruption and decay of the intended utopian animal society.Animal Farm is probably one of the shortest classics available, and it simply can't be put down. While there is relatively no humor or light-heartedness (except for the introduction of alcohol to the story), it is nonetheless interesting in a dark, hopeless, empathetic manner.Animal Farm is a great book from which lessons should be learned."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This short book gives an insightful look into the harsh realities of communism through the entertaining metaphorical use of farm animals. This classic still has political relevance today, despite the lack of a Soviet power."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"+++++THIS classic, brief novel by George Orwell (whose real name was Eric Arthur Blair, 1903 to 1950) is probably the most famous of all twentieth-century political allegories. (An allegory is a story in which people, things, and happenings have a hidden or symbolic meaning.) When it was first published, it made Orwell famous overnight.It tells the fable of a group of barnyard animals who revolt against their harsh human master, causing him to flee. The animals establish a system of socialism. (Socialism is a political and economic philosophy that states that only when the state controls the means of production and distribution will its members share its profits and rewards.) However, things go wrong and go full circle as the animals soon find themselves subjected to an even worse tyranny instigated by their own kind.For those who know about the Russian (or Bolshevik) revolution of 1917, it is also a satire on Stalinism. (Josef Stalin soon was ruling Russia after the revolution as a totalitarian or absolute dictator.) Many of the animal characters in the novel parallel those of the Russian revolution. The farm itself is a model of Russia at this time.There are countless themes that run throughout this novel. Major ones include the role of the population, religion and tyranny, and false allegiance.Finally, Orwell's spare prose and the logic of this dark comedy illuminate the stark message he coveys to the reader. The book is very easy to read and even children will enjoy reading it.In conclusion, this is a brilliant novel that lays out a vision that gives us a clear understanding of the possible consequences of our social and political acts!!(novel first published 1945; 10 chapters; main narrative 95 pages)+++++"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This story is well written and very entertaining, and that's before you start diving into the meaning. the story isn't just about the russian revolution, communism, totarlianism, socialism, but shows us the dangers that can happen to anyone in any system of government if we are not watchful and beware those of the silver tongue.

It is about a group of animals that lived on a farm, rebelled against the humans to lead their lives, but then when one of their own animals rules, the conclusion is that the animals becomes like a human, and the animals had gained nothing. The novel starts of by explaining Mr. Jones, the farm owner. The description of him was very mean, however, I personally do not think that Mr. Jones is all that bad. It seems that he used physical abuse in the means to organize and control, but did not use this strategy to his extreme. The Pigs are supposed to be the wisest. Orwell's satire of human nature is quite funny, making a pig a symbol of a human, and then when that pig (Napoleon) is corrupted with power, becomes a human. Besides politics, there were many historical allusions, biblical allusions, and a bit of stereotypes. The historical allusions consisted of communism, Hitler, and dictatorship. Napoleon, the leader of the animals, was power-hungry, and in turn became a dictator. In the beginning, animal farm was trying to make a utopian society using the method of communism, that all the animals should be treated equal. However, communism is the ideal society; it did not work for our world because of other factors, the method itself. Soon, Napoleon became a dictator and the method died. Napoleon can be compared with Hitler because Hitler tried to make a separation of line between the Germans and the Jews as Napoleon made that line with the animals to humans. In a wryly remark, the names of the animals played as a stereotype with the type of animal that they were. Boxer, the horse, was a hard working animal that always believed that if he listens and just \\"works harder\\" then true happiness can come for it. This reminds me of an actual boxer because boxers work hard one on one with their coach for better results, and do not question it. There was another comparison that I made while reading \\"Animal Farm\\", the connection with Golding's \\"Lord of the Flies\\" and \\"Animal Farm\\". Both stories are a bit equivalent. \\"Lord of the Flies\\" consists of boys stranded on an island so they make their societies, which in turn is divided by good and evil, but the evil is corrupted then restored at the end of the book. \\"Animal Farm\\" has somewhat of a same kind of tone. There are these animals that wish to have more rights and freedom so they rebel against Mr. Jones (and any other humans), Napoleon gets corrupted that he chases away Snowball (other pig that was in power with him) so he can have all the power. All the rules are broken, and at the end the farm is restored as it was in the beginning, but with more corruption. The rules were called the Seven commandments. This makes a religious allusion. The animals try to obey the rules, combining the theory of church and state. However, all the rules are broken by Napoleon, but must be obeyed by the pigs. Overall, I personally enjoyed this book. It is entreating, short, and had many of these little allusions that make it quite humorous."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Never mind communism and the workers' paradise. This tale shows exactly what happens when technical experts in high-tech fields decide to support the venture capitalists' new team of management &quot;experts&quot; over the founding management team, instead of hitting the silk at the first sign of trouble.The new management faction follows this familiar sequence, making use of the techies' unfortunate habit of continuing to work hard until it's too late:- wins the technical experts over with their inspiring slogans and &quot;vision&quot; for the company's future- demonizes the original members of the management team to keep the techies from following them out the door as each is ousted- invests heavily in ideas unrelated to the core business that go nowhere but sound good in press releases- works the techies to exhaustion supporting the ideas that go nowhere but sound good- reorganizes the techies' roles out of existence and lays them off, replacing them with inexpensive, compliant drones to boost the short-term profit picture- quickly sells the empty shell for a profit to a clueless winning management team at another company, which then uses the shell as its one of its own ideas that go nowhere but look good in press releases- hires into another unsuspecting company that has a great product and thinks it needs some management experts so it can grow- starts the whole cycle over again.This is also known as the &quot;ichneumon fly effect&quot; among its techie victims.

The story is told by an omniscient narratorin the third person. The action of this novel starts when theoldest pig on the farm, Old Major, calls all animals to a meeting. He tells themabout his dream of a revolution against Mr. Jones. Three days later Old Majordies, but the speech gives the more intelligent animals a new outlook of life.The pigs, which are considered the most intelligent animals, instruct the otherones. Their names are Napoleon and Snowball. Together with another pigcall Squealer, who is a very good speaker, they work out the theory of\\"Animalism\\". The rebellion starts months later, when Mr. Jones comes homedrunken one night and forgets to feed the animals. All animals attack him anddrive him off the farm. The intelligent pigs make up the sevencommandements. No animal is allowed to break one of these rules. FarmerJones comes back and want to recapture the farm, but the animals fight andthey manage to defend the farm. The pigs, Napoleon and Snowball often argue.When Snowball presents his idea to build a windmill, to produce electricity,Napoleon calls nine dogs, which drive Snowball from the farm.Napoleonexplains that Snowball was co-operating with Mr. Jones.Some time later the seven commandements change one after the other. Theother animals can\`t believe it, because now the intelligent pigs sleep in bedsand live in the fram house. The time passes and the pigs change everything.During this time deepens the relation with the neighbour farm and one dayNapoleon invites the owners of this farm. They sit inside the farmhouse andcelebrate the efficiency of his farm, where the animals work very hard withminimum of food. All other animals watch at the window of the fram when theylook inside they can\`t distinguish between man and animal.This is the story how you can read it in the book, when you watch the movie youcan see some differences between them. There aren\`t big differences, they aresmall. For example the begining in the film isn't like in the book. I think there is a betterbegining in the film,because in the book is no real introduction.There is another perspective of the narrator. In the book is it an omniscentnarrator in the third person but in the film is the narrator Jessie the dog. Otherdifferences are that the movie has an end and there come new people (newowners) to the farm.The story is an Allegory,it means that this what you read have an othermeaning. The story \\"Animal Fram\\" is a satire on the Russian revolution andtherefore full of symbolism. Here are some symbols for people and buildings:1. Old Major = He is the personification oh Lenin who is like the \\"father\\" of theRussians.2. Snowball = Trotsky3. Napoleon = Stalin4. The nine dogs = The red army5. Mr. Jones = He represents the imperial power6. Farm building = The farm stands for the Kremlin7. windmill = The windmill stands for the Russian industryThe book is written well but sometimes it isn\`t easy to read. Maybe it is becauseof the serious plot. I think if I read the book at home I wouldn\`t haveunderstand as at school. I think I wouldn\`t understand the real storyabout the book, because at home you read a book to have fun and not to thinkabout it ervery time. The positive things of the book are that you can understandthe background better than in the film, because when you watch the movie youthink \\" ok it\`s only a film\\", but when you read it you can think about it. Thenegative things of the book are that some parts of the book are boring, becauseit is very monotone and that the book has no end.The negative thing of the movie is that you don\`t really know the background.The good things are that it's more interesting. There are some facts which aretypical for films. For example the begining and the end and the relationshipbetween the actors.Only when you read the book you can derive the end from the film, because itcould mean that the family ( Clinton- Family) which come to the farm, is asymbol for the victory against Russia. This is a point where I would say that it\`s adisadvantage that you haven\`t read in the book.Personaly I think the film is better than the book, because for me the bookwas boring and at some parts I don\`t want to read it to the end.I think themovie is better, because you can watch it and you get it easyer to your mind.But you have to know for yourself if you want to read the book or to watch thefilm.book: 2 starsfilm: 3 starsReview of Nicole und Katrin"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Orwell presents his anti-Big Brother, anti-Communist manifesto in this short work and the power grips you from beginning to end.

It is one of the more impacting books of our time, but yields little reading pleasure and detail.When I read through the book,I found that the analogies to the characters in which the book portrayed were accurate. Napoleon was written well and played the part of what would have been Stalin, well. All of the major players in the communist socialist game were personnified well in Animal Farm.This book has relevance today, in that it showed the outlook on events that occurred during the time of the communistically idealistic society, which impacted the thoughts of people and changed society to become a power hungry, consumer dependant socialist government, well, I guess there is a plus and a minus to everything. The words of this book have echoed through generations, and &quot;The Beasts of England&quot; has taken a more human-acceptable form, affecting us all, and our thankfully sociallist economy, greatly."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"If you have a thing for democracy, you will enjoy George Orwells Animal Farm. Animal Farm is set on an English farm named Manor Farm, owned by Mr. Jones. The fable-like story concerns the rebellion of the farm animals, and is told entirely from their point of view. Though the book is filled with many different types of leadership;Kingship, Tyranny, Aristocracy, Oligarchy, Polity, and an overall Democracy. This book can teach you many lessons.The pigs as well as the other animals get tired of listening to Mr. Jones so they take it upon themselves to do as they please.Though quite scary to think that animals could actually take over anything but don't be alarmed, it's just a book."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"More than the Russian revolution, just look at the mighty U.S. Wonderful story that parallels political history and today's current world. And for this, the forward calls Orwell a prophet. While that may be too euphorically idealistic and naively entrusting, it rings of truth nevertheless, as this short story, along with Orwell's other novel, \\"1984,\\" are pessimistic speculations that have been materializing in world political reality more than most others, and doing so in a remarkably accurate way.The idea in this story of farm animals is to overcome their tyranny and replace it with equalitarian socialism, which sadly ends in the very same tyranny. What starts out good turns as the aggressors see the weak spots and subsequently use force to gain control bringing about the economic class divisions, privileges of the wealthy, taxations of the poor, economic tyranny and the subsequent methods employed; the use of force and the greatest being fear and of course, blind stupid patriotism, \\"Four legs good, two legs bad!\\" Fear brings on patriotism, unity and political dominance of the forceful leaders. To unite against the common enemy under fear will induce the subjects to willingly, even emotionally under patriotic fervor, give up all rights of autonomy and free thinking. In the end, the loyal patriot citizen, Boxer the horse, is understood as a mere commodity, which in reality he always was. As in our wars, \\"why do they always send the poor?\\"Napoleon (Stalin) is our fearless leader - he will save us from the terrorists, while poor pig Snowball (Trotsky)is the \\"enemy\\" \\"terrorist\\" and boxer is the proletariat, the working man, while the sheep are the mindless flag waving patriots - \\"God Bless America,\\" the war supporters (they think their spreading democracy) and the Democratic and Republican convention supporters.And so, here is the story of a farm where the animals revolt against the human despotism to create a socialistic equalitarian society, having a few pigs taking the intellectual lead. In a short time, this leads us to our now emperor pig, Napoleon, \\"who is always right,\\" while poor pig Snowball, blackballed, long gone, and yet still always the common enemy who must always be fought, thus spreading to the citizens themselves under the suspicion as possible spies, with forced confessions and punishments. Even in such mild forms, this tactic works well in the idea to spread suspicion among the masses. And you can see this in today's electronic signs along the New Jersey and New York highways reading \\"Report Suspicious Activity - Call 1-800-xxx-xxxx.\\" I wonder if Bin Laden has spies driving down the highway? Probably not, but it's a great excuse to call the authorities on the guy pissing you off in the fast lane. Now without probable cause (only a friendly phone call) can maybe find some marijuana in his car or a suspended license.Also highly interesting, is the way the leaders would change stories and convince the other animals of their validity. It's amazing to see the parallels in the American media, especially the gung-ho conservative talk show hosts, who portray the patriotic historical slant on history and current events in such bias framework. As the 7 commandments of the animal farm are slyly changed, so the Constitution of the U.S. with amendments which erode such and also render the Bill of Rights as near obsolete.While this is not always the case, it portrays the far greater percentage. Yet while there are still autonomous individuals, there is always hope. Even Rome fell. And while each replaces each other with other forms of liberties turned tyrannies, the pessimism of Orwell's prophetic future always has room (no matter how small) of the hope of equalitarian society of liberty and justice for all. That is, before nuclear proliferation occurs from the failure of cowboy unilateralism to publicly address the grievances of the so called \\"terrorists.\\""},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"With \\"Animal Farm\\" on every school's great-works-of-literature list, I had high expectations as I began to read . . . about Mr. Jones's Manor Farm being taken over by the animals, some of whom by story's end connive to become \\"more equal than others.\\" In an historical (first published 1945) context, Orwell's social commentary is prescient, pointing out weaknesses of communism with its privileged upper crust, propaganda and downtrodden (we all feel sorry for Boxer) laboring class. Orwell, a socialist, also pokes fun at the excesses of capitalism, notably in the final scene where Napolean and the other pigs, now walking on their hind legs, become interchangeable with humans--arguing over petty matters as they fritter away their time, while praising ways to enhance production and trim rations, having no concern for the well-being of the workers.From a modern perspective, we can all agree that communism has failed as a political and economic system, and that a side effect of capitalism is its division of society into haves and have-nots, with the rich in today's world only becoming richer and the poor poorer. But what are we to do to fix the problem? Here, unfortunately, Orwell is dead silent--not even a pip squeak. Orwell's negativism would be easier to take if accompanied by a spoonful of constructive, forward-looking medicine that might help us all find our way to the promised land. The author's vicious circle from Manor Farm to Animal Farm and back is too pessimistic for my liking--the story needs a dash of hope that we humans will be a little wiser the next time around. History might seem to repeat itself and humankind might make the same mistakes twice, but I like to think that by the third time around we will have learned our lesson."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This is a good book to read if u have to read one for your summer reading for school it is short yet has a good meaning to it.

Mr. Jones had to face that in the book Animal Farm. In the book, a group of animals rebel against their evil and cruel owner with hopes of a better life. However, they soon learn that it's not the life they hoped for.I was laughing when I read the last page of the book. I enjoyed how George Orwell described the pigs as looking almost identical to the men. I learned from the ending of the book that revolution is a never ending cycle and that there is no such thing as a perfect life. I thought the ending was very good and it left you thinking on how that relates to real life. I praise George Orwell for his masterful satire based on the events of Russian history up to that point in time.My favorite character in the book was Squealer. He was a clever and cunning pig whose speech craft and methods of persuasion were flawless. He was Napoleon's propaganda, and was darn good at it. I liked how the book paralleled Russian history perfectly and how it was an allegory using animals instead of Russians. I thought the whole entire concept was genius. Finally, I learned from the book that a dictator government never works no matter how hard someone tries to make it work.One question that was left unanswered was what happened to the farm after the pigs became identical to the humans. Another question is how the animals could talk in the first place. I would recommend this book to a friend. It was very well written and if you are someone who likes Russian history you will love this book. I will read other books by this author because I love his style of writing.

Here's someone with a steadfast character and a determination that if only he worked harder things would get better.&lt;/random thought&gt;&lt;aside&gt;Only after reading this book did I come to understand how ignorance and illiteracy could lead to abuse and oppression. I grew up in a country that was colonized by the Spaniards for over three centuries. During this time, the Spaniards made sure none of the natives learned how to read or write. They feared that once the natives learned what was going on around them, they would rebel. And indeed they did. That was the smartest thing they ever did.&lt;/aside&gt;The author remarks, in the original preface in the appendix section of the 50th Anniversary illustrated hardcover edition, how the USSR took a good political ideal such as Socialism, and twisted it to an abomination that's worth mockery. Indeed, George Orwell has even fought in a Spanish war to defend Socialism. This was when he took a bullet through the neck and lived to write about it later on.I can see why this book is a classic.

It has a point to make. Important this many years later for its denunciation of totalitarian communism, Orwell felt strongly to tell the world how the Soviet's had derailed and bastardized the socialist cause. The story is semi-compelling. The writing is a little flat. That's what keeps it from earning 5 stars. There once was a time when searching out the meaning behind each allegory was elevated to a Holy Grail Hunt at the encouragement of High School English teachers everywhere. As adults we've came to realize symbolism just isn't all that cool. It's great and fun that there is a code here...the pigs are the communist ruling class, Snowball may be Lenin or Trotsky, Napoleon may well be Stalin. It's intriguing but a lot of work to figure it out. Literary art takes elements of reality, life, and elevates it to another plane. There are some eerie moments here when things come full circle and the pigs look like men an men look like pigs, but if you want the true masterpiece of Orwell denouncing the totalitarian state, give &quot;1984&quot; a read.

Orwell, himself a socialist, paints a brilliant allegory of the Russian Revolution and its evolution into Stalinism by 1945 using a fable of a mass of animals on a farm rebelling from their capitalistic oppression by the consumers. It certainly falls short of, as some here seem to beleive, a total economic/philosophical evaluation of Communist societies in general, but nevertheless it's a brilliant satire on their nature and how human (animal) nature betrays idealism."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Fram is one of the most interesting books on government views I have ever read. It is a classic story about how animals on a farm convert into a communistic way of life. All of the pigs are the heads of government. In the end living conditions for the pigs are fantastic and living conditions for the rest of the animals are horrible. This book conveyed a message which I agree with and it is that the Communist Government system is a system which does not work well in countries which have it right now and it would not be a good system to change to in the future. In the beginning, the animals are furious with the humans, but in the end the pigs form a relationship with the humans. The pigs walk on &quot;two legs&quot; to act like humans. The original animals who have survived from the very beginning see that their lives have slowly detiriorated.

As children's stories go this is quite realistic. I had no idea that I was reading a literary classic. I think in many ways this gave an impact and fascination to reading the story as a teenager, and discovering it's deeper levels, that I would otherwise not have experienced. Orwell's linguistic philosophy, less is more, makes this book accessible to the upper end of the Junior School. For this reason I have decided to include it in my folder. The story, in case you didn't know, involves a farm, Manor Farm. I always imagined it was in Cornwall, but I guess I did grow up there. The farmer treats the all the animals badly, except for the dogs of course. The animals, lead by the pigs - being supposedly the most intelligent farm animal, revolt and take over the farm. The animals decide to redefine the boundaries of what a farm can be. To make farm where everyone is equal, where everyone does just what he can and receives just what he needs. Animal Farm. There is a power struggle between the two leading pigs Napoleon and Snowball. Snowball is chased out of the farm, never to return. From then on the farm gradually descends into a familiar pattern of the oppressed and the oppressors. By the end of the book we are asking ourselves what has changed from when the humans ran the farm. He looked from man to pig, and from pig to man. But already it was impossible to tell which was which. I would assume that you know that the book is a parable of the Russian Revolution, and of revolutions in general. It is quite specific in comparisons. Napoleon and Snowball represent Stalin and Trotsky. Squealer represents the media. Boxer is the uneducated but committed peasant, and the burning of his hat is the destruction of much of that would have been useful to the revolution. I could go on but I shan't. I would be surprised if many 9 year olds pick up on this alternative level of comprehension, and even more surprised if they were interested if it was pointed out to them. The book taken literally however has a lot to offer children. It deals with themes with which they are all familiar. Trust and betrayal. Fear, bullying, anger. Right and wrong. Justice and injustice. The same questions can be asked of the book, but without realising the comparison with the Russian Revolution. Just because thing didn't work out, did that make the animals wrong to revolt in the first place? Could things have turned out differently, or were thing bound to turn out as they did? Above all else though Animal farm is a well written, well told story, which many children would enjoy."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm was well written and very expressive of the author's feelings about communism and the Russian revolution. I liked this allegory because it was very discriptive and oppinionated. I also like its pace. It keeps at a faster pace which is a challenge I enjoy. I read this book in one night and could not put it down until I was finished (at 2 o'clock in the morning). I also liked how George Orwell used animals as symbols, like Boxer the horse, aka. common hard working man. Also I thought it interesting that he chose pigs to represent the smart and leader types. I thought it was probably because pigs and men look the same in a way, or at least look like the stereotypical bussiness/farming man. The book was also thought provoking, especially the title. When you pick it up and read : 'Animal Farm: A Fairy Story' you would think it would be a book you could read children to sleep with, but once you read it you realize the political content. I would recomend this book to anyone and everyone who could get their hands on it, except children under 11. Unless the kid is above average and knows of the events in Russia, I recomend that they wait until they are able to comprehend the meaning before trying to read this novel.

The comparison of Napoleon and Snowball to Stalin and Trotsky is very good. But I think its too abusive of Communism. I know Communism is not very good if ot used properly, as it destroys much of people's freedom. But it is not as bad as some people make it sound. However, if it works well, as Karl Marx dreamed, then it can be good for the people who it governs. But when its true meaning becomes abused, it is then that it can be destructive and people lose freedom and other things. This does happen often in such a government, and despite his aptitude for writing, Orwell exxagerates in making the generalization that Communism always leads to chaos and loss of freedom and voice, which is not true. The reason I think that it is so good despite this is that in Orwell's time Communism was just emerging. What Orwell experienced of Communism was horrible, therefore he is under no circumstances responsible for makig this exxageration. It is just today, in 1998, that we can look back at history and really see that despite most Communist governments becoming destructive of freedom, if COmmunism is used as Karl Marx hoped, then it can be a good government.Person, Age 12"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"From the point in which &quot;Old Major&quot; made his stirring speach to the animals in the barn, I was hooked.

The slightly unrealistic feeling in this use of animals also shows how humans can ignore such horrific behavoir simply because they cannot believe anyone or anything is capable of such crimes. (Referring to the person who disproved the idea that life under Snowball would have been better) Saying that anyone with the power given to Napoleon would lead to disaster is an over generalization (WAY over). For example, China was ruled under a very select few for long periods of its history and not all of its emperors were tyrannical monsters. The book is cute story about animals at one level and a splendid satire at another. Both levels are amusing ways to read the book."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm, by Orwell, shows the reading public, in my opinion, something much deeper than an open critique of communism, or the such. I feel Orwell wanted to tell us basically that we are fools for sweet talk, and that our friends, or in this case, the pigs, are &quot;always right&quot;, just like Boxer was continually repeating. Orwell showed us how weak we are, and let governments, whatever it might be, trample over us until we realize it and we can't do anything about it. Though, we might think it critiques communism, in my direct opinion, it critiques a totalitarian state, a military state, a state by which we live under, like the reprocussions of our very own country, also.Animal Farm is well written book, a book which teaches even children what life is really like, through the use of this adult fiction."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"the first time i read the book, it was for fun, i didn't think about how it could have related to a real event. the second time i read it, it was for my 8th grade teacher this year, and i finally realized that the story wasn't made up with a really good plot line, i knew that the events had really occoured and that Orwell had used farm anaimals to represent real people. this, i thought, was very clever and a good way to teach young people russan history, let them read the story and when they have finnished it, tell them that it had really happened. They should try and point out who the animals represent and why they were needed for the story to take place. Snowball, the clean innosent one was a good name for someone who really wanted to help.

George Orwell with the use of barn yard animals reveals the ruthlessness and control of the communist government in his own era. The book is very easy to follow and is very insightful"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Many have hailed George Orwells' Animal Farm a classic, and rightly so; it is indeed aclassic work of literature, in both meaning &amp; style. However, while it wouldn't be false toattribute it as a story raving against the injustice of governmental oppression (i.e.totalitarian-ship), it would be very much incorrect to dub it &quot;anti-communist&quot;, if not forthe very fact that Orwell himself subscribed to very communistic beliefs.The story itself is a surreal account of a group of farm animals uniting to overthrow theiroppressor, the farmer Mr. Jones. They initially hit upon the idea after a speech from aninspirational boar, Old Major, who represents communisms' primary theoretician, KarlMarx. Old Major tells the group of animals one night of a dream he had where the grouplived in an egalitarian society (that is, a society where everything is based on mutualrespect for others), where the group lived in harmony, working for the good of the group,rather than Mr. Jones. Soon after, Old Major dies and it seems the dream is just that.Two pigs suddenly call to the group to realize the dream and act upon it in order toachieve the potential of the idea, a self-sustained environment. The pigs, Snowball &amp;Napoleon, lead a revolt to overthrow Mr. Jones and his farm hands and establish their owndemocracy, to be headed by the revolutionary pigs.Snowball &amp; Napoleon have different opinions on how things should be however...It becomes evident early on that Snowball has the groups interests in mind (the animalsmanifesting the working class in the story) while Napoleon has only his. It turns out thatNapoleon is an expert manipulator/propagandist and once things begin to go wrong on thenew self-sustained farm, he deviously directs the blame to his rival, Snowball.Soon Snowball is in exile. The farm animals blindly follow whoever can convince themof a way of looking at things; in short, they are dumb animals. It seems in this instancethat Orwell is satirizing humanitys' tendency to blindly follow incompetent leaders andfailure to act for themselves. Few of the animals ever question Napoleon and the oneswho do are either slaughtered in front of the entire group...or are too afraid to speak out.Likewise, while in this country citizens are able to voice their distrust of the governmentwith more freedom than those on the farm, many are ridiculed &amp; labeled as disloyaldissenters, both of which echo life in Animal Farm.Immediately after the Revolution, the farm collectively established several unanimousrules that they would all abide by. Slowly, with Napoleon in charge, they are altered toconform with what Napoleon and his small group of loyal pigs desire; in short, theyestablish a dictatorship. Whenever someone speaks up and questions a rule that theythought had previously been different, they would be assured that that was most definitelynot the case and they were just imagining things. Ultimately, that was accepted andNapoleon held his power. Such are the conditions of the dictatorial establishment!In the end, the pigs have altered the original constitution beyond recognition and theanimals are brutally repressed. The end is shocking &amp; unreal &amp; must be read in its entiretyto be appreciated...but I will say that it turns out the animals had their enemy in their midstthe entire time.Basically, Animal Farm is a tale that is meant to parallel history, usually in its Stalinisticreferences. Still, like in Orwells' most widely recognized novel 1984, it serves as awarning to humanity with its insight and underline message: DON'T FOLLOW ANYONEBLINDLY. Or, perhaps more true to Orwells' personal beliefs, &quot;make decisions withrespect to others.&quot;After all, we're all in this together."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"George Orwell's classic _Animal Farm_ is truly a mustread.

My interpretation of a classic is a book that is relevant for all times. Such is the case of Animal Farm. Originally written as a criticism of Totalitarian oppression of the people it serves today as a window into the machinations of politics in the Oligarchy that is America.Napoleon the Pig represent the oppressive power of the Corporatocracy that is America. Were I to give him a name it would be something ending in Koch.Every oppressive system has to have its Minister of Propaganda. Hitler had Goebbels and Napoleon had Squealer. If I were to place a name tag on our Squealer it would end in Murdock.As in Animal Farm the workers were oppressed and subjected to the whims of those in charge. Today it is the middle class not the peasants that are being set upon. The grand old worker, the horse named Boxer upon who's back all that was accomplished or attempted to be done, rested. Boxer and his companion Clover it was said 'never lost heart' - kinda kin to 'hope springs eternal'. They worked for the improvement of the Farm. They worked to make things better. They worked.Finally when Boxer could work no more and needed medical help - help came. The story was that he would be taken care of and return to live out his remaining days. The facts were much different. He was no longer useful, was simply no longer an asset. Boxer went away to a 'hospital' to be come glue and whatever else they make of horse flesh.Clover and Boxer are, for me, representatives of the middle class. The Pigs use them and work them and take the profits from those labors and grow fat and rich.Social Welfare Programs for the poor and elderly have become liabilities to the Pigs....they want more. They are going to work, work, work the life out of those who will work. Like the sheep, they will be fleeced of every thing.Amazon - you wanted a review. Here tis.

It's important to note that it is not only about Russian Communism but equally about the French revolution. Orwell himself was a disillusioned socialist, so to view this book (as conservatives do) as a simple polemical against Communism is a distortion. Rather it is a tragedy about many years of history.Orwell correctly never denies that Mr. Jones abused his animals. He correctly recognizes the socialist dream as exactly that. It's worth noting that the theme song of the revolution, \\"Beasts of England\\" is an exact parody of the old Socialist poem \\"Men of England\\" by Percy Shelley from the early 19th century. The character Napoleon the pig is both Napoleon Bonaparte and Stalin. Orwell's relentless cynicism portrays most of the animals as far too stupid to realize what's happening as the revolution betrays its original principles. The most sympathetic character is the old donkey who knows better, but can only watch helplessly as the dogs and pigs establish their tyranny. Its ending corresponds closely with Napoleon (Bonaparte) crowning himself king.As far as advice, Orwell offers none. Figure it out yourself."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm successfully works as a chilling distillation of human behavior gleaned firsthand by George Orwell during the Spanish Civil War. He had become -for a time - one of those useful idiot intellectuals, like Hemingway and Dos Passos, who thought fighting for the Loyalists against Franco in the Spanish Civil war was the cat's meow. However, it wasn't long before every socialist and anarchist brigade on the Loyalist side was being coordinated, staffed and equipped by Soviet Stalinists who first purged their own, and then became every bit as brutal and inhumane as Franco's Nationalists. At least Orwell and Dos Passos saw the error of their ways.Where the allegory fails, however, is that Orwell puts the literate pigs at the top of the heap and makes less-than-bright barnyard animals unwitting dupes when we all know that super-schooled egghead types on both sides of the political aisle so often fall for utopian mumbo jumbo."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This book was awesome! It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole way through.The Animal Farm is an almost exact replica of the Bolshevik Revolution.

Chillingly, what happens in this little novel also transpired in Communist Russia. The ruling pigs stand in for real-life Russian leaders.I have always admired Orwell as a man who told the truth, no matter how distasteful. He was a socialist who would have been pleased to see Russia thrive, but their appalling tactics required him to change his rhetorical gears. Orwell was a master of the written word- his pen was ultimately far more significant than Stalin's sword. I do think this little book will survive for a long time; it carries warnings that even democracies should heed. The next time I hear Dick Cheney imply that a vote for a Democrat is giving support for al-Queda I'll think of Squealer the \\"brainworker\\" pig who justifies his pleasures : \\"Do you know what would happen if we pigs failed in our duty? Jones (the hated former owner) would come back!...Surely there is no one among you who wants to see Jones come back?\\""},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Some have said George Orwell's strength lies in his stories and ideas, not his writing. Granted, he's no genius with words and style, but I like his smooth and succinct way of writing.This in addition with the relative shortness of Animal Farm makes it a fairly quick read. You get a great satirical look at the beautiful idea that was transformed into a perversion of itself in Russia/the USSR in the beginning of the 20th century. It's even cute at first, so cute you might even consider reading it to your kids. Although the smallest might find the rest a little too scary, this might serve as a serious thoughtprovoker if combined with intelligent parents.Just don't do it without reading it yourself first.It helps if you know something about the Russian revolution and the situation there.

It's really remarkable how emotionally invested you can get in these characters, and how appalled he can make you in this microcosm. One can easily understand why this book was banned and also why it is so vitally important. Though the red scare is obviously long behind us, I think this book is timeless in its vitality in expressing the dangers of seeking any Utopian society or giving blind trust to leaders. Great book. And now I'm off to re-read 1984."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Orwell detested the enthusiastic rhetoric of revolutions. His first-hand experience of revolution, of oppressive police states and unjust, totalitarian rulers led to his composing this satiric fable. Set in England, the animals rebel from mistreatment, led by the pigs, forcing the alcoholic and indolent landowner, Mr. Jones, to flee for his life. Jones returns and is promptly defeated in The Battle of the Cowshed; the animals are now free and Animal Farm rises from the ashes of Manor Farm. The joy of victory is short-lived,however, and is soon replaced by the oppressive life of animals victimized by their own ignorance and the consolidation of power by the pigs though classic propaganda techniques. The novel is a grand study in the process of power consolidation, the effective use of propaganda, and the satiric refutation that \\"ignorance is bliss\\". Unlike most fables, though, the ending does not impart the sweetness of a pithy saying that imparts wisdom, but rather leaves the reader with a growing awareness of how pernicious propaganda techniques can be in the hands of malevolent rulers empowered by an illiterate populace."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Classic!

What a regrettable decision that was; because it was not until 20 years after graduation that I finally got to read this seminal work. A work that has such profound possibilities to shape the minds of readers both young and old alike that I wonder if we shouldn't be prescribing books like that in our schools instead of Shakespeare? To call a work 'seminal' or to say that it is worthy of actually making a 'prescribed reading' list is no mean feat and there are really comparatively few books worthy of such adoration; this though is surely one of them. Whether you agree with the books political or moral standpoint or not is an irrelevancy that should have no bearing on your desire to read or prescribe this book.In being desirous of understanding this text, it is firstly important to understand just what we are presented with here, for this book is NOT an overtly political or subversive anti-communist thesis (despite what Orwell may have originally intended). What it is in fact, is a precise, poignant, cutting and very astute examination of human nature; the motives, desires and inner reflections of humanity and the internal struggles we all face. What I found most impressive about this work was that as a critique of humanity and the complexities of hierarchical societies it is an examination that resounds as strongly now as it did in 1946. Especially in the wake of 11/9 and the measures that have been introduced to 'protect' and 'guard' the people by various governments around the globe, not to mentions how far from the truth we have been lead by the 'news' media. When one considers the impact the media had in back in the '70s, in bringing the terror of Vietnam home to the news-stands and the enormous social and political repercussions that spread outwards from that; who would have thought that a mere quarter of a century later the public would have gradually succumb to the acceptance of what before was seemingly unacceptable... sound familiar?

The amount of wisdom packed into this fable cannot be overstated. See how a group of barnyard animals struggle to prevent their oppression from the Humans, with the aim of building a more utopian society where they may live in harmony.

Nonetheless, the book the book left a mark on me and taught me to be skeptical (or even cynical) about idealistic schemes not supported by checks, balances, and a basic assumption of human greed.I returned to the book 12 years later after reading Orwell's Homage to Catalonia and other books on the Spanish Civil War. I believe that Animal Farm is Orwell's attempt to distill his observations about revolutionary politics and human nature gained from his experiences in the Spanish Civil War into a novel unconstrained by the limitations of journalism. In doing this, he has created a timeless masterpiece.The second time around, I read it to my 4 year old son and he enjoyed it immensely.

This complex book isn't as simple as first thought, Orwell referred to it as a fairytale but infact is a short enjoyable novel. This book is what I was told to expect it's wonderful and a real thrilling and a splendid read. Although it was first wrote in the 1950's its still as good as first written. This clever book will let you drift away and watch the hours fly by. On first reading this book I was amazed at the way Orwell managed to take a complicated issue such as the Russian Revolution and turn it into an enjoyable, informative read.Old major dreamt of a loving peaceful world, free of all men and so the animal's rebel against farmer Jones and so he soon gives up the fight. But things don't turn out to plan and things soon go wrong. All the animals should have been equal but the more clever ones soon start to take control. Napoleon, who becomes the main leader after much deliberation, gets a loyal pig, squealer, to distort the truth on what's happening behind the lines.If you like a fun, pleasurable, different book about animals rebelling against their master and the Russian Revolution then this is the book for you.

When reading this book my emotions ranged from being sympathetic with the animals in the beginning to pitying the animals for their stupidity. I felt bad when Mr. Jones would work the animals hard and only feed them enough to get by. But my sympathy turned to pity when the animals fell for Napoleons propaganda (squealer's speeches). After finishing the book I realized how bad totalitarianism is and despised Napoleon for becoming such a power hungry &quot;pig&quot;.My favorite character was probably Clover. She was my favorite because she was pretty smart and didn't always agree with Napoleon right away. She questioned his and the other pigs' behavior. She was the only animal that would realize every time Napoleon changed a commandment. She was also very nurturing and mother like towards the other animals.I really liked how everything in the book paralleled something in Russian history. It was really interesting to try and figure out what everything meant. I also really liked the book because it was an easy read and I had no trouble trying to figure out what happened.George Orwell did a wonderful job showing how totalitarianism is bad and eventually will not work in favor of the people or animals in this case. I really enjoyed how he used a story about animals to explain the effects of totalitarianism. It turned something that otherwise could be a boring subject into a story about a farm.I learned a lot about totalitarianism in this book. I knew that it was bad prior to reading the book but I had no idea how it affected the people the so badly. I always used to wonder why the people never fought against a dictator but after reading this book I realize that sometimes the people don't even now how bad they have it.I thought that the end of the book was sort of disappointing. I wanted the ending to include a big downfall of Napoleon since he was such a horrible leader to the animals. But instead the book ended with Napoleon being happy and still in control.There are a few things I still don't understand. I don't know what the windmill in the book represents in Russian history. I also didn't understand the ending. Why couldn't you tell the difference between the pigs and the humans? and What does that represent in history?I would definitely recommend this book. It is a very interesting book to read in either an English class or a history class. I wouldn't recommend this book to someone to read outside of school because the book is much more interesting when you can compare it to the Russian history.I don't know if I would read another book by this author. This particular book was interesting because it was so accurately representing an actual country's government. I might read another book by this author if there was another book that included this quality.Overall Animal Farm is an &quot;oink&quot;-ing good time to read!"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm allegorizes the rise to power of the dictator Joseph Stalin. In the novella, the overthrow of the human oppressor Mr. Jones by a democratic coalition of animals quickly gives way to the consolidation of power among the pigs. Much like the Soviet intelligentsia, the pigs establish themselves as the ruling class in the new society.The struggle for preeminence between Trotsky and Stalin emerges in the rivalry between the pigs Snowball and Napoleon; the idealistic but politically less powerful figure (Trotsky and Snowball) is expelled from the revolutionary state by the malicious and violent usurper of power (Stalin and Napoleon). The purges and show trials with which Stalin eliminated his enemies and solidified his political base find expression in Animal Farm as the false confessions and executions of animals whom Napoleon distrusts following the collapse of the windmill. Stalin's tyrannical rule and eventual abandonment of the founding principles of the Russian Revolution are represented by the pigs' turn to violent government and the adoption of human traits and behaviors, the trappings of their original oppressors. The novella critiques the violence of the Stalinist regime against the human beings it ruled, and also points to Soviet communism's violence against human logic, language, and ideals.Animal Farm illustrates how classes that are initially unified in the face of a common enemy, as the animals are against the humans, may become internally divided when that enemy is eliminated. The expulsion of Mr. Jones creates a power vacuum, and it is only so long before the next oppressor assumes totalitarian control. The natural division between intellectual and physical labor quickly comes to express itself as a new set of class divisions, with the &quot;brainworkers&quot; (as the pigs claim to be) using their superior intelligence to manipulate society to their own benefit.One of the novel's most impressive accomplishments is its portrayal not just of the figures in power but also of the oppressed people themselves. Animal Farm is not told from the perspective of any particular character, though occasionally it does slip into Clover's consciousness. Rather, the story is told from the perspective of the common animals as a whole. Gullible, loyal, and hardworking, these animals give Orwell a chance to sketch how situations of oppression arise not only from the motives and tactics of the oppressors but also from the navet&eacute; of the oppressed, who are not necessarily in a position to be better educated or informed. When presented with a dilemma, Boxer prefers not to puzzle out the implications of various possible actions but instead to repeat to himself, &quot;Napoleon is always right.&quot; Animal Farm demonstrates how the inability or unwillingness to question authority condemns the working class to suffer the full extent of the ruling class's oppression.In Animal Farm, the pigs gradually twist and distort a rhetoric of socialist revolution to justify their behavior and to keep the other animals in the dark. The animals heartily embrace Old Major's visionary ideal of socialism, but after Old Major dies, the pigs gradually twist the meaning of his words. As a result, the other animals seem unable to oppose the pigs without also opposing the ideals of the Rebellion. By the end of the novella, after Squealer's repeated reconfigurations of the Seven Commandments in order to decriminalize the pigs' treacheries, the main principle of the farm can be openly stated as &quot;ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL, BUT SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS.&quot; This outrageous abuse of the word &quot;equal&quot; and of the ideal of equality in general typifies the pigs' method, which becomes increasingly audacious as the novel progresses. Orwell's sophisticated exposure of this abuse of language remains one of the most compelling and enduring features of Animal Farm, worthy of close study even after we have decoded its allegorical characters and events."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm tells the story of a workers revolution betrayed. It uses the personification of animals to tell the story which is based upon the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. Although Orwell himself was a devout socialist, the book is fueled by his desire to deconstruct the Soviet Communist myth, and warn against innocence in any political system.The story begins when Major (Karl Marx), the prize middle white boar, foretells a time of animal utopia. His vision is encapsulated into seven commandments under which all animals shall live.The animals revolt against the owner of the farm, Mr. Jones (Czar Nicholas) in order to realize their dream of justice and equality, which they label Animalism (Marxism). For a time Animalism nears fruition until two pigs Napoleon (Stalin) and Snowball (Trotsky) struggle for the direction of the farm. From there, Animal Farm descends into a totalitarian state with each of the seven commandments being modified to justify the pigs' violence and greed. The ending is brilliant (tease line).Even with the information of this short summary, Animal Farm is a brilliant story and a perfect read. Everyone need read this book. Everyone will glean something from it.On one level it is a great and engrossing fairy tale. A real page-turner with eye opening concepts. On another level it's an allegory of the Bolshevik Revolution with each animal representing the participants. Read it on any level you desire - just read it. Then read it again. On every level, George Orwell's, Animal Farm is as relevant today as it was when it was published at the end of World War II. The message is a universal one."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Too many readers have stated that this book is irrelevant now that the Russian revolution is over. But you should realize that the Russian revolution has no bearing on this material whatsoever. So what if it is modeled after real persons? The importance of this book comes from its lessons about the danger of power and manipulation and corruption. It is more relative now than ever."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I read Animal Farm today. I believe it's the first time I've ever read it, although I've been very familiar with the story since I was a little girl.When I was about four years old, I remember turning the television on to watch Mr. Dressup. A message came up: \\"Mr. Dressup will not be shown today. In its place, we will be presenting the animated feature, Animal Farm.\\"\\"Oh goody!\\" I thought. \\"I like cartoons!\\"So I sat down and started to watch.Bear in mind that I was a very hyper child who never watched anything on television except by fly-by. I'd zoom back and forth, playing as hard as I could, occasionally pausing to catch a couple of moments of tv programming. I sat perfectly still in front of the television for the entirety of Animal Farm, and when Boxer, the faithful, hardworking horse was sent off to the glue factory, I raged and screamed and cried and stamped my feet and shook my fists. I screamed, \\"It's not fair! It's not fair!\\" over and over again.Well over three decades later, I still remember watching that cartoon. I remember the sense of helpless rage and horror. I may not have understood the concepts of communism or absolute power doing its absolute corruption, but I was able to recognize when something wasn't right.I can't say an episode of Mr. Dressup ever effected me similarly.So I read the book today, and I felt the same sense of righteous indignation with those pigs that I did as a four-year-old. But this time I didn't stomp and scream. I sat quietly and my brain barraged me with parallels, feeling rather like Alex in the forced eye-opening scene from A Clockwork Orange.There aren't many books which engage me so viscerally."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Pigs and men sitting at a table together? What is the matter with this picture? In the book Animal Farm, by George Orwell, the Manor Farm is set in England. The farm animals kick out their master and decide to wage war with the human race if they try to return to the farm. The animals rename the farm Animal Farm.Snowball is the leader of the Animal Farm in the begining of the book, but a boar named Napoleon chases him out of the farm and convinces all the animals that he is evil.The horses, Clover and Boxer, and the donkey named Benjamin start to suspect that Napoleon is lying, but the over feed pig Squealer always makes up a good excuse.In the end of the book there is a scene with pigs and men sitting at the same table drinking whisky and playing cards. But the animals looking through the window can't tell who is who.This book is a very interesting book with and includes funny parts some serious parts and some sad parts. Animal Farm is also a little confusing at times; therefore, it is a little hard to follow.Animal Farm is very interesting because of all of the surprises.

All the main characters, such as Stalin, Karl Marx etc. can be found in this short piece of satire. i disagree with pple who say that this book is simply a summary of 1984. I have read both books and I feel that although they are similar in some ways, there deal with different subjects. There is a fine line seperating the two. 1984 is mainly about \\"big brother\\", almost something like dictatorship, or autocratism in a futuristic setting while Animal Farm is about communism. One gripe I have about Animal Farm is its lack of action. It also lacks depth, and is a pretty superficial glance at communism and its appearance in Russia. It could just be any anit-communist book in the market. Nothing really special.

In the book it has two sets of animals the sets are good animals and bad animals, It tells you about a Farm that was owned by a man and his wife called Mr. and Mrs. Jones, and hoe they held the animals badly on the farm and how the animals did not like it, so they had made a plan to get the owners off the farm. That's how they came up with that name &quot;Animal Farm&quot; Because the animals were the only creatures on the farm.

Mr. Jones was a farmer who took care of the animals. The animals wanted to be free. Basically, the animals were angry because Farmer Jones would take eggs from the chickens, would butcher the pigs for meat, milk the cows, work the horses, etc. The animals were fed up with the way they were being treated and rose up and took control of the farm. The animals had decided that they would run the farm themselves, but unfortunately, they acted just as badly, or worse, than the humans they despised!! The animals in the story turned on each other and seemed to forget what cause -- freedom -- they had banded together for! One particularly strong-willed and clever pig, named Napoleon, became the leader of the farm after the humans were gone. &quot;The pigs did not actually work, but directed and supervised the others.&quot; The pigs taught themselves how to read and write and had developed and written down &quot;The Seven Commandments.&quot; They are: &quot;(1) Whatever goes upon 2 legs is an enemy; (2) Whatever goes upon 4 legs, or has wings, is a friend; (3) No animal shall wear clothes; (4) No animal shall sleep in a bed; (5) No animal shall drink alcohol; (6) No animal shall kill another animal; and (7) All animals are equal.&quot; The animals eventually broke all these Commandments they were supposed to live by. Napoleon realized that power (electricity) was useful and something that they needed to have, so the animals decided they should constuct a windmill. It took 2 years to build. The winter was coming and food was scarce. All the animals survived through the winter with little food. They were so worried about getting the windmill up that food production was slowed. They had focused on one thing and forgot about other basic necessities. Snowball, one of the other pigs who was run off of the farm by Napoleon's dogs, secretly returned and plotted to kill Napoleon and take over the farm. Napoleon found out about this plot and gathered the animals together. He asked all the farm animals to confess any bad things they had done. Several animals, mostly the chickens, said they had stolen food and some said Snowball had talked to them about killing Napoleon. Napoleon passed judgment and killed every animal that had confessed. He said that it had to be done for a better farm but in doing this, he broke one of the Commandments. He killed other animals. The animal society was in chaos. They did not follow their own Commandments and acted no better than the humans they thought were so evil. Napoleon started sleeping in beds and drinking alcohol; food was scarce because the animals spent most of their time trying to build the windmill, which got finished, was then destroyed, but then was re-built again; and all the animals were NOT equal -- the pigs had the higher authority and pretty much ran the others. The animals gained their freedom temporarily but it did not last long for all the animals on the farm. They were not treated equally. After many years, the farm thrived under the supervision of Napoleon and the &quot;ruling class&quot; animals. There was only 1 Commandment left &quot;All Animals Are Equal, But Some Animals are More Equal Than Others.&quot; The animals that ran the farm (the pigs) slept in beds, wore clothes, drank alcohol, and carried switches in their mouths while the other &quot;lesser&quot; animals did all the work. Mr. Orwell's description of the characters and their actions are as dark as the characters themselves. &quot;When they had finished their confession, the dogs promptly tore their throats out and in a terrible voice Napoleon demanded whether any other animal had anything to confess.&quot; There always seemed to be tension in this new animal society and still there was no true freedom for many of the animals. Napoleon and the other pigs that ran the farm became just like Farmer Jones. &quot;The creatures outside looked from pig to man and man to pig, and from pig to man again, but already it was impossible to say which was which.&quot;"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"&quot;Animal Farm &quot; is a true story with fictional protagonists.

The book was easy to read but hard to put it down. I can really understand the meaning of communism, capitalism and I found that History was not boring anymore, but it was too late, as I did not take History in F.4.Orwell made me think, that the story was parallel with the Russian Revolution. He showed me the negatives side of politics and the mirror to the real humanity.The Seven Commandments were laid down, and then the animals were forced into slave labour. Soon, the revolution began with &iexcl;four legs good, two legs bad&iexcl; but ends with &iexcl;four legs good, two legs better.&iexcl; It was ironic and proved that &iexcl;Power Corrupts&iexcl;.

Unfortunately, all he did was to show that socialism devolves into communism, making people wary of BOTH socialism and communism, thus his own book hindered his own cause.I will not ever comment on the storyline and its relation to communism other than to say that it is very well done and provides an excellent simplification of what communism in Russia did.

One pig, named Napolean, becomes the farm's dictator, executing animals, rewriting history, and slowly becoming more like the humans that they overthrew in the first place. The story is modeled after that of The Soviet Union. The conflict is unfornuately, not resolved. This is because the book was written before the Soviet Union was defeated and overthrown.

I always vaguely remembered the lessons in them. As the events today follow the pattern of 1984 and Animal Farm and after a really humiliating experience at the airport with the TSA, I dug out the books and reread them.After rereading them I felt powerless like I did at the airport. How could people in positions of power be so unjust and abusive of their positions. But after a few days of feeling depressed I went on a quest of self-improvement and to consciously make decisions for the betterment of my family and so that we can be as independent and free of the big brother system that bullies us.I had my husband and brother build a 10x10 foot greenhouse so my family and relatives could have a stable supply of food. I'm not a gardener and I also needed to learn a lot about canning. It's not easy and I was quite scared of this but it's something I needed to do and thankfully my daughter and husband fully support and help me. The foods we don't grow we get from the local farmer's market. We save money from having the greenhouse and use those savings to buy higher quality organic foods. We are all healthier than ever.After weeks of arguing with my husband I quit my part-time job and took my 3rd grade daughter out of her school so I could homeschool her.This was further outside my comfort zone than the greenhouse gardening, but I will no longer allow other people to have responsibilities over how my daughter is raised. With all the homeschool materials out there and my daughter's natural aptitude, this has actually been easier than I expected. We use the Robinson Curriculum mostly and it doesn't require parents to teach. Just be there with your children and guide. The materials will do the teaching.She's learning more, she's better behaved, and we're spending a lot of quality time together even though she only devotes 2 hours a day to studying. This homeschooling has enriched ME more than I can ever describe. I feel empowered, productive, and that I have a life that has meaning. It's a feeling I wish every mother could feel.I will end this review now because I'm off on a tangent. Animal Farm is a must read book."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This review is of the 2008 Audiobook by Blackstone read by Ralph Cosham. I will first review this edition of the book. In my mind it is flawless. Ralph Cosham is a wonderful actor and brings a fantastic stroke of drama to the work. It is first rate performance free from annoying characters or vocal idiosyncrasies. Additionally, his British accent will likely prove to be soothing to many American listeners.As for the work itself, it is nothing short of brilliant satire. This delightful read is excellent for modern, western minds to read to remind us of the many dangers of a government with few checks and balances. There are many witty ironies in this book but to me, one of the most profund is the use of animals to portray human nature. Orwell seems to have a dim view of humanity and seems to highlight the reality that humans tend to naturally be self-seeking and easily corruptible. Though this stands in stark contrast to the ideals of the Enlightenment, the WWII context for this book revealed that humans are capable yes of amazing achievements yes, but equally capable of horrific atrocities. An additional high point for this reader is the display of the power of strong rhetoric, even if it is in the form of propaganda. This book should be read by every American and I would imagine would serve to protect and preserve the ideals of a free-market democracy."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I first read \\"Animal Farm\\" over 45 years ago. My \\"Signet Classic\\" copy has an introduction by C.M. Woodhouse, which was published in the \\"The Times Literary Supplement.\\" One of his points was that two events occurred in August, 1945, and the target of both was the Soviet Union. One was the dropping of the A-bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which effectively ended the Second World War, but also, as Woodhouse implies, was a warning from the United States to its ally in that war. The other event was the publication of this book, which was a scathing, thinly veiled denunciation of the betrayal of the original principals of the Russian revolution by its leaders. George Orwell had experienced other betrayals as well, having fought on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War, and bore witness to the failure of the Western democracies to support that side. His account,Homage to Cataloniais highly recommended.Having just re-read the book, I've concluded that it has definitely withstood the \\"test of time,\\" and remains as relevant today, even though the Soviet Union no longer exists. Orwell's tale is an allegorical one; his prose is lean and to the point. In the best spirit of the \\"inmates taking over the asylum,\\" Orwell has the animals on \\"Manor Farm\\" seizing power, and driving off its human owner, a Mr. Jones. The one animal that was most directly allied with Mr. Jones is a black raven, a clever talker, who would convey tales of \\"Sugarcandy Mountain,\\" way up there is the sky, where all the animal's dreams would come true. Priests anyone? In the immediate aftermath of the \\"revolution,\\" new principles are proclaimed. The most important one is that \\"All animals are equal.\\" Not having to support parasitic humans, the animals will now be free to enjoy the fruits of their own labor. The work days will be shortened; retirement benefits proclaimed. Hum! And yes, within a few pages, the initial problems commence. What happened to the extra milk?Orwell unfolds his tale brilliantly. Step by step, a new hierarchy emerges, with the cleverest of animals, the pigs, in charge. There is a conflict between the two cleverest pigs, once closely allied, Snowball and Napoleon. Snowball loses, and step by step, becomes the personification of all evil. Themes that Orwell developed inNineteen Eighty-Fourare present. He that controls the past controls the future, so it is no surprise to see the past constantly rewritten in order to justify current actions. Orwell depicts many an administration \\"spokesperson\\" in slimy \\"Squealer,\\" a cheerleader, rationalizer and literally re-writer, adding key qualifying phrases to the original Seven commandments. Napoleon transforms into the indispensible, aloof leader, who needs much praise, and, of course, lots of \\"perks\\" as compensation for his heavy duties.The narrow reading of this allegory is that it is solely about totalitarianism. The broader reading concerns the power relationships which evolve when any three humans gather together. In particular, I have to think about how the \\"power elites\\" almost lost it in the 2008 financial meltdown, but with only a stumble or two, have re-establish the need for their \\"perks,\\" and, in the main, most people still go along with it. As in Animal Farm, Napoleon, (i.e., the power elites) constantly uses external \\"threats,\\" in particular, from the evil Snowball to maintain control. Alliances of convenience have to be made with former enemies. The focus remains on self-aggrandizement; the hedge fund managers need their incentives in order to work hard; the rest, like the ever faithful horse, Boxer, need only exhortations.At the beginning, it was called \\"Manor Farm\\"; after the \\"revolution\\" it became \\"Animal Farm\\"; and sure \`nuf, at the end, it reverts to its original name. It remains an astonishingly true tale for our times, and should be read in all our schools. Of course, nothing might actually change, but it is a telling and sardonic portrait of the human condition. 5-stars plus."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Though Animal Farm is known to symbolize the communist revolution in Russia, it still has much to teach any society about government control over the masses. I had never read this book in high school, and shunned it after watching some of the movie, since the talking animals were a little too much for me to handle, but as I read this book now, a college student studying communications I see many things that still exist in our society.One thing that is most prevalent is the ability the pigs have to twist the \\"media\\" (mainly Squealer's speeches) to anything they want, while the rest of the animals are too ignorant to truly know what to believe. They have no choice but to believe the pigs, since they have no other way of knowing, which must stir some thought in every reader since that is true for the media and government today. There is no other way to know what is true other than what is given to us, and we have to put our trust and faith into our government.Luckily our government does not have ferocious dogs to back them up and kill anyone who goes against them. Either way, this book provoked a lot of thought to me, not just of communism, but government in general. It's a short read, only about 100 pages, but each page consists of a new idea to contemplate.I give it four stars only because I believe a little more depth could have been covered, and the talking animals still disturbed me a little, but overall I am glad I can finally say I have read this book. Anyone who hasn't read this book, should read it. It's still contemporary to today's world."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"With thousands of reviews of Animal Farm in the press since 1945, Amazon with over 1,187 as of today, it's hard to find something extra to say. With Soviet era Communism in his cross-hairs first, with particular disdain for Stalinism, and the danger of totalitarian regimes in general, George Orwell was and will remain one of the greatest political yarn spinners for generations to come.Concealing his hatred of Communism, not Socialism, with humor and perhaps the most poignant political moment in history, when we realize that Boxer is headed to the glue factory and not to the promised green pastures for his retirement, we understand the true nature and lethal danger of totalitarian politics left unchecked.Most who read Animal Farm will look quickly to the farms and the characters as representations of life in post-revolution communist Russia under Stalin. Perhaps they will expand the political commentary to include more modern totalitarian regimes, as well they should. But, Orwell's greatest contribution is not the recasting of Stalin's absolute abuse of his power, but the way in which the people, the masses, were lead down the absolute wrong path by the subtle manipulation of ideas. Animal Farm is more than a denunciation of a political system it is a call to the literacy, political awareness, and participation one must have in any political system in order to avoid the inevitable corruption of power. A must and continuous read."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Book is Fiction story, But sounds pretty accurate when describing the current situation and past situations of the world, and what could happen when You have Populist Leaders Emerge.The Pigs in the story are a Metaphor for Communism and Socialism and Why It never works.

The book is written as fiction, but essentially it's not. If you wish to understand Orwell's mind read this work, which is disguised as a tale, as true history. This outstanding title is written in such a concise and brilliant manner that it deserves to be remembered by all future generations.Now I want to briefly summarize the work itself. It is about the Russian Revolution of 1917. On one of the farms in England animals decide to orchestrate a revolt against their owner. All the infamous characters of those tumultuous times - Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Leon Trotsky, Russian secret police - are here ingenuously depicted. Orwell the literary mastermind had decided to portray the Bolshevik bureaucrats as pigs, which was unbelievably accurate. The oldest pig (Lenin) on the farm had incited all the others to rebel against the \`oppressive' regime, and then he died. The animals carried out the plan and gained their \`independence'. Eventually the farm animals (common people) granted the pigs (Bolsheviks) absolute power. However, one of the pigs (Stalin), who yearned to be the ultimate ruler, purged the other pig (Trotsky) and started to spread propaganda about him. The former became a dictator and the latter was detested by everyone, because the wicked lies about him were believed.Years passed and the whole farm began to decline, economically and psychologically. All the animals started to realize that life was better before the revolution (during the Tsarist Russia). Meanwhile, the pigs behaved like pigs: retaining dogs (Cheka, Russian secret police of those times) as personal bodyguard, changing the constitution whenever it suited them, and having business relations with people, which was one of the most horrendous violations of their fundamental principles. The author delivered his thorough design until the very last sentence: when the pigs and humans were playing cards, a dispute erupted, and while they were screaming at each other their faces contorted so much that it was impossible to tell them apart.As has become obvious by now that I highly recommend this book. But once again, read it as one of the genuine versions of the Russian Revolution and the beginning of the Bolshevik tyranny.Good day to you."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"George Orwell is a great writer. Showing how the best of intentions lead to bad things. His description of the pigs show his feelings about Stalin and Trotsky. This is the best anti-communist novel besides the author's 1984."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"With the end of the Cold War, Animal Farm, so clearly modelled on the Russian Revolution, may have lost the urgency it once had. (I first read the book as a high-school student in the mid-1970s.) Nevertheless, the course of the revolution described in Animal Farm is characteristic of so many modern Western revolutions, beginning, of course, with the French Revolution. It remains a brilliant, cautionary tale about the perils of attempting to bring about the eschaton on terms that are compatible with secular modernity (or postmodernity)."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"George Orwell - best known for his seering criticisms of totalitarianism - does it again with Animal Farm. Here the reader will see the struggle between ideals and personal power play out in a quiet corner of the English countryside. After suffering under the cruel rule of man, an old boar named Major reveals a vision that came to him in the night - a dream where every animal is able to live in both comfort and dignity. This excites the animals so greatly that soon they oust man from the farm and set up their own utopia.Orwell, of course, wrote Animal Farm as an indictment of Communist Russia. Like 1984, the observant reader will notice that allusions, references and parallels between Animal Farm and the totalitarian Russia abound. Many of the characters symbolize historical characters like Stalin, Trotsky and Lenin.It's kind of strange, looking back to the time at which this was written. Stalin was a great ally of America against the Nazis, and most people didn't want to upset that with 'philosophical' differences. There was also the a section of America infatuated with the 'Great Experiment' of Russia, such as that of Upton Sinclair and his character who toils under the 'evils' of capitalism, stating only that 'I will work harder.' Orwell felt it only fair, I think, that communism be shown as it was without romantic ideal. Animal Farm is a tale for all ages. Check it out."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm was a very good book. Although it got of to a slow start at first, when I was finished, I was glad I read it. I feel that Snowball was the better leader. That he was NOT a dictator. The poor other animals had to have Napoleon as a dictator. They had to watch as Napoleon and his dogs had a massacre. And Napoleon worked them way to hard. Napoleon was a liar and a cheat. Those poor animals did nothing wrong. The book was very good because of the way George Orwell set it up. With the main animals representing someone of great importance of that time. I recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"\\"Animal Farm\\" is a great favorite for many good reasons. It's language is clear and precise. It's story is well- told. The animals who are the chief characters are depicted with clarity, and act as humans would. In fact that is the point. The story of the animals is the story of the humans. And the story of the animal's takeover of the Jones Family Farm is the story of the People's take over of Russia, away from its Czarist lords.And the celebration of the new equality which lasts so briefly is the glorious dawn of the Russian Revolution 1917. And the two clever - pigs (Snowball- Trotsky?) and Napoleon (Stalin? ) soon take advantage of their new - made power to exploit the other animals .The pigs become the oppressors, the animals persecute other animals. The Revolution brings back oppression and persecution only now in a worse way, because it is done by one's fellow animals. The most moving part of this is what happens to the faithful hard- working animals, the workhorse whose loyalty and hard- work do not bring a new world or redemption.This work is a wonderful easy read with vivid one- dimensional characters . And the animal/ human parallelism plays in a beautiful way to underscore the less than human in the human, and perhaps the more than animal in the animals.\\"All animals are equal and some animals are more equal than others\\" The statement of liberation becomes the statement of oppression. The would- be- revolutionaries become the new dictators .And Orwell at the end leaves us no way out , as if the human story is an animal farm with no exit."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This book isn't about animals ruling the world.

Some may say that it's better to read the book without the illustrations, letting the imagination run free, but I remember being so powerfully moved by this illustrated copy.

We had to explain the significance of the quote as it reflects the Russian Revolution. There is so much depth to this book! The first time I read it, I saw the superficial level- story about animals, good, bad, ugly. It was great. Then, as I read it twice and then a third time, I got more out of it than I ever imagined.

The narrative centres around farmyard animals who uprise and overthrow their cruel master Mr Jones to live in a utopian society where \\"all animals are equal\\". The short novel outlines how good the Communist idea was intended to be, and how cruel it could become in the hands of a dictator.PositivesIn Politics and the English Language, George Orwell denotes that successful authors should : \\"Never use a long word where a short one will do\\". He applied this rule to Animal Farm and made the book accessible to any audience by doing so ; if read in depth, can be taken as the historical allegory of the fall of Communism in Russia during the years under Stalins' dictatorship, or read simply can be taken merely as a childhood fable (albiet not a very happy one). The book can be understood by children who don't need to understand the political message. The simpleness and grace of the prose of the book easily portrays the tragedy behind the story. The reader is hooked from the strong beginning and will find it easy to read in a couple of hours; Animal Farm is only 10 chapters long! I took History at A Level (I'm so cool, I know) so I think this is why I enjoyed the book, because I was aware of the history behind it. Orwell captures the characters of the political leaders he is satiring well ; Old Major is Karl Marx, with the first idea of Communism, Snowball is Lenin and Napoleon is Stalin. He also portrays the cruelty of how the Russian people were treated very concisely and chillingly; for example the execution of the rebellious chickens. A must-read book, that was well ahead of its time and can be read and allegorised to the majority of governments in society today.NegativesThe character development was sacrified in favour of the narrative ; the majority of the characters are not fleshed out as well as I personally would have liked. Also, the chronological order of the events in the book are incorrect (the Trials, predominantly) compared to the history from which the story is derived. This novel is definately not for younger children as the depiction of animal cruelty is quite rife.ConclusionA personal favourite of mine, a book that was forced upon me and led me to my love of George Orwell. Animal Farm is written so simply yet cleverly, so it can be seen as a contemporary parody and satire of the British and American governments or as a timeless allogory of the Soviet Union, or in some respects Nazi Germany. The book is timeless, and will stay in your mind forever.By Nicola Cousen"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I come from a country oppressed by a disguised form of socialism. It is instead communism, the old one. I was impressed on how our own reality is pictured so very well in this book. I couldn't finish it, I read it in two afternoons.A classic to give as a gift to someone that doesn't actually grasp the sad reality they live in."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Orwell is taking one step more here than in \\"1984\\". He describes the rebellion of the animals of a farm against the brutal, steadily drunken farmer who exploits and oppresses them violently. The usurpation against this rule of violence is successful. But to fight the evil it does not mean to attain the emergence of the good.When in 1917 the Bolschewiki and Menschewiki overthrew Czarist Russia they removed a system that had brought for most of the people only hardly bearable conditions. In their place they set a regimen with an ideology that promised a wonderful future but created more terrible conditions than had ever existed before. The same goes with the animals on the farm. The freed ones installed a much worse rule. This happens not at once, it is a creeping and scaringly not avoidable process!Is this the fate of any free order, that it deteriorates into dictatorship? Is this what Orwell wants to tell us? Not quite! He is about showing us that this is only inevitable when the conscience for freedom values is undermined. But then it might be an imperceptible process which is all the more successful in case of a skilled use of language. The individuals should get accustomed to the wrong and adopt it. This makes them assessable. In the end they have no more own voice and bleat \\"mee\\" and \\"moo\\" in lockstep until they can be lead to the butcher unresistantly. At first it is the turn of the unadopted, but in the end all others are in for it, even the rascals. They leave a desert behind. Enough examples in the younger history! Especially the 20th century has excelled in the realization of much promising but less promise keeping ideologies, whose devastating effects will last long.Orwell\`s book is an appeal to all to understand and treasure the freedom rights of man as superior sanctity of human possession and to restore them as the most precious good that people have. He hopes that man is wise enough to do it. It is a pious hope.Freedom is always endangered if one or a group of people, a party, a majority etc. has the presumption to connote oneself as only owner of \\"truth\\". And freedom is getting lost, if it becomes a political will, transformed and applied by the power holders. Ideologies promise always to bring people to their true greatness. In truth they belittle them to unrecognizability. This can be seen in our times in Islam how it is lived by the Islamists where the individual is nothing, although promised paradise. Already Friedrich H&ouml;lderlin had said: \\"It were always those who made the world a hell who promised to make it paradise.\\"\\"Animal farm\\" is thrilling though you know in the beginning how it ends."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"It really doesn't get much better than this.

He was a socialist and even fought for a socialist political party, the POUM, during the Spanish Civil War. POUM, incidentally, means \\"Workers Party of Marxist Unification\\". It was formed by the Spanish supporters of deposed Russian revolutionaries Leon Trotsky and Nikolai Bukharin. Orwell's famous novels \\"1984\\" and \\"Animal Farm\\" aren't anti-socialist either. However, they have been interpreted in that manner by many Americans, who apparently think that Orwell was some kind of Cold Warrior.You can see these misinterpretations in the customer reviews here at Amazon. Weirdly, \\"Animal Farm\\" has also been misunderstood by some as a children's story about nice little animals. Gee, guys, it's a political allegory for adults for crying out load!It's also interesting that many of the reviewers read the book in high school, which indicates that their teachers didn't get it either. My English-language teacher was a real Tory, but she did get it. I guess she assumed that telling the truth about \\"Animal Farm\\" makes the novel more interesting, which it sure does.\\"Animal Farm\\" is anti-Stalinist, not \\"anti-socialist\\". Orwell believed in democratic, revolutionary socialism. He may have been nave, of course, but that was his actual position. In the novel, the oppressed animals of a certain farm stage a rebellion against the farmer, Jones. The rebellion is the Russian revolution, while Jones symbolizes the Czar. The animals are led by Old Major, a pig who symbolizes both Lenin and Marx. After the death of Old Major, a battle for control ensues between the pigs Napoleon and Snowball, obviously based on Stalin and Trotsky. The name \\"Napoleon\\" for the Stalinist pig is presumably based on Trotsky's accusation that Stalin was a \\"Bonapartist\\". Here, Orwell made an intentional or unintentional mistake, since the Marxist term \\"Bonapartism\\" originally referred to Louis Bonaparte, not Napoleon Bonaparte. (Of course, Orwell might have chosen the name for a more mundane reason: just as Napoleon \\"betrayed\\" the French revolution, so Stalin \\"betrayed\\" the Russian revolution.)In the novel, the pig Napoleon emerges victorious, and transforms the liberated Animal Farm into a new system of oppression by a combination of violence, propaganda and deceit. He also gradually changes the message of Old Major, eventually replacing his commandment \\"All animals are equal\\" with the classic line \\"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others\\". In the last chapter, Napoleon's pig faction negotiates with humans, and as the other animals are looking in, they realize that the Napoleonic pigs have become so similar to humans, that they are impossible to tell apart. (In the novel, humans symbolize capitalists or monarchists.) Another classical part of the novel deals with the old horse Boxer, who symbolizes the Russian working class. Boxer is eventually sent away to the glue factory by Napoleon.In other words, it's a novel claiming that the true principles of Marx and Lenin were betrayed by Stalin. Neither more nor less. Deal with it.At the same time, both \\"Animal Farm\\" and \\"1984\\" are very pessimistic. I suspect Orwell became demoralized at the end of his life. \\"1984\\" describes a society that combines the worst aspects of capitalism and Stalinism, a society many intellectuals at the time believed was quite possible. The British working class is depicted in a very unfavourable way, and the only real resistance to Big Brother comes from individuals of the middle class. \\"Animal Farm\\" also contains veiled attacks on the working class. For instance, the old horse Boxer is sympathetic but stupid. And it's Boxer who symbolizes the workers... There are also unsympathetic sheep, who uncritically follow Napoleon. Finally, there is the smart but cynical donkey Benjamin, who some people believe symbolizes George Orwell himself!And now, let the attacks begin..."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"A fairy tale or a nightmare?

It is an incredibly short book, so if you've also been putting it off, you can get to it soon.The historical context in this allegorical tale is the rise of Marxism in Europe, especially of the figures Stalin and Trotsky. The animals on a farm decide to overthrown their human owners to create their own society where from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs. We all know how this worked out in the history of Russia (and China, and elsewhere), and this book clearly maps this arc, as the revolutionaries trade one unfair regime for another.Orwell's 1984 gave us lots of phrases. Animal Farm gave us a couple, too, and you may recognize them as your read them.Some may consider the book dated. After all, any serious attempts at pure Marxism are gone forever. Every first-world nation has some mixed system of socialism and capitalism. A balance has been struck, that of free(ish) trade backed with a safety net, regulation, and government-built infrastructure. In America we like to toot our horn at how non-socialist we are compared to Europe, but really it's just a matter of degrees and implementation. None of us are willing to see people die in the streets, so we do a little (more or less) take care of those who cannot take care of themselves.This book warns of dangers that one might think are long past. But I would argue otherwise -- not that I expect a sudden Marxist uprising, nor do I expect a slow takeover by the commies. Quite the opposite, in fact.Towards the end of Animal Farm, I was suddenly struck by how this book could equally apply to those living in a semi-socialist society (like ours) who decide to buck off The Man (the government) in favor of a new system (unfettered capitalism) where everyone supposedly owns more of their own stuff and makes more of their own choices, but end up with the same old oppression.This cycle is not limited to Marxism - the powerful will try to grab or keep power using lies. A century ago, it was, \\"Capitalism is bad, socialism is good!\\" Capitalism indeed was corrupt and abusive on many levels. So socialism rose (even in America).Decades go by, and as socialism became a powerful idea and attracted the powerful, the chant became, \\"Socialism is bad, capitalism is good!\\" Socialism is reigned in and balanced now (what remains is that which was successful, like Social Security here, and NHS in England). Yet the refrain keeps being shouted. Socialism hasn't been a danger since the late 70s, yet Socialism is still the Great Enemy, safety nets have been and continue to be removed, and regulations have been and continue to be thrown from the shoulders of the rich.All these years, the farm animals keep on getting screwed, believing one day it is the socialists screwing them, and the next, the capitalists screwing them. (These days, think Tea Party vs the Occupy Movement.) Sometimes, these groups are right (more or less), until they push the pendulum too far in the other direction.And usually, it is the group they are taught to love who is really screwing them (or will eventually be screwing them). It is the corrupt and those who have enough power who can teach the people who to love and hate.Orwell offers no solutions in Animal Farm. Like 1984, this is merely a cautionary tale. One we can apply today. We should always keep an eye on both the government AND business to see which is making a grab for the most power in any given year. We can love capitalism for its benefits, and hate it for its flaws. Likewise, we can love socialism for its benefits, hate it for its flaws. If we can break the shackles of blindness and ignorance, we can fix the flaws as they arise, and admit to the benefits of both systems.We live in a democratic republic, which means we have the freedom to keep the powerful and corrupt in check. As long as we're not deluded by the lies."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Once written as a parody of the communist system, it actually works just as well as a contemporary parody of Corporate America. The pigs are ingrained in the corporate culture - from Wall Street to Big-Box-Marts - and there is no shortage of dumb horses working to death to support them. Certainly not the author's intent, but an extension that makes sense to anyone who has seen how small cliques of egomaniacs have managed to plunder the companies they drove into bankruptcy. Barring an unexpected accelerated evolution of human nature, this is a classic that will forever remain relevant (and entertaining)."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"to all whom might be interested,my husband read this novel as a young boy and loved it.as our eldest daughter,who is eleven,really enjoys reading,he recommendedshe give it a try.well,she love it too and thinks it is well worth the read.enjoy readingmrs sj allsopp"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"The plot was based on the beginning of the Soviet Union in animal form. It shows how the Soviet Union was started by a rebellion against oppressive rules, the soviets as the pigs did by that it would be better if they had them ruling but then it ended up having it be worst than it was when the Tsar's were in power.One of my favorite things about this book was how the different people were portrayed by the animals; having the Communist being the pigs and the original owner of the farm being the Human (Tsar). I also really was enthusiastic about the ending. Its one the few books that is interesting the whole way through and has a good ending.I would highly recommend this book to anyone with a highly biased mind, and enjoys political humor. Though it may offend any hardcore Liberal/Communists, but all other political parties will find this book funny and interesting just any other George Orwell's books."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Georg Orwell's ANIMAL FARM is an easy to read novel which exposes the inherent contradictions of Big Communism and the dynamics of \\"Dog Eat Dog Communism.\\" To paraphrase the late James J. Martin, this is one of the most clever political satires since GULLIVER'S TRAVELS.The novel begins with an uprising of farm animals against the farmer (the capitalist), and the uprising is in the name of the exploited animals (the Proletariat). The two leaders of this revolution are Napolean and Snowball (Joesph Stalin and Leon Trotsky) whereby Snowball is eventually killed in a power struggle. Readers should note the Napolean and Snowball are pigs which may be an apt description.Napolean and his supporters very quickly let the other animals know \\"who is boss.\\" In asserting the superiority of the pigs, language is distorted whereby, All animals are equal. Pigs are more equal.\\" Those animals who helped engineer the overthrow the farmer are quickly disciplined into their second class status, and Napolean entrehches his authority.Those who view the Angels of Light (the capitalists) and the Angels of Darkness (the wicked communists) are in for a surprise. Orwell portrays Napolean as \\"doing business\\" with farmers (the capitalists)and threatens any of the animals with repirsal.The novel concludes with a feast which includes the pigs (the communists) and the farmers (the capitalists). Some scholars argue that this may have been a reflection on the Yalta Conference in 1945 when Stalin & co. supposedly cooperated with the capitalistic western leaders toward the end of World War II. The other animals view this banquet with suspicion as they cannot distingush between their recent enemies, the capitalists, and the pigs or the communists.Orwell's short novel should attract any reader with \\"residual common sense. In a short, clever novel Orwell's blast at Big Communism is easy to follow. There have been long studies of the capitalistic West subsidizing the Soviet regime. For example, Anthony Sutton wrote several such studies, and his WALL STREET AND THE BOLSHEVIK REVOLUTION is probably his best. Yet, one can get the same connection by reading ANIMAL FARM."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I think Animal Farm was interesting in that fact that it was based on Russia's history.

Animals in this story show how different people in different 'ranking' of our society is treated and acts differently. Read this book and see what animal represent you the most.

Since it is a fairy tale, I assume people can derive from it whatever message they wish. I believe Animal Farm to be an accurate, albeit accelerated, would-be history of the path of socialism and other idealistic utopian schemes. The book is short and easy to read.

Orwell's self-proclaimed goal was to, &quot;make political writing into an art&quot;. Did he succeed in &quot;Animal Farm&quot;? Yes. Maybe not in anyway that will take your breath away, but he certainly did far more than simply feed us another dose of political rhetoric. He made us enjoy it. He did an extraordinary job of fitting his agenda into this unusual medium, and making it largely amusing. Stylistically, &quot;Animal Farm&quot; imitates a fairytale, and does it spectacularly well. That isn't to say that it's a thing for children. It's much too dark for that. Orwell writes &quot;Animal Farm&quot; using both extended narrative and long passages of exposition to best advantage. While I dislike both of those things, he can't realistically be criticized for either. He was simply remaining faithful to the mold of a classic Fairytale. The characters are thin to an extreme, but even that can't be considered a fault. Again, he remains faithfully within the bounds of his chosen form. Each character fulfills its role and none of them ever violates the bounds of their purpose. Is &quot;Animal Farm&quot; a perfect story? Maybe not, but it's very well done and deserves every speck of the praise it's received from other reviewers. Is it one of my all time favorites? No. It didn't hold my interest strongly enough. Is it worth the time I spent reading it? Definitely."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I think this book is good for peolpe who like Geagraphy,because it talks about an history.people who like geagraphy would like this book because it talk about that caminiseum and it also fun for people who like geagraphy."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"when i first heard of this book thought it would very kiddy and kinda stupid, but once i had read two pages of it i knew it was the exact oppisite of what i had thought.the first part set's the mood for the whole story it is basedon the russian revolution.

In fact, I think we all are in a way, right now. And I think we're all like the pigs to in a way. Who really thinks himself equal to all others, you take what you can, and if you don't then only because it gives you an advantage in another way!

The equation of pigs with the Bolsheviks, the pig Napoleon with Stalin and Snowball with Trotsky is ultimately quite unnecessary to enjoyment of the story - exactly like 'Gulliver's Travels'. Yet the point was not lost on the people of the 1940s, nor on the oppressed people of Eastern Europe and Russia, who read the book in secret. Nor was the point lost on fellow-travellers in the West who made Orwell struggle to have it published. This is the only English book (along with 1984) guaranteed to have been read by every Russian dissident. That in itself is a monument to Orwell.

But certain groups among the animals(the pigs), begin taking over, assuming superiority over the other animals and becoming the very human masters they all despised in the first place. Throughout the book, the pigs twist the law to their own ends, manipulating the ignorant and trusting nature of the other animals. The book offers an interesting peek into what might actually happen if the anarchists had their way, and how even the most \\"fair\\" of situations, and \\"fairest\\" of people, are fallible, and eventually become corrupt.

However, this was not obvious at first. First one society (the animals) overthrew another (the owners of Manor Farm) in a rebellion they felt they put off for too long. After years of turmoil, they finally got the courage to act on what they felt and rebel against their cruel owners (pg. 21-23). In celebration of their victory, and to show that their harsh captivity was over, they burned, destroyed and buried all the objects that were a symbol of their terrible past: whips, chains, cuffs (pg. 23-24). Their new society based on Animalism was doing fine, at first. Their living conditions were at their highest, they had goals for the future, and all the animals were treated fairly equally. Soon, though, the two leaders, Napoleon and Snowball, could no longer ignore each other's differences and Napoleon overthrew Snowball. Under Napoleon's rule, the society began to crumble. The work load of the animals increased, they got less food, and the punishments were cruel. Most of all, the pigs abused their power and became unfair to the animals under them. In conclusion, this story is an example of a society under dictatorship with cruel leaders, hungry for power."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This is a classic book and a must read for anyone who is interested in history or politics.

As the book goes along however one can see how certain animals abuse their power.This is a great book for many reasons but mainly because it is easy to read and understand the links Orwell is making to communism.

I found it amusing how pigs (of all animals) could rise above the rest to become dictators. George Orwell did a fantastic job in linking the pigs to communism.

He was such a good guy (horse) that after the glue factory incident I lost all my respect for Napoleon, Squealer and the rest of the christmas hams.Since I finished the book I have not looked at any animal- tame or wild- in the same way. I was supposed to help my grandpa slaughter cows, but I just couldn't after what they did yo me favorite horse, Boxer. I have treated all animals with the utmost respect, with the exception of pigs.

So many political movements try to place the blame for the class system or pecking order on the system they are fighting, when in truth it's a basic facet of human nature. Under communist rule, nations merely trade one elite for another--the bourgeoisie for the Party \\"central committees\\". Human nature at its current stage of evolution is not ready for equality. We must never confuse resentment at being lower than we might prefer in the \\"food chain\\" with a bona fide belief in equality. It's not the same, as revolutions have proven again and again. The classic saying \\"everyone is created equal, but some are more equal than others\\" originated right here in these pages. The allegory to that in this book is the way the pigs lead the \\"revolution\\" against the human farmer, and become the new ruling class in the process. As with communism, this is done with a lot of \\"progressive\\" doctrine and holier-than-thou pontificating--put 'em under your thumb and make them think they like it. The definition of \\"treason\\" or \\"sedition\\" remains the same--disagreement with the status quo.

A story about how power can drive an animal, or a person, to do things that they'd never think of doing. A dispute between leaders and the ruining of a utopian dream.

What could have been a very moving story comes off as being dry, flat, and ultimately forgettable. While the message behind the book is a valid one, I found myself feeling like I was reading the Reader's Digest version of the book when I read it. Orwell seems to give a fact-by-fact summary of the book which makes it extremely difficult to feel connected with the story, much less the characters. One really should feel something towards the characters - whether it be admiration or disgust, but I found after reading it I did not feel much of anything towards the lot of them. All in all, it seems that Orwell is simply trying to get his point across rather than actually telling a story. One's better off reading a history book, because that's basically all Animal Farm focuses on - which is unfortunate, because this could have been a really interesting and moving story, and it isn't."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"George Orwell's little warm-up to the much-superior *1984*. Indeed, if you've read the latter, there's no urgent need to read *Animal Farm*, as this book contains much of the same ideas, only here they're presented in a condescending &quot;fairy tale&quot; format involving farm animals. I say &quot;condescending&quot; because while the prose is superficially geared toward kids, the book is obviously for adult readers, and it becomes a trial to be lectured at as if you're eight years old. The book has more value for eight-year-olds anyway: at least they might get hooked by the plot without having to worry about the author's bitter politics.Conservatives who champion Orwell in general and this book in particular are either misreading the author, or don't know Orwell's political background, or -- much worse -- PURPOSEFULLY misreading him. The key to understanding this book is that Trotsky, who is represented here by the pig Snowball, is the HERO. Orwell really believed in that enlightened socialist stuff. The character of Josef Stalin, played by the pig Napoleon, is supposed to be a BETRAYAL of the socialist ideal. Of course, what actually comes through is the author's reductivist view of humankind (or in this case, animalkind). This bitterness toward the infinite stupidity of Man has been transferred by Orwell's readers onto socialism in general, understandably enough . . . but that's really missing the point. The author's INTENTION -- as opposed to what he actually wrote -- was to tell us what went wrong with Stalinist Russia, NOT what went wrong with socialism itself. Reading the work this way permits a clearer understanding of the ending, with its &quot;capitalist pigs&quot; regnant and communing with their fellow capitalist farmers. Orwell saw little difference between a communist oligarchy like Stalin's and your average capitalist country. In either system, his idealized &quot;Boxers&quot; and &quot;Clovers&quot; (the workhorses of the book) get the shaft. But even he knew these mythical &quot;workers&quot; were an idealization . I believe that deep down, Orwell suspected we are, all of us, like the sheep in this story. (The sheep will turn up again in *1984* as the &quot;proles&quot;.) As such, it strikes me that Orwell wasn't just fooling his readers . . . he was fooling himself.Frankly, I find such misanthropy to be a pretty cowardly reaction to the problems of humanity, and am inclined to give *Animal Farm* an even lower rating than the Three Stars I have given it. But credit must be extended to the book's longevity, so Three Stars it is. (Perhaps the credit should be extended to the several generations of 9th Grade English teachers who have forced millions of puberty-stricken kids to read the book.)"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"My son needed this book for college english class.He has to do a 6-8 page research paper on it.He likes the book so far.

Our utopia is a Constitutional Republic.At first, everthign works great. We have freedom, we have respect for rights, and we have an honest money and trade system. All people are equals, and each is free to produce and live an abundant life.But, slowly, over time, the principles (the commandments) are abused. The treachery is hidden from public view. The pigs (congressmen) treat themselves to extravagant spending. The executive wages war and rallies support for its stupidity initiatives (space flight, war, socialism). Congress, in alliance with the money/banking powers, establishes fradudlent paper money, illegal and fradulent banking systems, and our economy is reduced to a unproductive series of accounting gimmicks. When times get bad, we go to war.Now we are left with a system of government far worse that that of the original England. We embrace socialism with a eagerness not even shown in Russia.We THINK we're free, we think we have justice, we think we have open and free elections, we think we have a real economy. All lies, all told to keep up the morale of the working class for the benefit of the elite. The business of the government in America has been to (unconstitutionally) wage war, and to lie to the most people in a believable way. The government views it's function as a propaganda mnachine, to keep people believign in the fantasy, for the benefit of the fradulent financial elite. All while the underlying \\"doctrine\\" is ignored. All while the judiciary looks the other way regarding the \\"commandments\\", theconstitution.

George Orwell's intriguing beginning of this book earned my first star. It all starts out on a cold night when Mr. Jones goes in the house without noticing that the gate to the animal barn was left unlocked. This automatically got my imagination zooming on what could happen with the gate unlocked. The farm has a pig resident named Old Major. His real name is Willingdon Beauty. He is a prize winning middle-white boar OWNED by Mr. Jones. He has thick fur/hair with black and white spots. Old Major likes to share his dreams with the farm, because he feels that they have great and powerful meanings. He is very respected on the farm. The detail in this book is so grand. George Orwell does a great job explaining the farm when he describes Old Majors' living space. The detailing earned two more of the four stars. Most books you read only give settings at some of the locations in the book, but, this book details almost every change of setting. The fourth and final star I give this book goes to the author's credit. He deserves this star for putting forth the effort to give us this amazing piece of literature.The only reason I did not give this book a fifth star is because no book is perfect, there is always things that can be added to it. I would have liked to have felt a happier atmosphere or lighter feeling while reading the book. I give this book an age rating of eight and up.

The animals can all talk and they don't like to be pushed around by the humans. Because of this they turn on the humans and drive them away from the farm. Then the pigs take charge, and make up rules for the farm. These rules are called the seven commandments. One of them is Four Legs Good, Two Legs Bad. The whole farm follows these rules. The reason I rated this book so poorly was because it was boring. It took me days to finish even though it is a short book.

I expected nothing more than another great work by George Orwell, whose book 1984 was nothing short of a masterpiece. But let me tell you, Animal Farm is a disgrace. It is nothing more than an ameture application of talking farm animals to characters in the Russian Revolution. Nothing more. Nothing new. Honestly, it is simply that simple: farm animals applied to a historical account of the Russian Revolution; this is the extent of the so-called 'symbolysm'. If i wished to simply apply idiotic and stupid talking pigs, dogs and horses to the Nazis, France and the US in World War II, my 'masterpiece' would be equally as good as this 'symbolic work of art'. I find it tragic that people believe that something so simple and dumbfounded is 'symbolism', and that something so unbearably torturously difficult to read can be considered 'great' only because it integrates lowly 'symbolism'.

It is a prequel to 1984, although the characters are different in the books, Animal Farm tells of how a tyrant can come to power, while 1984 tells of what happens when that power is firmly in place. The story goes like this. Mr. Jones is the human master of Manor Farm, a place where all animals are misfed, mistreated, and wanting a change. An old pig, Major, stirs the animals into action to start their own rule. But when this happens and Napoleon takes control, conditions return to the way they were, opression as the pigs grow fat and the other animals starve, the pigs break the commandments the revolution was founded on, and the animals can not revolt or even speak their mind.

He describes the rebellion of the animals of a farm against the brutal, steadily drunken farmer who exploits and oppresses them violently. The usurpation against this rule of violence is successful. But to fight the evil it does not mean to attain the emergence of the good.When in 1917 the Bolschewiki and Menschewiki overthrew Czarist Russia they removed a system that had brought for most of the people only hardly bearable conditions. In their place they set a regimen with an ideology that promised a wonderful future but created more terrible conditions than had ever existed before. The same goes with the animals on the farm. The freed ones installed a much worse rule. This happens not at once, it is a creeping and scaringly not avoidable process!Is this the fate of any free order, that it deteriorates into dictatorship? Is this what Orwell wants to tell us? Not quite! He is about showing us that this is only inevitable when the conscience for freedom values is undermined. But then it might be an imperceptible process which is all the more successful in case of a skilled use of language. The individuals should get accustomed to the wrong and adopt it. This makes them assessable. In the end they have no more own voice and bleat \\"mee\\" and \\"moo\\" in lockstep until they can be lead to the butcher unresistantly. At first it is the turn of the unadopted, but in the end all others are in for it, even the rascals. They leave a desert behind. Enough examples in the younger history! Especially the 20th century has excelled in the realization of much promising but less promise keeping ideologies, whose devastating effects will last long.Orwell\`s book is an appeal to all to understand and treasure the freedom rights of man as superior sanctity of human possession and to restore them as the most precious good that people have. He hopes that man is wise enough to do it. It is a pious hope.Freedom is always endangered if one or a group of people, a party, a majority etc. has the presumption to connote oneself as only owner of \\"truth\\". And freedom is getting lost, if it becomes a political will, transformed and applied by the power holders. Ideologies promise always to bring people to their true greatness. In truth they belittle them to unrecognizability. This can be seen in our times in Islam how it is lived by the Islamists where the individual is nothing, although promised paradise. Already Friedrich H&ouml;lderlin had said: \\"It were always those who made the world a hell who promised to make it paradise.\\"\\"Animal farm\\" is thrilling though you know in the beginning how it ends."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Years after its publication ANIMAL FARM continues to bridge the gap between great parody and a good animal story.The setting is a farm taken over in an animal revolution from the human owner. The pigs on the farm become the ruling class in this \\"classless\\" society. The farm endures an abortive invasion by the humans and gradually devolves into a society similar to the old one that was overthrown with the humans allying with the pig elite. Enough said about the plot. This book today is seen by many as a children's story as some publishers saw it when Orwell first approached them. As the memory of the Soviet Union fades into history this book will lose its edge as political parody.The story of ANIMAL FARM is actually the history of the Soviet state between 1917 and the death of Stalin. The secession of Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin can easily be seen in the story as can the the tyranny of the ruling Politburo. ANIMAL FARM was probably influenced by Orwell's experience in the Spanish Civil War remembered in HOMAGE TO CATALONIA- a bitter story of Communist double dealings against the Left. The chapters in HOMAGE TO CATALONIA that deal with the labyrinthine left politics of the Spanish Republic are echoed in ANIMAL FARM.ANIMAL FARM raises the same disturbing questions that HOMAGE raised with me when I read it. The tyrant pigs who run the farm are, paradoxically, the ones who save it from the humans and the ones who organize and exploit it. The Soviet Union with its meagre help bought time for the Spanish Republic, advanced the Soviet state's interest in maintaining its military alliance with France, and at the same time prevented a real revolution in Spain. A revolution that could have created a weak Spain possibly occupied by the Nazi war machine. A war machine that would have dominated the western flank of British Egypt and Malta.The West benefited from the tyranny of Stalin with a destructive second front against Hitler. The farm, with the political machinations of the pigs, was defended from a far worse human tyranny. Was Orwell guilty of aloofness from Realpolitik or did he have excessive idealism? Is the worldview of ANIMAL FARM realistic? Was Orwell a reactionary in red sheep's clothing?The impact of this book was seen as huge and potentially destabilizing when published in 1946. The US Army in Bavaria restricted distribution to then Soviet occupied zones for fears that it would provoke the ire of the Russians. So much for calling Stalin a pig.A student of history and readers who like animal stories will find this book enduring."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"After reading this book, I was shocked on how well this book was written.

(lol)I read the book when I was 16. I liked it well enough. The thing is: I read 'Animal Farm' AFTER '1984', so the themes were somewhat repetitious to me.I didn't read these books as part of a school reading project, mind you. I was just really into dystopian-style books. Actually, my English teacher sparked my obsession with 'Brave New World' which was a welcome and much-appreciated change from the 'Bronte' sisters!I can say with total honesty that 'Jane Eyre' is the only book that has ever put me to sleep! You have to understand the significance of that statement. I mean, this is coming from someone who took Acctg I & II. And anyone taking accounting courses (even intro) know dry material when they see it. 'Jane Eyre' is simply not my style, I suppose. But all in all, it's still one tough and boring read.LOLBIG anyway, don't get me wrong -- I 'got' the message (of animal farm). Still doesn't make a difference. Just wasn't that blown away by it.

With \\"Moby Dick,\\" for example, I would have dumbed down some of the cetology talk, deleted Bulkington, and fixed up the abrupt about-face with Queequeg's \\"long last dive.\\" With \\"David Copperfield,\\" I would have the style more expansive, not so crabbed. \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" leaves much unresolved in the denouement, awaiting a sequel that never came.

I wouldn't change a word. I read it when I was a kid -- it blew me away. Reading it in middle age, it still blows me away.As for the edition I'm trying to review, the deluxe hardback \\"Everyman's Library,\\" there's just one omission, in my view.Sure, there's a comprehensively helpful introduction by Julian Symons, a couple of different (but somehow superfluous) prefaces by Orwell, and even a chronology and textual note.

It is a thinly-veiled jab at tyrannical regimes and succeeds tremendously. I breezed through this one and honestly could find nothing wrong with it. The characters are all believable and quite a few are even highly likable. My favorite is the horse Boxer who is renowned for his strength, both of body and character. You have to kind of suspend your disbelief when reading Animal Farm because of some of the things that happen, but it is well worth it. The animals decide that the humans get all of the benefit for their hard work and they are tired of it. Led by two pigs, Napoleon and Snowball, they overthrow the humans. I won't give a bunch of spoilers, but the story unfolds in such a way as to show how a dictatorship comes to be and how the animals went from one form of slavery to another. I also think the character Squealer was done extremely well as far a propaganda man(pig). By the end of the tale, you can see and understand everything that has transpired and the moral stands on its own without you needing to be bashed over the head with it. For a great fairy-tale about the dangers of socialism or any other kind of bad government ending with \\"ism\\", look no further than Animal Farm, where \\"All animals are created equal, but some are more equal than others.\\""},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal farm is a classic read that is usually required throughout high school and entry level college classes. It is a short novel by George Orwell that is full of allegory and deals mostly with political corruption and the distortion of reality. The book itself is very easy to read and is quite short with approximately 100 pages. Two of the major themes in the book are the naive of the middle class and the manipulation of language to gain power.The book opens up with all the animals on the farm gathering to hear a dream by old boxer, a pig, about the animals living freely from human tyranny. In this society the animals were free and equal, and they keep what they worked for. Although Old Major died before his vision could be seen, two pigs took up after him, Snowball and Napoleon. Thus the next time they were treated horrible, a revolution occurs, and Jones and his wife were chased off the farm.At first the revolution was an amazing success. As a result the farm animals changed everything on the farm. They met every Sunday to debate farm politics, and developed seven basic rules that all animals must live by. Since the pigs were considered the most intelligence they automatically became the supervisor. Napoleon the leader of all the pigs became power hunger and lazy. With the help of Squealer, another pig he was able to convince the other farm animals that the pigs are always right.Two concepts that are fascinating in the novel are the power of words and the corruptions of power. There is a famous saying that goes, &#8220;power corrupts but absolute power corrupts absolutely&#8221;. This is proven true on every page of the novel. Napoleon lust for power took over him. He forces Snowball off the farm with the help of his trained secret dogs. Thus he was the smartest and only animal with total power on the farm. He also uses the dogs to get confession out of other animals and even killed them when they did not speak.Napoleon although cared nothing of the other animals decided to devote the animals&#8217; time in building a windmill. After the completion of the building of the mill a fight broke out on the farm in which the mill was destroy by the humans. Boxer, the horse who was in charge of the mill received serious injuries. Napoleon then sells Boxer to a glue boiler. The animals were curious of what happen to Boxer but Squealer convinced them then he was taken to a veterinarian hospital.As the years goes by on the farm, the seven commandments became one sole line &#8220;all animals are equal but some are more equal than others&#8221;. The pigs also completely changed, they began to act like humans, &#8220;walking upright, carrying whips and wearing clothes&#8221;. At the end of the novel the pigs invited a nearby farmer, Mr. Pilkington over for dinner. In which they discuss on ways of allying themselves against the working classes, both humans and animals alike.The novel seemingly ends just like how it started. The name of the farm was changed back to the Manor Farm. Corrupts individual were still in power, and the animals couldn't distinguish the animals from the humans."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This story is a great balance of easy reading and deep storyline. The writing style is simplistic, but the meaning behind it and the political implications are certainly not. After reading Farehnheit 451, it only seemed right to read another book that was once banned and considered controversial. Pretty amazing how both of these books pack such a hard message and contain such realistic fiction in less than 150 pages.To look at the book as fiction, as just a story (which is very hard to do), it's not amazing by any means, but the uniqueness of Animals overthrowing their master and starting live on their own is pretty enjoyable still.I don't know what else to say. 1400+ reviews are here for the book, and certainly there are better ones than mine, from more perceptive readers as well as people more familair with the historical sigficance.

Its not a long read and well worth the small effort required. Essentially, the animals on a farm kick out their human overlords and take over the running of the farm themselves. It turns out the pigs are the most intelligent, and end up managing the running of the farm. The corruption and politics of the pigs and the way they take advantage of the other animals becomes more and more extreme.This has some clear parallels with Nineteen Eighty Four too. The pigs rewrite history and convince the others that things happened differently to how they remember, and rewrite their '7 Commandments' subtly in their favour and so on.

Animals (common people in Russia) kicked out the farmer (the elite) and begin to form their own government after hearing Major (Marx or Lenin) about revolting against the cruelty of the farmer against the animals. Things went smoothly for a while as food is plentiful. However, Napoleon (Stalin) and Snowball (Trotsky) argues on how to govern the farm, which leads to Napoleon taking leadership after releasing trained vicious dogs to chase Snowball away. Things take a deep turn when Napoleon starts making the animals work for the pigs' benefit (the Communist party officials). This book is a good example on what happens when a revolution goes sour and corrupt leaders take over and the indifference and low knowledge of current events and happenings. The donkey, Benjamin is an example of the cynicism and the sheep are willing to do whatever Napoleon says. Illiteracy is a problem as very few animals can read.

According to Orwell, the book reflects events leading up to ad during the Stalin era before the Second World War. Orwell, a democratic socialist, was a critic of Joseph Stalin and hostile to Moscow-directed Stalinism. The novella uses anthropomorphic method of the revolution of the animal against the human being to show the time of the Communism in Russia and the truth of its revolution.The story is organized and developed by the animal's revolution. It starts with the facts Animals are not satisfied the life Mr. Jones provides to them, they are poorly treated, always hungry and get beat by him. Old Major, the old boar teaches the animals a revolutionary song, \\"Beasts of England\\". When Major dies, two young pigs, Snowball and Napoleon, assume command and lead the animal to take over the farm ran by the human. Here Mr. Jones (human)'s domination is an allegory of Tsar's government. Russian people were tortured by the governing of Tsar, so some pioneering Russians decided to lead the people to start a revolution, the Russian Civil War and built a communism country.After the revolution is successful and animal farm is built, they adopt Seven Commandments of Animalism, the most important of which is \\"All animals are equal\\". At first, Snowball teaches the animals to write and the foods are plentiful, but the conflict soon shows between Snowball and Napoleon. The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items. Napoleon takes the pups from the farm dogs and let his dogs chase Snowball away. He wants to be the only leader in this animal farm. Napoleon is an allegory for Joseph Stalin, and Snowball is the allegory of Leon Trotsky who was a major figure in the Russian Civil War, but because he opposed the policies and rise of Joseph Stalin, eventually he was expelled from the Communist Party, and finally deported from the Soviet Union. Stalin afterwards became the Premier of the Soviet Union.The growth of the conflict begins after Napoleon takes over the leadership. The pigs learn to walk upright like human and carry whips to torture the other animals to work for them. The Seven Commandments are reduced to a single phrase: \\"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others\\". Napoleon announces an alliance with the humans, against the laboring classes of both \\"worlds\\". He abolishes practices and traditions related to the Revolution, and changes the name of the farm to \\"The Manor Farm\\". Communism is a revolutionary socialist movement to create a classless, moneyless, and stateless social order structured upon common ownership of the means of production, as well as a social, political and economic ideology that aims at the establishment of the social order. Russian people held a revolution to overthrow the Tsar's horrible domination, they thought the communism government will help them to fulfill the dream that they can live in an equal and prosperity society. But during his rule for a quarter of a century in the Soviet Union, he was one of the most powerful and murderous dictators in history. His policy was no different than the Tsar's. The communism dream of the Russian people has completed broken.Through the vivid description of every character/animal in the animal farm and its revolution, Orwell gives the reader precise insight on the communist government. Animal Farm is a very well-written critique of how socialist ideals are corrupted by powerful people, how the uneducated masses are taken advantage of , and how the dictator or communist leaders turn into capitalists. It's a wonderful example of how effective the allegorical style can be, and a well-deserved classic."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This is, by far, one of the best books I have ever read! It's about the Soviet Union, and is a great allegorical, short novel. You should read it if you haven't already :D"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm by George Orwell is short and sweet (or bittersweet). Animal Farm is supposed to be an ideal place, but turns out to be anything but that - a corrupted place where a few pigs have all the power. Having done some research on the book before reading it, I learned that this whole novel was satiric, and an extended metaphor or allegory of the Russian revolution. The message, however, is not just about communism or socialism or Russia, but rather society and humankind as a whole.It is easy to be discouraged to read this book because of the heavy political reference; however, the commentary on human nature outweighs this. Old Major, the pig with the vision of a new peaceful society for the animals, represents the Soviet leaders Marx and Lenin. These leaders aren't actually alive to see the implementation of their ideal. I like that Orwell doesn't exactly attack Soviet ideals, but simply paints a harsh picture of the ones who come afterward to corrupt the ideal (namely Napoleon), by becoming overzealous and tyrannical themselves. Theoretically the ideal could work. Orwell points out; however, that greed and humankind's nature can lead to corruption.To me, Boxer, the workhorse who represents Soviet peasants, is the most tragic character. Loyal and hardworking, he remains blinded by idea of the now jaded ideal as he stays faithful to Napoleon's leadership even as things continually go wrong.The character of Squealer - a pig who convinces the other farm animals that their memories are bad among other things - awed me. Orwell's depiction of this kind of psychological warfare in such a straightforward, non-confusing manner really adds to the poignancy of this tragic tale.I recommend this book because it is so poignant, shocking and interesting (mostly shocking)."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Excellent book, a timeless political manifesto.I read parts of speeches by the current administration and ideologies by today's politicos."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"\\"Animal Farm\\" by George Orwell is short, enjoyable read that I choose for a mandatory independent read in my AP Literature class. However, I was able to diligently and quickly read this book in a short time period of a week. I found this book as a whole to be very imaginative in order to expose and critique the totalitarian regime in Russia.In the beginning of \\"Animal Farm\\", a prized boar, Old Major, brings all the animals together for a meeting in the barn on Major Farm. He then tells the other animals about a dream he had the night prior dealing with communism thus setting the plot of the book. A dream in which all the animals live together with no interaction with the human race. The animals will no longer be burdened and forced by the human population. Together, they must work towards this visioned destiny, \\"Animal Farm\\", with a joyous theme song called \\"Beasts England.\\" Pigs take the place as the oppressive human dictatorship. However, as the years continue on in creating this animalized paradise controlled by \\"Animalism\\", the pigs that took leadership roles begin to humanize. They begin to carry around whips, walk upright, and even begin to cloth themselves. Napoleon, the big man in charge, creates a saying: \\"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal.\\" Thus, he changes the farm's name back to Manor Farm from Animal Farm. The idea of complete freedom only leads back to totalitarianism.I found \\"Animal Farm\\" to be a correct depiction of our world history leading to our current society. Our current government in the United States is in a democratic state. However, world history has proven that totalitarianism is still alive and well.

Old Major, a boar on Mr. Jones' farm, convinces the rest of the animals that their rights and conditions are anything less than ideal. After his death, two pigs named Snowball and Napoleon take his ideas and turn them into a movement, convincing the other animals that they must take action. After a successful rebellion, the animals begin to set up new rules for their society (referred to as Animalism). As the book progresses, we begin to see the gradual shift of power from the animals as a group, to select subclasses within their society, namely the pigs and dogs. Animalism begins to evolve into something more evil as more and more rules and restrictions are placed on the animals by the pigs, and Snowball and Napoleon are corrupted by the effects of that power.After finishing Animal Farm, I was fairly underwhelmed. It was a decent read, but nothing as revolutionary as I expected and although entertaining, I wasn't on the edge of my seat. Fully prepared to give the novel four stars, it wasn't until I reflected on it several days later that I began to realize how wrong I was. My problem with the story was that I grew up in America after the end of Communism, and couldn't fully appreciate what Orwell had done. To have written a story like Animal Farm in 1945 was revolutionary in itself. I kept reading the book and getting frustrated at how stupid the animals were, and wondering how they could follow these leaders along so blindly with unflinching determination in their work. All of the events are not simply a product of Orwell's imagination, but an actual reflection of life under Stalinism. Why would an animal admit to treason, knowing that it would result in their execution? Well why do suspects routinely sign false confessions? Why did seemingly good men go along with the atrocities of My Lai? Those who haven't experienced it may never know why humans behave the way they do, but Animal Farm shows a very simplistic yet informative glance of the effects of Communism to those of us fortunate enough to never have experienced it.Ultimately, I have to agree with the critic's opinion of Animal Farm as one of the best novels of the Twentieth Century. For anyone having trouble with suspension of disbelief, George Orwell's Animal Farm is an incredibly executed explanation of \\"how easily totalitarian propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in democratic countries.\\""},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This book succeeds on so many levels. Orwell states that \\"Animal Farm was the first book in which [he] tried, with full consciousness of what [he] was doing, to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole\\" (Orwell 16) and I believe he does so wholeheartedly. First, \\"Animal Farm\\" is one of the harshest political attacks on Stalin and the Russian Revolution, making it very rooted in history. However, even if the reader has no knowledge of Russian politics this book manages to carry universal meanings about humanity and critiques totalitarianism and the tools in which the strong manage to oppress the weak, including: religion, manipulation of laws to suit the government's end, false promises, brute force if one does not comply with authority, and propaganda to support the ruling class. It critiques communism--not the idea of it--rather the implementation of it and how it could never succeed due to man's selfish nature to advance oneself. He tells this story in the form of a fable and what starts off so innocent and optimistic--a group of animals working for the common good, equal in status, and resources--takes a dark twist and ends in outright nightmare.Reading this book made me look at all the flaws in my own government today and infuriated me. I actually had to take a break from reading it just to calm down. I think that Orwell has succeeded in writing this book by getting that kind of reaction. Animal Farm ends on a very tragic note and Old Benjamin leaves us with a very pessimistic message: \\"things never had been, nor ever could be much better or much worse--hunger, hardship, and disappointment being, so he said, the unalterable law of life\\" (Orwell 130).

It's so interesting that I assigned it as a summer reading and most of them already started reading it and they've told me that it's hard for them to put it down, they really do like the book, we've even started discussing part of it, and the discussion was supposed to begin in August. Honestly George Orwells knew what he was doing great job and thank you.CordiallyMiriam Hernandez.Thank you very"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"We Read this book in 9th Grade (just last year) and I thought it was really good!!!! Its a book that can be read at different levels with different meanings. I was very impressed with it, it was scary, suspenseful, and sad. Deserves all 5 of the stars. You will never look at a pig the same way again!!!!"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Few authors have been capable of holding as individual a style as Orwell, for whether it is Nineteen Eighty-Four or Animal Farm, Orwell makes sure he stamps his beliefs onto the reader. Here in what Orwell describes as a 'fairy story' we see the bitter irony of socialist politics and collectivism corrupted by those very elements they initially overthrew - elitism. Animal Farm is a short read, and because of this, it has to be intense, which it is. The moral engagement of the reader is exceptional - for Boxer, Old Benjamin, and the ruling pigs (Napoleon/Squealer) are all styled to draw from us a unique response. Yet Animal Farm, with its great potential and success, fails to develop as much as an innovative idea such as that it uses could offer. The novel, it seems, tends to stop developing by about the fiftieth page, the 'political' structure of the farm in place. After that Orwell only gives extensions off the back of what happens earlier in the novel. That is not to say the novel does not have impact - it does, but by the concluding pages I, at least, was yearning for more. More injustice, or a happy resolution via a new Rebellion, or a development of the social structure of the farm along the lines it had started to take, would all have performed a great encore. A wonderful skeleton of a novel exists, but in a sense, it lacks 'meat on the bones'. It is well worth a quick read, don't doubt it. And the numerous strands of themes running through the pages are not to be missed. Yet, something about Orwell's style here - apart from his trademark 'depression' - is not fully exercised. But there is something there"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"When I first started reading this (at age 25) I was ridiculed by a friend for reading a &quot;kid's book&quot;. I think Animal Farm trancends age groups in that there's something to be learned by people of all ages. I particularly liked the way the revolution is shown as a full cycle, to the point where the animals are not only back where they started from, but in a worse situation. I also liked the way Orwell simplifies not only communism, but capitalism (and maybe dictatorship?) also (being a system full of holes and ripe for the evils of greed and power)."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Hi, my name is Brooke.

Over all I thought this was a fairly good book. It describes what Communism was meant to be like, and what it ended up as. The book begins with an old boar named Major who inspires the rest of the farm animals to rebel against the farmer. Then Major dies and and the animals rebel.

So get out there and read it!!"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Because it is against the nature of man (animals in the book) and because it is based on force and compulsion by a new ruling class - legislators.This book can be read by children and adults alike, and can be read on many levels.

I bought this book for my girlfriend because Animal Farm is one of her favorite books and because Ralph Steadman is an artist all serious-minded people should be familiar with. Best known for his illustrations of the works of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson, Steadman has a penchant for drawing grotesque characterizations of (in)famous celebrities and people in power. He has gotten himself in more trouble over his drawings than just about anyone else in the last few decades. This edition of &quot;Animal Farm&quot; is the perfect companion to anyones Steadman collection.

Soon, their first commandment is changed from &quot;All animals are equal.&quot; to &quot;All animals are equal. Some are more equal than others.&quot; That's those Commies for ya.

It is a book everyone should read at least once in their life because not only is it an exciting book it has a lot of things you can learn from it. The book is based on the Russian government and the ruthless dictator Stalin who is portrayed as a pig in the story. The story gives you a lot of historical information you might not know. For example in Russian History Stalin had a band of secret police that did his \\"dirty work\\". In the book Napoleon (pig who portrays Stalin) takes puppies away from their mother and later on in the book He brings them out to chase Snowball off of the Farm. These including many more historical facts are within the book. The book is not just about animals that take over a farm. The real point behind the book is to show how ridiculous the Russian government use to be. This book is one of my favorite books because it really never slows down. It starts with action and ends with action. The author also writes so that you can kind of imagine in your head what the farm was like when the animals took over. Also it is an easy book to understand. There is not one moment through out the book were you are lost or confused. It also shows that power corrupts and that it can change everything. The animals may have wanted to get away from Mr. Jones ways but what happened was they ended up just where they started with the abuse and excessive work. I highly recommend the book not only is it not confusing, fun to read, and funny at points it is also a fun way to learn history."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm can be enjoyed by people of all ages. It's story of animals overtaking a farm will draw in a middle school crowd while its deep social symbols will draw anyone from late high school and up. It's satire of communism is hilarious and half the fun of the book is seeing how Orwell shows people from all classes in life. From Boxer the worker to Napoleon the leader all can be seen as a real life social class. This is Orwell's best work, and one of the best novels the English language has ever seen."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"George Orwell has done an amazing job of this book. It is so simple to read that many schools require Animal Farm to be read by junior high schoolers. Yet, it is also required reading for college freshmen because of the complex nature of the story.The story is an analogy for the 1917 Russian revolution and the rise of communism later. Orwell's masterstroke was making the protagonists animals. This way he could tell his story without acknowledging what he was really talking about. He uses animals to portray how inhuman the former masters were and to give sympathy for animals plight.Animal Farm opens with the animals chasing away the owner of the farm and the beggining of it being run by animals. The story progresses from the optimism of the ideas of shared community to the cynicism of a power grab and the new leaders are as bad as the original ones. Orwell describes how the new leaders change the rules slowly and in incremental steps so as not to alarm the followers. Any opposition is either exiled or killed. By the time the rest of the animals realize that they were swindled of their ideas, it is too late to stop the process. The book ends where communism was in the 1970's, stagnated. The odd part of this is that Orwell wrote Animal Farm in 1946 and much of the book is actually prediction.This book is both wonderfull to read and a dire prediction. Orwell shows how the best of intentions can be twisted into the worst of nightmares. It is a must read."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm on the outside might seem like a children's story, but it is far from it. George Orwell uses this tale to cleverly disguise his thoughts on politics and government, and if we are not careful, how we can be led in to situations as despicable as the ones we were originally freed from. The animals were lead blindly into this, never questioning the pigs' authority or their doings. What I found fascinating was how the seven commandments were changed somewhat (ex. no animal should drink alchohol to excess when it was orignally no animal should drink alchohol) so the pigs could do as they pleased as the humans once did, and how the other animals were fooled in this piece of hypocrisy. How Napolean bided his time until he had complete dictatorship, while looking at it with an unbiased view, was very smart if not cunning. The pigs used many clever persuasions to make the illusion of happiness, more food than ever, and little work on the farm when the animals literally starved and worked to death, like Boxer, who was sent to the glue factory by the pigs for his pains. All in all, this book really makes you think, which is the biggest reason I liked it, and the whole theme of Animal Farm is worded in my favorite line-\\"The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.\\""},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"A good warm-up to George Orwell's greater work, Animal Farm is a satire of the Soviet Union told through the episodes of a farm that has been taken over by it's animals.The heavy symbolism in Animal Farm is apparent everywhere. The competing Snowball &amp; Napoleon being obvious metaphors for Leon Trotsky &amp; Joseph Stalin. The windmill being another metaphor for the Soviet economy.The time I spent reading Animal Farm, although brief, was enjoyable. The plot moved along at a nice pace and the events were well timed. I would recommend this book to those even not interested in reading 1984 or learning much about communism. Even without the political and philosophical messages, Animal Farm would still make an interesting story about animals taking over a farm."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"George Orwell's \`Animal Farm' was among the first writing to appear criticizing Stalin's communist Russia. The novel is a poignant allegory about what can go wrong when the masses allow themselves to be unquestioningly led by a select few \`leaders' who are supposedly acting in their best interests. The animals launch a revolution and expulse their drunken human master, and then set up their own form of socialist government. Things soon go wrong, however, when the pigs (who are the intellectual leaders) begin to brainwash and manipulate the other animals. In time, all of the ideals which the revolution stood for are abandoned, class distinctions arise, and the pigs begin subjugating everyone under their rule just as the farmer did.This book is not an attack against socialism itself, but rather against totalitarianism, whatever form it may take. Readers (and reviewers) who believe Orwell is attacking not only Stalinist Communism but also capitalism itself are missing the point. The pigs are portrayed as evil not because they become capitalists (though this is a step in their corruption), but because they assert absolute authority over the rest of the animals. Their crime lies in allowing special privileges for themselves, creating a system of classes, and abolishing the democratic voting power of the other farm animals. They are evil not because they open trade with other farmers and take on a capitalist attitude, but because they oppress the other animals in doing so.One of the things which makes this book a classic is that it applies to all systems of government, not just to Soviet Communism. The propaganda, the dog \`police' (equal to the Gestapo or the KGB), the changing of rules to exempt the upper-classes from their crimes--all of these things are dangers in any system of government, and apply to not only 1940's Communist Russia but also Nazi Germany (and many other governments throughout history as well).It is true that the animals' socialist government works for a time, and I suppose this could be an argument that Orwell is actually promoting socialism here. Well, the reason \\"Animalism\\" works at first is because each member of the farm does his duty, each contributes to the overall benefit of the community. In this case, it is a very Utopian socialism which Orwell promotes. And, if anything, this book shows that human (or animal) nature will not allow such a utopian existence to exist for long. The animals' government works at first because they govern themselves, and I think this is what Orwell is trying to tell us: any government whose rule is taken out of the hands of the people and placed in the role of a select few is certain to become corrupt and oppressive."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Orwell saw Communism as practiced in the Soviet Union (and eventually other places in the world) for what it was; despotism under the guise of \\"we're from the goverment and we're here to help you.\\" He wrote this masterpiece of satire to explain the rise of Hitler, Stalin, and any other despot who comes with smiles on his lips and murder and greed in his heart.The farm is the metaphor for the world; the peasants (farm animals) are cruelly worked. They revolt, and the pigs, the smartest animals in the barnyard, soon run the farm and find that, using the cliches of socialism, they can get more production out of the farm animals for less food and expense. They soon shed the pretense of working for the four-legged good and are even worse than the simple brutish farmer that the animals sent packing.This books is truly frightening. As the animals realize their doom, you feel the chilly clamp of despotism around your own neck. If you haven't read this book, do so.A MUST-READ"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"&quot;All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.&quot; This direct quote from Animal Farm presents the theme of hypocracy in totalitarian governments. George Orwell's Animal Farm is a satire of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. The animals revolt against the humans resulting in their short-lived freedom. For the pigs become the rulers, and become tyrants themselves. Napoleon's cruelty to Boxer represents the proletariat under Stalin. Throught the story, Orwell remonstrates against governments, especially those that are totalitarian."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal farmThe book I read was called Animal Farm. It was about a group of animals who rebelled against there owner and formed there own farm. It was very exciting and I would recommend it to any one who would read it.In the story a pig named Snowball takes charge and becomes there leader. The animals teach each other to speak English and the pigs even learned to write. The pigs become the rulers while the other animals work. Many animals did not think this was fair, I know I wouldn't. Eventually napoleon \\"a large fat pig\\" takes over the farm and Snowball was never to be seen again. There were many things in the book and the animals even learned to build a windmill to generate power. got so advanced they started trading with humans and dealing with money. Personally I think it's cool that They so smart and teaching them selves all these things.I really liked this book and would advise you to read it. It was a really out of this world book but it was still good. It Was one of the best books I had reading all year. I hope to read some other good books I could tell you about. I think you should go and read this book right know."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Watch out all you \`four-leggers'! Here come the animals of Animal Farm by George Orwell.I can't quite describe how if felt to read Animal Farm. I felt loathing toward the pigs, Napoleon in particular, and deep sympathy for the other animals. Napoleon (and Squealer) took advantage of the power and the trust that everyone, especially Boxer, put into them. It was almost like a movie, when you know something the characters don't, but can't do anything to help them. I found myself telling Boxer to stop working and Clover to realize that the commandments had been changed.Boxer was my favorite character by far. He was old and dedicated, but not the brightest crayon in the box. He represented the stereotypical \\"person\\" and was very loyal, even if he didn't know whom he was loyal to. Another reason I loved Boxer was because he always did more than his fair share and took the bulk of the work upon himself. Unfortunately, the system got him. No matter how loyal he was, in the end he got sent to the slaughter house/glue factory. That goes to show that there is no pleasing a totalitarian government.Animal Farm was written very well, and wasn't all that difficult to read. To me, it was a new way of reading, because I had never read a political satire before. It was very interesting, and actually kind of fun to try and decipher the parallels it had to the Russian Revolution.By reading the book, I learned a lot about the totalitarian government system as a whole, as well as some of the tactics the used to keep the \\"people\\" at bay. For example, they used propaganda like blaming everything that went wrong on Snowball, who had been exiled from the farm earlier. I also learned a lot from the prologue and the preface both, so I would advise at least skimming them before reading the book. It tells you a lot about George Orwell as well as the background of the book and the time period.I liked the ending because it was thought provoking. I actually had to read it more than once to get the full meaning of it, but the comparison to men and pigs was very creative.I didn't think any questions were left unanswered, but at first I didn't understand what parallel the windmill was. I also wasn't sure what the two farms represented, although I had a hunch they might be the United States and Germany.To anyone who read and enjoyed Animal Farm, I would recommend Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell as well. Nineteen Eighty-Four, while also about totalitarian government, applies more to today's society than Animal Farm did. Truthfully, it was almost disturbing how perfectly parts of the book describe today's culture, especially Big Brother in terms of the Patriot Act.All in all, when you read Animal Farm, I think you'll have a wild time!"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Are totalitarian dictators pigs? George Orwell, the author of Animal Farm, believes they are. Animal Farm is a satire that attacks totalitarianism and Communism. The book was brilliantly realized and intelligent. Orwell made all the right stylistic choices, such as using pigs to represent Stalin and Trotsky, and the simplicity of the story conveyed Orwell's anti-Communist stance well. The simplicity of the characters prevented one from getting too attached to the characters, but it was necessary since the book is an allegory. Though most of the characters were stereotypical, I did like several of them and even felt emotion at the death of one. I liked Benjamin, the quiet cynical one. I liked it when he said that after the rebellion things shall go on as they always have, \\"that is badly.\\" I was also sad when Boxer died, because Boxer had pure intentions and innocence, which turned out to help cause his downfall. It was saddening to see Boxer taken advantage of by Napoleon even though he wanted to do the right thing. I really disliked Napoleon since he was corrupt and he made all the other animals suffer. I also felt frustration when the illiterate animals let Napoleon take advantage of them.Overall, the book was quite humorous and enjoyable, but most importantly, the humor had a purpose. For example, the way that the pigs amended the commandments was rather humorous. The final line of the book, in which the author comments that the pigs and humans cannot be told apart, was funny and powerful; it made the ultimate insult to Stalin and his followers by saying that they were pigs.I really liked the book, but certain things were ambiguous. I was confused as to whether the people who were executed had actually committed the crimes they confessed to, and if they had not committed the crimes, then why would they have confessed? Though certain parts were confusing, I learned about Russian history since all the events were simplified. I would like to read other books by George Orwell; he is a supremely talented author and social critic. I would also recommend this book to friends. So, are totalitarian dictators pigs? Animal Farm, by George Orwell, certainly makes a compelling case that they are."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Have you ever read a story about the battle between animals and humans on a man named Mr. Jones' farm? Well me, Mike Kasunic? I have!At the beginning of the novel, I felt excited for the animals because of Old Major's opening speech and the determined revolution that was about to be led. I felt as though the animals were a minority that needed freedom, just like many ethnic groups throughout the world. As the story advanced, I started to feel uneasy towards Napoleon and Squealer, his faithful companion. As soon as rules started changing, I felt sympathy and anxiety for the lesser animals of Animal Farm, for they could not realize what was going on and they were rather helpless. I think that George Orwell does a great job of twisting your perspective on certain characters and also on basic human emotions, such as fear, greed, or sadness.My favorite character was Clover, because she was an important part in the disbelief of Napoleon's tyrannical statements, which were directed through Squealer of course. She was also a very caring creature, this was expressed heavily during Boxer's struggle. Clover was the most morally sane character, without her there would be no opposition to Napoleon's scheme. Even though Boxer had second thoughts, he couldn't allow himself to believe that Napoleon would do any wrong doing to his own \\"followers\\", the fellow animals.I thought that this book was very easy to follow, which happens to be very pleasant after the allegorical and epic poems we have been studying lately. The character introduction is wonderful, all the while remaining simple and straightforward. The only thing I disliked about Animal Farm was partially what made me love it. Although I loved the simple structure of Animal Farm, sometimes the writing was very bland. Although it the writing wasn't too interesting at times, the plot moved very fast which kept me very attentive. I finished the novel in one sitting because of the way it pulls you in.I applaud George Orwell for his courage in writing this novel during times of struggle and danger. He did a great job of satirizing the totalitarian movement and explained a lot about how the tyranny came into place.After reading through this book, It taught me much more about the totalitarian government and how it came into power. It also taught me a lot about the use of satires and allegories in stories, which are both present throughout the novel.Although the ending of Animal Farm was predictable if you have any common sense, it was perfectly executed in the sense that it was just a never-ending cycle, the cycle of a revolution. Even though it was seen coming, the ending was still shocking for me and almost disturbing in a way. How could somebody live that way? Apparently greed and power can overcome some people more than others.George Orwell does a concise job with the execution of Animal Farm, leaving me with no confusion. The book was perfectly thorough while remaining as simple as can be. I would definitely recommend this to a friend, but it is highly recommended to have some knowledge of 20th century totalitarianism before reading.I am planning on checking out some of George Orwell's books in the near future. I think he has a great style and purpose with his writing. Books like Animal Farm and 1984 will never be forgotten, they are classics. I would enjoy reading more satires about the political struggles of his time.Whether you are interested in reading a book about a band of animals taking over a farm or the satiric totalitarian story that lies beneath the letters, then Animal Farm is for you. Just about any age group can find enjoyment in this novel, understanding the deeper meaning or not."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"One of the greatest works of literature of all time was definitely Animal Farm. The use of all the different literary devices from the allegory and satire, to the use of certain names to convey the characters actions was definitely a strong aspect of this story. My overall feelings while I read the book were mostly a feeling of surprise, as each event would lead up to the next one, never really stopping to give a lot of information on settings, at least not all at once. They did a great job to diverse the information on the setting, only giving it to you when it was necessary. The main part of my feelings fell into the book when they talked of the bond between the animals as a whole, each one helping the others to complete the work and almost having the unity that a family would.The characters were the greatest part of the book, though each one was clever in its own way, they all had the same general feel that they each were trying to make you part of the story and trying to teach you exactly what they thought you should. Of the characters though, the best one was Benjamin. The smartest of all the animals on the farm, he was the only one that saw what was going on throughout the book, though never told anyone. Each time a rule was changed, he noticed it. And when they took Boxer in the glue truck, Benjamin was the first to notice it, and tried to warn him before they took him. I must definitely give a huge standing ovation to the author, for not only making an interesting book to read, yet equating it to Russia's Communist and Totalitarian government and teaching us of this time period.Though the ending was slightly less catchy than the rest of the book, it was still well thought and showed everything that it was meant to show, the leader of the government taking all the credit and profit for himself, becoming a \`Fat Pig'. There was one thing however, that throughout the book perplexed me to no end. Benjamin was always out of the way, never really talking to anyone, but had the bond with Boxer. But though he never talked, and noticed all the changes and the wrong doings on the farm, why did he never speak up? Even someone that is completely anti-social would have spoken out against the killings of the innocent and the changing of the Seven Commandments.I would definitely recommend this book to most of my friends, though many of them are science fiction people, so they may not read it. But I would definitely recommend it to them nonetheless. As for reading other books he has written, almost definitely would, considering that I have already read about four of them. I love the style of writing he uses and just can't get enough. And in the words of the \`Leader, Comrade Napoleon', \\"LONG LIVE ANIMAL FARM!\\""},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"When you look at the cover of this novel, you would not think that novel would be any good, since it was based on animals. Orwell did a wonderful job at portaying the animals as Stalin and his soldiers. Throughout the novel there is constant change and nothing is able to stay the same. The more power Napoleon recieves, the worse the animals on the farm are being treated. More and more they are becoming slaves and they do not have enough knowledge to realize this till it is too late. The animals go beyond their dreams and make things happen for themselves. Yet they realize that it takes more then hopes and dreams to fill the farm with crops and their pockets with money. Slowly they loose focus of why the expelled Jones and took control. Napoleon takes control of the farm and unhappiness runs throughout the farms for years. This was a good novel and I would recommend this novel. Yet I wonder how the farm turned out in the years to come after they saw Napoleon and the other pigs walking on two legs and drinking an excess amount of alcohol."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"\\"Four legs good, Two legs bad\\" the sheep said, but in the end they said, \\"Four legs good, Two legs BETTER!\\" This part of animal farm was the ending, but it was also my favorite part. Although you thought this might happen, it still came as a surprise and was a very drastic ending, showing that something like this couldn't work out while so many people were still as greedy as they are. My least favorite characters were also these sheep because of how they were always bleating, even though they didn't understand what they were saying, and ruining any chance to fight against the tyranny of the pigs. This book was very good because all of the easily recognizable allegories, as well as the better hidden ones. Although George Orwell is a very good author, I think he may have been able to do a better job of Communism, and made Animalism closer to it. I think I would both recommend this book to a friend (although they'll already have to read it, and read another book by this author to hear his good storytelling and view his unique perspective. I didn't learn much from this book, but I did see communism in another perspective, although I still think it could work if not for the greedy rulers that came into place."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Do you adore adventure? Do you crave for history? If so, then you must donate time to read the enchanting novel, Animal Farm. Animal Farm is masterfully written by George Orwell, writing so grand that it gripped me by the throat and would not let go.This book is a re-telling of the Russian-Communist history, and it is retold through animals and their rebellious farm. Through this novel, I learnt a great deal about Russian history. I loved every aspect of this novel except for the short length of it. The end was very solid and left me with a feeling of hope for the future, but the end was enjoyable and a bit puzzling, for it leaves you with the question, \\"is it your body that makes you the animal you are, or is it your actions?\\"The characters all represent important figures in Russian history, for example, my least favorite character, Napoleon, is based on Josef Stalin. He was the leader of Animal Farm for most of the book, and he was cruel and arrogant and utterly dogmatic. His bitterness and wicked acts make him terrifying man, or should I say, \\"pig.\\"I would recommend this book to anyone who asks, and furthermore, I would read any novel, or any form of literature, by George Orwell. No life can be complete without reading George Orwell's puzzling, yet strangely satisfying Animal Farm."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"All world leaders today are pigs. They rule only for themselves, with no thought given to those who elect them. This is probably what Eric Blair, or George Orwell, as he is better known, was thinking when he wrote Animal Farm. And after reading this novel, I too agree with him. During Animal Farm, I was entranced by the creativity of his plot and characters, in relation to the current events of the Russian government at that time. I especially liked reading this book because the book was so full of events happening. Every chapter, in fact, was full of Orwell's interesting plot. When I finished the book, I felt as if I had learned a valuable lesson in life, and that Orwell was definitely knowledgeable in this area. I liked the end of the book, because I think that if this story had actually happened, that would be how it would turn out. My favorite character was probably Boxer, because I respected how he served the cause he felt was important, all the way to his demise. He would always work as hard as possible, and his motto, \\"I will work harder!\\" proves it. I think the best part about Animal Farm is how it ran parallel to the events in the Russian government, and especially how Orwell could make them seem like it was a story he had thought up, with the animals being the characters. My praise goes to Orwell for including all the events in Russian history such as the KGB and Trotsky's exile so accurately, and to fit seamlessly into the novel. After reading the book, I came to know of such important events as the rise of Stalin, the Bolshevik Revolution, and the events that took place during Stalin's time of power, such as the numerous executions and exile. A question I had after finishing the book was the whereabouts and the condition of Snowball after his exile. I would without a doubt recommend this book to anyone because of the continuous action, Orwell's amazing creativity, and the depth of the characters contained in the novel. With such an impressive book for his resume, I think it would be safe to say that I would read any of Orwell's other books and be equally entertained by them, as this one has amused me. Animal Farm is by far the best-written satire I have come across, and its simplicity, message, and plot will continue to keep those unfamiliar with George Orwell on their toes, always looking for more."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I absolutely adored this book. I loved the character portrayal of historical figures like Josef Stalin and Trotsky. In this book review I will tell you about my favorite and least favorite characters, what I liked and disliked about the book, how I felt about the author, what I learned from reading the book, what I thought about the ending of the book, and questions that I have about the book.My favorite character, without question, is Boxer. His gullible personality and work ethic really appealed to me. I enjoyed reading about him waking up earlier and going to bed later than any other animal on the farm. My least favorite character was Squeeler. He was deceitful with his untrue speeches. A henchman is just as bad as a villian.Although there was only bad news for the animals, I really like the whole plot of the story. It delivered a message to anybody who read the book. Although I did not like the ending, just because it made me sad, I thought it was important to end as it did with the animals unable to tell the difference between pigs and humans. It delivered a message that communism can't ever work because power changes anybody who touches it.I appreciated the author's point of view. He had the courage to explain the cons of communism. It was bold of him to write such a book in the middle of the cold war and the end of World War II. I don't doubt that it offended more than a few people.I learend from the book that power can change anybody. It totally changed the pigs. Not only did they revise the seven commandments a few times, but also they changed their titles and made the animals treat pigs better than all the others.A few questions left unanswered for me in the book include: Did Snowball really knock down the windmill the first time? Is Snowball really dead? Did the animals really commit the crimes they admitted to? Or did Napoleon tell them to admit these crimes for effect? I might be reading into the book too much on the last question.I was very skeptical of the ending of the book. I didn't like how Snowball vanished and never came back. I do feel that there was good purpose for the ending. It is important for pigs to end up ruling the farm unjustly - just as it was before - otherwise there would be no satire, allegory or theme.I would definitely recommend this book to a friend. First of all, it is a short book which can be read in 2 hours. But it is also a good story, delvering a good message.I highly recommend this book. It is a must read for all high school students - teaching readers about greed, power, and change. If you don't read this book, you are missing out on life and you won't understand the true meaning of comradeship."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Pigs, of course, are the typically greedy animals. Seldom do we have the chance to see in such detail this quality of them as in Animal Farm, by George Orwell. This book was a unique insight into farm life, on a farm that is itself quite unique. Although it frustrated me to no end, I really enjoyed reading Animal Farm. Perhaps somewhere between the animals learning to write and Boxer being taken away for glue, I began to see them as more than simply animals. Of course, George Orwell didn't mean this book to be taken at only its surface value. I give high praise to him for creating such an interesting plot line, while modeling it directly after actual events. I think it is brilliant to represent views on a topic in such an appealing way. From reading this book, I learned much about the totalitarian system in Russia in the early 1900's. Since the events in the book so closely paralleled the actual Russian revolution, it was easy to make connections between, for instance, Bolshevik's Revolution and the overthrowing of Manor Farm.My absolute favorite part of the book is the ending. It was satisfying for me, having the pigs end up as humans. I couldn't stand having them representing their fellow animals. Although they were just as horrible as humans, I felt better that they were separated more from the animals, and at least the animals wouldn't still be deceived into thinking they were all equal. One part I disliked was when Boxer was taken away and killed. I couldn't stand when Squealer came back with his blatant lies, and the animals were too stupid to see it. Except, of course, Benjamin. He was my favorite character. He saw what was going on, and in his wisdom, knew he couldn't stop it. Until one of his best friend's life was threatened, he refused to be involved. I was very impressed by him.So as a whole, although the despicable pigs caused me much anguish in their actions, I enjoyed this book. I would recommend it to a friend, and would like to read other books by George Orwell. Hopefully they will catch me up in the story, as this one did. I might like them better if they had less pigging out though!"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"It about a farm animal that did like the farmer and out throw the farmer"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"George Orwell's Animal Farm is a masterpiece.

Over one thousand reviews appear here on Amazon alone, there have been numerous adaptations all over the world of Orwell's book, as well as being discussed in high schools and colleges nationwide and internationally.To say this should be required reading for people of all ages would be quite an understatement. A person can read every single review here and/or hear other peoples' interpretations of \\"Animal Farm,\\" but that just cannot take the place of actually reading every single word of the novel to try to understand the complacency that takes place after Mr. Jones is disposed of and his attempt to get his farm back (later christened \\"The Battle of the Cowshed\\"). One *must* read this to be truly baffled as to why people (in this case, animals) accept half-cooked explanations for serious wrongs.It's well-known that Soviet Russia was the target of this novel (as well as \\"1984\\"), but little did he know that, half a century later, it would be the United States that would be guilty of the same mindset they accused Soviet Russia of. The scare tactics of this administration (junta) have managed to keep well-meaning people silent and complacent (every time Cheney and Bush are in trouble, up pops yet another \\"terror plot\\" that would have leveled military bases and entire airports that was foiled by a \\"concerned citizen\\"). The American government actually encourages people to keep tabs on each other by reporting \\"suspicious activities\\" - much as they do in communist Cuba and communist China (as in Russia before them). And, all the while, the ferocious dogs (the American media) guard their masters (Cheney and Bush) unquestioningly.As one reads more and more of the book, they will (hopefully) start connecting the dots and realize they need to think for themselves and always fight for freedom, because, as the bumper sticker proclaims, \\"If you ignore your rights, they will go away.\\" - Donna Di Giacomo"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"The last paragraph of this book is riveting:\\"Twelve voices were shouting in anger, and they were all alike.

The story of Animal Farm goes like this- A farm owner named Mr. Jones always forgets to feed the animals, doesn't take care of the farm and always gets drunk and leaves town, the animals fight back which is the start of a Rebellion. It ends up that Napoleon, a dictator who's a boar, turns out to be exactly like Mr. Jones.

George Orwell not only took a subject that at the time,it was still 1945 may I remind you,was basically attacking the Russian system of communism. Now of course Russia, then the Soviet Union or U.S.S.R., is no longer under communist rule, but at the time we were still fighting in World War 2 and Russia was an Allied Force. Well obviously publishers werent scrambling to get a book that attacked a country that was aiding them in the fight against Mousolinni,Hitler,and Hirohito. The book starts off as a symbol of the start of the Russian revolt when Major(A play off of political prophet Karl Marx)urges a revolt against the dastardly doings of Farmer Jones(A play off of Czar Nicholos 2)and point in case they listen. Days later Farmer Jones forgets to feed the animals, soon afterwards all hell breaks loose. Being led by two strong leaders Snowball(A play off of Trotsky, I think his first name was Leon)and Napoleon(A play off of Infamous, yet cruel leader Joseph Stalin)the animals decide to wage a war against the humans and overthrow their corrupt regime(The humans represent the Capitalists woh exploit the weak). May I remind you the intentions are still good here, that is untill the idea of the Windmill(Russian Industry Modernizing) comes up....At first Snowball proposes a windmill so the stalls can be lighted and have flowing water by the power of hydroelectricity, however Napolean disagrees. Sensing his power running short and the people siding with him, Napolean gets the Dogs(A play off the KBG)to chase Snowball out of the Farm. Now its just Napolean, a lone dictator with a bad mind set, so whom does he get to explain he was for the windmill after all? Squealer thats who!(The representation of the Russian Media)After squealer explains it to the ignorant animals all but a few whom understand what is happening(Particalarly a stubborn mule named Benjamin who represents the witnesses of corruption but stand by and do nothing)and to the one follower whom belives his \\"Friendly Dictator\\" is always right, I'm talking of course about Boxer(Who represents the Unskilled Labor class)whose later sold,In a very sad scene, to a glue factory by the one he belives is always right. Later on Moses the wise raven comes in and(representing the Orthodox church of the time)tells of magical Sugarcandy Mountain and its glory of ripe windfall apples and sugarcake.Twoards the end the Pigs(communist party loyalists)take total control and leave the farm in hell, worse than it was with Farmer Jones...and twoards the end of the book in a stunning final word from Mr. George Orwell...\\"Soon they looked from the men to the pigs, the pigs to the men, and back to the men and could not tell the difference.\\""},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Though this book starts real slow, it is hard to put down once you are in to the action.

The character who stands out most for me is the pig Snowball who plays Goebbles to the chief boar Napoleon's Hitler.

The story begins with a bunch of farm animals plotting the overthrow of a farm. They are able to take the farm over and kick out the farmer and his family.

Principally he has only transcribed from reality, because the dictatorships of terror existed already: Nazi-Germany, Sowjetunion, Mao-China, GDR, Northern Korea and others. A better description in literary form is not thinkable! That\`s all old hat? Not at all!Orwell is about advising against mechanisms which lead to such slavery of people. And these mechanisms are still going, even with us. He wants that everybody develops a feeling in order to become able to stop such wrong developments. No wonder that this book was on the black list of many dictatorships. Why? A dog that is hit will bark! But we are all hit since in this time of a progressing media age the ideal presuppositions for the complete exertion of influence and control of people are given. In totalitarian regimes of today it is for example often practise to block websites, so that only certain information currents are available. Talking about opinion-forming. That is to say the advantages of linking ways of information in our days can be reversed at any time to a disadvantage. You believe what a majority says is right, because it is comfortable.When Orwell wrote 1984\\" he thought of the Sowjetunion, but his observations of human psyche have universal validity. What he describes is the ideal type of a totalitarian dictatorship that comes automatically from the misleading human will of self-realization, being often enough wishful thinking that the paradise could be ordered on Earth, thanks to the human capability. This has nothing to do with prophecy when Orwell writes this. It is nothing than self-observation and self-realization of any reasonable human.In 1984\\", similar to the Sowjetunion or the GDR or Cuba, there is a striking economy of scarcity which is being denied with the help of propaganda. Hence the ministry of economics is for Orwell the \\"ministry of abundance\\". This is a mark of totalitarian systems, that they misuse the language, twist everything, blackmail opponents and let them disappear when they get them. All for the alleged welfare of the community. Everybody understands the proper insanity but all surrender to the pressure and take part in the game. Reality sense is no longer needed, it dwindles ever more and the reversion to reason and to sustainable values is getting more and more difficult. \\"Why do you accuse me of not having unlocked the door?\\" is the question of the concentration-camp guard who stands in front of the court because the prisoners perished in the locked building. \\"I have not had an order to open it!\\"At first one agrees with the lie until on is able to live under it by constant use. Who does not remember the propaganda of the Nazis about worthless lives and alike to praise man on one side as superior masters and at the same time devalue man by racism. That is always the same, self-elevation leads to fall. So much for ideologies where after man himself determines what is good and bad. In so far Orwell draws not the last necessary conclusions, that man cannot find truth in himself. Hardly he seems to have found it, at once it is turning destructively against him as is apparent in his \\"Animal farm\\".Orwell says clearly in \\"1984\\" what is unjust. But, whence the individual freedom and self-determination of man should come when they cannot be given naturally, he is not able to say.It is lost somewhere in the fog of humanistic wisdom which are always under suspicion of being misused as helpers for something else. Already the Bible warned: \\"woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who make out of darkness light and out of light darkness\\". Well, but how to avoid the evil?It would be wrong to point at totalitarian systems and think that this could not happen to a democracy. Orwell knew about the fragility and sensibility of all man made power structures which have those above and those below. He knew that the so called free West could quickly slide into Totalitarianism. In Germany that happened very quickly. It is a deception tp assume that it would be different somewhere else. It was visible that a high culture could not withstand. And today? Sceptics discover also in our society the beginning of limitations of freedoms and of the misuse of information, even when this happens subtly. For example somebody who behaves like a Christian is in our days quickly branded as a fundamentalist or even thrown into the same pot with Islamists. Because of the relativism of today which regards as only truth that there is no binding truth it is ignored that exactly the Christians combine the notion of truth tightly to the notion of individual freedom, whereas this is not the case in Islam, because Islam has a political claim of power exertion.It is true that Orwell makes clear that the reversal of the values goes together with the reversal of the words. \\"War and peace\\" is exchangeable with \\"just war\\". Sand this process is starting in the small, with verbal persecution and it is ending in the worst case with Holocaust. At first you are eliminated in words and then with all consequences. Marxism-Leninism possessed the impunity to call itself scientific knowledge. We laugh about it. But what about today? We have an extended faith in science. Today even the former marxists know that they were wrong. We have seen it a hundred of times what happens when man takes himself as last measure. His self-redemption programs are sentenced to failure. One day it will also be put an end to the personal freedom. Orwells book should be a warning. \\"1984\\" is one of the few books which everybody should have read.

He'd been to the Soviet Union, hated it, and tried to warn the world. But no one listened. The characters in this book symbolize members of the Communist Revolution. The symbolism is amazing. In this book, animals rebel against their farmers and take over the farm. But their government of Animalism is slowly destroyed both from outside human attacks and inside quarrels and greed. Snowball, or Leon Trotsky, is better suited to lead the animals. But Napoleon, or Joseph Stalin, forms his own police force and kicks Snowball out. Then as Napoleon gets greedy and uses the farm for his own good, things begin to go bad. Napoleon blames it all on Snowball, the unseen enemy. In reality, Snowball never returns. But he is the unseen scapegoat for the story. If you like this story, I also recommend 1984 and Brave New World."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Orwell's 1946 &quot;Fairy Story&quot; and political masterpiece offers atimeless warning about the dangers of a totalitarian state. Unfortunately the all-too-human nature of the animals who engaged in this egalitarin experiment are destined to recreatethe inevitable abuse of absolute power: lust for still more power, greed for material comforts, plus the surprising andunrestrained cruelty toward the other animals who were naive enough to trust their leaders for protection. And worst of all--the tendancy of the other farm creatures to behave like sheep by not raising their collective voices to protest the rampantdeception.The characters in this novel are animals who behave in a painfully human manner. Although the ideologies of Socialism and Communism are not specifically named, the effects of revolution are terrifyingly familiar from recent 20th centuryhistory. Old Major--a wise and repsected pig--calls the animals of Manor Farm to an evening assembly. Outlining his dream of a more democratic and benevolent lifestyle for all farm aniamls, heinstills in them the idea of rebellion, which will be followed by an almost utopian existence. The emerging leader pigs under him devise the Seven Commandments, which should provide for general peace and prosperity.Alas, after his death his two successors, Snowball and Napoleon, vie for power. They maniuplate both the facts and the written ideas to their own private purposes of self-aggrandizement. Suspicion, paranoia, deceit and cruelty define the new age of porcine rule. Animal dissidents are converted, silenced or removed, as the memory of actual history is gradually lost in a haze of clever rhetoric and retribution.One by one the rights of the hard-working animals are stripped away or distorted for Napoleon's private agenda--the dream of a peaceful retirement is forgotten. Worst of all, the revised rules permit an oligarchy to sink to human vices; eventually the rulers become barely distinguishable from the humans they vowed to shun. Orwell raises the naggingquestion: were the animals better off under drunken Jones, the tyrant, than they are under one of their own? Whether you consider this novel a fairy story, a fable where animals and humans can communicate (zoomorphism) or a cautionary political essay disguised as fiction, ANIMAL FARM has earned an honored place in literary history. Its sobering view of the effects of dictatorship will expand and warn thoughtful minds. His style flows as easily as absolute power corrupts; the plot captivates readers and maintains our interest from the start. Beware the excess of human vice!"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"&quot;Animal Farm&quot; is by far one of the most amazing and powerful books I have ever read. On Manor Farm the animals are mistreated by Mr. Jones, their farmer who has a drinking problem. When one day the animals decide to rebel, Mr. Jones and his family are driven out of their farm. The pigs, Snowball and Napoleon, since they are deemed the smartest of the animals, become the rulers of the farm. The animals rename their farm Animal Farm and create The Seven Commandments which all animals on the farm must listen to. For a while on Animal Farm, life is happy and rewarding. All animals are treated with equal respect, and are allowed to vote on plans for the farm. However, when the desire for power gets the better of Napoleon, things start to get out of hand.When I read this story, I was surprised to find that it contained humor. Although it is an easy read, it is one of those stories that will keep you thinking long after you've finished it. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an enjoyable story."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Every time I read something by George Orwell, I'm convinced what a genius he was. This novel, along with 1984, is so entrenched in our collective consciousness now that it is difficult to remember a time when they didn't exist. I think that political extremists on either side would like to subvert Orwell's message for their own purposes. What makes Orwell great however is that he is not simply skewering the left or the right, but politics itself. To paraphrase Woody Allen in Sleeper (his take on 1984) \\"It doesn't matter who is in charge - they're all terrible.\\"Historically, Animal Farm was written as a polemic against Soviet communism after Orwell returned from fighting in the Spanish Civil War. Even though the USSR is his main target, Animal Farm reads like a blueprint for every violent revolution ever. I'm also reading a book on the French Revolution, and I'm amazed at how much the two link up. First comes the idyllic phase when the oppressors have been overthrown. Next, the \\"liberators\\" soon set themselves up as demi-gods. Next comes marshal law. Eventually, it does become impossible to distinguish the men from the pigs. \\"All animals are created equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\\"This book, written before 1984, introduces some of the themes that Orwell will do much to develop later. For instance, like Big Brother, Napoleon - the leader - gradually does away with the animal's history and memory. He gradually alters the Seven Commandments of animals, while maintaining they were \\"always\\" that way. (\\"We are at war with Eastasia. We have ALWAYS been at war with Eastasia.\\")This book is so spot-on in its depiction of human (animal) behavior its scary. Whenever Napoleon institutes another sacrilege, the \\"sheep\\" are quick to shout down any opposition with their cry of \\"Four legs good, two legs bad.\\" Inevitably, this becomes, \\"Two legs good, four legs bad.\\" Four legs are bad, four legs have ALWAYS been bad...If you were forced to read this in school, or haven't read it in a long time, give it another chance.

The best book ever written."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"&quot;Animal Farm&quot; is a clever book that is supposed to be a metaphor for Communist Russia, using farm animals to represent various people groups from that era. Take heart, though, for even if you are nearly completely oblivious to the specifics of this period of history (like me,) you will be completely entertained by this book.Orwell paints an awesome picture of a barnyard where the animals speak to each other and eventually learn how to read, write, and use tools. These animals band together and form a revolt against the human farmer, and they win their freedom.The story is very interesting on two accounts. The first point of interest is the way in which the animals' behaviors match their personality traits. For instance, pigs are known to be intelligent, so they rise to leadership and do all the planning. Horses are strong and reliable, so they do all of the grunt work on the farm without asking questions. Sheep are stupid and so bleat the same mantras over and over, etc.The second point of interest is the description of how the utopian society eventually deteriorates into a dictatorship as the intelligent pigs assert themselves and become power-hungry. Immediately after the revolt, the animals decided on seven laws for the new society of animals. However, as the pigs became more greedy, they started breaking the laws to suit their own desires and then change the laws to suit their needs. The rest of the animals were either too stupid to notice the difference or too afraid to say anything about it.So, the pigs keep grabbing power and changing laws to suit their nature until eventually they are indistinguishable from the human master who preceded them. Even if you are unfamiliar with the events that represent the Russian metaphor, this story provides a great lesson in how power can corrupt even the most noble-minded beings. The story also is entertaining and gives your imagination a great workout."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"George Orwell's ANIMAL FARM is in that rare class of books that can be read by a fifth-grade child who will enjoy it on a basic level, then by the same child as a teenager a few years later and be enjoyed on a more meaningful level, and finally, by the teenager as an adult several years afterwards and be understood for all of its profundity and wisdom. That is the mark of a true literary classic, and ANIMAL FARM is one of the greatest of them all.It is short enough to read cover-to-cover within two hours; yet, its symbolic meaningfulness can be pondered over for hours afterwards. Kids love to read about talking animals; however, it is the fact that these animals actually stand for PEOPLE that makes this novella truly the ageless work it is. This is one story that one can never outgrow. This is a story that shows us the dark side of human nature and, in so doing, shows us how easily we can fall prey to the natural hunger for power. Given the right conditions, it doesn't take very long for that to happen.At the time George Orwell wrote this in his native England in 1937, it was pretty obvious of the story's real setting and characters: Manor Farm was the Soviet Union, Old Major was Vladimir Lenin, Snowball was Leon Trotsky, and Napoleon was Josef Stalin. Now that that whole time period has long since passed, and there is no more Soviet Union, nor is there any more Communist domination of Eastern Europe, the question for us now is: What is the Manor Farm that exists today in our world?

This is full of irony and symbolism. The humans were appropriately shown as gods to the animals and the pigs were the leaders of the revolting society. As in any society, there are those in favor of the ruling power, those who just follow along with much support, and those who are traitors. Also, there is a parallel to the Russian Revolution. Those, like me, who know little to nothing about this event, may learn the basic mechanics of this event as if from a textbook. One may use it to study certain aspects of greed, conflict, and freedom that are common in any era. In this novel each animal has a job, but proves that someone has to be a leader. In this the pigs do rule over all, and teach the rest of the animals. They learn how to spell, talk, and even memorize commandments. Some of the animals are too slow, but others learned rather quickly. It is a political satire and I feel Mr.Orwell did well in writing this outlook-on-life changing novel."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This book was different from what I thought it would be. I have a definition in my head for a &quot;Fairy story&quot; and I wouldn't call this book one. It leaves you thinking at the end like all good books do and I think you have to know government and politics a little bit(and I don't!)to really understand the depth of this book. Some parts where funny and the characters were good. Read it, but don't expect a happy ending."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"We had to write a report on a book, and the teacher passed out the list. When I went to the library they were all out of &quot;The Red Pony,&quot; so I had to read this one, which had the second smallest number of pages. This one seems to got pictures, but the one I got sure didn't. I read Shaq's book and it was a lot bigger than this but this book took a lot longer to read, for sure. My teacher said I did an OK report, but she thought I missed the point about the socialism society and all. But to me it was just about some pigs. Like those Narnia books by CS Lewis, except CS Lewis had that cool monkey in the last book. I skipped to the end, cause I got bored, (it's ok to say that now, cause I already got the B minus,) and plus I had to go to practice. But I liked the donkey and I was sort of cheesed when the horse bought it. Anyhow, the long and short of it is if you get the choice of this book or the red pony, maybe you should pick the red pony because this one is too damn hard."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"NO NO NO! Funny how this book sounds a lot more like a metaphor for our corporate welfare state. The irony of this book is the foolish reader that thinks this book is about \\"another\\" society where citizens don't have the freedoms that we \\"have\\" in our society. The pigs in Orwell's novel are the very leaders that are driving the working families of this country into the ground today in the US."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm portrays the behavior of humans in a society of farm animals and mirrors the real-life condition of communism. It is an allegory that can be applied to almost any system of government. Although Orwell satirizes the Russian revolution, the book communicates such a shocking message it must be considered a significant work. Abuse of power and the use nepotism to maintain authority are horrifying realities that exist today.The novel entailed descriptions of the different animal characters, each representing a figure in the true drama of the communist revolution in Russia.Benjamin, a pivotal character in representing a facet of society, is depicted as a wise, clever donkey who accepts that life is the way it is and does not try to change it. He saw what the other animals failed to see; the real truth behind the Rebellion -one ruler would only be replaced by another. He represents the intellectuals, and perhaps, the Jews, during the era of communism in Russia.Napoleon used his fellow animals' intrigue with the philosophy of Old Major to deceive them into working towards his goals. When he first established himself as the leader of Animal Farm, he appeared to be a good-hearted and fair ruler. However, as time progressed he became increasingly dictatorial, initially he lied to his populace and eventually he executed anyone who opposed him, all in the name of animalism. As the novel closed, irony was a principal element. Although the animals had undergone a revolution with great personal sacrifice, they ended up in even more oppressive circumstances than that of their former human masters, from which they did not revolt. The book reflects realities of communist totalitarianism in a realistic manner.Animal Farm illustrates the biting irony of socialism corrupted by those very elements which the animals previously overthrew -a greedy ruling class. Orwell ends the novel with the realistic insight that even in a &quot;classless&quot; non-material society, the capable and self-serving bureaucrats who crave power will eventually rise to positions of authority and subjugate the masses to a life of slavery to serve their selfish needs"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"On Manor Farm, the animals there feel that they are overworked, underfed, and treated unfairly. As Old Major (one of the older pigs) said, &quot;Man is the only real enemy we have. Remove Man from the scene, and the root cause of hunger and overwork is abolished forever.&quot; The barnyard animals agree with Old Major and decide to overthorw their cruel master, Mr. Jones. After an unexpected take over of Manor Farm, the animals elect the pigs as their rulers. Two of the pigs happen to be Snowball and Napoleon. These two are the main leaders of the farm. With Snowball and Napoleon as rulers, many adventures lay ahead for the animals on Animal Farm (formerly Manor Farm). Adventures of war, defeat, deceitfulness, and changes in every day living. In the end, a strange twist occurs that may surprise you. &quot;Animal Farm&quot; is a powerful look at how a government and leadership applies to many people. Many countries are in basically the same situation as the animals of this story. That is what I think makes &quot;Animal Farm&quot; such an interesting book. I also think it is interesting how the author, George Orwell, puts certain animals with certain personalities and how certain things that may seem small turn out to be a major event in the book. I think it is awesome how George Orwell uses this in his writings. If you are into a book where defeat and leadership are a main subjet of the book, or you just like to read about talking animals, I would highly recommend the book &quot;Animal Farm&quot; by George Orwell. It has been a favorite in my bookshelf for years and I hope it will soon be part of yours."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I lived in DC for a few years. I couldn't help but think of this book when I watched the mess we call our government. We live in a bazaar world where things that are important are ignored, and things that don't matter matter."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I first read this book in high school, and recently read it again at age 35.It was good when I read it in high school, and it is fantastic now that I am older and can really recognize the allegories and metaphors that are hidden throughout. What a classic this is."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"It's excellent. Shows how corrupt human beings can be. In this case they show that through the animals. Sometimes difficult to understand and you have to break it down. In the end it's all worth the wait."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I had never really heard of George Orwell's Animal Farm until I was a senior in high school. Our European History teacher told us that we had to read it for a semester project. I wasn't looking forward to it. So, I waited until the last week of the assignment to start reading it. But once I started I couldn't book the book down. The story in itself is very well told.Life wasn't that bad on the Jones's Farm, but the animals, especially the pigs weren't happy that the Jones seems to be profiting from the animals hard work. Then one day on Mr. Jones's farm, all the animals revolted against him and kick him and his family off the farm. The pigs, the most intelligent of the animals, were the leaders of the revolt. Two pigs would rise as the leaders. Their names are Snowball and Napoleon. Each one had their own unique characteristics. Snowball is a dreamer who is very persuasive in his speeches. He is always looking for ways to help the farm survive. Napoleon is not a very good speaker, but he is great at getting people on his side. Everything started out perfectly; all animals were created equal and they all had the same rights and duties as the others. The farm was doing very well and all the animals were happy. Yet, slowly things started to happen that none of the animals could explain. Napoleon and his followers started to act differently. Soon most of the animals started to feel just like they did with Mr. Jones. But nothing could prepare them for what was coming next.This is one of my favorite books I have ever read. I am not a very big reader but I really loved this book. The first reason is how quick of a read it is. It took me only one day to finish it. The way George Orwell explains situations in detail is amazing. He uses simple words and ideas yet paints a great picture. The story in itself is very entertaining but if you look closely at what is happening we find a bigger story. The story of Animal Farm is directly related to the Russian Revolution and how Stalin gained control over the people. It is very hard to believe that George Orwell can tell the dark story of how Stalin gained power over Russia in a book about animals; but he does and he does a fabulous job at it. Just by reading the story and knowing about the Russian Revolution I was able to understand what had happened in Russia. It puts it in perspective that many people can understand easily. I would recommend this book to everyone who wants to learn more about the Russian Revolution or just about history in general."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Again:Don't read this review.Just read this book.Keep it in your glove compartment.Keep it in your desk at work.Take it with you to a deserted island.Read it not once, not twice... but thrice.When you're finished, go tell someone else about it."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I thought this book was great. In hte story the animals of the Mason Farm rebel against their owner Mr. Mason. The animals make a set of rules so they are to not become like humans. Soon the pigs of the farm begin rising in power and the rules begin changing to the pigs benifit. Then one day the other animals see a pig standing on his hind legs. After that the animals spy on a party the pigs are having with the humans. They then realize that the pigs are taking over the farm and that they are turnig just like humans themselves."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"There is a farm called Manor farm. On that farm there is a guy called Mr.Jones. One night he for got to feed the aniamls.The animals kicked down the fence and drove the humans out. The animals are now working as humans. The animals on the Manor farm did not like each other. They always had a commander on the farm as a leader to lead them. The pig were first to lead them. Then Napoleon anther pig would be able to take to the humans.I would tell you that Animal farm is a great book if you like to read about farm animals. Their job in the book is like it is on a farm. The horses work to pull equipment and the cows give the milk. The animals can be like humans.There wasn't much about the book I didn't like. It is not really like any other book I've read recently."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"A great read!

Do you want the plot to be teeth grinding, lead you on through a tale of heroes and villains, Traumas and tragedies? Well....If so I've got just the book for you It's called Animal Farm by George Orwell.Old Major had a dream, a dream to lead all animals to power. Then in steps Napoleon and Snowball, watch them take a grasp for power and let the dream slip through their slimy trotters.This novel a political allegory of the momentous events of the Russian Revolution was published in 1945.This mind-boggling novel of adventures is targeted at the years 11 and above, but on the other hand Adults that have views on the Russian Revolution mat be intrigued.The dream of power starts all so well, everyone trying equally hard, things running like clockwork then everything takes a horrible turn over Power Hungry animals.My views on the book are that it is cleverly worded in a sophisticated language that people will take pleasure out of reading."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"The Animal Farm was a very interesting book written by George Orwell. If you didn't pay attention closely you could miss something important. The book was held at the end of World War 2 at a farm.

Any story with that many reviews speaks for itself. What I would like to contribute is that of all the books I was assigned to read when I was in high school, this is one of the few that I can't wait until my kids get assigned. Although I will try and read any book they have for homework, this is one I know I'll read. Playing devil's advocate, picking actual people to fill the roles in the book, all will be great fun and contribute to some excellent family discussions. Can't wait! THAT is how good this story is and how well it stands the test of time."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Having read Animal Farm in one sitting, i feel that it transcends the obvious allusions to communisms and the likes to something far more poetic. Human nature, it seems, has a very deceiving quality to it. Orwell made it clear that the book was parallel with real life (Russian Revolution and such) and similarities are easily made between characters in the book and real life people. Although i'd say the biggest lesson learned is the power of mind-manipulation and how few can control many through fear.Simply put, you can call it a process... Bad people reign--good people overthrow bad people---hunger for power consumes a handful of the good people---manipulation/propaganda is instilled and WAHLA ---Once again Bad people reign... It's a sad cycle that this book has beautifully portrayed.Definitely worth a read, especially if you are \\"into\\" politics.Lucas."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm is a strong metaphor for the rise of tyranny using the model of a failing communism after the deliberate overthrow and subsequent breakdown of capitalism and democracy. In Orwell's story oppressed farm animals rebel against their masters only to find themselves falling prey to the inherent problem of an escalating despotism following emancipation that culminates in an even vaster gap of inequality between upper and lower classes with the wants of the very few outweighing the needs of a neglected majority that are slowly turned into isolated brainwashed slaves controlled by fear.The ideology of equality is sound but in overthrowing the ruling elite who cannot say that yet another privileged will not emerge? An even stronger dictatorship that can control the masses with the intimidating thought that if the populace doesn't obey any order then the old ways can come back? What makes Animal Farm so good is that it explains how revolutions designed to close the differences in rank can be easily exploited. This is the inevitable dilemma faced by all civilizations that desire governed order and is especially true of socialism and communism. Nobody has captured the difficulty of the exploitation of trust and power any better than Orwell has done with Animal Farm.Animal Farm doesn't answer any questions but makes lots of them and is all about awareness of these possibilities, a conundrum born out from our systemic need to consolidate power socially.Orwell based his work on a combination of the Bolshevik revolutionaries and Stalinism but the overall message is a one of warning about how any system of political control can become corrupt if it is allowed run with carte blanche.It is also a message about how awareness of one's own strength can suddenly change the balance and for this reason has been seen as subversive material. Animal Farm is often banned by most totalitarian regimes and even some governments had banned it because they didn't understand it or believed that its anti-communism message was considered too strong for public consumption."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:F,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},q={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],N={key:0},R={key:1};function M(n,e,s,u,r,i){const c=g("PoemCard");return t(),o("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",q,[(t(!0),o(f,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,w)=>(t(),p(c,{key:w,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),o("span",R,"Loading...")):(t(),o("span",N,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const E=m(O,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-4373beca"]]),B=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/38.md","filePath":"quotes/38.md"}'),j={name:"quotes/38.md"},W=Object.assign(j,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(E)]))}});export{B as __pageData,W as default};
