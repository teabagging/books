What if we as a civilization decided that instead of spending tens of thousands of dollars on caring for people once they got old, we decided on a specific age that people would no longer be allowed to live? What if a group of young people decided on what that age would be? What would happen once the young people who made that decision started to reach \\"the fixed period\\"?"},{"Title":"The Fixed Period (The World's Classics)","review":"In this novel, written in 1882 but set in the 1980s, Trollope creates an island called Britannula (capital Gladstonopolis) which had been settled by a group of young men from New Zealand. It had been granted self-government as a republic by Great Britain (on the lines of New Zealand etc), only to have had it taken away again at the point of a British battleship's guns (called a \\"steam swiveller\\") when the government of Britannula about to implement, in accordance with a law the young men had passed, the Fixed Period. (One of the weaknesses of the book is that we are told about this d&eacute;nouement right at the beginning - so the spoiler is not mine.) This law laid down that at the age of 67 its citizens should be deposited in a college for a year's preparatory and honoured stay, at the end of which year they should leave this world by way of euthanasia, to be followed by cremation.The story is told by President John Neverbend (Trollope is not subtle in the names he bestows on several of his characters), one of the creators of the law and a fanatic and self-righteous believer in it, and in the opening chapter he eloquently explains why it is for the benefit both of society, which will not have to support unproductive members, and of the senior citizens themselves, who will be spared the often prolonged sufferings that old age brings with it.Needless to say, a law enacted by men in their thirties and forties lost its appeal, to the disgust of John Neverbend, as they were approaching the Fixed Period. The first to reach that age was a still vigorous sexagenarian, ten years Neverbend's senior, who had been a stout supporter and friend of his, when the law had been passed. But, as I said, we have known since the beginning of the novel that the British would intervene to save him, which to an extent draws the sting from the prolonged account of how he struggles against it.The story involves a much-courted maiden, a cricket match between the Britanullans and a team from England (in which much of the bowling is done by a machine called a steam-bowler!). And when Neverbend expresses republican sentiments, we have to wonder whether these are also Trollope's.Trollope is here as readable as he always is. In his great novels there is often a repetition, over and over again, of what is in the minds of his characters - we accept that repetition there because of the realism: people DO mull over certain ideas in various combinations and permutations. So it is here; but I thought that here it is a matter of padding out a story rather than of developing a character. One could write a credible novel about supporters and opponents of a law ALLOWING euthanasia for the frail elderly under certain circumstances (indeed I wish we did live in such a society); but the situation in this book is too artificial, too much written with tongue-in-cheek, even to be taken seriously as an allegory. At best it can be taken as a sometimes witty jeux d'esprit. And Trollope could not find a neat end to the story because Neverbend's tale concludes abruptly when we would like to know more about the next stage of his life."},{"Title":"The Fixed Period (The World's Classics)","review":"Interesting idea, and some humorous moments, but overall this book has far too many words for its story."},{"Title":"Kawasaki 80-350Cc Rotary Valve, 1966-2001 (Clymer Motorcycle Repair)","review":"I own a 1973 Kawasaki G5-A and according to the description this would be the manual for me.

For those less motivated to hunt for Falling Off, The Middle of the World, The Year of Common Things, and Astronomy of Love, this is perfect buy as it includes most of the poems in those collections as well as poems from her more recent book of poems, Little Girls in Church.The cover art isn't especially beautiful (surprising since it is a University of Pitt Press book) and the title is a bit weak, but let neither of these things discourage you from purchasing the book. If you're a fan of any of KN's work (non-fiction or poetry), you'll want this collection. If you're a ardent reader of contemporary poetry, you'll want this collection. If you'd never read poetry beyond high school, you'll want to open this book, as it will surely make you hungry for more poetry.Like her instructions to angels in her poem &quot;Excerpts from the Angel Handbook,&quot; she is always asking us to be open and wary, skeptical and believing, and dreaming and restless. Her poems implore us to be better than we are, to listen more closely to the music in our head, and to watch out for and care for the lonely traveler, the needy neighbor, the lost among us, and the loving."},{"Title":"Journey: New and Selected Poems, 1969-1999 (Pitt Poetry)","review":"Now I see so clearly on the dayswhen rain turns to snowwind passes quicklyalong the surfaces of things,how calmly it probes this chilly placewhere I have movedwith everything I own.~ from Evaporation poem 3While reading Kathleen Norris' poems, I cannot help feeling nostalgic for a life I've never lived. Then, suddenly she writes about a part of a life I have lived and I can somehow relate to both situations.I started to read this book months ago, and then finally decided to read three poetry books all in a row. I am impressed with Kathleen's poems because they take many forms and express a wide range of emotions. She is the ever-observant poet who can remember the exact details of her experiences, right down to the exact wording of various conversations.\\"Excerpts from the Angel Handbook\\" threw me into an instant state of amusement. In this poem angels are instructed in such important principles as hiding their wings or listening and never telling a lie.You will never tell a lie,but you will have many secrets.In fact, the poem amused me so much... I am going to send it to a friend who claims he is an angel. I'm amused.Then, onward to the erotic musings in \\"The Dancers.\\" In this poem, a preacher's daughter reveals her thoughts about a farmer boy.Through reading Kathleen's poetry, you enter her inner world and peer out through her words, observing the sheer magnificence of a world in which a poet dances.The first few poems( 1969-1973) seem to have a coolness in their observation. By the time you reach \\"Inheritance\\" on page 31, you can feel Kathleen starting to really delve into her deeper emotions.The poems from 1982-1986 are filled with surprises. Anyone who loves to cook will enjoy the exuberant \\"Pommes de Terre.\\" If you are looking for something a little more innocently erotic, you might enjoy \\"Young Lovers with Pizza.\\"By the time you reach the poems from 1987-1999, you have seen Kathleen explore so many emotions and worlds. She seems to be returning to deeply rooted traditions. She says goodbye to those she loves, she seems to be searching for meaning and then finally seems to find a place for God in her life.I also loved the last poem and especially the last six lines about the bumblebee.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"New and Selected Poems: v. 1","review":"In Mary Olivers poems you can feel the deep connection she has to the nature and it is amazing how she connects her observation with our own being a part of it."},{"Title":"New and Selected Poems: v. 1","review":"Mary Oliver is my favorite poet.

Her naturalistic views of spirituality are beautiful affirmations of life and nature. Living in a coastal state myself, I &#34;get&#34; her metaphors."},{"Title":"New and Selected Poems: v. 1","review":"Volume One of Mary Oliver's New and Selected Poems collection trails off (metaphorically; the book is arranged in reverse chronological order) after reprinting her New Poems compilation from 1991-1992; its 30-year span also encompasses Oliver's No Voyage and Other Poems collection from 1963 and 1965.Many are quick to notice the common theme of nature in Oliver's work. Oliver herself cites Blake, who, in \\"Spring Azures,\\" she imagines \\"in the dirt and sweat of London - a boy / Staring through the window, when God came / Fluttering up\\" in the form of blue flowers, inspiring him to \\"turn ... away forever / From the factories, the personal strivings, / To a life of the imagination.\\" Likewise, in \\"Some Questions You May Ask,\\" Oliver compares \\"The face of a moose\\" to \\"the face of Jesus,\\" implying its equal ability to have a soul, and humanity's lack of dominion over the earth. On the contrary, to not come to see the great gifts of nature, Oliver implies repeatedly, is to be but a visitor to this world (\\"When Death Comes\\").Several reviewers point to \\"Wild Geese\\" and \\"The Journey\\" as Oliver's furthest-reaching poems, both of which first appeared in her 1986 compendium, Dream Work. The behavior of wild geese is, of course, what Oliver urges readers to mimic, observing them as they \\"head ... home,\\" loving \\"what [they] love,\\" doing what feels right, no matter how \\"harsh or exciting.\\" In \\"The Journey,\\" a \\"road full of fallen / Branches and stones\\" implies the same harsh excitement of one following their dream, with an additional focus on humanity's foibles: \\"though the voices around you / Kept shouting / their bad advice [...] you didn't stop. / You know what you had to do.\\" In the end, the speaker must save only herself. Like many readers, I enjoy most Oliver's insights into humanity mixed with her lovely nature imagery. Poems like \\"Alex,\\" chronicling the forgotten old man who \\"chased my brother once / Waving a rusty gun,\\" with \\"hungry eyes / For money and the bottle,\\" and others from Oliver's The River Styx, Ohio, and Other Poems collection (1972), by indulging in descriptions of humanity's own nature, have perhaps the greatest impact."},{"Title":"New and Selected Poems: v. 1","review":"As long as she is living--and let's hope she goes on a long while--we will probably not get the many volumes of her complete collected poems. In the meantime, this volume, along with the second volume, will suffice. Mary Oliver lives within her readers by taking us into the sensuality of living, so we are tasting, feeling, perceiving, smelling, touching, intuiting the depths of the world. She brings out in us how to intuit this world and live in it, and then our psyches sprout out into soul and spirit. She is not just native American in that way, but Native American, and Native Human. Rain, grass, sky, the simplest elements, become the here-all and be-all, the true way to prosper, far from the gray walls of the office.This work has already become a handbook, browned on the page edges where my thumbs sweat on them opening to one place or another.

One hurried morning while rushing to get to work I stopped long enough to watch a rare interview Mary had granted to Maria Shriver. Then, like something new to us usually does, she began appearing everywhere and I felt singularly drawn toward her until I finally decided to purchase this book.

But, recently, a newspaper article mentioned that Maria Shriver liked one poem so much she kept it on her desk. Out of curiosity, I read it online. It was a poem called \\"The Journey\\" by Mary Oliver.Finally, a poem made sense to me! It spoke to me.I read another of her poems online and it was the same. That's when I decided to buy my first book of poetry, \\"New and Selected Poems,\\" Volume One, so I could sample poems from many of her books.Reading her poems are like taking a walk with Mary, albeit seeing through her eyes and hearing her thoughts. Her descriptions and phrases are like moment by moment photographs of her walk. The words are simple, but the images and emotions they convey, are clear -- and because of their acknowledgement, they are important and powerful, something you are glad to know.So, this is not a typical review of a poetry book. I don't know anything about the techniques or rules or what is considered classic poetry. All I can tell you is they are compelling. Each one pulls pull me in and I race through to see how it ends. Then, I go back to reread and savor the words and phrases. (Me! The non-poetry reader. I've surprised myself!)Reading Mary Oliver's biography was also important to me. It provided me with a perspective about her and her poems that only made them seem more alive -- more of her. I recommend doing this to anyone who wants to read more of her poems, as I did for the first time."},{"Title":"New and Selected Poems: v. 1","review":"The best poems say with words that which can't be said with words. I know that sounds like double-talk, but it's true. The best poems act as catalysts, creating emotions and connections in us that the words taken by themselves just don't convey. For example, veteran poet Mary Oliver's poem \\"Rain\\" (the first in her \\"New and Selected Poems, Volume One\\") opens with \\"All afternoon it rained, then / such power came down from the clouds / on a yellow thread, / as authoritative as God is supposed to be. / When it hit the tree, her body / opened forever.\\" Beautiful, profound, and any attempt at explanation effectively kills the poetry.Mary Olver's poems are like that: clear imagery, simple language, common themes brought together like \\"power . . . on a yellow thread\\" that packs a wallop. How's THIS for a brightly-lit thought: \\"Is the soul solid, like iron? / Or is it tender and breakable, like / the wings of a moth in the beak of the owl?\\"And this seasoned poet has a few observations about life to share with us: \\"You do not have to be good. / You do not have to walk on your knees / for a hundred miles through the desert, repenting. / You only have to let the soft animal of your body love what it loves.\\"I've already ordered her \\"New and Selected Poems, Volume Two.\\""},{"Title":"New and Selected Poems: v. 1","review":"My favorite book of poetry, winner of the 1992 Nat'l book for Poetry and the Pulitzer Prize.

These poems speak to the primal heart of the basic emotions, the senses, and the humanity which anyone can understand.

Can't see that I, or anyone else, will be making that Kindle purchase."},{"Title":"New and Selected Poems: v. 1","review":"Every poem in this book is a gem, and the collection made me want to read her complete works. While this is definitely not &quot;religious poetry&quot; of the greeting card variety, it is an expression of a deep spiritual awareness. Oliver's poems often reveal an amazement and wonder at being alive. Poetic skill and heightened awareness are so well-integrated, those who are looking for well-crafted poetry will certainly find it, and those who are looking for an awakening of consciousness may also find that.Although Oliver's environment, her field of play, is nature, I wouldn't reduce her to a &quot;naturalist poet.&quot; Nature is always interpreted and absorbed by her vision. Nature reveals its secrets to her, but they are the secrets of her own soul. In her poetry, nature is the oracle that reveals the human psyche.But I should include Oliver's own words, because no prose critique can do justice to the intoxicating natural imagery of her poems. In the poem &quot;Peonies&quot;, the richness and fertility of nature mirror the same qualities of the imagination:This morning the green fists of the peonies are getting ready to break my heartas the sun rises,as the sun strokes them with his old, buttery fingersand they open- pools of lace,white and pink- and all day the black ants climb over them,boring their deep and mysterious holes into the curls,craving the sweet sap,...The poem ends with a challenge that reverberates through the book. In spite of the sense of death looming sometimes on the edge of the poem (and our lives), sometimes at the center, are we willing to fully experience life?Do you love this world?Do you cherish your humble and silky life?Do you adore the green grass, with its terror beneath?Do you also hurry, half-dressed and barefoot, into the garden,and softly,and exclaiming of their dearness,fill your arms with the white and pink flowers,with their honeyed heaviness, their lush trembling,their eagernessto be wild and perfect for a moment, before they arenothing forever?"},{"Title":"New and Selected Poems: v. 1","review":"The only problem with a volume of Mary Oliver's collected poems is that whichever poems end up excluded are likely to be the reader's loss. Such incomparable consistency of craft and soul can be expected, every single time, from Ms. Oliver!That said, no poem here is undeserving of its inclusion, and if it took an anthology like this to have you wonder about reading her for the first time, then thank God for this book.Included here -note that this is only the first volume- are works from her earlier books, all of which are worth buying separately. A particularly important inclusion are the selections of American Primitive, in my opinion her most moving and accomplished collection.Those who adore poems like the glorious &quot;Wild Geese&quot; or were moved by the wisdom of &quot;The Journey,&quot; will be happy to know that they are, of course, contained in this volume, along with many others begetting similar acclaim.So, five stars for Ms. Oliver only because I can't give her ten.As far as the publisher, I would have liked a clearer indication that this is the very same edition already published years ago. At least in my case, the additional subtitle -&quot;Volume One&quot;- confused me and led me to buy something I already owned. In the other hand, if such mention indicates the upcoming release of a second volume -specially if more uncollected poems may be part of it, I'll be satisfied and forgiving.For those who own everything by her and do not possess this volume, this is still a valid purchase on the basis of the, once, &quot;new poems&quot; contained and not available anywhere else.Welcome -or welcome back- to the poetry of Mary Oliver.

No one, of all the readers who have written in, has singled out my favorite poem. I won't say it's better than anyone else's favorite; we all have our own special pathways to the heart, and different poems reach different people. But I've carried a clipping of it with me for years, since it appeared in an earlier collection, and I'm thrilled to see again in this new one. If only one person decides to read this book on the basis of this poem, it will be worth it for me.

Here is a poet who can lay such a careful argument that a line like: \\"We hope for magic; mystery endures.\\" flows naturally from its contest into the verses that follow. Others: \\"To live in this world // you must ebe able / to do three things: / to love what is mortal; / to hold it // against your bones kknowing / your own life depends on it; / and, when the time comes to let it go, / to let it go.\\" \\"Oh what good it does the heart / to know it isn't magic!\\" \\"I don't know exactly what prayer is. / I do know how to pay attention. ... / Tell me, what else should I have done?\\" \\"... the heart cries aloud: / yes, I am willing to be / that wild darkness, / that long, blue body of light.\\" All this, mind you, in the contest of sumptuous, sharply observed, nature poetry. (The poems on owls I find particularly arresting.) This as superb as any carefully edited anthology can be -- and it's by a single author! What must Volume 2 (published October 2005) be like?!?"},{"Title":"New and Selected Poems: v. 1","review":"Mary Oliver's poem &quot;The Journey&quot; came into my life when I was seriously ill and in desperate need of permission to rest. That poem became a talisman, a mentor, a voice ringing with sanity. I have shared it with many, many people over the last 10 years.... I've yet to encounter another poet whose voice is as pure, clear, lucid, and present. Mary's poems combine all the wonder of early childhood with the exquisite vision and discernment of someone who deeply, minutely, wildly loves Creation. Her poems are blessings, nothing less."},{"Title":"New and Selected Poems: v. 1","review":"With a Pulitzer and a National Book Award, Mary Oliver's poems will catch one's attention. But besides the kudos, this is plainly incredible writing. Her poetry comes closer to the sensibility, depth, and power of Emily Dickinson's writing than anyone in history. Yet Oliver is not a copycat version of the lady in white. Oliver's Nature has its very own stylistic plumes and claws. In a world of mainstream and so-what poetry, Oliver's insights continually cause me to catch my breath and say, Oh, yes. If you love poetry, if you occasionally collect a special volume, or if you're a novice poetry reader who doesn't want to get lost in the &quot;wherefor's&quot; and wails of pompous or confessional poetry, this is a book to own and love again and again"},{"Title":"New and Selected Poems: v. 1","review":"After Sept. 11, I read this book each night before going to sleep. The poems give me hope, help me focus on what's real and beautiful in the world, and inspire me. I've given copies to several friends, I just can't imagine anyone not being deeply moved by this book. I am so grateful to my husband for introducing me to the awe-inspiring work of Mary Oliver."},{"Title":"New and Selected Poems: v. 1","review":"My minister chose to read from Mary Oliver one Sunday, in place of her usual sermon. She read other poetry from other poets as well, but when she read &quot;The Sunflowers&quot; and &quot;Creeks&quot; I shut my eyes and felt the words, the air, the water! I was so inspired."},{"Title":"New and Selected Poems: v. 1","review":"My copy is dog-eared, and I've bought copies for friends in Ireland, Germany and Ecuador, as well as at home. Oliver's poems of the natural world help us see our oneness with All That Is. I hear her poems read in my Buddhist sangha, my Catholic parrish and also at AA meetings. I'd give her six stars for this book if I could!"},{"Title":"Lie With Me","review":"Have only begun to read this little book. Little meaning it is about the size of a childs board book. This disappointed me. I was expecting a novel. Considered returning it even. But if you want a hot \\"little\\" read about the exploits of the character, this will do it for you. Reads like the fantasy section of Penthouse. Not sure if it's really worth $18.95 Canadian but it's paid for now so what the heck.You decide."},{"Title":"The Heavyweight Champions","review":"The Heavyweight Champions is a history of boxing specific to the heavyweight division. In the first chapter John Durant gives us a brief history of ancient boxing dating back to the bloody brawls during the time of the Roman Empire and quickly moves to the modern bare knuckle era, but the emphasis is on the modern history of the gloved heavyweights beginning with James Corbett (champion 1892-1897).There are several updated copyrights. The one that I have is from nineteen-seventy-three and ends with George Forman being the new champion.This book is actually quite a good narrative giving details of many of the prominent bouts in modern times along with a sprinkling of black and white photos. If you're a boxing fan you will enjoy reading this one even if you are already familiar with the outcome of the majority of the fights.The inside covers both front and back on my copy have a set of tables listing many interesting stats on all of the gloved heavyweight champions up to nineteen-seventy-three. The tables list such things as the number of title defenses, fight records, height and weight, reach etc. It's just a good reference chart.If you can find a copy it's well worth reading for the entertainment value alone."},{"Title":"The Heavyweight Champions","review":"When I was 14 I accidentally picked up this book in the library where I worked (as a lowly library page). I was not able to put it down.When I was 19 I picked it up again to the same effect. Now at 33 I find myself re-reading it and I still can't put it down. You see, the history of the heavyweight crown reads like a history of the world. As the belt moves from champion to champion, John Durant succinctly shows the reader the tumult and excitement of the times that the champions lived in. This is a story of the boxing greats' ups and downs. Durant builds up a champion to the invincible heights that the sport and John Q. Public put him in and takes us through to their sometimes miserable lows. AMAZING BOOK! One of my favourites of all time."},{"Title":"The Heavyweight Champions","review":"This book is a good, but not great or perfect Boxing book. It gives some decent (although mostly known) stories about the Boxing Heavyweight Lineal Champions until the 70s, but nothing that you should probably be going out of your way for. If you have cash hanging around, worth to pick up a copy, but otherwise, not really."},{"Title":"The $5 Billion Misunderstanding: The Collapse of the Navy's A-12 Stealth Bomber Program","review":"I was a test engineer for a sub-contractor on this \\"black hole\\" program . During my two year stay on the program , I certainly saw no \\"waste and fraud\\" nor did a good friend of mine at GD who was very closely associated with the program. For those two years we put in very long hours 6 to 7 days a week and had all of our \\"state of the art\\" test equipment up and running and certified ahead of schedule . The book tells it as it was , a program that was mis-managed by the Navy from the day the contract was signed . The airframe producers , General Dynamics and Mcdonnell Douglas , found their hands tied as they didn't get the support they were expecting from Northrop's \\"learning curve\\" on the B2 program . This coupled with the never ending design changes requested by the Navy brought on the inevitable cost over runs . This is a superbly written book by the author of \\"The Pentagon Paradox\\" , another \\"must read\\" book !"},{"Title":"The $5 Billion Misunderstanding: The Collapse of the Navy's A-12 Stealth Bomber Program","review":"The A-12 program is probably the single most expensive cancellation in the history of US defense acquisition. The US taxpayer ended up shelling out about $5 billion dollars and got.....nothing. (That would have bought over seven million of those $700 hammers you've heard about!) Mr. Stevenson takes a look at the origins of the program in the earliest research in \\"stealth\\" technology, how the Navy illegally started the program without Congressional funding, the lack of oversight of contractor performance, and the totally heinous behavior of the Secretary of Defense, who in April 1990 told Congress that \\"the program appears to be reasonably well-handled at this point\\" and six months later cancelled the program in such a manner that the prime contractors, McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics, were able to win in court over $2 billion in costs PLUS $400 million in legal fees.I worked at McAir during the period covered by this book. I watched about 6,000 hard-working engineers and technicians get laid off in a single week, and I had to do the work of three peoople after those layoffs, so yes, I'm pretty bitter about the whole thing. But anyone who pays taxes ought to be bitter about the totally irresponsible (and yes, illegal) way the program was conceived, awarded, managed, and terminated.My only complaint is that the book covers only the top-level decision-making. You won't find any \\"lessons learned\\" on program management or personal stories of the fraud, waste, and abuse that went on. Oh, yes, in spite of assertions to the contrary, McDonnell and GD BOTH cooked the books and overspent WILDLY on travel, overtime, and facilities (although the description of GD's Building 500 [page 196] is a nice appetizer for the KIND of waste that I saw SO VERY MUCH of.) Still, this is the first time the story has been brought to the attention of the general public, and it's one that is more relevant than ever today. \\"Black\\" programs make up increasingly large percentages of the defense budget and it is nearly impossible for Congress to see just exactly what is being done with that money. Highly recommended reading."},{"Title":"The $5 Billion Misunderstanding: The Collapse of the Navy's A-12 Stealth Bomber Program","review":"This book is a good managerial/legal overview but lacks technical depth and any analysis of the human cost incurred by the A-12 cancellation debacle. It exhaustively details program management missteps and lays out the legal argument which favors the contractor assertion that the program (excuse me, contract) was terminated for convenience. However, the reader is left with the misleading impression that most engineering problems (and there were many) were resolved by the time of cancellation. However, in January 1991, there were many challenges ahead that drawing release tracking charts did not reflect. In the final analysis, Dick Cheney did the right thing the wrong way and thousands of workers were fired virtually overnight by companies that had mortgaged their futures trying to get a piece of the stealth pie; Mr. Stevenson got it mostly right."},{"Title":"The $5 Billion Misunderstanding: The Collapse of the Navy's A-12 Stealth Bomber Program","review":"I was an analyist with the Office of the Secretary of Defense during the A-12 program life. As such, I knew most of the personalities in this book. Mr. Stevenson's presentation is accurate and correct, as to the best of my recollection. It is a great read, and truly astounding that such an important and expensive program was mananaged with such incompetance and blatant disrespect for the law. If you're not outraged at the Pentagon's procurement apparatus at the end of this book, check your pulse.What I did feel was missing, was a telling of general euphoria, arrogance, and excitement that defined the Pentagon during the Regan adminstrations. Money flowed like water and every service -- not just the Navy or the Air Force -- rushed to the trough. Black programs, especially stealth, proliferated wildely, and all this was just considered \\"normal\\". Of course there were billions of dollars being wasted on programs such as the A-12, but then everybody was doing it! I wish a bit more of the popular attitudes of the times had been addressed to provide context."},{"Title":"The $5 Billion Misunderstanding: The Collapse of the Navy's A-12 Stealth Bomber Program","review":"Mr. Stevenson does it again in his second book on the stpuid spending decisions that come from the Pentagon. In this book he covers the fraud, waste, mis-management, and general abuse of the laws and rules of both the Navy and the Nation in trying to buy a plane that even the Navy didn't want right away. This book talks about it all from the hatred of the various under secretary's of the project and how they tried to kill it. How the Navy went about skipping major milestones and reporting laws in the name of \\"National Security\\", how the USAF didn't want to share thier lessons learned in builiding the F-117A and B-2A under the same \\"National Security\\" banner (let alone they wanted to control all stealth projects) and finally after spending all of 5 billion US dollars and 10 yrs of development all that the American taxpayer had to gain from it was a non-working wooden mock up, thousands of thousands of sheets of memos and designs, and a bunch of bolts that did absoultely nothing. He uses this aqusition project as another attempt to show the world what is wrong with how the US buys its weapons systems. In this book you can pick up some more ideas as to how he thinks one should go about buying everything from thread to carriers and how the contracts should be written. When you read through the lines. There are numerous footnotes and a well stock biblograhpy so the reader can track down the source of a subject if then need to. This is a wonderful compainion to his previous book on the F-18 Horent."},{"Title":"Quotable Hogan (Potent Quotables)","review":"Before Ben Hogan's sad passing in July 1997 there were only 5 books about his life and his work. Of there 5 there were only 2 that were anywhere near biographical \\"Hogan the Man Who Played for Glory\\" by Gene Gregston and \\"My Partner Ben Hogan\\" by Jimmy Demaret. Neither was authorised. Of the rest 2 were Hogan's classic instruction books and the last a photographic coffee table book by Martin Jenkins. All very good books.Since Hogan's death much more has been written some of it good, some great (Curt Sampson), but unfortunately some seem to want to take the great man's name in vane. In my opinion there are 2 books in the latter category that fall foul of this in exploiting the name of the most revered golfer ever. One of the titles is \\"As Hogan Said.....\\" by Randy Voorhees, this other title is is \\"Quotable Hogan\\".Quotable Hogan is a collection of quotes by Hogan and others including fellow professionals, writers and his wife Valerie that have all probably been heard and read before and now repeated again, some for the umpteenth time. Hogan said very little, so this book has had to be padded out with large print, wide spacing and comments by other people. On some pages, although it will be argued that it is done for emphasis, there is only 1 quote printed. The maximum is 4 over 129 pages (which includes the acknowledgements and meagre photography etc.).I am a collector of Hogan literature, as a devotee I feel that not only is Mr Hogan's name been exploited but so are the people like me. I am sure Mr Hogan would not have had approved and neither do I.Incidentally, I believe it was Valerie Hogan (not Ben) who said, \\"Why don't you hit them closer to the hole\\"? (page 82, quote 8)."},{"Title":"Quotable Hogan (Potent Quotables)","review":"I also am an avid Ben Hogan admirer and reader of works about him, and I found this book very informative. Yeah, I've read some of these quotes before, but a lot of them I hadn't, and that's the purpose of a book like this---to bring all his best stuff together in one book. Author Rich Skyzinski did all the research that would have taken me months or years on my own. Hogan didn't say much over the years, but that's exactly what makes this book so valuable; it digs out all his best quotes from over the years. I loved it!, and I've met Hogan--several times, and at length---and I think he would have gotten a kick out of it because of the author's diligence."},{"Title":"LoveSmart: Transforming the Emotional Patterns That Sabotage Relationships","review":"This book has excellent material for getting through the bumpy start-up of a new relationship or for getting through the low points of an existing relationship. But even more, Sandra Michaelson provides the positive guidance that takes a relationship into new territory. Recommended reading for anyone who wondered what it takes to be happy with a partner."},{"Title":"Faith Works","review":"I really liked the preview of this book. Jim says many things we have all heard before but says it so well! I too believe we need to look beyond our backdoor or comfort zones and really open our eyes to what's going on around us. By that I mean nationally and internationally. There are many things wrong in this world and unless we as Christians are willing to take up the cross of Jesus in mission and doing for the least of them, things will remain as they are. Mr. Wallis has written a book previously entitled Who Speaks For God? It is excellent and explains the Sojourners magazine he is the editor of. I would encourage all readers to explore his work."},{"Title":"Faith Works","review":"Jim Wallis is a brilliant and compassionate man who preaches his faith like nobody else. He is level-headed and not at all inflammatory, which is beautiful and so rare these days. I am not a particularly religious person, so when he speaks of 'faith' I think of it as 'faith' in humanity and the substitution works just fine. This book is for people who are done hating and being angry about the current state of our country (no matter your political persuasion) and who are truly looking for some way to help bring about change. For someone to have that strong a reaction against a man like Jim Wallis is, who unlike everyone these days has no hidden political agenda, is very bizarre. He is a TRUE Christian (yes, some still exist) and his priority is practicing and teaching the lessons of Christ, which don't include starting wars, sentencing people to death, degrading the poor, quieting dissenting voices, etc. FYI, those who read that last sentence as a poltiical statement rather than an honest recitation of the teachings of Christ are not ready for Jim Wallis's message (like, I suspect, the man who gave this one star)."},{"Title":"Faith Works","review":"Gee, we have to have \\"Faith Based\\" organizations to change lives and neighborhoods across America. What a load of BS. From the day this country was formed there were people taking care of people whether faith was involved or not. Walls just loves to get preachy on the platform of righteousness. People who care about others are religious or not. They just have a basic need to get outside of EGO and place the welfare of others equal to their own. To place Religion doctrine (which is NOT necessarily \\"Christian\\") before the feeding of the hungry is as anti-Christian as it gets."},{"Title":"Sailing Small: Inspiration and Instruction for the Pocket Cruiser","review":"After recently realising that a small, traditional boat can have many advantages over today's 'dream boat', it was a delight to discover others that share the experience.

Similar data is included on element concentrations in various plants, and in rocks according to type. Coverage is biased towards the northern hemisphere, where, of course, most studies have been made to this date.The mobility of various ions, as a function of soil pH, is graphed. So is the ratio of concentration of elements in soil relative to their counterparts in the lithosphere.Although this is not a book about rare earth elements (REEs), it contains a treasure trove of information relative to them.

There is also data on concentrations of lanthanides in soils of various stated types, and in terrestrial plant species."},{"Title":"Your Special Gift (A Preteen Primer to the Facts of Life)","review":"I loved this book! Mrs. McCormick hits an excellent balance. She uses today's phrases to delicately teach young people about how special their bodies are.

I think parents would do well to share it with their children in this age group."},{"Title":"Your Special Gift (A Preteen Primer to the Facts of Life)","review":"This is a gentle, touching book that encourages children to see their own inner beauty.

It seems to be lost in a time warp, far more apropos to the 1950's, rather than 2012, when I purchased it. We are Christians, and that was one of the book's selling points. Now that I have read it, I couldn't give it away-that's how bad it is.

The very first chapter turned me off of this author forever. If I ever do get bored enough to pick it up again, it will be for a laugh. I'm sorry, but there is a particular sentence towards the front of the book that is so stupid, I was embarrassed for the author. I bought the book because my two favorite authors didn't have any new books out so I decided to try something new. I wish I had saved my money. I don't usually give bad reviews, but....I had to do this."},{"Title":"The Border Hostage","review":"We first met the Kennedy's in TEMPTED when Flaming Tina Kennedy stole the heart of Ramsey &quot;Black&quot; Douglas set to the brackdrop of the Border turmoils of 17th century Scotland before the Battle of Flodden. Tina's half gypsy brother Heath plays an important role in helping his sister find her heart desire and was deserving of his own story.Well... in THE BORDER HOSTAGE, Ms Henley doesn't disappoint.Heath is living with his sister and her husband some months after the horrendous battle at Flodden which about distroyed all of the &quot;Flowers of Scotland&quot;. Heath ignored by the rest of Kennedy Clan as their father's by blow, has found his place with the Douglas clan as a horse trainer. Thru his Celtic gift of magic he senses his sister, who is swollen with child, is in dangers and he rushes to her tower room. Here he is captured by border reivers who mistake him for his brother in law Ramsey&quot; Black Ram&quot; Douglas,and in true hero fashion he willing is captured to keep both Tina and Ram safe.Across the border in England, Raven Carleton has found her own unigue niche, she trains raptors, much to her mother's dismay. Seems mother sees titles/money/status in her daughter's future and will do everything to rise above her own meeker border beginnings. Including linking with a border family's who job is to secure peace on the Enlglish side of the Borders. But Raven wants to be left alone to make her own choices both in how she will act and who she will choose for a husband, despite her interest in local &quot;catch&quot; Chris Dacre. Yet, she has a magical link to her Celtic heritage when she is inducted into the CRAFT by her grandmother. When the couple first meet, it seems in a case of mistaken identity again as Heath has been taken across the border and left for dead. Yet, he survives and finds himself at the mercy of Raven who calls him a filthy Scots bastard. Yet in true Scots Revier fashion he gets her out her clothes only to take her shirt(one of her brothers she wasn't supposed to have on) and wears it to escape. leaving her virtue intact and her being in outrage. Thru this first encounter they share an inkling of a shared magical link, but both are too concerned with their own problems to delve into what the magic might hold for them.In Heath's determination to find out who wants Black Douglas dead, he meets with Raven head on as they clash over border disputes. Yet, thru this Celtic magical bond our couple to begin a journey of love and self discovery: a highly charged senual link as only Ms Henley can provide.What makes this such a fun read is the hero is a man of courage, honor and pride. To compliment him Ms Henley has given him a heroine who like the hero is searching for self and when she must, she listens to her heart despite what others expect of her: another Flaming Tina who can't obey when her man is in touble.Readers who have read TEMPTED will enjoy meeting up with the Kennedy Clan, as they too must share a journey of discovery, forgiveness and acceptance, but this clearly Heath Kennedy's story. Although each book stands alone, if the reader hasn't read TEMPTED, buy it now along with THE BORDER HOSTAGE, you won't be disappointed. It was a delight for this reader to see Ms Henley return to her classic historical romances. The pace is measured and the story is exceptional with loves discovery at the forefront and history in the background giving it depth, until the final page,Here is hoping we readers get Duncan's story in the near future. THE BORDER HOSTAGE is worth the hardcover price and is classic historical romance."},{"Title":"The Border Hostage","review":"This was the first Virginia Henley book I tried reading. I was drawn by the summary at the back of the book, it sounded intriguing and sexy. But after reading the first few pages of this book, I could guess what kind of a story it would be like and how the author was likely to write it out. How can you begin a romance by description of two horses mating? Ms. Henley's choice of words also leaves a lot to be desired. Does everything have to be sexual?No romantic depth here. And I don't get the ravishing each other in their dreams thing either. There's a lot of sexual teasing in this book, which made it seem more lustful than romantic. I didn't exactly feel like the stones they carried around (phallic for Heath and hag for Raven) brought much weight to the story, it just made it seem strange, not adding a thing to the magical or destined feel.However, I must say that the storyline and plot are not that bad though. And Heath's character was a definate plus to it since I always enjoy it when the hero falls for the heroine first; I cannot say the same for Raven. She seemed too impulsive and silly most of the time, not a likable heroine. The dialogue between characters is not too well written, it doesn't flow naturally and is not a joy to read their bantering since it is predictable and without humour.If you don't mind a nit-wit heroine, a hot hero and a so-so storyline then get this book. Otherwise, you won't be missing out on much at all."},{"Title":"The Border Hostage","review":"The border lands between England and Scotland are dangerous places for anyone, especially a woman. Raven Carleton is unimpressed with the wild nature of her English home, for it closely mirrors her own temperament. Heath Kennedy thrives in his Scottish home, raising his horses and protecting his clan. In retribution for the theft of his prized herd, Heath takes Raven and her betrothed hostage. He has no intention of returning Raven, for she has captivated him. Raven finds herself unwillingly attracted to the rogue. In their tumultuous surroundings, love is not as easy as declaring feelings and living happily ever after. Virginia Henley has written an enjoyable story despite some flaws. The most glaring transgression is the use of words that were not part of the English language in Medieval England or using words that were in existence but had yet to take on the meaning she conveyed. This caused a &quot;jerking away&quot; from the story. Raven's thought process as she lingered between the English lord and the Scottish man leaned toward confusing at times. For a woman who flaunted convention at every opportunity, she was willing to give up true love to conform to expectations. Regardless of its problems, it still catches the interest and begs to be completely read."},{"Title":"The Border Hostage","review":"As with her previous historical romances, Virginia Henley continues her tradition in creating tales rich in historical tapestries and sultry passion. THE BORDER HOSTAGE takes the readers to the 17th century Scotland where she weaves the destined romance between an English aristocrat's daughter Raven Carleton and the roguish dark borderer Heath Kennedy who is the illegtimate son of Lord Galloway ewith Gypsy's origin.When Raven's intended fiance, Christopher Dacre attempts to kidnap Lord Ramsey Douglas, Heath Kennedy ends up mistaken as him and gets waylaid. Heath swore revenge, kidnaps Raven and his nemesis but sets him free with Raven's intervention. She is not convinced that Heath is his soulmate despite her erotic dreams and her Celtic roots that call out to her. The passion between them accelerates with Heath's chivalry in her rescue and his loyalty to the Scottish clan. Raven falls head over heels in love with this protective man who claims her as his own. However, political treachery comes in the way when Raven becomes a pawn in the deadly game masterminded by her betrothed....THE BORDER HOSTAGE is bawdy lust and highland romance at its finest despite the tangible flaw in the loose plot binding the 400 pages . The characters are scripted to finesse with their emotions afire, yet the intrigue and murder plot can never sustain the interest with its thin content. It is predictible but it is the fascination with the starstruck couple that holds us arrested."},{"Title":"The Border Hostage","review":"While I would agree with other reviewers that this is not Virginia Henley's best work, it is still a nice read. The plot is a little loose, but it moves along nicely, and the secondary characters in particular are well drawn. Heath and Raven seem a bit too willing to give each other up, but I chalk this up to dramatic necessity, thought I wish that the author had used something more believable and more consistent with her characters' temperaments.One thing Henley excels at is her excellent descriptive ability when it comes to time and place, and for that reason alone, I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Border Hostage","review":"I love Viginia Henley's books. At first this book was hard to get into. I felt the lead characters were thin. The plot really makes up for what I thought was a problem. With it's fast plot, and the characters from the first book brought back, I found it a fast and enjoyable read. Heath was different from other male characters from Henley's previos books. He was gallant, and unselfish. I was not found of Raven. I'm use to Henley's strong female characters. And Raven was naive. But even that did not dampen the story. V.H. is one of the greatest historical romance writers to me. And I hope she keeps on writing for a long time!"},{"Title":"The Border Hostage","review":"In 1514 in the Borders, six thugs abduct Heath Kennedy thinking he is Lord Douglas. He barely escapes, but soon meets Lady Raven Carleton, who is mulling over her expected marriage to Christopher Dacre, son of a Head Border Lord. Not withstanding her connections, Heath steals her horse anyway. Not long afterwards, Heath recognizes his own horse stolen by the thugs but now possessed by Christopher.As an act of revenge for the attack that he cannot prove, Heath kidnaps Christopher and Raven. He sends the former back for an insultingly low ransom, but decides to keep the latter with him a little longer because he already is falling in love with her. Heath knows that he must somehow persuade Raven that he is the right man for her in spite of his half-Gypsy blood. Raven is unable to resist her attraction to the dangerous Heath and neither can he to her, so they make love. However, a deadly conspiracy centering on the three-year-old King of Scotland plus the insulted Dacre clan make a permanent relationship between Heath and Raven seem impossible.THE BORDER HOSTAGE is the typical entertaining Virginia Henley historical romance with the twist of gypsy and Celtic powers to add depth. The story line is fast-paced and filled with action that paints the conspiratorial atmosphere of the times with fascinating colors. The lead couple is a fabulous duo while the royal machinations adds suspense and excitement to a very strong sixteenth century romance.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Border Hostage","review":"I liked this story a great deal and plan to keep the hardcover copy I bought as part of my collection. It wasn't overly dramatic but at the same time it made you sit up and think. I enjoyed how the heroine became part of what she had been brought into and the way she overcame things. Henley is very clever at weaving a story and I hope to read more of her books in the future. My hat off to you !"},{"Title":"The Border Hostage","review":"Actually, I would give this book 2 1/2 stars if I could because it was only half as good as it should have been. I am surprised that the same author who wrote &quot;Enslaved&quot; which was one of the best books I've ever read could have possible written this piece of fluff. This is a great author or I never would have spent the money on the hardcover, but when I do buy the hardcover, I expect the book to be above the average. This one was not. There was no substance. The book never really took hold and got going. Even the antagonism between the hero and heroine was limp. I never got the point. Try harder next time Virginia. I am a great fan of your and have read ALL of your books, but you let me down this time."},{"Title":"The Border Hostage","review":"I am usually a big fan of Virginia Henley's work. I'm afraid that this book did not live up to her previous work. The main characters were interesting - but the plot was very thin. I kept waiting for more to happen. Some of the plot lines were just dropped with no explanation. I will admit that I finished the book 3 days after it arrived - but it just didn't match the last two - A Woman of Passion and The Marriage Prize."},{"Title":"The Border Hostage","review":"The language used in this book was just so wrong for the time period, as well as some of the plot twists (why is it okay for a proper English lady in the 1500s to travel by herself through the forest in the dark while her brother travels on?), it was extremely distracting. I thought I was going to go crazy if I heard about Raven exploring her \\"sexual\\" self again. Raven was a total twit, Heath was definitely hot, and I have no clue what attracted him to her. Oh, and the ending? Completely unbelievable. Two stars for Heath, and that's about it."},{"Title":"The Border Hostage","review":"What are you guys crazy? How could you leave such bad reviews? This is a very good book. I read it about a month or two ago and I still have a clear picture in my head."},{"Title":"The Border Hostage","review":"After reading Tempted, I was eagerly looking forward to this book. I loved Heath from Tempted and really wanted to see how his character played out in his own story. Well, I was very disappointed.One of things that disappointed me is the lack of storytelling when it came to the two characters falling in love. When Heath told Raven he loved her, I asked myself why? It just didnt seem right, he had hardly met her at that point. Halfway through the book, all of a sudden, Raven loves him--out of nowhere! I mean, at least in Tempted, Henley describes characteristics that a woman (Tina) fell in love with (in Ram), he was kind to children, he was kind to her...things that just opened the heroines eyes. But with Raven, her feelings for Heath went from cold to hot with no explanation in between.Also, there was way too much plot and not enough romance. The characters could have definitely been better defined.Again, I am a Henley fan, but felt she could do better. By the end of the book, I couldnt wait to be done with it."},{"Title":"The Border Hostage","review":"I have tried to read Ms. Henleys' work before and it isn't my cup of tea, as they say. Border Hostage was the last I will try. I found the sex scenes lewd and too graphic and the characters shallow. As an owner of two mares I particularly didn't like the lead in pages to the story. Perhaps people don't mind reading a detailed account of the mating between a stallion and mare which at first gives you the impression that it is two people and not horses, but I didn't like how it came across. I wouldn't recommend this book and it's the last of Ms. Henleys' I will buy."},{"Title":"The Border Hostage","review":"I did not care for these characters. The dialogue was so blah that they didn't feel real at all. The secondary characters were more alive than the hero and heroine. In fact, I think that the secondary characters took up more of the plot than Heath and Raven. It was almost as though Virginia Henley was plotting out her next sequel and couldn't decide on which characters she should write about. Too many to keep track of. Through more than 1/2 of the book Raven and Heath weren't even together. Even when you thought they were it might have all been a dream. When they were actually together it was so wooden and boring that there was absolutely no chemistry. I'm sure they deserved each other though. At least they believed that there was a connection. All the magic and earth healing got to be sooooo old. Yuck."},{"Title":"The Border Hostage","review":"I agree with those who didn't like this book and for pretty well the same reasons. The heroine was naive, too many secondary characters and relatives to keep track of (I hope Raven and Heath aren't related - the family background is convoluted enough they or other key married characters could be). Too much plot and VH's penchant for certain language to describe the male anatomy reminds me of a kid who just discovered a dirty word. It's boring, tedious and hardly sexy.I also always have a problem with names beginning with the same initials - it gets confusing. Donald, Donal, Dacre,Ramsay, Rob, Raven, Heath, Heron. She's not the worst at it, but I wish authors would think this through - there are 26 letters in the alphabet. Could we also lose the 'lavendar' colored eyes? And how about those exclamation marks - they're the sign of an amateur! The first sentence of the book has an exclamation mark. There are six on page 5, the first page with dialogue. After that, it's exclamation marks everywhere. The dialogue should carry the meaning without any help. I liked the gypsy component, but not the lead characters constant love-making in a dream. That too, got boring. Now, Heath I liked - there was great kindness in him for an alpha male."},{"Title":"The Border Hostage","review":"I bought The Border Hostage and The Marriage Prize.In three words, The Border Hostage was - A Great Disappointment.The first page was good, Henley started out with her usual 'purple prose' which hits you between the eyes, it's so wicked. (Remember 'The Pirate &amp; The Pagan?') Then after the first two chapters, it's downhill. It's nice that we got to revisit a couple of characters (Ramsey &amp; Raven) from a previous book (whose name escaped me right now), but this ended up as a catch 22 situation, as I cared more about these secondary characters than the main hero/heroine.Even worst, I ended up disliking a couple of characters who are going to be the main hero/heroine(?) in 'The Marriage Prize', and I haven't read the book as yet!The next book that is out in Nov. 'Ravished', doesn't sound too thrilling either. Is Henley in a downward spiral? I'll hate to think so, as two books back, she was at the top of my list. In fact, I have ALL her books to date, but now maybe I'll pick up a used copy so I won't feel bad if it turns out mediocre.Ms. Henley can do and has done much better than this. Maybe we both need a break.New readers check her backlist, there are some gems there."},{"Title":"The Border Hostage","review":"There are other Virginia Henley titles that are much better than this one. The plot was very loose, and the main female character, Raven, was extremely unlikeable. She really seemed like a twit - she frittered around never doing anything that you'd expect her to do after she learned something more about her supposed-to-be fiance (Dacre) or Heathe. Even in the end, when she accompanies Margaret across the border Raven seems confused and unclear about what she's doing. Raven is a space cadet who ends up with Heathe in the end - who knows how."},{"Title":"The Border Hostage","review":"Heath deserved all the wonderful things he earned! As a brother, son, and now a lover. A wonderful ending to v.henleys &quot;Tempted&quot; I only wish Ms. Henley wrote faster then i read."},{"Title":"The Border Hostage","review":"Flaming Tina Kennedy's gypsy brother finally gets his story and it was great and worth the wait!This was a great Scottish romance with plenty of the former characters from Tina and Ram's story mixed in with new characters to provide a entertaining read.Raven and Heath are perfectly suited to each other and their romance is full of adventure, intrigue, and lusty romance that are trademark Virgina Henley."},{"Title":"The Border Hostage","review":"I thought this book lacked some of the emotion that Tempted had however it was a great story that had me wanting it to go on. I love Henley's books. We all know that they aren't true however thats why they are called fiction. It's where the unbelievable happens. It amazes me that some of the reviews on here say that her books are unbelievable when we have vampire books that are made into top selling movies where they have half human babies? Really and a bastard son can't be proven legitimate and become heir to his fathers holdings????? People amaze me."},{"Title":"The Border Hostage","review":"I read the low reviews on this one and I don't agree. Some of them were from readers who just don't like Henley's style; in other cases they found fault with parts of the story. I was fine with it. I love Virginia Henley's ability to immediately put me in the middle of an exciting story involving people with strong passions dealing with difficult circumstances. THE BORDER HOSTAGE is no exception. It reminds me of the pirate stories I love: a strong hero who takes what he wants though he has a gentle and noble heart; and a heroine who will not be captured even if her heart longs for the man who abducts her. All this and Scotland, too! I do recommend reading TEMPTED first as this is the 2nd in Henley's Clan Kennedy Saga and is truly a sequel with some of the same characters as the first.THE BORDER HOSTAGE is set in 1514 on the Borderlands between Scotland and England after Flodden Field where King James IV was killed. Young James V, still a toddler, is being raised under the watchful eye of his English mother (Henry VIII's sister) and the Earl of Angus, acting as guardian for the young king. Tina who is married to Black Ram Douglas (their story told in TEMPTED) is about to give birth to twins and her half brother, who is a bastard and half Gypsy, Heath Kennedy, is raising horses at the Douglas Castle. A raid by Scottish Borderers hired by the English heir to Lord Dacre, Christopher Dacre (the Douglas' enemy), to steal Heath's prize brood mares, nearly costs Heath his life. In an act to recover his horses and have his revenge, Heath captures the Dacre heir (for ransom) and his betrothed, the dark-haired Raven Clarendon. Heath has seen Raven before and wants her for his own, so he decides he will not let her go when the Dacre heir is ransomed. Raven is a wonderful heroine, fiercely independent and innocent (though not unaware of the ways of men). She is a free spirit who is trained by her grandmother in the ways of the Craft, a natural healer and (unusual for a woman), a falcon trainer.This is a case of love at first encounter. Heath was quite clear about his desire to possess the lovely Raven. He'd had many women but she was the first to capture his heart. For Raven, although she was attracted to Heath, she was trying to please her parents and marry the man she thought she was supposed to. That is so very believable. So I had no problem when Raven realizes she loves Heath and can't live without him despite his questionable heritage. It was a matter of finally hearing her heart's desire and acting on it.I believe this was a worthy sequel to TEMPTED. Frankly, I enjoyed the two books so much I was hoping there were more in this saga. Henley does a superb job of weaving in the history of a tumultuous time in Scotland's history with compelling tales of love. She created such wonderful characters I wanted to see more of them. So, it's no wonder I recommend these two books."},{"Title":"The Border Hostage","review":"I thought that Heath Kennedy and Raven Carlton made a lovely match. Heath is definitely one of my all-time favorite heroes in any romance novel. With his selflessness, sensuality, compassion and strength, you could not have asked for a better male character. Raven probably was a bit naive, but she came into her own and grew in character when she was around Heath. They both had many things in common and grew to love each other through those common bonds. They fit together as well as Tina and Ramsey do in &quot;Tempted.&quot; It was a fantastic love story."},{"Title":"The Border Hostage","review":"I do not know what book &quot;St Augustine&quot; read, but it could not have been this one. I thought it was OUTSTANDING - Henley out did herself. Heath was exactly what I want in a leading man! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Border Hostage","review":"Like most of the other reviewers, I too am a big VH fan. I couldn't wait to get hold of this book as Ram and Tina's story is one of my most favourite of her books (Desired is my favourite)and I really loved Heath from this.I found the storyline a little thin as well - would have preferred a bit more depth and I would have liked Heath and Raven's relationship to develop a little slower. But the way VH describes the surrounds and the time period always gets to me - I love it!! This, combined with Ram and Tina's on going story is what made the book even more worthwhile. Overall I would reccommend this book any VH or romance novelist fan!!"},{"Title":"The Border Hostage","review":"A little thin...but then again nothing will compare, in my mind, to a Woman of Passion. A fun summer afternoon at the beach read, but it was a little too easy to put down."},{"Title":"The Border Hostage","review":"I am a huge fan of Virginia Henley and have read all of herbooks. I was disappointed in this latest novel; it seems the plot was somewhat thin and quickly devised. I enjoy her characters and historical accuracy, but this was not one of herbest works. I still think she is the best romantic fiction writer and will continue to look forward to her next release."},{"Title":"The Border Hostage","review":"I think Ms Henley is changing her writing a little, the style is a bit different than before. Even her last one 'The Marriage Prize' was also similar in style. The new ones, ie., this one, is not as exciting or action-packed as her older ones. I enjoyed curling up with her older books with all the action and excitement going on and just the right amount of romance mixed in! I liked the hero in this and I also liked the heroine, they were both very strong characters, typical of a Henley novel.~Raven Carleton is a very proper English lady and hopes to marry a proper English gentleman, but on a sunny morning, with the birds singing and the wind flying through her black hair as she gallops at breakneck speed along the seacoast, she isn't thinking about her betrothal to an aristicratic Englishman named Christoper Dacre. Suddenly she is forced to pull rein tightly on her precious horse's reins to avoid running down a man standing in the direct path of her horse! A darkly powerful man who will alter her life forever.Heath Kennedy is a diehard and loyal Scot who will defend to the death his homeland and those he loves. After barely escaping his own death at the hands of men hired to do away with him, he wakes up on the banks of River Eden and sees a beautiful ravenhaired woman riding hell-for-leather along the coast. Seeing her, he devises a plan that will teach his enemy a lesson he will soon never forget, a ransom for the wild beauty, a bargaining chip.Heath soon realizes too late that his heart is caught in the middle of this political game and he will do anything to save Raven from being used as the bait. At a time when England is reeling with treason and highborn ladies and gentleman are involved, Heath must convince Raven that he truly cares for her and that she is making a huge mistake by marrying the enemy. Can the two find love and can Raven dismiss the fact that the man she falls in love with is a hated Scot?Not what a hoped for, but it was definately worth the time and money. I thought Ms. Henley couldn't done more with the hostage plot and with the murder plot, but all in all it was a very satisfying read.Tracy Talley~@"},{"Title":"The Border Hostage","review":"I could not get through this book. The dialogue was horrible!!! I read at least one book a week and this was the worst book I've come across in a while."},{"Title":"The Border Hostage","review":"I disagree with most of the reviews on this book. Having read most of Henley's books, I believe this is one of my favorites. Heath is such a compelling character. I just loved reading about him and wished the book could just go on and on. An added bonus is Ram and Tina. They were so wonderful is their own book, Tempted that I was glad to have them back as secondary characters."},{"Title":"Who I was Supposed To Be: Short Stories","review":"These stories bring to life characters you will think--and dream--about, long after you have finished the book.

I just loved this book!!"},{"Title":"Who I was Supposed To Be: Short Stories","review":"This book came with high recommendations and expectations but for me the book failed to live up to them. The characters are inventive and memorable but their treatment falls short and the stories repeatedly end on a dissatisfying note. I agree with the Amazon review that her characters' promise and development seems to stall out of some kind of self conscious regard for academic critique and conflict, etc. (I'm not an academic, but you can feel their eyes on the text.) I wish she'd just let it rip. I also think the writing suffers from a lack of a clear voice; the voice often seem contrived and forced and in some instances just competely derails the story. The good part is the characters themselves, who are memorable despite their author's too-often shallow treatment."},{"Title":"Who I was Supposed To Be: Short Stories","review":"This is an amazing book, almost unnerving in its ability to capture the way people really think and act in their weirdest, darkest, and most uncensored moments - but also in their best moments. Tolstoy said that each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way, and Perabo's actually like a modern Tolstoy in her sketches of the details of family life (and friendship too), the way it shocks you and the way it doesn't surprise you at all."},{"Title":"Who I was Supposed To Be: Short Stories","review":"I read Susan Perabo's collection after being her student over Christmas. Wow.These stories amaze me. Well written, she does so well what she has taught her own students. The gears in my head turned, and I finally understood all those things she wrote on my stories or tried to explain in class.I love her characters. The data processing woman with the Diana dress. The pot smoking music teacher father. The woman whose baby just died. The actor whose marriage is ending so he invites a klepto father to stay with him. On and on they go, so confused, so much in pain, but she makes their lives and situations funny. It's a bittersweet pain, but Perabo has one of the most original ways of communicating pain I've seen since the writers she told us to read.I still can't get out of my mind the one called &quot;Explaining Death to the dog&quot;. The pain the woman feels when showing the dog the book of Time photos or showing her the dead animal, wow. I read it three times in a row the first night I read it. I am still in awe of it.As she told my class so many times, &quot;Show, don't tell.&quot;Perabo shows. I can't believe I was lucky enough to have classes with her. I just wish I read these sooner."},{"Title":"Who I was Supposed To Be: Short Stories","review":"Should be 'nuf said -- but I want to add that the author's voice is completely true!

I finished this book in half a day, and wanted more when I ran out of stories. I would love to see more stories about the characters here!"},{"Title":"Who I was Supposed To Be: Short Stories","review":"We spent a week in the woods with our children and grandchildren and I discovered in the nearby library this enchanting book of short stories. The first one that I read was &quot;Retirement,&quot; because we are both retired grandparents. What a twist to discover that it was a comedy yet a reality check for Batman's butler. I laughed my way to the end, which I still have yet to discover. But that is what retirement is all about anyway.This little book became a vacation to me within my family vacation. When the reality of family problems overwhelmed me, I sought refuge in Susan's family tales. Then nothing really could make me feel upset. Susan takes the everyday ordinary people of today and gives them a new dimension under bizarre experiences such as: an addictive mother who gambles her lifesavings on the lottery; lost loves and lovers; a young couple with unfulfilled material dreams; a burglaring father and Holywood son reunion; a pyromaniac daughter with her adulterous mother and meek stepfather; a brutal attack on a father in front of his son: the accidental death of a fellow student by two young friends; the emergence of clandestine sex between neighboring adolescents. You can enjoy the situation and revel in the unique mannerisms of her characters. She weaves her light stories in a charming and timely style that kept me curious to sample each new tale."},{"Title":"Who I was Supposed To Be: Short Stories","review":"I found this collection by accident and didn't know what to expect.

Enjoy this collection."},{"Title":"Who I was Supposed To Be: Short Stories","review":"Reading Susan Perabo's short stories I was moved, uplifted to laughter, and stung by the recognition of deep emotional experiences. I was amazed to have old pleasures and guilts resurface through the thoughts and experiences of people whose lives are so utterly unlike mine. Each short story invites a long conversation to express the pleasure and pain and plentiful humor. For example, Perabo's characters in &quot;Thick as Thieves&quot; convey so much in one SHORT story about people, their regrets, and possibilities while still being so exceedingly funny. I will buy ten more copies of the book and send them to the people most likely to sit down and discuss them with me, ASAP."},{"Title":"Who I was Supposed To Be: Short Stories","review":"I came upon this purely by accident, but wasn't disappointed.

I'm normally put off by stories: too long, too short, too pretentious, too what-have-you. However, I succumbed to these bite-sized nuggets of angst, humor and shocking surprise. Perabo can say a lot in just a few well-chosen words: peculiarities and passions come to sharp, quirky life in one tale after another. It's like a bag of chips on paper: you'll have another, and another, and (yum!) another....and be left wanting more at the end. Don't miss this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Clubhouse Lawyer: Law in the World of Sports","review":"Positives: The author's writing style flows smoothly and is easy to read. He explains legal terminology in an easy to understand manner. The book brought back memories of controversial cases and added interesting ones I had never heard of.Negative: Too often I felt that the author left me hanging, wondering what point he was trying to make. Here's an example: In one section of his chapter titled 'Equal Opportunity in Sports', the author discusses racial discrimation against black people by whites. He mentions that in 1990 Michael Jordan applied for membership in an Illinois country club and was rejected. The problem is that the author does not say that the country club was \\"all-white\\", but that the members were predominently of one particular religion, which he names.Was the author implying that practitioners of this religion, as opposed to practitioners of other religions, discriminate against blacks? Or that Jordan was rejected for religious reasons, rather than white vs. black? If not, what was the purpose of mentioning the religion at all? The reader is left wondering because nothing further is written about this incident.I would recommend that you read the book because of the positives, but keep the negative in mind."},{"Title":"Racing around Kentucky","review":"Lynn S. Renau, Racing Around Kentucky (self-published, 1995)Now, as anyone who's been reading my reviews for the past ten or so years knows, I'll read anything that relates even tangentially to any aspect of the Thoroughbred Racing industry as it is practiced in any country in the world. And my lack of giving out bad reviews to books on racing is due in no way to my affinity for the subject, but rather because I just hadn't stumbled across any bad ones. (And the tooth fairy is real. I look back over some old reviews and wonder what on earth I was thinking giving... ah, my memory is playing tricks on me; The American Handicapper did only receive a single star. So I do give bad reviews to horse racing books!) That, unfortunately, has changed mightily in the past year, as I've discovered the wonders of Interlibrary Loan, and I've found some stunningly bad books on all aspects of the racing world. The newest on the list is Lynn S. Renau's Racing Around Kentucky, which, while purporting to be many, many things, is mainly a history of racing as it relates to Kentucky. (This should not surprise the astute title reader.)To be fair, Racing Around Kentucky is not nearly as awful as The American Handicapper or William Bauman's \\"classic\\" tome Smart Handicapping Made Easy. This is not a book designed to put you in the poorhouse within a month after you buy it. However, it does have a number of major shortcomings. I would guess that the majority of readers of this book will find the biggest complaint to be that the book tries to do too much in limited space; a quick run-down of everything Renau lists on the back of the book should tell you that a single book, especially one weighing in at only 214 pages, will not be able to cover all of Renau's topics with anything approaching comprehensiveness; in fact, many of the sections barely reach the level of a survey of the material. If you put aside the rest and concentrate on the history, though, my main complaint comes through-- the book's style, which ranges from the dry to the unreadable (one particular chapter in the book, that on Sallie Ward, is so badly organized that one will find oneself asking the question of whether Ms. Ward died before she was born, or how many Ms. Wards actually coexisted contemporaneously. This leads to mental images perhaps best left unearthed). As if the style weren't bad enough, the book is honeycombed with typos; if you found a particularly obsessive proofreading termite and sent him in to eat away all the typos in this book, you'd find yourself with a rather ratty volume when he was finished.Especially at the prices for which this book goes today, it is only recommended for the most compulsive completist collectors of books on the Thoroughbred industry. The rest of you should be avoiding it as much as possible. *"},{"Title":"Night, Sea And Stars","review":"I have read alot of Ms. Graham's work, and this is an older one, written orginally in 1983 and the time shows in the way the hero and heroine interact. The hero was very dominating and nearly abusive towards the heroine and alot older than her also. (he was 40 she is 26)Reflecting the times of romances in the 80's. By today's standards this book would'nt be well recieved. So in reading it, you have to remember when it was written.The beginning was great and I was quickly pulled into the story when they crashed on the deserted island and then had to fend for themselves but eventually fell for one another. I started to get pulled back out when they were rescued and the subplots of stolen gold and a bitter divorce along with an unwanted pregnancy began to cloud the mood she had woven earlier on.The hero Kyle Jagger was a little too dominate for my taste and too cold. He was continuously in a bad mood and flew off the handle for no reason. He treated the heroine Skye Delaney like a pampered and beautiful pet that was too ignorant or fragile to make her own mistakes or decisions. She was only a corporate excecutive after all and owned her own company, lol. She was strong in the beginning, but lost my respect when she submitted to Kyle's dominance and somewhat cruel treatment. She began acting like an 18 year old school girl who needed a much older man's wise advice and wisdom to make her decisions for her. In the end I was wishing she would run off with Kyle's brother or son, lol. But all in all, it was highly entertaining and a great book to sit out on the beach or on your porch with for the afternoon.~Fate stepped in when fashion executive Skye Delaney survived a crash on a deserted island with a surly pilot alone. Both overly domineering and suductive, Skye lost her inhibitions to him and forgot about the 'real world' waiting for them to be found. How coulkd she return to a fiance and a life of hard work when she found paradise in this man's arms? The only problem? Skye soon realizes who he REALLY is and it makes her heart break. He is Kyle Jagger, the owner and tycoon of the company she flew with and crashed. He is also married with a 20 year old son and he is reputed to be a major playboy. Can the sultry eden change his ways? Should Skye distance herself from him before its too late?Kyle Jagger is a hard and bitter man with a nasty estranged wife at home and a son he adores. Getting stranded on an island that reminded him of paradise with a gorgeous woman he can't seem to stop thinking about made things worse.

Skye is a single (with a serious boyfriend back home), independent, business woman that \\"becomes pudding in Kyle's hands.\\" Kyle is a little more complicated. Co-owner of the airlines, Kyle is a domineering, playboy, tyconne that is married with an estranged wife and has a son he adores.

The book is ok but HG has other wonderful books out there to be enjoyed that I don't rate this one up there very high, though I did finish it and enjoyed the ending.

It is hard to beat them."},{"Title":"Night, Sea And Stars","review":"This is the first &quot;Heather Graham&quot; book I read. It was interesting enough for me to finish on a rainy afternoon. It definitely grabs your attention in the beginning but after the rescue, my attention span lulled off and part of me wished that Skye would've left Kyle. This leading man was not very appealing to me. I would definitely recommend the series books that she writes over this book. It was a good read, but not as well written as the &quot;And one rode...&quot; series"},{"Title":"Night, Sea And Stars","review":"The first half of this novel was good. After their plane crashes on a deserted Pacific island, the strong, silent hero and the feisty, independent heroine clash initially and then succumb to the romantic setting and fall in love. Unfortunately, she doesn't tell him she's in love, and he tells her but she's not buying it. The second half of the novel is filled with subplots (stolen gold, pregnancy, a bitter divorce, etc) that are more distracting and annoying than interesting. And everything falls into place a little too neatly at the end. This was my first Heather Graham novel; I'm not sure if I'll try another."},{"Title":"Night, Sea And Stars","review":"I wish that men in real life could compare to Heather Graham's men.

She quickly heads for New Orleans only to discover her grandmother is fine, but wanted her home to tour a newly refurbished plantation that has just opened to the public. There, Alex sees a unique portrait of someone who looks exactly like her. Upon reaching out to touch the likeness, her fingers begin to tingle and she is transported back in time.Plantation owner Trey Dalton is trying to discover who is out to destroy his plantation, his most prized horse, and his life. On top of all that, he has unexpected visitors; his aunt and a strangely dressed woman who has just appeared out of nowhere. He has many problems to solve while protecting his new visitor until he can learn her secrets.A Portrait in Time isn't just another time travel. This is a strong love story that brings two souls together who have belonged to each other throughout time.The two main characters play against each other successfully and the deepening feelings they demonstrate throughout the book are very believable. Each successive scene draws them deeper and deeper into each other's love. The hero and heroine meld together as two halves form a complete whole.Anyone who likes a good story, a bit of an adventure, a gentle clash of characters, and a happy ending will enjoy reading A Portrait in Time. It will make you laugh, sniffle, and rejoice in the strength of love over time."},{"Title":"A Portrait in Time","review":"This book was an okay read. It's one that I'd have rather checked out from the library than purchased. The book has a lot of typos in it (ie. misspelled words, words left out of a sentence, ect.)I was a bit disappointed at first. Reading the description the book sounded like it was going to be very promising. I couldn't wait to receive the book and get started reading!The book is a very easy read. I kept hoping for it to pick up so I actually read the entire book in a day. It had some great moments, but the book didn't draw you into the story. I didn't feel the characters pain or happiness. I felt like I was reading a story. At first the descriptions start out well. You can visualize what they're wearing and how things looked. But by the 4th chapter, the descriptions of people, places and everything stops. I also felt like I was left hanging. There was a hint in the book that the aunt \\"knew\\" the truth, but then it never said anything more about it. It also mentions how she needs to get 2 people (I won't go into much detail so not to give the story away) to fall in love, but it never tells you if they did or not.I'd suggest checking this book out from the library or going to a B & N store and grabbing a cappuccino and reading it there at the store instead of purchasing this book. It is an ok read, I just wouldn't suggest buying it."},{"Title":"A Portrait in Time","review":"Alexandra \\"Alex\\" Tibideaux receives a message that her grandmother: \\"I need you.\\" Unable to get a hold of Grams, Alex rushes from California to New Orleans. Grams is fine; she only wants to attend the re-opening of the Dalton Plantation with her granddaughter. Alex agrees-since Grams is her only living relative and is 93 years old. Later that evening, Grams shows Alex a picture of Trey Dalton and how he fell in love with a woman in their family; one who had the same name as Alex... and had disappeared and was never found.While at the plantation, Alex sees a painting of herself wearing period clothing. Curiosity causes her to touch the portrait... which transports her back to 1878. She awakens in the same house... but Trey Dalton, his aunt, and their servants are very much alive.Trey Dalton doesn't have time for a woman who mysteriously shows up at his plantation; talking nonsense about how she's from the future. And he doesn't need his Aunt Rose to interfere by going around telling everyone that Trey and Alex are getting married. Both Trey and Alex have to go along with the idea to keep people from gossiping.But there's someone who wants to ruin Trey and will stop at nothing to do so. Trey believes he knows who is responsible... or does he? Only after a series of potentially disastrous events does he learn the truth.Stephanie's Review:Other reviews talk about how Bradley weaved \\"an engrossing tale of time travel, romance, and suspense.\\"The time travel was typical: Woman from the present goes back in time where she has to adjust to her new life while wondering if she'll ever return to the present.The romance was unbelievable - and not in a good way: Trey and Alex spent more time bickering and arguing than anything else. I'm still wondering how the two fell in love. It just \\"happened.\\"The suspense was predictable: It's easy to tell who did what when.Bradley also has a habit of not going deep enough into the story. There are lots of instances where things are just glossed over. Two examples: (1) Alex arrived in 1878, and basically just accepted everything that happened to her - except when she wanted to return to Trey. (2) Alex kept a journal of her time spent in 1878. When she returns to 1997, Grams gives her the journal. She starts reading... only to find a new entry on the last page from Trey. This could've been a very emotional moment, but Trey's entry was cut short.There's also a lot of typos in this book. I understand that no book is edited perfectly, but the typos here are beyond the norm. After awhile, they started sticking out like a sore thumb. Usually, with traditional publishers, the fingers can be pointed to the copyeditors. But it's questionable with e-publishers. I know of some e-publishers who do more editing beyond what an author does. And then there's some e-publishers who expect their authors to do all of the editing. I'm not sure where Hard Shell lies as this is my first Hard Shell read."},{"Title":"A Portrait in Time","review":"I was disappointed in this book, first by all the typo's in the book, then by the story itself. I loved the character of Alex. I would have liked to have read more about her history and seen her question her transport to the past more.

What I remember the most about the book was the coverage of the events during the Civil War and a little bit of everything else. Also, I do remember that the book was confusing to follow at times. Having read the book again now, much of what I thought still holds up true. What is worse is that I now feel Across Five Aprils is a mess of a novel. Irene Hunt jumps around too much, providing a paucity of character development. Some of the characters are introduced, and then the author forgets about them. As the book claims to be about Jethro Creighton, Across Five Aprils slowly makes a transition from him being the central focus to the events of Civil War. And then the author ultimately lets the war to take over, leaving out the Creighton family and friends. At the same time, I am thinking, \\"Is Across Five Aprils supposed to be about the boy who lived through the Civil War or what?\\" Irene Hunt also fails to expand the details at a considerable length, causing gaps in description of the action, feeling, and incident. Whenever Irene Hunt brings up the battles of the Civil War, she gives a very, very superficial account of them, only letting a hand out on a life preserver by describing the kind of character the famous men were and what kind of a battle was it in terms of blood. While she lays out the events of the Civil War, I felt wholly unabsorbed due to the lack of Fear and Loathing '72: On Campaign Trial technique of mixing self and the events of the campaign that were happening at the same time. When I read that Hunter Thompson's book, I was simultaneously absorbing two sides of the story whereas in Across Five Aprils, Irene Hunt failed to provide the same treatment for me. All in all, Across Five Aprils is such a poorly developed novel."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"i had to read across five aprils for the start of 8th grade and it was so boring that i couldnt take it anymore.

I normally enjoy reading, and often read more than is asked of me or just for my enjoyment. Most books I read are books that are to do with actual events and are written by authors who speak the English language. This book is without a doubt the worst book I've ever been forced to read, and this is the second time I've been forced to read it.

A good perspective of the other side of the war - the farms and villages."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"Irene Hunt describes life on a southern Illinois farm in much detail. Combine this with a dialect and you have a book not all readers will appreciate. However, some readers will find themselves caring deeply for young Jethro and all he struggles with - the loss of a brother, the responsibility of farm work, the hostility within the community, etc. They will also learn much about the Civil War as it unfolds throughout the story.

I wondered why some said it was great while others said it was boring. I went ahead and bought it and loved every page!

I wish it would have never ended."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"Across Five Aprils is a very good, easy to read book. If you want a feel for what some familes went through during the Civil War, then you should read this book. If you only want dates and battle descriptions, this is not the book for you. Across Five Aprils gives you a perspective of the Civil War through the eyes of a nine year old boy. One who had to grow up quick and watch his family torn apart. These things really did happen and I couldn't stop thinking about my nephew, and how I'm glad he isn't having to face the same type of problems that Jethro had to face. This book should really be on school reading lists."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"Young adult readers may find that the book is boring, but this is usually because they do not read well or do not like to read. Jethro is a character that meets all of the requirements of a hero. The events reflect the treatment given families who suffered from division and prejudice. The local ruffians remind one of the Klan and their activities after the war in the South. Those who call the book boring have no understanding of the history of their country. If you are lead through the first two chapters, you then become engrossed in the story of Jethro and should learn a great deal about the worse war in our history and how we treated our own citizens."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"This is one of my favourite books. Not only it's the best history based book, it also reflects the affection of Jethro towards his family, his brothers and, ofcourse the civil war. The incidents of the book were arranged sequentially in a very good way. It also described the civil war in a very nice way.Before I read this book, I didn't have much clear concept about the civil war. But later on when I read this book, the concept about the civil war became absolutely clear to me. This book helped to increase my general knowlodge. Not only that, it enhanced my thinking ability and it gave me a chance to see some important aspects in a different view.I love this book. And I would like to suggest the readers to read this book with their heart, and not to make irksome comments about it without understanding the story.To conclude, I would like to thank the writer of this book, Mrs. Irene Hunt for providing us such a nice book."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"When you first look at this book you think that it will be super boring, but it is super interesting. This book tells about how a family enters the world war in bad shape and exits gracefully. It has certains things that really made me want to cry, laugh or get mad. It shows alot of emotions. It really proved to me that you can actually do anything that you want to do as long as you try hard enough and believe in yourself and never to quite. I will tell you the truth when you first start to read this book it starts off really really bad but don't let that stop you from reading it because after you get to about the third chapter you start to realize alot of things that you would never believe would be true during 1890's.

Unfortunately when it was assigned the book was packed in boxes from our move so I bought the eBook version for the assignment! This fall I read this book aloud to my 7th grader as it was a parent-child discussion assignment.Set in southern Illinois, the story unfolds over five years, starting just before the Civil War and ending soon after the war ends. Jethro is the main character, a nine year old farmboy who is the baby in the family. Soon all his older brothers go off to war leaving his sister, he, and his parents to tend to the family farm which is a lot of work. Jethro's father falls ill and all the farmwork then falls to Jethro. Forced to grow up before his time given both the family's individual situation and the unrest in the country, this winds up being a coming of age tale. At the start of the story Jethro was a little boy and by the end he is a fourteen year old young man.Issues with the Civil War are debated and discussed in the story by the characters. An early situation is one of Jethro's brothers sympathizes with the Southerners and leaves the family to fight with the Rebels. This causes discontent, anger and hatred in the community, since they live in The North. Later the Creighton family is the target of hate crimes punishing them for the crime of the traitor son.Throughout the book we are informed of the happenings in the Civil War as the family hears news of various battles. Sometimes we read letters written by family members at the battlefront and other times we hear the opinions expressed in the newspapers. The opinions of the public about the Generals and President Lincoln are also shared as part of the story. I felt this showed that the issues were complicated and that even a family raised with the same values could not agree on which opinion was the right one. Later we wrestle with the issue of what should happen to soldiers who ran away from the battlefield and also what should happen to the traitors when the war was over.A subplot is the romantic love that develops between the fourteen year old girl and the schoolteacher who winds up fighting in the war. Her father had banned their marriage before he left to fight saying she was too young to marry. The girl matured in the war years and in the end we hope to see them united in marriage and hope he makes it through the war alive. (I'll not spoil the story...)I confess I am not a war story lover so in the parts that detailed the details of the battles my interest waned. However I was rivoted to the book and wanted to find out what happened to the Creighton family in the end. I would guess that any reader who likes battle details will be most interested in the book but honestly the story is solid and moves along quickly so even if you just want to know what happens to the individual people in the family and in the community you will enjoy the book.Character traits and virtues are clearly present in this historical fiction story. There is a lot to talk about regarding ethics and values as well as the topic of the Civil War. The book gave me a sense for what life was like for those who were both fighing in the war and those who were left at home struggling to make ends meet with most of the men in the family gone off to war.This is a solid, high quality historical fiction book that I think every middle school aged student should read, hopefully in conjunction with a study of The Civil War. I bet they'd learn a lot more by reading this than by reading a boring old textbook."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"This was one of the most boring books I have ever read. The plot just wasn't good. There was some good historical information on battles of the Civil War, but I could have gotten that from a history book. I was looking for something more with this book, and I didn't get it."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I read this book when I was in 6th grade. I loved it so much I recommended it to my mother (who is very well-read and instilled in each of her 5 children a love of reading) and she loved it as well. So obviously, the story resonates with young and mature alike.I am in my 30's now and still love this book.BTW, so many books about the Civil War are from the southern perspective, I assume because most of the battles took place there. This book takes a refreshingly different view."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I purchased the Audio copy of Across Five Aprils to use in the classroom and I love it. It is well read and holds the students' attention. It has been a valuable asset to my classroom library."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"This was at least my second reading of this wonderful book - this time out loud to my son who was studying the Civil War in 4th grade. It truly brought home to him (and reminded me) of just how destructive the war was, and how deep the pain was that touched every inhabitant of this country."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"For an 8th grader this is way too boring for these children to read"},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"This book is hard to understand, mostly because of the dialect. Irene Hunt is a good author, but I think she could have done MUCH better."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"It was a boring but informable book. Only someone that likes Civil War History could like it. I read it for school and it just about bored me to death. The slang talk and the writing was the worst. It made the book seem like it was writen by a five year old. it is not the best book for middle schoolers like me but maybe for an adult or someone that likes American History."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"If there's one word that describes this book it's BORING!

Half the time you didn't know what was going on and it was really confusing. There was alot of extra detail that made it even MORE confusing. And nothing really happens- like Jethro is the main character but he just basically sits around the entire time. Nothing exciting ever happens. The characters barely even have personality."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"Across Five Aprils is the story of a young boy, Jethro Creighton, and his family who live in Southern Illinois during the Five Aprils of the Civil War. Jethro is faced with the responsibility of running the family's farm after his older brothers leave to fight in the war and his father suffers a heart attack. With the help of friends and neighbors, Jethro manages the farm fairly well but almost faces death after mobleaders almost kill him and ruin the Creighton farm over Bill Creighton's, one of Jethro's brothers, joining of the Confederate Army. The war does affect the Creighton family more significantly, however, as Tom, one of Jethro's brothers, is killed in a fierce battle.The book gives a good illustration of what occured during the Civil War era. Almost every family was affected and often brothers fought each other in different armies. The book is relatively short and easy to read. It contains alot of Southern Illinois Accent in its dialogue but it is easily understandable. The book is suitable for any child who can read well and it is fun, interesting, and enjoyable. It provides a new perspective on one of the most terrible wars in the history of the United States. Across Five Aprils is one of the best books of its kind."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I read Across Five Aprils only because it was on my summer reading list (entering seventh grade). The subject matter is not something I am usually drawn towards, but as American history dominates my seventh grade year, many books about war ended up on the list. Across Five Aprils is about the Creighton family, a typical family living on a farm in southern Illinois during the turbulent years of the American Civil War. The story opens on the days immeaditly before the outbreak of war. Jethro Creighton, then only nine years old, is very confused. He doesn't know what to expect of war, and he is very unprepared for what happens to his family in the next five years. Torn apart by war, Jethro must deal with all the problems a man faces during a time of war, as well as his own, internal problems.This book has a good mix of historical events and ficitional scenes. Many of the battles that took place are described in letters to Jethro and his family, coming from his brothers at war. It is written in rural dialect, as this family would have spoken back in the 1860's, which is at times quite hard to understand. Though I did enjoy the book, I would reccomend it solely to those people who have a great interest in this time period."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"My reason for rating the book Across Five Aprils by Irene Hunt low was because this book had several words that were had to read example:from pages(51-52)&quot;you're too young to be married, Jenny; you're jest a little girl.' Oh. Jeth, it's horrible to be so young. Why does there have to be a war to take Shad away from me before I'm of an age that Pa thinks thinks is old enough fer marryin'?&quot; Several accounts of the book were true which was good. I did not like how Jethro who was at the age of nine in the beginning was shown as so mature and to me was percepted as a boy of a man's age. At the early parts of the book I recieved an opinion of Lincoln from the book and reasons were not explained for this opinion being formed. I would also recomend not reading this book in a school enviorment,the children do not like this plot in my past experiences. I have seen it used with seventh graders and feel they werent interested in the book's story. thank you -Mimi"},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"So mabey it was a little dull.I had to read it for my book report.But it was a good book.Read it for yourself.You will either love it or hate it."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I very seldom rate books, not because they're not good or they are good, just because I read so many. But this one deserved something... what, I'm not sure.I live in the south, and I'm proud of it. I love the way we talk and think, and sound. However, Irene Hunt -- an author who usually I like -- really took the phonetic spelling TOO far. Even I had problems understanding it at times, and that's the way people around here talk!Aside from that, I did find the book dull, and hard to get into.In short, Hunt has written some very good books (The Lottery Rose was brilliant) but this isn't one of them."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"Six brothers who live on a small farm in Southern Illinois durng the Civil War, have a family conflict. Four of the five brothers went to fight for the North and one brother fights for the South. Jethro, the youngest brother, has to stay home with his mother and sister to run the family farm. Everyone at home worries about the brothers at war. Getting letters helps the family know about the war battles. I gave Across Five Aprils a three star rating because it was slow moving in the beginning. If Hunt had added information about war scenes, the story would have been more interesting."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"My 8.8 year old son and I listened to the audio version of Across Five Aprils to fill \\"drive time\\" with something worthwhile. We both rated the book the same (3 out of 5 stars). At the first listen, I thought how soporific! and hoped my son would not complain. To my surprise Ms. Hunt garnered his attention for at least the 40 minute driving time on most days. The story gave an interesting perspective on the Civil War and was a catalyst for discussion on the war, slavery and the social issue of what to do with \\"them\\" after they're \\"free\\". My son enjoyed the southern dialect, but gives the rating primarily because the book was sad. If you enjoy Civil War history the audio version may be more palatable than the book."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"The Best book I have ever read. Across Five Aprils takes place on a Southern Illnois farm during the civil War. Jethro Creighton, a ten-year old farm boy is split between his favorite brother Bill, and his three other brothers John, Tom, and Eb. John, Tom, and Eb fight for the Union while Bill fights for the Confederates. Neighbors find out that Bill is fighting for the Confederates so they burn the Creighton's barn. Then Tom dies, Matt Creighton (Jethro's dad) has a heart attack, and Eb deserts. Now Jethro is faced with a man's work on the farm. I give Across Five Aprils 5 stars because it is a great drama story, it is well written, and it has the best wording I've ever seen. Read this book if you like the Civil War and and drama."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"This historical novel starts slowly; it also takes some getting used to the dialogue, which is written in rural dialect--liberally dispersed throughout the 12 chapters, but it is well worth the visual effort. We are introduced to a poor farm family in southern Illinois--a border state which is divided between Dixie and the Union, over issues such as Slavery and Secession. As war clouds rumble and decades of social and political friction ignite the War between the States, towns and even famlies are rent asunder by conflicting loyalties. If a man is going to risk his life for a cause, he ought to believe in it, but should his family suffer for that individual decision?Jethro is only 9 when the book opens, but his childhood is quickly terminated by disastrous national events which impact heavily on both his community and his large family. Tempers run high in the pro-Union town; some vicious hotheads resent the fact that one of Jethro's brothers joined up with the Re! bs. The boy and his entire family are persecuted for that action, even though other brothers join the Union army. One wrote home describing a battle: &quot;the suferin and scenes of death was sech to make a mans hart hate war.&quot; Which seems to be a major theme in this novel.Jethro comes of age too quickly during the five Aprils (or years) that span the Civil War. As the only able-bodied male left on the farm, he gradually assumes an increasingly adult role; still he deeply misses not only his brothers, but his sister's beau Shadrah, the gentle schoolmaster, who encourges him in geting an edcuation. With so many brothers invovled in the war, it is inevitable that some will not return. The story of the Creighton family is intense and holds one's attention, but excessive historical detail makes for uneven pacing, as though the author really wanted to write a treatise on the cause, horrors and course of the war--disguised as a novel.This book provides in-depth tre! atment of our great national shame, as well as a gripping p! ersonal story about ficitious characters who are very real. Hunt discusses such serious issues as slavery, Lincoln's two elections, Sherman's March to the Sea, Emancipation, Lincoln's assassination and the seesaw careers of various Generals. These details contribute to our complete unerstanding of the drama of the times, but water down the intensity of the storyline. Still I would recommend this book to any student of the Civil War, for the plot holds the reader's interest as we grow to care about this one, socially- insignificant family. A good introduciton to the Civil War era in a literary package."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I'm going to be honest here, because there's a statute of limitations on grade school book reports. I wrote a book report on this one without ever actually READING it. Not sure if my teacher ever picked up on that. I think someone told me about it. Out of guilt, it has been on my bookshelf since, and I've promised myself I'd read it. It's short, why did it take so long? Well, there's TV afterall, quite distracting. But eventually I've gotten around to reading it, and I was OK with it. I'm sure in grade school I wouldn't have been. BORING would have been my chant. I've matured since then.It's not a face paced read. I don't think it was meant to be. What it does is reveal a world torn apart by events larger than the people who lived them. Events forced choices with real consequences. No one really knew for certain WHO was right. People had very little trust in the leaders of the day. And people you loved dearly often didn't make it home. And unfortunately for these people, who had no access to the latest from the front lines, who had no heliocopters following the troups, who had to wait for someone heading to town to bring a month old newspaper back to them, they really had to hang a lot on faith. Facts during the Civil War were awful hard to come by.I'm not sure I'd say this was spelled out in the book in dramatic fashion. Irene Hunt was going for realism, not shock value. She let the events stand on their own and if you're a good reader, you rise to understand just how compelling the subject matter is.Frankly, I'm glad I waited."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I read this book aloud to my five children aged 7-16. We all loved this book and couldn't bear to stop at any chapter. This book provided excellent insight to both the North and South during the Civil War. I cannot imagine how anyone could rate this story low. We laughed, cried, and cheered throughout the whole thing. I HIGHLY recommend this book."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I read this book and was riveted. I found it really interesting how this one family came to be divided during the cival war. Because they were on the boarder between the north and south their family ended up choosing sides. Two sons went to the north and one went to the south. They were still a family though. I thought the author did an excellent job including old letters and news articles that the family had had."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"It shows how the civil war effected a family that lives on a farm. Three of the sons go to fight in the army and out of them one dies and one becomes a deserter. They also have a another son that went to fight on the rebels side, so there were a group of people that hated the family for that. There daughter was in love with a man that went to war and he became wounded, but she eventually marrys him. Then there youngest son, Jethro, who was most loved, had to work on the farm after his father had a heart-attack. So I would say this is a touching story of a family and everything that happens to them on the way."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"Across Five Aprils is more than a story about a boy during the Civil War. It is the telling of how one family struggled and survived many difficulties suffered during a period of great turmoil in our nation's history. It is the story of how Jethro Creighton is forced to grow up quickly to become the sole source of food and shelter for his family, his brother's family and himself. It is an accurate historical account of the war as seen through the eyes of a child. I have read other reviews that describe the book as boring, unlikable and primitive. Anyone who has a negative comment about Across Five Aprils doesn't get it. They never will. This is a wonderful book that all children from ages 10 through 16 should be required to read."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I love how Irene Hunt took the knowledge provided by her grandfather and put it together in this phonominal book.

They bought it.I was forced to read this in my stinking Advanced English class. None of the other eighth graders had to read it -- just like they didn't have to read Little Women (which I liked, apart from that last abysmal Mr. Bhaer romance...but I digress) or Call of the Wild (which had me seriously wondering whether London actually enjoyed the kind of gruesome scenes that have me covering my eyes and make my evil friend constantly read those scenes aloud to me). Anyway, that's not the point. The point is, maybe I just disliked it because of the -- ahem -- forced reading (which I think is a bad way to introduce someone to a great book, as it effectively clouds their opinion on that book FOREVER.) Maybe that's the case. But any book that, when I am assigned to write a \\"last chapter\\" in class, makes me title the said chapter \\"Conclusion: A Sarcastic and Satirical Mockery of Across Five Aprils (In Which Every Character I Loathed Is Ruthlessly Killed)\\" -- typically I tend to avoid such books.Maybe it's a masterpiece. Maybe I'm just really dumb, not to like such classic, wonderful, fantabulistic (not sure if that's a word) book. If I am, so is my entire Advanced English class, because not one person (excluding the teacher) did anything less than declare undying hatred for Jethro's plight.But, hey, it's a book. I honestly like some (most, actually) historical fiction, but generally I prefer middle ages, or renaissance at least. Except most kids' historical fiction of that era is altered a bit and called fantasy.Rating: A toss-up between Average and Terrible"},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"Across Five Aprils is a horrible read. It is based around a colicky 10-year-old boy named Jethro who lives on a potato farm on southern Illinois during the Civil War. Throughout the book, he whines about how horrible war is and how he wishes his brothers would come home from it. The combination of his constant complaints, his occupation of potato planting, and the fact that the \\"big adventure\\" is a four hour trip to the town of Newton, make this book about as exciting as watching grass grow.Do not get me wrong, the book has some redeeming qualities. It provides historical information in the form of letters from the brothers at war, and from Jetho's one-room schoolhouse education. The other positive things about the book have, for the moment, escaped me. Nonetheless, they were surpassed by the book's slow movement and the author's poor writing, lack of originality, and conformity with the \\"war is bad\\" theme in all its political correctness. Thus, my recommendation is to no one."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"Sometimes when I read a review by someone who's just raging about the book, I think, \\"Well, why didn't they just quit?\\"I'll dispel that notion.

This is one of the books my teacher made us read and was actually my third choice but read it anyway. The book takes you back to Civil War era in a Southern IL farm through the eyes of a nine year old boy, Jethro. He has brothers fighting for the Union Army but one chose to fight for the Confederate so his family was harassed by neighbors and people from other towns. The book is very accurate on historical facts and invites the reader to think and contemplate the views and beliefs of the North and South through the eyes of an innocent child. A reader who do not care to stop and reflect on the feelings and emotions of different characters will obviously find the book boring. But this is the opposite when you know how to appreciate a writer's creativity of bringing the story into your mind. The book also used spellings to closely portray how people in the setting speaks which actually caught my interest as I was still learning American English. Very interesting and entertaining at the same time.

It seemed like it always took place in a field where the family was farming. I had to stop reading it after a few chapters because it was excessively boring (watching corn boil on the stove took hold of my attention more than this book did) and I was not in the least bit interested in reading it, let alone finding out what happens in the book (at the time it seemed like the plot was nonexistent), it was not until my teacher explained what was going on that I realized it could have been so much more interesting. Sure the family's troubles make for a great story, but the author just did not create a good story. I'm sorry Irene Hunt, and I realize that you put a lot of work and effort into this book, but it just didn't do it for me. Although I must admit that I did not give this book a fair chance, I would say that I would have been able to appreciate it much better if I had read it when I was older."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"The book Across Five Aprils, by Irene Hunt, is a story about the Civil War. It takes place in the early 1860s in a rural area of Illinois. It is about a young boy named Jethro Creigton. At first, Jethro likes the idea of the war and thinks it is cool. Shortly afterwards he changes his mind about that for a very good reason. Jethro's brothers (Bill and Tom), his cousin (Eb), and his teacher (Shadrach, who Jethro really liked and is romantic with Jethro's sister, Jenny) go off to war. Bad things happen to all of these people in the war. First of all, Bill (who is Jethro's favorite brother), fights for the South. This makes many people angry at the Criegtons, since they lived in Illinois. Tom gets killed in the war. Luckily for the sake of the Criegtons who are not at war, Jethro finds out that it was not Bill who killed him. Later on, Eb runs away from the army. Jetro finds him in the woods, and takes care of him for a little. Then he makes it so it is ok for Eb to go back to the army by writing a letter to the president. In the end of the book, Shardrach gets hurt and Jenny visits him in Washington and marrys him. The war ends, and Jenny and Shadrach go home and live with Jethro. I would never recommend this book to anyone. It was extremely hard to understand, which was partially due to the characters' country grammar. I had to re-read many pages and sentences before I could truly understand what was going on. The plot was very hard to grasp because of this. I found the book to be extremely boring."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START WITH THIS BOOK. I AM IN THE 7th GRADE AND I HAD TO READ IT FOR SUMMER READING.

I can see a clear picture of the Civil War;hungry soldiers and hardworking farmers. Across Five Aprils is a story about the Civil War through the eyes of a nine year old boy,Jethro. I remember the part when Jethro's favorite brother,Bill leaves to fight with the South. I can feel the pain. I can picture Shadrach's and Jenny's happy face when they got married. I also felt Jethro's anger when Jenny had received a letter from Shadrach, while he was fighting the war, and would not show it to anyone. Jethro had misunderstood and soon realized that it was a private letter so he had forgiven Jenny quickly. During the confusion of the war, Jethro and his family had a hard relationship with each other,but when the war ended, the family would soon be united."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"This book is a coming of age tale for southern Illinois preteen Jethro, who's hard-working farm family is forced to face the American Civil War. Jethro's schoolteacher, brothers, and cousin (who later deserts) fight for the North while his favorite brother fights for the South. The family must face the horrors of the war from the home front while also facing the prejudices of the zealots of home. The book would be incredibly difficult for young readers because of the dialect. Also, the plot is more tell than show. But, still, a powerful human tale of a border-state family during a tragic period. Grade: B"},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I read this book in 5th grade and thought it extremely boring. I recently re-read it in college and still think it is. There are many elements of family time and it does portray the way families were torn apart by choosing sides."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I found this book to be a wonderful introduction to the Civil 'War. It has spurred a desire to learn more about early American history, much of which I have forgotten over the years. I enjoyed the dialect very much, and found the characters to be very well drawn, especially 'Jeth'. I was sad to see the book end, and will definitely make it a part of my library. I couldn't part with it!"},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I thought this was an excellet book. I have only read it once but plan on buying it very soon. Across Five Aprils tells of how young Jethro Creighton and his family cope with the bad and good news duringthe Civil War. The Creightons live in southern Illinois, and their families views on 'rights' are different. GO READ THIS BOOK.......IT IS EXCELLENT......MY FAVORITE BOOK OF ALL TIME!"},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"A civil war is going on around the country, in the book Across Five Aprils, by Irene hunt. A young boy , named Jethro, is changed by it. Jethro is left by all of his brothers, during the Civil War, in a farm house, in southern Illinois. He has a very big family, of which he only knows half of, being the youngest of twelve children. Jethro is left for five years to put up with the bitterness of people who despise one of his brothers for being a Confederate. He is not alone. His mother, sister, Jenny, Father, and sister-in-law all deal with the same problems he is going through. During this time of war, Jethro matures and realizes the results of war, and learns to deal with the harshness of it all. A neighborhood of old enemies is brought together again by a war that has torn neighborhoods apart. This is a wonderful book and I would recommend it to anyone that likes Civil War stories. Though it is not a real story, it is based on the authors memories of her grandfather's stories, which are just as great as this story itself."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"Across Five Aprils is a well, written book and you should read it, but it may be too complex for young kids. Jethro Creighton shows true leadership in his early life as his brothers went to war, either fighting for the Union or the Confederates. When most people think of Abraham Lincoln, we think of him as a president EVERYONE liked from the beginning. Well, actually, he was not. Although he came out good in the end, the beginning was a rough one and during the election of 1860, he didnt even gain a majority in electoral votes, and ten southern states didnt even have his name on the voting ballot. This all has to deal with the coming of the war and the setting of this book. I rated this book a 4 because some parts of the book were a bit confusing, unless you reread it over again."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"i first tried reading this book when i was 8 or 9 because there was nothing else in the house that i hadnt read. Even then i had a fairly high reading level, and so most books like this were no problem. But this one i just couldn't read. It was moving too slowly in the beging. I tried reading it now at 14, and i found it more interesting and easier to read."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I think this book is really good. I like the characters espically Jethro because hes determined, shy, and outgoing, he likes to help people. this book has also many other interesting characters, you might like, there are also many different parts there are scary, sad, mad, glad, and cheerful. It teachs you different things about the civalwar and racism. And thats why I like this book."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"Across Five Aprils obviously brings you through five aprils.It also brings you into the realm of the mid 1800's through the eyes of a low class child from the north,Jethro Creighton.Whats great about the plot is the sake of realism with bits of unbelievable events that stir the drama up.Keep in mind this is a childrens book so it doesn't go too in-depth.The depth offered though isn't bad as it's a fairly short book.Jethro Creighton is an average boy growing up during a war.His brothers get sent off to war causing controversy.Jethros household becomes very unstable and soon he ends up doing tasks as tough as his father Matt Creighton.This book emphasizes the fact that he had too grow up during a difficult point in history and needed to mature faster then others his age.It shows the wisdom that he obtains in those 4 years and how his opinions on war change.Across Five Aprils has some of the most diverse characters truly showing it's ok too be different and stand up for what you believe in much like Bill Creighton and his joining to the reb side.Besides following Jethro's life you get filled in on some historical events and some of the brutal battles that took place as the campaign marched onward to much of Americas destruction and the death of a memorable president.The only issue i noticed with this book is the pace, at sometimes it will hit you with all these massive issues, and other times it moves so sluggishly that at the end of a chapter you are bored out of your mind.With all that in mind this is a really great and many learn to aprreciate this book them ore they read it much like how i did."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"This book is about a boy named Jethro. He was the youngest in the family and his mother favored him. He lived in a small farm in southern Illinois. The Civil War was going on and lots of Jethro's brothers were in the war. One of his brothers joined the Confederate army. He became mature during the years of the war. One of his brothers died in the war and one was held as a prisoner. He considered President Abraham Lincoln as a friend while many of the farmers hated him. He really hoped the chaos would end and live in peace.My favorite part of the book is when Shad and Jenny married. Jenny was Jethro's sister and Shad was Jethro's schoolmaster. Jenny loved Shad for a long time, but her parents refuse them to get marry. When Shad was hurt badly in the war, Jenny's parents decided to let them marry. Jenny was very happy to be the wife of Shad.I like this book because it gives us information about the Civil War in the United States. It also showed you how the people that time think of Abraham Lincoln and how a family lived during such hard times. When you read this book, it feels like you went back through time and experienced the war yourself. I recommend this book to anyone that is interested in the Civil War."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"This book is a very good book. It is about a boy who enlists in a war. I will tell you about the setting, and give you some character traits, on the main characters. The setting is a very important part of the story. It is in the 1800's and Jethro, Ellen, and Matt live on a farm. The war is going on, so Jethro enlists in the war. His father never went to war because, he wasn't born in that part of the time. But Jethro was, so he enlists in the war. The character traits of some of the main characters, are a very important part of the story. Some character traits of Jethro are that he is very hard working and he is a potato farmer. He is also one of the main characters. Matt is Jethro's father, and he is strong and very hard working too. Ellen is Jethro's mother. She is the lady of the house, so she does the washing, and house stuff. She is very hard working too. All of their family is very hard working. Those are some character traits. Well that is the setting, and some Character traits. So this is a good book. I would rate it a five, because it was a good book but it wasn't the best book I have read."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I didn't like this book at all. It was a long story about a family with problems. You expect action in this book but instead there is a buch of long character building stuff in it and unreasonable twists of fate to make the book somewhat interesting. I f you want civil war action don't read this."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I think this book majorly lacked in plot and moved very slowly. I had to read this for English class. The only good thing about it was that it used historical happenings which made it seem realistic rather than fiction."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I thought this book was hard to Understand it was written for older people not 8th graders i enjoy social and reading but i did not enjoy this book. I have heard Irene hunt writes better books than this one"},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"Out of the many books I have read, this book is the most touching, and best action. Although we had a outline of all the characters, but it was an awsome book about the civil war. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I read this book for eighth grade during the summer. My parents had to force me to read it because I couldn't even comprehend some of the material I wouldn't even recommend this to a person I don't like."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"man...books don't get more boring than this...i recommend it only if you have nothing better to do."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"It was a slow book.I would not recommend it unless you are bored out of your mind.It is the kind of book that makes you go to sleep.But it has a good ending."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"Jethro Creighton is living in the time of the Civil war. It is just about to start and he is excited. Jethro and his family live in southern Illinois. So they live in a union state and have a union family. All of Jethro's brothers go into the war, and also his cousin. His brother John and Tom, and also his cousin Eb, go to fight for the union. However, his brother Bill makes a decision to fight with the confederacy. Jethro respects his decision and still loves him. While a lot of his family is out at war, Jethro is still at home and expected to work even harder out on the farm. All day he works in the heat, but he doesn't mind it so much. But things start going wrong. His brother Tom is killed in battle, it is very sad. While that happened, some of the men in the down are very angry that Bill went to the confederacy. They call him a traitor and said he deserted the union. Then they start taking action for it and start tormenting the Creighton's. After countless things they end up burning the Creighton's house down. Then Jethro finds Eb, he had deserted the union army. Jethro wrote a letter to President Lincoln to see what he needs to do. Jethro doesn't tell the family cause he doesn't want anyone to get in trouble. Later the war ends and Jethro gets his education. This book was ok, not the greatest I have ever read. There were things about it that I liked and there were things that I didn't like so much. I liked how it showed what war is really like. It showed that enemies aren't always your enemies. What I didn't like is that it was sort of boring.This book showed what war is really like. Sometimes people actually want to go into war. They do not see what it is really like. It's really hard to imagine what it is really like. At the begging of the book Jethro is excited about it, he thinks that it will be fun, cool, and interesting. Later on in the book he figures out that it is none of those. He realizes that war is horror, filled with pain and sorrow. His brother dies; he doesn't even know how any of the other ones are doing. This portrays the way war is in a great way.This book showed that your enemies aren't always really your enemies. A lot of them can actually be your friend, even if you don't know it. In this book there is a family that has a bad reputation. The son of the man who started the bad reputation killed Jethro's sister accidentally. But then Jethro goes on a ride with the father. He is frightened but then the man saves Jethro from people that want to hurt him, so really he is his friend. Also, even though some of Jethro's brothers are fighting each other, they aren't really enemies; they all still love each other.This book was sort of boring. Though many things happen in it it's hard to stay with it. There isn't too much action that you actually read about. You hear about things that happen but you never get to read like you were there. Such as all the battles, you just read about what happened, not as if you were there.This book was alright. I'm not sure I would read a sequel if it had one. There were just things about it that were good and some bad features also. I would recommend this book to people who like reading a lot and don't care if there is action or suspense in a book.-J. Hamilton"},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"\\"A5A\\" is a spectacular heartpounding book.with problems that even you might worry about getting into. Read about all the worlds of characters and sudden turns of fate. Come face to face with the battles of Civil War. Its perfect for teachers teaching on the civil war too."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"As an English teacher, Across Five Aprils is the first text to which I introduce my 9th CP classes. Not only is it a story with sympathetic characters and a primarily-balanced views of the opposing opinions about the Civil War, but Irene Hunt has worked in descriptive passages that do more than describe. Many of the descriptive passages are symbolic, the symbols either referring to time-honored meanings (farm = green = growth,life; red = blood of sacrifice, the soldiers who sacrifice themselves for their cause of freedom for all) or Amer.History meanings (the silver poplars = silver = grey of Confederacy). Such underlying symbols are the sign of a good author, not action and adventure. Finally, as we learned during the late '60s and early '70s, the events on the &quot;home front&quot; are as important to the &quot;war effort&quot; as the events on the battle line. Hunt does an excellent job presenting the &quot;war&quot; on the home front."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"This book is not one of Irene Hunt's greatest novels. Having read the &quot;Lottery Rose&quot; first, I thought that this book would have been equally as interesting. The book is set in the period of the Civil War and it is about a family who goes through a trying period because several of the men in the family leave to take part in the War. The main character is a young boy named Jethro Creighton who journeys from boyhood to manhood throughout the course of the book. He has to take on the responsibilities of the older boys when they leave. The community does not back the Creighton family because one of Jethro's brothers joins the Confederacy. This causes problems for the family as a whole. Needless to say, they stand by one another and stick together. The book has a few other little sub-plots, but none that are overly interesting. Sorry people, the book was not on my list of 'most fascinating' books to be read."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I chose to read this book to my fourth grade students. As a Newberry Award Winner I knew it would be acceptable to our school. I was amazed at the ability of the book to affect both me and my students. It held all my students' attention and made them more aware of the sacrifices that the families of the civil war had to make. At one point I became saddened by the tragedy developing in this family & the students also became visibly saddened because they seemed able to transpose themselves into the role of the younger family member. As the family was divided between the North and South armies my students realized that families can be very different, but still be capable of loving each other. As the anniversary of the Civil War starts this year this book would be very appropriate for any child from upper elementary school through middle school (individual or group) and you might find it affects you as much as it did me."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I am a fifth grade student at Waldron Mercy Academy (S.R.J.). I think that this book is better than a hot fudge sundae with extra hot fudge! Jethro is a 9-year old boy who is devastated when his three brothers, one cousin, and schoolmaster all go off to fight in the Civil War. Even though his family lives in the Union state of Illinois - Jethro's favorite brother, Bill, decides to fight for the Confederacy. All throughout the book Jethro has to deal with townspeople making nasty comments about Bill. Will Jethro every see Bill or his other brothers again?"},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"Life during the civil war is hard, especially for a 9-year-old boy and his family. His brothers, Bill, John, and Tom, and cousin, Eb Carron, had to leave home and join the arm; now, since all his older brothers have gone to war, Jethro Creighton has to make up the work for them. A few years later, the Matt and Ellen heard some terrible news - Tom was dead. In March 1863 finds Eb, now considered a deserter, hiding in the woods near their home, and Jethro does all he can do to help, even writing to the president. After four years of hardship and pain, the war is finally over. However, to everyone's disappointment, the president, Mr. Abraham Lincoln and been murdered in the fifth and last April of the war.I started reading this book because it was the book literature group was assigned to. I didn't want to read it, but I didn't have a choice. So, I just read 15 pages every night and did the homework assignment. However, as I got farther into the book, I started to read more than I needed to.I thought this book was a little boring because it was only about a 9-year-old peasant's life through the Civil War, but there were still parts of the story I enjoyed reading. My favorite part in this book was when Guy Wortman and his friends broke into Sam Gardiner's store. Sam had pretended to go on a business trip to St. Louise, but he was really hiding in his store. He had hit Guy right where he wanted to with buckshot, and held a lamp for the doctor."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"Across Five Aprils is a wonderful recollection of what went on during the Civil War, through the eyes of a child.I loved the way the book is written, since we rarely get to experience what children live and how they feel and react to terrible events that not only influence but change their lives forever.It is true, this book is not a history one explaining past events, but a novel about everyday life in a time of war, and as such it includes some not very accurate comments on what happened, but it does a wonderful job telling us what people percieved to be happening at the time.I liked the way the main character Jethro is developed, because I felt I could identify with him, his experiences and his suffering. Also, I thought some of the books passages were very realistic, such as his encounter with President Lincoln.Finally, this is a book about family, about different points of view, about tragedy, but most of all, about an event that changed this country forever."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"Across Five Aprils, by Irene Hunt is historical fiction. In 1861, Jethro Creighton is a nine year-old boy at the start of the American Revolution. This book tells how his family is affected throughout the war. His mother had twelve kids, but three of them died the year Jethro was born, the oldest daughter was murdered by a man in their town, and the oldest son went to California looking for gold. They haven't seen him since. This book, Across Five Aprils, goes through five years. In the beginning, all of Jethro's brothers and friends are drafted in the war. The war causes Jethro's family many hardships. First, his favorite brother, Bill, joins the war with the south, and not the north. Many towns people call Jethro's family &quot;Copperheads&quot; which means traitors. They think the Creightons are spies for the south. Gangs come to their house in the middle of the night and burn down their barn. Second, Jethro's father, Matt Creighton, has a heart attack, and becomes too weak to work the farm anymore. Time passes, and Jethro's family gets the news that Tom is dead. Eb, the Creightons' cousin who has lived with them for years, becomes a deserter. Jethro writes a letter to Abraham Lincoln asking him what to do about Eb. I like this book because i think it is very interesting. It gives a very accurate idea of what could happen to an average family during the American Revolution. I mostly liked the love story. Jenny Creighton, Jethro's 14 year-old sister, and Shad, Jethro's friend, are in love, and want to marry before the war, but Matt Creighton thinks Jenny is too young. When Shad becomes hurt, the family lets Jenny go to him and they get married. I don't like how sad this book is. Everyone in his family is dying or gone. Jenny, Jethro's sister, is my favorite characterb because I can relate to her. We are about the same age, and have many of the same problems. The scene when John and Bill see eachother for the first time in the war means something to me because it was very surprising. Most books are predictable, but this book was very surprising. This book is different from other books I have read because it is a historical fiction and I still think it is interesting. Usually these kind of books are boring, but this book kept my attention. I would recommend this book to other people. I tell them how interesting and exciting it is. After reading this book i have a few questions such as: What happened to John and Bill? Did they ever make it home? Does everyone in town hate Bill? Will anything happen to Eb when he returns to the war? The strongest reason I recommend this book is because it kept my attention. I would recommend this book to people of all ages."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"This Civil War era novel contains plenty of details on battles and generals for the history buff. But even for those only slightly interested in the Civil War, interesting perspectives are offered concerning both the North and South. Of course the main story of a young boy becoming a man during through the five Aprils of the war is the most compelling. The reader gets a frank picture of what daily farm-life was like, especially for a teenager carrying the responsibilities of a man. Young Jethro has to deal with heavy issues such as death, questions of loyalty, and the necessity of forgiveness. Highly recommended for 12 and up."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"Ok...I'm not going to lie here..This book was down rite awful..It was the worst book i'v ever read!

It thells what they have to go through during the war. the Creighton family witch jeth belongs to lives in southern Illinois.It shows there feelings obout war from the begining to the end. Even though jeth and his family are closer to the south they do not want the union to split apart. So jeth goes to serve in the union army. The book does nicly show how friends and famils get streched apart by the war. This book is very confusing at parts. When I read the back of the book it looked alot better. Even though this is a boring book I do not feel it is the worst I ever read."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"Across Five Aprils is not the wonderful book people claim it is.

I'm a new yorker! And I have to write a report on this book for 7th grade literature! This is probably one of the hardest books you will ever read! Don't read it unless you absolutley have to!"},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I feel bad rating this book so low but I also don't want to rate it higher because I hate this book. The only reason why I read this book was because I had to read it for my english class at school. If it wasn't for the class there is absolutely no way I would have read this book. the teachers thought that we should read a civil war novel for english because were doing a civil war unit in social studies. Before we even started the novel I thought we were doing plenty of civil war, but no we have to do even more civil war. I probably wouldn't have such a hard time with this book if I didn't have to do school work with. I had such a hard time understanding some parts of this book because the family had so many people in it. I struggled to read this book every night not only because it was boring, but because I had to try to understand it so I could do the work that went with it. The only thing that happens in this book is in the begging the civil war is about to start and then some people from this family fight in the war and then they write letters to the family. Thats litteraly the only thing that happens in this book.

For a runner up to the Newberry it was very dissapointing. It starts out well but then it soon begins to slow down and by the end starts to read like a history book. It is a fact that many young adults drop a book the minute they think they're being taught something. I'm sure this has been put down many times."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I have loved this book since I first read it 25 years ago. It presents great accounts of both everyday life and wartime in the previous century -- historical fiction at its best. But Irene Hunt excels at painting human beings and relationships -- the young boy, the family, even Abraham Lincoln. I agree with some other viewers that this book may require more maturity to appreciate than the average 6th-8th grader may possess. It's not all action; it's thought and emotions, too."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"As a whole people who are looking for a thrill or a light read shouldn't read this. It's very descriptive and you need to devote your attention and a willing attitude to be able to enjoy it. I'm in 8th grade and thought that it was hard to stay into. Personally I would have rather read something else, but I did get a good sense of life during the civil war and I suppose that's why I was made to read it."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I read Across Five Aprils when I was in 6th grade and I loved it!

At first i didn't want to be bothered with it, and then after we started discussing it in class, I realized it is probably very interestin.

Along with all the chaos going on, the father of the family becomes ill, leaving Jethro to tend the farm as well as take care of the family. With all the stress over work and fear of his brothers deaths it is amazing how this young man carries on.

Judging from their comments, and from those posted here, I do not think the book is well suited for the middle school reader. Although teachers may assign it for this age group because of the age of the main character, the beauty of the writing and the VERY interesting inclusion of Civil War history is best appreciated by older readers. Perhaps 10th grade? Adults interested in the Civil War will absolutely LOVE this book!"},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I am currently reading this book with high school students. In my opinion, this book is most appreciated when one allready has an understanding of the context of the Civil War. I think it is so crucial that students read literature like this (whether they want to or not) so they can actually visualize our nation's history. Some students are less excited about this book compared to others but we read it together as a class for comprehension's sake. If I assigned this as an out of class book, I can not see many students actually reading this on their own time. It is a bit slow but the details of life during the 1860's and further education of our country's history is why I chose this book for our class. Sometimes, I sense that our student's grasp of history is so weak so I wanted to bolster their knowledge with this historical fiction written about a young man and his family dealing with the trials and tribulations of the time."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"The story follows a young boy, Jethro, and his family at the start of the Civil war and as he grows. The book is similar to \\"My Brother Sam is Dead\\" as it follows a young boy into early adulthood. His family is divided between the views of the South and the North. His brothers go off to fight and he must stay behind to help run the farm and take care of the famliy. The dialect used in the book can make it difficult to read at times, especially for young readers. There are many facts about the war and different battles, which can be difficult for a younger reader to understand, but it is easier to remember these events when put into the context of a real story and family. It can be slow at times, especially at the beginning, overall it is well worth the read and the reader will learn something."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"It's April of 1861, and the Creighton family is living in southern Illinois. Then war breaks out, and the family must somehow live through the struggles of the Civil War. After the firing on Fort Sumter, Tom Creighton and Eb, the family's cousin, went to help the Union Army. For a while the Union Army was not doing very well, and was losing many battles against the Confederate Army. While one of the oldest Creighton sons, John, went to help the Union with the schoolteacher Shadrach Yale, John's favorite brother Bill decided to fight for the Confederacy. After the Union started winning victories, the Creighton's father Matt had a heart attack, and Jethro, the youngest Creighton, and his sister Jenny had to do all of the work on the farm. Then, some people came and burned down the Creighton's farm because Bill was in the Southern Army. After Tom was killed in battle, Eb deserts the Union Army. Jethro wrote a letter to President Lincoln, asking him what to do about Eb, and the President told him that all deserters would be pardoned. Shadrach returned from battle in critical condition, and after he has time to heal, he married Jenny. Bill wrote that he had been captured by the Union, and finally the war came to an end. Jethro went on to get an education with Shadrach. This book showed very well how someone you think is an enemy can turn out to be a good friend, how something like a war can greatly effect a family, and showed how even someone who seems weak can be a very important person.Across Five Aprils depicted very well how a war can tear apart, or bring together, a family. Shadrach Yale and Jenny Creighton were in love, and wanted to get married, but their marriage was delayed five years because of the Civil War. Also, Bill Creighton went to the Confederate Army instead of the Union Army, and this caused the town to turn against the Creightons. Also, because nobody else was at the home, Jethro was forced to do all of the work on the farm after his father's heart attack.The book also showed that an enemy can become a friend. The Creightons had a daughter named Mary who was killed in an accident by Dave Burdow's son. Dave Burdow was also part of the group of people who spoke badly about the family when Bill became a Confederate. But one day on his way home from town, Jethro was overtaken by some evil men. Unexpectedly, Dave Burdow came to his rescue, and stopped the men from hurting Jethro.This story explained how a seemingly weak or unimportant person can really be a key person in a time of tragedy or struggle. Jethro Creighton was just an 8-year-old when the Civil War broke out. But he ended up taking control of the farm, a job that was meant for at least three older men. He also had the courage to write to Abraham Lincoln to ask about his cousin Eb, and in doing so saved his cousin's life. He also stood up for his family when many people were saying they were Confederate supporters.Across Five Aprils is an interesting book that wonderfully shows the life of a family during the Civil War, and the struggles and hardships that they had to face during those five years. It is a masterpiece that anyone would enjoy reading.W.Pillow"},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"In this thrilling and exciting story of a boy named Jethro who went from a safe house to the treacheries of the Civil War, Irene Hunt keeps her readers interested in seeing how the family will overcome many obstacles. {Irene Hunt shows the importance of the setting and her character traits are great.} The Civil War and the fields at his house is the setting of the story. By the second week of April that year,the fields were dry enough for plowing, and Jethro, full of the optimism of inexperience, harnessed his team and went out to the field alone. This once young little boy who didn't know how to do much is now plowing the field as a young man. The characters in this story are Jethro and Shad. &quot;He watched the wagon from the corner of his eye as he worked, and when the team started coming down the road toward the potato patch, he put the heavy bag of cuttings aside and raced across the field to the roadside.&quot; Jethro is a very hard working boy. He is young smart and a fast learner. He was about 10 years old when he started hearing about the Civil War. After a little while his brothers left and then Shad. As he grew older he became stronger and wiser, then he was old enough he joined the army. He had book learning and was almost 21; still he could make a boy feel as proud as a man. Shad was much older than Jethro and smarter. He was the school master of the kids around the area. He was also the on who Jenny loved. He was a book taughtperson from the east he also joined the army. Irene Hunt's historical knowledge gives this book a sense of realness."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"one of the best novels i've yet read on the civil war, and it really does an excellent job of personalizing war, and showing how this war in particular affected a vulnerable american family. the main character is sympathetic, as are his parents and brothers and sister, and their relationships are touching and believable. the interactions with the townfolk are powerful as well, and this book gives a real slice of life into a time and place that just doesn't exist anymore. i wasn't surprised when the author wrote that her inspiration for the novel came almost directly from stories her grandfather told of his actual experiences as a boy who lived during the civil war - this book was too personal, too detailed, too heartfelt, and too simply real to just have been &quot;made up&quot; from her imagination...it just had that ring of truth that made it special.book's major weakness: i felt that in the last quarter of the book or so the author just lost her feel for the characters, or perhaps herself just wanted to finish the book. it started turning into a history lesson. the first three-quarters were wonderful because she DIDN'T do just that, and really let the lives of the characters carry the book and let the battles and history be the backdrop. that last quarter, though, god, it just got dull. sometimes for pages on end there was nothing about a single LIVING character in the book, and just paragraph after paragraph about lincoln and this general and that general and supply lines and politics. it was like...SHUT UP, I WANT TO READ A NOVEL, NOT A TEXTBOOK!that said, i'd still recommend the book highly. it's one of those books that puts a real human feel on a war, and thereby gives me a point of reference when i hear or read further on the civil war.

Sorry folks, I hated this book so did my whole class, even my teacher!"},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I recently read a book titled Across Five Aprils; it's about a young boy named Jethro from Illinois. He is a farm boy who was of age when the Civil War broke out. He and his family worry about the war and if he would be able to dodge having to go. Young Jethro has to grow up faster than most adolescents and he learns to take on huge responsibilities. He gets up early in the mornings to help his mother in the field's he helps with the dishes. The community does not back up the Creighton family because Jethro's brothers join the Confederacy. The Confederacy is against having slaves. This causes problems for the whole family. To get through it the Creighton family sticks together and finds a way through this miserable Hardship.I started reading this book because my English Teacher, Mrs. Shea, recommended it to me. When I saw the cover of the book I didn't want to have anything to do with the book. It looked boring; it looked like something someone old would read. It seemed like a waste of time, but I had to read it. So I read on. At the begging of the book it didn't seem worthwhile to read, but then it got interesting.My favorite part of the book was the opening of every event that happened. Every time he mentioned the fields you could feel the heat of the fields. When he mentioned the murder of someone you could hear the gunshots and the horses gallop. At the dinner table when they all gathered and someone said something that they shouldn't have, you could feel the awkwardness. Irene Hunt did a great job with the descriptions and with the feeling within the whole entire book. This was an extravagant heart-pounding book and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys books about Hardships wars, or excitement."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"[...] I read this book when I was nine or ten years old, and I understood it perfectly. In fact, despite the many books I have read since, I remembered this title and have often recommended it to others as a great example of American historical fiction. I learned so much about the Civil War by reading it, and thought it beautifully captured the emotional conflict so many felt at the time. I have had a passion for American history, particularly the Civil War Era, ever since.Books like these are great for learning about our past in a more personal way than a dry history book. They help us to understand what generations before have gone through in order to make our country what it is today.

It is one of the few American historical novels worthy to stand with the writings of Rosemary Sutcliff. (She and Scott O'Dell are likely the greatest writers of historical fiction for young people ever.) Irene Hunt writes with great compassion and beauty of her ancestors in Illinois during the tumult of the Civil War. She has an almost heartbreaking intensity in her choice of language. This is a great novel, an American classic. People who do not see that are probably not able to read with any sense of artistic appreciation. Well, for them there is always the Magic Tree House series, nice and easy and comfy and not challenging in the least. For those who want something else, there is Across Five Aprils. It is a scandal that Hunt's Newbery Medal winner Up a Road Slowly is out of print."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"An excellent novel to re-read yourself while introducing it to your child. The Creighton family must deal with the political repercussions and the emotional trauma of the American Civil War as their family itself divides along with the country.

An excellent portrayal of mid-19th century household life and the pain of war told through the eyes of a young man coming of age."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"The book Across Five Aprils was really hard to get into. I ended up reading the first chapter four times before I even remotely understood it. Perhaps it is because my knowledge of the Civil War is not quite extensive--but how could that be? I have studied the Civil War for countless hours and have read many books on the topic. All I really want to say, I guess, is that if you are going to read this book, it is best to have a good handle on the Civil War and to like to re-read passages. (This was written with all due respect to Ms. Hunt and her novel.)"},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"Hunt's novel about the American Civil War was a wonderfully written book.

The story was not destinct enough and was shadowed by stero types and more."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"The book that I am reviewing is Across 5 Aprils. It is a book about the Civil War. Though you are never actually in a war in this book you hear about how bad they are and who is winning and such from other characters in the book. In this book the main character is Jethro. Jethro is a young boy whose brothers go to was and he is left to take care if things. He feels like a real man when his dad sends him with the horse and carriage to get a newspaper where he sees the father of the man who killed his sister. My opinion of the Across 5 Aprils is that it is a pretty good book. I liked the story, it wasn't like the Red Badge of Courage where it is just detail after detail. It was a very well written book I would recommend it to just about anyone, and if you had to do a Civil war book report (like me) I would especially recommend it. Across 5 Aprils is about a kid named Jethro and his family who get caught up in the Civil War, their other son went to war and was not expected to return because the war was so brutal and terrible. The people reported of other battles, some the South won, and some the North won. But in the end we all know who won and that the slaves are freed."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"The Book was really good! It helps you understand the Civil War a little better.

Yes, it was quite boring, but a book about most of you'lls lives would be just as, and much more DULL. If I hadn't had to read it for school I would of enjoyed it a bit more. If you look into it you can see some good points and touching morals of the Creighton family.

In the beginning I didnt want to read the book because people who have previously read it were saying that this was the worst book ever. So I blew the book off and totally forgot about it. And when it was two days before the first day of school I relised that I still have yet to read the book. So i found out how many chapters were in the book and made a reading schedule. So I read six chapters a day. But when I got to chapter three I relized how good this book really is. It was soo heartfelt and real. I literally felt as if i was sitting rite next to Jethro and Bill in the field. It was a really strong story and plot line. I could feel the anger, the sadness, and the fear in this book. And when I finally came to the end of the book I didnt want the story to end. I wanted more. I wanted to know what happened to Bill and Eb. I wanted to know if Shadrach and Jenny had any children. I wanted the story to last forever. That is the best book that I have ever read in my entire life. And I would read a thousand times over if I could. I recomend this book for anyone who is from the age 13 up and to anyone who is interested in how the people lived in the Civil War when they weren't the ones fighting in it. So that is why I give Across Five Aprils five out of five stars."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"If you are looking for a war adventure story with lots of explosions, forget it. If you are interested in what war does to a loving family's everyday life, this is your book.Jethro Creighton, the central character, grows from the carefree &quot;baby of the family&quot; to a hardworking, thoughtful adolescent who has seen his brothers go off to fight and in one case, die in the Civil War. Two of the family's sons fight for the Union, one for the Confederacy, and Irene Hunt explores in some detail the ways in which everyday farming folks dealt with these divided loyalties.Hunt is not the sort of writer to condescend to young readers.She creates situations that make you think and reflect. So maybe a junior-high reader who is &quot;made&quot; to read Across Five Aprils would find it tough going.I first read this book when I was in high school, so I was a little older than some of the readers who seem to be having major problems with it. Twenty years later, it's still a book I re-read from time to time. Hunt's characters lose none of their vividness -- when you're an adult, you find a whole new interest in her portraits of Jethro's parents and their anguish over their children in wartime.My advice is, if you're being told to read this for a report and you don't like it, grit your teeth and get through it -- but don't throw the book away. I guarantee that in a few more years you will love it -- unless you've given up on reading altogether."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I read Across Five Aprils along with my own son and the 8th graders I teach as part of a unit on the Civil War. Ms. Hunt does a wonderful job of drawing her characters, particularly Jethro Creighton. Jethro and his family, farming in southern Illinois, find that even though they are not in the midst of the battlefields, their lives are nonetheless swept up in the events of this tragic period in our history. Jethro's growth and understanding of the sweep of history as well as of himself are well-detailed. Well they might be, as Ms. Hunt crafted this story from family stories of her great-grandfather, who was the young protagonist, making this novel something between historical fiction and family lore.She deftly weaves the family events with historic fact, adding faces to the stories in the history texts. As a midwestern gal myself, I found the perspective of a family from that part of the country to be very interesting. Many other similar works make their settings much closer to the historical action, and it is this unique setting that allows the reader to understand just how all-encompassing the Civil War was for the whole country.I found the last few chapters to be disappointing, as she seemed to want to rush to the end of the war and hence her story. The writing took on a feeling of newspaper reports of battles, with very little of the narrative from the Creighton family viewpoint that made the book so engrossing.As a teacher, I feel that the authentic dialect that was used in the dialogue might make for somewhat difficult reading for many kids who struggle with involved text. Nonetheless, a book such as Across Five Aprils makes for a much more interesting and meaningful study of the Civil War than the dry texts we read and forgot."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"If you asked me about this book before May of '08, I simply would have answered I read it for school 10 years ago in 8th grade, and don't remember a thing about it. This all changed last year. I had a flight overseas to catch. Before I left my home for the airport, I randomly grabbed this book off the bottom of the shelf, not really thinking, just needing something to read on the plane.What a treasure I discovered! This book is beautifully written with undertones on how Jethro's thought process changes and develops as the war goes on. It's an incredible read, and really paints vivid pictures for the imaginative. During the course of my trip, I read and re-read this book several times, and learned something new every time. I wish I knew what happened to Bill and the rest of the family after the war.This 3/5 rating is a bit skewered. Most of the 1 scores are from students who do not want to read it and are being forced to, so they're being spiteful. I challenge all of you younger guys and girls to either genuinely give it a chance, or put it away for 5-10 years, and discover it again. It's an amazing read if given a chance."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"Firstly, I am an Australian who is interested in the Civil War. I have had no formal education about American history and have only started to become a serious student of the Civil War through my husband's interest in the event.I am greatly fascinated by the effects that Civil War (as with the Holocaust) had on the people of the country. I found Across Five Aprils a perfect introduction to Civil War fiction. It was well researched and written with great compassion. As a &quot;foreigner&quot;, I found the apparent &quot;Lincon&quot; worshipping a bit much, but now, after a lot more research and many hours of watching documentaries and reading non-fiction works, I can understand the writer's adulation, especially from Jethro's adolescent point of view. Indeed, I was deeply moved by the last few pages, even to the point of tears as I could imagine Jethro's pain at the loss of his (for want of a better term) last great hope.I am greatly amused by other reader's opinions of the book being &quot;boring&quot;. Well, what can you expect? Amazon describes it as a fictional work. It doesn't say &quot;Read the exiting adventures of a farmer boy as he single handedly wins the Civil War&quot; does it?This is an excellent read, as the author is so damned good at descriptive prose that you can feel the heat of the fields, take pleasure in the simple pleasures of these people's lives (who could've imagined that salads would have been such a treat!), rejoice in their small triumphs and feel for them in their loss.I would whole-heartedly recommend this book for &quot;foreigners&quot; with an interest in the Civil War and its effects on an everyday rural family. I also liked this book as I was an avid fan of the Laura Ingalls Wilder (spelling?) Little House series as a child, and I sort of found this book in much the same style."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"For me, this book wasn't at all bad. In fact, I started it yesterday and today I'm finished. If you want a short little story that will keep you interested, then you should try this one. But that's not all it did; I picked up a lot from what I didn't remember in the Civil War. This book hardly made it an American history lesson--it made the Civil War come alive instead. For the kids, well I can understand your pain. In junior high I wouldn't have given this book a second look, but wait a few more years until you can appreciate the history and writing in it. All right, take care."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"Somehow, I made it through childhood without ever knowing about this book. The story itself is very interesting, dealing with issues of death, and joy, and contentment, and innocence, and honor, and responsibility.The setting is the five years of the Civil War, away from the front lines in rural southern Illinois. The characters are country people -- a large family and their neighbors. Jethro, our protagonist, is nine years old as the book opens, and the dreamy peacefulness of his protected childhood bursts wide open as the war talk turns to open conflict within his own family. He bears up, and by helping his family through the endless farm work, he develops manly honor and insight.This book is a treat to read. I am raising a family of boys; I would want Shad or Mr. Milton or Bill or Matt, or Jethro himself, as a role model for any of them.Irene Hunt does a wonderful job with the sibling relationships in this book, the personalities of the sons and the daughter, the affection and conflict. It helps to read this book with a good atlas of the Civil War... try this one.Great Maps of the Civil War: Pivotal Battles and Campaigns Featuring 32 Removable Maps (Museum in a Book)OrAtlas of the Civil War: A Complete Guide to the Tactics and Terrain of Battle (National Geographic)"},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"Across Five Aprils is a book that is set during the Civil War. It is about a 9-year-old boy named Jethro who lives on a farm in Illinois, and it chronicles his experiences across the five aprils that the war goes through.I particularly enjoyed this book, because most books about boys set during the Civil War are about how the boys go off to fight. This book is different, because Jeth does not join the army. Instead, he stays at home and helps his family with the crops. I thought that this was a most refreshing change.I learned many new things from this book. From my history books I had always gotten the impression that Lincoln was a grand hero. We know now that he was, but at the time, many people didn't think so. They criticized him and blamed him for all their problems when the war went wrong. In truth, when the Union army lost battles, it was because the Generals in charge ignored Lincoln's orders and did something different instead.I would recommend this book to people ages 10 and up. I would not recommend it for younger children, because some of the things described in the book are a bit scary. It is, after all, about a war."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"Wow! It saddens me to read some of the low-star reviews of such a wonderfully written book as Across Five Aprils. Whoever said there is no plot or depth of characters either has no heart or doesn't know how to read a book that is above a 4th grade reading level. Yes, I will admit that an elementary child may not be able to understand the longer descriptions of battles or grasp the emotions of the characters on his own. But, it would make a great read-aloud, if the reader can hold back the tears long enough to get the words out. This should forever be required reading for middle/high school students. The problem with our society is that people won't push themselves when reading. Even if it's a little hard, keep reading! This book is a classic and there is reason for that. Please do not continue reading simple stories with fast-paced plots, easy wording and no purpose. Slow down and take your time with a classic like Across Five Aprils.

At the time the war started he was nine. Two Creighton brothers and one of their cousins enlist for the Army and two of them die. The story ends after five long years with the Creightons hearing about President Lincoln getting assassinated.This book was the most exciting book I read about the Civil War. It has many details, emotions and lots of setting descriptions. I especially liked how the author described the battles and the Creighton's farm. This book tells abot the characters' thoughts, instead other books only say facts about what happened with no emotions. I really felt the sadnees and cruelty of the war from all the letters the Creighton boys sent home.

He was certainly right. This book was especially interesting to me because it is set in rural Southern Illinois, about fifty miles from where I grew up. The characters in this book all seem to come to life with the authors words. The reader will find himself putting himself in the position of one or more of the characters in the book. A young boy suddenly finds himself making the decisions and performing the duties of a full grown man. As was so common in this war, brothers find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict. This is a wonderful story of how the Civil War touched the lives of a family. This is a book I could not put down."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"Across Five Aprils was probably the worst book I have ever read in my life. The book was so boring, and hard to follow.

My daughter is an extreme reader (has always had more AR points than anyone else in her school) & I am extremely well read, but somehow missed this one growing up. I will be honest, as an adult I had a hard time dragging myself through this novel & I read a lot of Russian lit (translated) from the turn of the last century! I do understand that there is value in this novel, but it is a very slow story & understanding it is difficult if one doesn't already have a very strong grasp of Civil War History (neither my daughter nor I do). The plethora of underdeveloped characters makes them bleed together, the language is written in such a way that it makes it difficult - and those with reading disorder will TRULY struggle with spellings and word meanings, and military strategy is discussed across the book - but sadly it is so broken up that it has very little meaning at all if one doesn't already have that knowledge at hand (and maybe a map would have been nice for those of us that are lost). With 2 strong readers in my household struggling to drag through this one, I was hoping for some amazing things in the last couple of chapters to make all the work worthwhile (let's face it, the beginning of some fine works are pretty boring - \\"Frankenstein\\" springs to mind), sadly, the end of the book brings nothing more than the beginning or middle offered to us. In my daughter's case this book is being used to screen out Pre-AP students for 7th grade year. At the rate her peers are getting this done, she may well be the only kid qualified for the class.If, as an educator, you elect to use this book, please be sure that your students have a firm grasp of Civil War Battle History. Also, be sure that you either read this aloud to them or offer other options for students with reading issues. The \\"creative\\" spelling of so many words makes this a minefield for kids with any processing issues.At the end of this book I felt as if I had crawled through razor wire to get to a piece of burnt toast. I have rarely considered any book a waste of my efforts, but this one, sadly, falls into that category."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"My Granddaughter needed a copy of this book to have at home, her teacher said the children will need to re-read at home what they read at school.

They are on the Northern side with Abe Lincoln, so many of the men of the house and family list into the army. However, one family member is on the opposite side and the town is against him while another one dies in the war. After a while the North was able to escape with the victory after the town comes to togther to help the family.The reason I'm reading this book is because it has been picked for me for a group book by Mrs. Shea my english teacher.My favorite part is the whole thing because it is the first book I have read with so many emotions. It makes you want to cry, laugh, smile, and frown. The family's problems and jokes never end. Once one does another one starts all over again. This made me feel like i was watching a TV show.

To my surprise Ms. Hunt garnered his attention for at least the 40 minute driving time on most days. The story gave an interesting perspective on the Civil War and was a catalyst for discussion on the war, slavery and the social issue of what to do with \\"them\\" after they're \\"free\\".

I didn't give much thought to the title or author when I returned the book to the library, till I wanted to recomend to their teachers as a good book to read to the class. I had forgoten the name of the book and the author. I searched the library and on internet trying to locate it with no luck, I had given up and was sick about it.

In history books people say the Abraham Lincoln was a hero.

The Civil War almost destroyed the whole South."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"This book offers a different perspective on the Civil War - a boy too young to fight in the war, but old enough to understand the consequences. This isn't an action-adventure book - the battle scenes are told through letters written home - but Jethro, a nine-year-old boy, becomes a man during the four years of the war, as he takes on the responsibilities of the family and the farm. This book really makes you think about the Civil War, and how complicated it was for everyone, not just the soldiers and politicians and slaves, but even for a young boy in a small farming town in Illinois."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"Hi. I am in 7th grade and I didn't have to read this book but I did. It only took one day to finish it. It was totally cool. I'm not really into history and yet I loved it.

I was touched by the love and compassion in this book and am looking forward to reading Irene's next book. Look if you want to read this book find a day where you have nothing to do.

It helped my students gain an understanding of how war affects a family as well as a community and nation. It had all the things young students enjoy--a story about another young person, a bit of a love story :), some blood and guts, and a lot of adventure.

My kids enjoyed it, and they really read it. Thanks, Irene."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I first read this book as a young child. I enjoyed it so much that I have re-read the book at different times in my life. The author certainly is one of the best I have read. She has the special talent to portray the full gament and richness of human emotion.The book inspired me to write. I am still trying to obtain the depth of character that Ms. Hunt is so talented. Unfortunately, many of the reviewers here were unable to enjoy and understand the emotional interactions. I feel very sad for them, as they are surely unable to embrace what it is to be a human. We are emotional beings and the book is able to portray life in all of its good and bad terms.Terry L.

The Civil War was one of the most important wars ever. You just have to understand what Jethro and his family and friends are going through. There are some sentences that you just have to think about what they mean. For instance, the very last line of the book: Her arms were held out to Jethro, and for that moment when he ran to her, all the shadows were lifted from the April morning.That line has a lot of meaning into it. You just have to sit and think about it. Then, you'll come to understand the significance of the book.This book is filled with hatred from the war, sadness because of loss, as well as with love and dignity. If you understand the meaning, then you'll come to love the book as much as I have"},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"This book was assigned for my 8th grade English Honors course. The book was easy to follow along with, but it was not very exciting. I found the story line to be well organized, but I really wanted to smack around all the characters, especially Jethro. I can't even remember why, I just feel that he could use a smack in the face."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I think that the book Across Five Aprils is very boring.They should not have eighth graders read it.Students should not have to read this book until eleventh grade.Because it is quite hard to read.In closing I did not like the book Across Five Aprils."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"What happened on the home front when all the young men left to go to war.This novel is about a boy growing up in a farming communityin the north bordering a southern state whose relativeson his mother's side were southern.He follows the battles in the war as he struggles to get the crops in.The point that northern people looked down on the farmer's dialect is make.I enjoyed the historical perspective of the novel,but I found the prose hard going at times as a matter of written style."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I teach 8th grade and my students and I LOVE this novel. There are several good twists,turns, and nice surprises along the way. It may require some thinking on their part to \\"get into it\\", but I have never had one student tell me that they didn't like the book when they were finished. In fact, students would get angry if we had to skip a day! This is a great historical fiction that really sparks a great deal of discussion about he Civil War. When I read other kids complaining about this book I thought of something Eleanor Roosevelt once said. \\"It takes curiosity to gain intellegence.\\" So, if you're curious about the Civil War, this is a good read!"},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I can't say enough good things about this book!!I was an insatiable reader as a child and this was one of my favorite books! I read this with 5th graders as a teacher and fell in love with it all over again! Many of my students had NEVER read a chapter book on their own, let alone read for pleasure, but they became captivated with reading as a result of this book and went on to read non-fiction books about the Civil War, biographies about Abraham Lincoln, Rifles for Watie, etc., on their own. This is significant since I taught in a low socio-economic area (95% free or reduced lunch). If kids find this boring, it is because it is over their heads - I read this WITH my students. They each had a copy and we read it aloud together in unison, stopping to clarify and discuss. Using historical fiction to introduce history makes it interesting and \\"digestible\\" for young people. It also sparks a desire to know more. A teacher can't tell a student everything, s/he must inspire them to investigate further. When students endeavor to learn more on their own, they are on the road to becoming educated. Abraham Lincoln himself only had one year of schooling - he educated himself with BOOKS!Specifically, this book is about a farming family in Civil War times torn apart by the war. It helps students understand the realities of the war that pitted \\"brother against brother\\" when the oldest son goes to fight for the \\"other\\" side. When he discovers that his brother was killed in battle, this big, hulk of a man sends word to his \\"mama\\" that he did not fire the shot that killed his brother. The book makes real the pain each family member must have felt. It helps students understand that the war was not just about slavery, it was also about states' rights and whether or not the people of the US wanted the federal government to be able to tell them what to do. The future of our government depended on the outcome of the war. It also helps them understand human rights and the fact that there are many gray areas in the complex world of politics and that issues rarely have an easy black or white answer.PARENTS, this book is worth reading with your child line by line if necessary! It can be tough, but it helps young people grow up a little and see the world more clearly, giving them a glimpse of a world outside of themselves.Books can change you and this one will for the better, without the shocking slap in the face that sometimes accompanies life lessons. You will notice deeper understanding, more maturity, a sense of accomplishment when your child masters this book. THAT is how you develop genuine self-esteem.For other character developing books, try The Secret Garden, The Diary of Anne Frank, and Anne of Green Gables. I can't explain why, but my 6th grade boys liked these as much as the girls, although they would never have picked them up on their own. Sounds crazy - I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't experienced it myself!"},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I have to say I love this book! It is awsome! I had heard it was boring, slow getting into, stupid and about everything else bad about it you can think of. Those comments were and are the understatements of the year!I like this book so much because you can relate and feel like your being the character. I also like it because it has something for everyone for kids their is a young character, for men their is a war story, and for women their is a love story.The story is strong because it has so much agony and yet the family holds through it all. It holds through death, suffering, and through war.Overall this book is very wishy-washy but it is good none the less!!!"},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I just read this book in my 8th grade Language Arts class and thought it was supper boring.

But, I keep an open mind when it comes to reading. So I picked it up and began reading it for the assignment and I literally just fell asleep. Across Five Aprils is a historical novel that takes place during the Civil War. The Creighton family, which the story revolves around, has members of the family that are fighting on opposing sides. Even though this may have seemed like and interesting character conflict, it wasn't, ad the characters also became impossible to relate to. I felt like an outsider while reading the book because I continually became confused as to what was happening because of the lack of character detail and description. Please, don't waste your time reading this novel if you can avoid it."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"At a glance, this book is about the Civil War and how it effected children and families growing up in that time, the sturggles they face and how they triumph when triumph seems impossible, and how love and hope outshine hate, bloodshed and grief. That's enough to make anyone want to read this book, but what really made me like it so much was the patterns of family life woven around all of this. In the story, nine-year-old Jethro Crieghten learns to become the man of the family when his brothers Tom and John and his cousin Eb go off to war. In the parts of the book about them, Irene Hunt draws a relistic picture of what life was like for the families waiting anxiously back home, drawing in death, and desertation into the story. Jethros favorite brother, Bill, leaves the family to serve the south, and when this causes an uproar in the pro-Union town, Jethro must learn to stand up for what and who he believes is write, in the face of his grief and the towns anger. Other characters woven into the fast-paced plot of this story are Jethro's older sister, Jenny, who her father deems to young to marry the schoolmaster, Shadrach, who is Jethro's hero and a fair, thoughtful person. There are Jethros parents, kind and worried Ellen, and Matt who is always questing for what is right. There is his brother John's meek wife, Nancy, who is brought closer to her husbands family by the war, Dave Burdow, a misunderstood town criminal, Ross Milton, a kind editor and friend, and Abraham Lincoln, the presidant who Jethro admires for his abilities to lead the country towards what is right. This book is a wonderful read, full of convinicng characters, and yes, it is very interesting after studying the Civil War, for the battles and the feelings for and against the presidant and the grenerals are well portrayed."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I read this book for school, and I found it excessively boring.

However, I am not a child that can't understand books. I have read many great works which I know that many adults have never even dared touch (ex. The Catcher in the Rye, The Grapes of Wrath, Uncle Tom's Cabin, The Three Musketeers, The Red Badge of Courage, The adventures of Huckleberry Finn, etc.). I agree with many that this book is so boring that it would put many to sleep. I hated this book so much that when we turned our copies in, I thought that the best use for the stacks of books would either be firewood alternatives or for skeet."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"Jethro Creighton's life in rural Illinois seems far removed from the tense political events in Washington, DC. But when Jethro's teacher brings the news that the country is at war, Jethro's world comes crashing down around him.

Jethro waits, desperate for news and struggling to manage the farm with just his mother and sister, through the five long springs of the American Civil War.Across Five Aprils is a powerful story about a boy becoming a man during the most difficult of times.

They also have a another son that went to fight on the rebels side, so there were a group of people that hated the family for that. There daughter was in love with a man that went to war and he became wounded, but she eventually marrys him. Then there youngest son, Jethro, who was most loved, had to work on the farm after his father had a heart-attack. So I would say this is a touching story of a family and everything that happens to them on the way."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I haven't even finished the book but it sounds really good and who ever doesn't like this book probably doesn't like history either.

This book was a very well wriiten book and it was wounderful. Not many books about the Civil War tell about how the young boys who didn't fight in the war had to cope with the hardships of not having their brothers to help them work the farm. It was extreamly hard for Jethro for his father could not even help him. He only had his sister. I would truly recomend this book to anyone who is interested it the history of the USA."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"I had to read this book for an 8th gade class. I had a hard time reading the book because the story was so dull. I was a little dissapointed. I was also lost for some of the time. I watched the movie based on the book after I read the book. The movie was horrible. It was an ultra low budget that was worse then the book."},{"Title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"This book was so excellent! When you get into it is so sad, with much hate and prejudice, but also with a love that binds the Creightons so they can get through all the tradgedy they suffer. Jethro is so tough in appearence, but underneath he is sad about the losses of his family. He becomes a man way too early and through the book i was sort of worried he wouldnt be able to do it any longer. I will say no more except for this: Anyone that misses out on a book so touching and well thought and told, is missing out on one the great parts of life!"},{"Title":"Software Patents","review":"I read older version of this book more than 6 month ago. This gives little idea about software patents but it DOES NOT talk about software in each chapter. This is like a general patent agent's book, but only with a little flavor of software-insights.I suggest the following supplements for writing a competent software/business method patent: Read a book on System Analysis, a book on Software Engineering--if you have time(optional), a book on Unified Modeling Language 2.0 (any basic UML book will suffice, but it is a must to read), learn to use a UML drawing tool like either MS Visio, Rational Rose, or Enterprise Architect.

It's written in an accessible tone and has some ideas that challenged my, what I thought were, progressive views of marital relationships. I particularly found the examples of near peer relationships and the father as provider discussion enlightening. Although the other reviewer thought the book contained too much class bias, my personal experiences with this type of arrangement are from working class folks who elected to take jobs on different shifts so they could both work full time and share child-rearing responsibilities and a couple who chose to rough it out financially for a few years so the mom could get a degree in dental hygiene to increase the family money instead of focusing on the father as the provider. While the couples have had tough times working out their work/family situation, I am glad we have books like this that give us hope of creating a better family unit through principles and practices of equality instead of relying on the easier, more gender-stereotyped, traditional way of doing things."},{"Title":"Peer Marriage","review":"This sociological study explores a marriage without a dominating partner where both spouses are best friends. True love. The main flaw is that it doesn't delve into how these people found each other. Beyond that it focuses on power sharing which comes down to sharing the household chores and working less hours for the husband. The question is, how many people out there can afford to work part time to in a quality relationship and still earn a full time income? It seems that peer marriage is an upper class phenomenon, but the author takes this bias for granted, nver mind that only 2% or so can and do engage in an arrangement of the type discussed in the book. This book would have been much more relevant if it analysed equality and friendship as it manifests itself in working and blue collar families who have to worry about bills and daycare and are not facing a danger of becoming an advertising executive at the peak of their career."},{"Title":"The book of Daniel","review":"My Community Bible Study Teacher had often made the statement that the Book of Daniel in the Old Testament is the key to the rest of the Bible. Now, that was compelling enough for me to go home and read it. The history given in the beginning of the book was easy to understand, but the prophesy given from this book of the Bible was very complicated. I didn't get it at all. Then someone told me about Clarence Larkin, so I ordered several of his books including this one. As I read, I thanked God for his insights. His Book of Daniel explained everything in an easy readable way. It was his last of several bible teaching books. This Baptist Preacher was dying but held on until he finished his Book of Daniel. I'm thankful for that, because I am one who didn't understand, and now I do. And, by the way, my Bible Study Teacher had been right."},{"Title":"The book of Daniel","review":"Great book.

I have a child with attention problems and one who is defiant. This book was hard to read and didn't really give me any good stategies that I haven't already learned in other books. Honestly, I had to skim though most of it because it was so boring. So, maybe I missed some good parts.My favorite book so far is How To Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk. I highly recommend this book! This book gave me strategies to use for all four of my children and has made a big difference in how my children obey me, talk to me and talk to each other.

Only half kidding...it has been enormously helpful in thinking about his behavior. But the surprise is, all of my other kids are in here too, as well as me and my husband! Anyone with a strong personality was probably a difficult child, at least in some ways (ask your mom!!), and this book gives you insight into how you got the way you are, and how your personality might intersect with your child's to cause trouble understanding each other.My favorite thing about this book is the way Greenspan includes a section on &quot;what it feels like&quot; to be each of the types of challenging children, so you can understand that your child often really, truly, doesn't see the world at all the way you do. They are not just trying to drive you nuts, they genuinely sometimes see black when you see white! If you can get behind their eyes you can support them so much better when things get hairy.I would agree with the other reviewers that there isn't much in this book about special needs per se-- if you're looking for a book on ADD or another issue of that sort you may not find what you need here in terms of specific information.

As a teacher and parent, I believe this is the best book I have seen in recognizing and nurturing the five different \\"challenging\\" children. Even my husband, who is always a bit skeptical with parenting books, was amazed at how on-target this one is.

The highly sensitive child chapter outlines my daughter's life from birth through today, as well as many of the frustrating feelings I've had as a loving, yet confused parent. The book helps show how to best parent each of the five different types of children. The book states that you (the parent) are not the cause, but you can help be part of the solution via your parenting style. I started dog-earing the pages as I read the book so I could go back to the parts most on spot for my daughter. By the end of the chapter I realized that I had dog-eared almost every page.

Who among us hasn't come up against a behavior or problem with our child, and felt as if we had tried everything we know of, with no result? It doesn't have to be a huge pattern of difficult behaviors to drive you crazy; it can just be that One Thing that you fight over, every day...I love that Dr. Greenspan emphasizes the point of view of the child, to help frustrated parents understand that the kid isn't being deliberately, willfully difficult. I have two friends with VERY stubborn, almost 2 year olds, and I wish they would just crack the chapter on The Stubborn Child. They seem so frustrated, and sometimes I see them making the exact parenting missteps that Dr. Greenspan outlines. I must admit that it is hard to read the book and see yourself there, in the mistakes you've made and the things you've thought and tried. But, as I tell my son, kids don't come with an instruction booklet attached, and parents make mistakes sometimes, too.This book is full of kind and sound advice and really helped our family. I wish the title was somewhat different, because at first blush it seems as though it was written only for the parents of that Kid Throwing the Huge Tantrum in the middle of the restaurant; you know, THE CHALLENGING CHILD. But, it is a great book for all of us, who want to understand our kids more and become better, more confident parents, and raise happy and loving children.

That book was Noli Me Tangere, translated into English here in The Social Cancer. The first of two books in a series, The Social Cancer provides an exceptional glimpse into history and does a great job of exposing the injustices of the Philippine Revolution, while simultaneously being an excellent read.While this book is certainly historically educational, it is by no means your average history book. Rizal, writing for a large audience, opted to write a novel rather than a manifesto. In doing so, he not only writes an expository piece revealing the corruption and wrongdoings of those in power at the time, but also tells a compelling story with rich characters in a diverse and interesting milieu. Much like with Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, The Social Cancer's interesting set of characters draws the reader into the book and makes you care about them, right before they are subjected to the horrors of the world they live in.To create these characters and their oppressive world, Rizal drew on his own life experiences to great effect. Rizal was born into a Filipino family and was thus able to witness the injustices he describes in his book firsthand. Right before Rizal was sent off to school, his mother was unjustly imprisoned, simply because two Spanish officials felt insulted by Rizal's father and wanted to get back at him. (1) On top of that, when Rizal finally got to school, he found his brother distraught over the unjust execution of three Filipino priests. One of these priests had been a renowned professor at the university, and the three had been executed because they protested the forced replacement of Filipino clergy with Spanish clergy. Rizal also wrote of his own experience with the Philippine civil guard: \\"Almost every day in our town we saw the Guardia Civil lieutenant caning or injuring some unarmed and inoffensive villager. The only fault would be that while at a distance he had not taken off his hat and made his bow... We saw no restraint put upon brutality. Those whose duty it was to look out for the public peace... were the real outlaws.\\"1 Events like these do appear in The Social Cancer, with the civil guard and their ironic lack of peacekeeping making a prominent appearance. By showing how kind and righteous Filipino characters could be uprooted and twisted by the 19th century Spanish leaders and clergy, Rizal made a beautiful argument for change that still carries weight today, despite the fact that the leaders in question are long gone.A testament to the book's importance is the reaction it received at the time of its publication. To the Spanish leaders and clergy, the book was so scathing that it was banned in the Philippines. On top of that, Rizal himself was persecuted by the Philippine government for his remarks, much like Ibarra, the main character in his book. Eventually Rizal was arrested for inciting a rebellion he had no personal involvement in (Rizal actually favored peaceful protest (2)) and executed by the Spanish government. His execution then served as further proof of unjust government to those who had read his books and thus, Rizal managed indirectly spark a revolution. While the revolution itself wasn't exactly a success (the Filipinos were able to oust Spanish rule, only to have it forcibly replaced by an American army they couldn't defeat (3)), the simple fact that Filipinos were able to gather together from their respective regions to form a cohesive revolutionary force shows what a unifying effect The Social Cancer had by creating characters to drive a Filipino national image.Even though the Philippines are an independent nation today, The Social Cancer is definitely still a powerful book. Not only does it provide a glimpse into the troubled past of the Philippines, but it also serves as a reminder of what government has been and could be. While reading and reflecting on this book, I was reminded of how valuable freedom really is, and I gained a renewed appreciation for my American right to vote and decide who will be in power, especially considering that events like those in The Social Cancer actually took place.Sources:[...][...][...]"},{"Title":"The Long Revolution","review":"I've become very interested in critical theory recently, especially in the areas of Marxist Criticism and Cultural Studies. I've been reading some of the primary texts of these movements in an effort to understand where they are coming from and how they can be used in literary criticism and beyond. So far I have finished a number of short excerpts and essays as well as two books, including The Long Revolution by Raymond Williams. While all of this reading has been truly enlightening, The Long Revolution has stood out to me as one of the most interesting and mindblowing pieces of nonfiction I have ever read.In this book, Williams sets out to describe the state of literature, democracy, education, and culture in England, how it got there, and where it's going. He does so by tracing the history of various institutions, including public education, the popular press, and standard English, and showing how they have become what they are. Using many (somewhat exhausting) pages of facts and statistics as evidence, Williams comes to stunning and revolutionary conclusions. I was absolutely blown away by his ideas because they seemed so right and felt so honest.First, Williams sets down definitions for important terms that he will be using for the rest of the books. These terms have so many uses in casual speech that he defines the way he wants the reader to understand them in the context of his book. He defines what it means to be creative, and shows how all people create to some degree in their everyday lives. He also defines culture, not just as art and clothes and the lie, but as structures of feeling, the way people thought and felt about things, the general sense of what it was like to live in a time. Once those definitions are complete, he shows the various ways that an individual can relate to society as a whole, and the different ideas of what it means to be individualistic verses social. His great gift is subtlety, and he can show all the important social reasons why individualism became the dominant idea of how people relate to society while also showing how pure individualism has failed society and is now being reevaluated by a new generation of people. The chapters Individuals and Societies and Images of Society and the end of Part 1 left me literally speechless. It's Williams's balance and fairness, his reliance on research, his refusal to be pedantic or dogmatic, that makes this book so refreshing and so effective.So often, when we talk about culture we blame low quality arts, be they books, movies, or music, on the masses, as if the working class were inherently less intelligent than the rich or entitled. Williams doesn't just argue against that, he shows with real evidence that much of that classist thinking goes against the actual history of these institutions. He shows, for instance, that the relatively low state of the popular press (magazines and newspapers) today is not, as many people think, the fault of the poor taste of the masses, but instead that the popular press has been affected by changes in printing, distribution, taxation, advertising, and consolidation of ownership more than anything else. The glut of sensational tabloids is sold just as much to the rich as to the poor, and the changes in newspaper styles and distributions are independent of education reforms that taught more of the working class to read. The proliferation of low quality books, movies, music, and newspapers, he argues, is not the fault of the inherent bad taste of the masses, but a side-effect of the ownership of these cultural institutions by speculators who are only interested in making money. Quality artists, interested in furthering the art form, cannot compete with the scale of distribution that the large companies produce. The problem, it seems, is not that people are inherently stupid or that the lower classes have inherently bad taste, but that our current system of capitalism makes our cultural institutions into a matter of speculation and profit. Anyone who is interested in independent publishing should absolutely read Part 3, Britain in the 1960s, which looks at the publishing industry in a way I've never seen before.Williams writes in a style that is easy to read and understand. Although there are some slow sections where he is setting down definitions or charting history using facts and figures, his conclusions are always strong and flow naturally from his research. The book is older, published in 1961, so I'm sure it has mistakes and is outdated in some places, but most of it still reads as being contemporary and relevant. His structure is perfect, his writing is incredibly readable, and his ideas are engaging. I don't know that I have ever enjoyed academic writing so much, and I thoroughly intend to read more of his books very soon.Rating: 5 stars.Recommendations: The statistics and definitions can get very boring, but the conclusions they support are worth all the waiting.Note: Many people see this book as a sequel or companion to his earlier book Culture and Society, which I have not read. I found it perfectly readable without having read the other book. That said, I imagine that Culture and Society is also very good."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring Sourcebook (The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game)","review":"This book mostly outlines the timeline of both Peter Jacksons' films and the trilogy from J.R.R. Tolkien, and spells it all out in plain english. There's also a lot of good information on *each* of the major characters from the books and film, and the differences between each. In the \\"Places\\" chapter it outlines major places of note, and gives some maps and adventure hooks as well. All in all I am very happy with it; but it *is* just a sourcebook, it doesn't have much actual DM stuff in it for the game. Just a good reference book."},{"Title":"Where Two Ways Met","review":"I love all of her books. Where Two Ways Met is a heartwarming tale of the conflicts between God and the material world.

Jensen refutes old myths and nationaist propaganda about how the Confederation government was a failure. Jensen rightly points out the accomplishments of the first Federal government. He points out the laws to settle the huge western territory,the commissions develpoed to settle land disputes between states, and the establishment of foreign diplomatic establishments.He also points out the propaganda and power of the nationalists in the nation who were attempting to create a centralized government.He shows how many Americans were quite content with a weak central government and thought the Confederation was a sucess.Overall and excellent book."},{"Title":"The New Nation;: A history of the United States during the Confederation, 1781-1789 (A Caraville edition)","review":"I read a lot of history books, I like ones that even most people would find dull, but this is the abosolute worst.

Jensens writing style is unbearable."},{"Title":"Football's Attacking 46 Bear Defense","review":"It seems with Harding Press books that the topic discussed isn't the mainstay of a coach. While Coach Ratledge uses the 46 he also uses other defenses(as he says in the book). This isn't a bad thing AT ALL. It actually gives you something extra. In the case with this book it is the shifting and stemming from and to a 4-3 Defense.With the book itself: it is good. Very detailed and illustrated. The front itself looks differen from Rex Ryan's 46 but it's not THAT much different. Both have the adjuster(Strong Safety) off the TE instead of the weakside tackle but the tackle in Coach Ratledge's book is set wider in the illustrations only. It might throw you off at first, but you'll adjust(we are coaches after all).Why four stars? While the book covers all the basics and advanced material, I'd like to see a chart or the like. I would also like to see things more spaced out.Pluses: Good coverage of the 46. Bonus material informative and adds to knowledge.Minuses: Bunched together informaton-wise at times."},{"Title":"Football's Attacking 46 Bear Defense","review":"Why would anyone want to purchase a book that is 10 years old and just over 100 pages for $95. No way this book is worth that much, especially considering that the author is not even the originator of the 46 defense."},{"Title":"The thing","review":"Based upon the title one might assume that this is an autobiographical work about why it is that Chesterton converted to Catholicism and, perhaps, an explanation of why he could no longer accept Protestantism as legitimate at a relatively late stage of his life. This assumption would only be partially accurate at best. Accurate in that Chesterton spares few words expressing his frustration and borderline disgust with the Protestant denominations of his time. Disappointingly inaccurate in that, unlike Lewis'Surprised by Joy: The Shape of My Early Life, there is very little information surrounding the circumstances of his conversion. Nonetheless, Chesterton makes it apparent enough why he made, and why he felt that he had to make, the decision that he did. As for the evolution of the thought process leading to his conversion, there are enough indications in most of his earlier works, such asHeretics,Orthodoxy, andThe Everlasting Man(to name some of his most popular titles), to put the pieces together. Unfortunately, or fortunately, for the reader Chesterton wrote a lot of books and so there are a lot of pieces.The Thing, at first blush, appears to be a collection of loosely related essays that read as such, as opposed to one solidly cohesive work attributed to a clearly defined conclusion. If approached on a chapter by chapter or essay by essay basis; that is, each in the context of itself, The Thing seems empty and cold. However, as Chesterton seemingly always manages, once reflected upon in its entirety, The Thing powerfully reveals that which Chesterton needed so many words and examples to describe that he could only refer to it as Thing when time or space were limited. The fact that it could not be explained succinctly adds to its legitimacy, especially considering the author's gifted ability to translate the abstract. This fact also, in this case, necessitates circular arguments and seemingly unrelated references which one might feel bogs it down at times.It is atypical that Chesterton's work would seem labored. In The Thing Chesterton, on more than one occasion, takes multiple swings at his point; sometimes missing. This is the primary difference between The Thing and this genius of an author's most popular masterpieces. It is in his attempts to put thought to paper, however, that Chesterton makes his point clear enough to call it completed and, what may have been unintentionally, expresses some of life's most difficult to express truths. It might be comparable (with regard to theology) to what Pascal did for modern statistics in writingPensees. Brains of their caliber are great even with regard to the derivatives of a point that many will never have the ability to perceive as they have. In other words The Thing is worth reading if one is able to resist the temptation to force what one expects it to be out of it."},{"Title":"The thing","review":"highly recommended to fans of &#34;the Thing&#34; gave a lot of creedence to the movie and as character names were the same as movie (Copper , MacReady) it was rather enjoyable and easy to picture in one's &#34;minds eye&#34; what was happening , although there were very subtle differences which made it a little different , but not to the point of annoyance."},{"Title":"Follow That Puppy!","review":"I received this book from no other than the author's daughter, Alicia.

For example, it explains in a clear and understandable way the qualities of and relationship between spirit, mind and matter. It furthermore provides welcome insights on universal healing principles and how to build a strong faith. As I was reading it for the first time, I found myself looking at the original publication date (1941) in total disbelief.

This well-writen book may be dated with respect to some of its topical discussions, but remains highly relevant thanks to its excellent perspective and thoughtful conclusions.Laqueur, an experienced historian and political commentator, closely examines the uses and limits of intelligence in this 400-page book, including its excellent endnotes. His context is the spate of intelligence \\"failures\\" associated with the Vietnam and Cold Wars, and the investigations into those failures. The author spends some useful time on commonsense definitions, but the heart of the book is a series of case studies, including the so-called missile gap of the 1950's and the Cuban missile crisis. His analysis is pitched at the strategic level, and his findings are a recognition of the reality of life in the intelligence business, and of the limitations of what intelligence can accomplish for decision-makers. The Cold War was still undecided when Laqueur wrote this book; much attention is paid to the then-ongoing competition with the Soviet Union and its intelligence agencies. The closing chapter, with its eleven principles of intelligence, is worth the price of the book all by itself. There are no photographs or other graphic aids.\\"A World of Secrets\\" is highly recommended to students of the intelligence community as a clear-eyed look at a difficult but essential business, well worth purchasing even in used condition."},{"Title":"World of Secrets: The Uses and Limits of Intelligence","review":"I continue to regard this book as one of the best available textbooks for inspiring informed student and entry-level employee discussion about the intelligence professional and its role in supporting policy-making.

The book consists of eight chapters each dealing with an important aspect of life: Romance, Happiness, Work, Emotions, etc. Within these chapters 100 personality quizzes are offered, many with intriguing titles, such as: How Romantic Are You? How's Your Sense of Humor? and Can You Control Your Own Destiny?The reader is drawn in to complete a test, only to discover that each is only 10 to 12 questions long and most are just statements that require a true/false answer. These tests are not scientifically valid psychological assessments, but merely the author's ideas of what may be useful questions.How foolish does the author/publisher expect readers to be by addressing serious issues like marital unhappiness, parenting problems, and career change with a handful of unvalidated questions? While many questions are &quot;based on&quot; scientific psychological tools, no percentiles, averages, or normative information can be shared because there are none. It is like asking for an x-ray and being handed a flash light.Once the reader completes each test one sentence on how to calculate the score is offered, then the reader is provided with another couple of lines of banal analysis: &quot;You should do as well as the average person.&quot;Has the reader learned a personal insight?

I missed him from this offering by Allingham, but even without him, the author shows clearly why she earned membership in that Golden Group of Detective Story Authors, those of the British School of the Twenties through the Fifties. She is literate, her characters have life, the plots are interesting, there is generally an element of humor in situations and/or text, and, in every respect, they speak of an author who has experienced life with a novelists eye and mind. ( I would say the same of Christie, Sayers, Marsh, Blake, Crispin, et al, who continue to provide pleasure long after their deaths.) In this story, the Co-Director, and serving Manager, of an historically relevant Art Gallery is murdered. All the suspects are either confined within the firms headquarters or the ancestral home of the elite family that has owned the gallery since its founding. The lead characters are richly drawn, the background ones nicely delineated. Not Campion but a Police Inspector plays the Central role of Nemesis. There is a romantic element, but it is not the dominant theme as it is in so many current mysteries. It reads well.As to this audio book, it shines with the performance of Francis Matthews, a distinguished actor. With his voice he makes each of the characters live, none sound contrived.

Also interesting ... perhaps most interesting... is the account at the beginning of the book of how a preconceived notion can blind a reasonable person to the evidence right before his (or her) eyes)."},{"Title":"War Before Civilization","review":"The thrust of this book is the auithor's thesis that war, however defined, was at least as prevalent in prehistory as in historic times, with all the horrors we see today or in our previous century. His evidence from archaeology and ethnology is very convincing, entertainingly rendered, with flashes of both humor and pathos. Though his attempts at drawing conclusions about how to secure peace do not quite fit the project, on the whole this will prove interesting to both lay hobyists (of military history) and, perhaps, professional military (for pointing out how little military science has actually advanced since earliest human prehistory, and what we have to learn from &#34;primitive&#34; warriors).Kindle Edition: Regional and geographic maps hard to read on my Kindle Keyboard, archaeological site maps OK, cave paintings rendered well.

Typos do not seriously detract, but look slightly unprofessional.(My objection, which may be more appropriate to a scholarly journal: the taphonomic filter. I question drawing conclusions about what percentage of an ancient population died by war or murder by counting skeletons with marks of human violence such as embedded projectile points and ax injuries. Which is more likely to be found archaeologically: a hunter or trekker who died alone and had his bones scattered by scavengers, or one that died with at least one other human nearby (his killer), who would then have done something orderly about the corpse if only to get it out of sight and smell?)"},{"Title":"War Before Civilization","review":"It doesn't require a book to tell this story.

Reasons included the need for more land, food and, of course, women. Keeley shows, through documented research, that this warfare took predominately the form of \\"low-intensity\\" warfare that accounted for more dead (as a percentage of population) than even the most vicious \\"modern\\" wars (i.e., world wars I and II, etc.). His research shows that the peaceful savage was much more myth than reality."},{"Title":"War Before Civilization","review":"The author really kicks the \\"noble savage\\" myth to the curb. Uses the latest archaeological data to show that, overall, the supposed peaceful aborigines were proportionally more violent than the evil white man and that war and violence are universal throughout history and cultures."},{"Title":"War Before Civilization","review":"This book examines and buries one of the great myths of our times. The myth of the peaceful past, the Noble Savage. Keeley reminds us, with empirical evidence, that war and violence is part of the human heritage and not the exclusive sin of one race, one culture or even one epoch. This myth demeans the humanity of all of us. His final and more speculative final chapters on how the myth of the passive past shapes modern debate is full of uncommon sense."},{"Title":"War Before Civilization","review":"Vital for understanding how tribal people were hardly the peaceful sages of the earth but were in fact in often in a constant state of low-level warfare. Keeley misses, or dismisses, some major points made by other anthropologists about how hunter-gatherers were indeed healthy and free of the stresses of modern life. Keeley doesn't always differentiate between hunter-gatherers, tribes, and chiefdoms but rather analyzes data based on prehistoric people of all social organizations, many of which I suspect behaved more like civilized cultures in terms of territorial expansion and warfare. Instead Keeley focuses on instances when that was/is not the case and ends up glorifying civilization by saying what humans need is increased civilization in a global sense because our death rates are lower than in prehistoric times. To him the choice is obvious; then again, he barely mentions the consequences of civilization that many other anthropologists, scientists, philosophers, politicians, etc. have examined to death. A final aside: Despite Keeley's case, his argument appears to rely more on a scientific view than that of the experiences of those who have actually spent time with tribal people (see, e.g., Jean Liedloff and Elizabeth Marshall Thomas)."},{"Title":"War Before Civilization","review":"This is a rare gem of a book, a triumph for common sense in scientific work.

It is very descriptive, and to the point. And as a former student of Proffessor Kelley's I must say that the success of this book comes as no surprise."},{"Title":"War Before Civilization","review":"This concise and well written book is a fine description and analysis of prestate warfare. Keeley uses the term prestate a relatively neutral language for what was formerly described as primitive or uncivilized societies (non-literate, non-urbanized, relatively low social stratification). These broad array of societies, from hunter-gatherer bands to relatively complex and sedentary tribal societies, were the norm for most of human history. Keeley is particularly concerned with attacking the highly romanticized, Rousseauist vision of peaceful prestate societies. Drawing on a wide array of ethnographic and archaeologic evidence, Keeley demonstrates that conflict and forms of warfare were vry common among prestate societies. Indeed, measured as the fraction of the populations involved, prestate warfare usually involved more social commitment and casualties than even the most destructive modern wars. As he points out, prestate wars are clearly of a piece with wars among state societies and also continuous with conflict within the simplest hunter-gatherer societies, which while lacking wars, had (by modern standards) phenomenally high homicide rates. Keeley also discusses some features that tend to promote conflicts in prestate societies, generally pointing to some commonsense conclusions, such as the presence of unusually aggressive neighbors (this seems essentially tautological) and the importance of stressful ecologic or climactic events. Keeley emphasizes both the continuity of human behavior from prestate to state societies and also the considerable variety of possible human organization."},{"Title":"War Before Civilization","review":"There are already several good reviews to this book, so I will add that I think that the professional historian and the educated layperson alike can savour it. So my rate is 5 (content) and 5 (pleasure).I also suggest reading the following books in addition to Keeley's book: 1) above all, \\"War in human civilization\\" by Azar Gat; 2) \\"How War Began\\" by Keith F. Otterbein; 3) \\"War and Peace and War: The Rise and Fall of Empires\\" by Peter Turchin; and 4) \\"The German Way of War: From the Thirty Years' War to the Third Reich\\" by Robert M. Citino."},{"Title":"War Before Civilization","review":"It's always fun to read a book that completely demolishes some widely held, uncritical belief system. This is one of those books. Many people believe that prehistoric hunter-gatherers existed in a state of primordial harmony with nature and with each other. The advent of civilization (ie - writing, economic specialization, centralized government et al), they say, put an end to the harmony and replaced it with merciless violence, endless suffering, and reprehensible inequality.Keeley demonstrates that modern civilization is unequivocally *not* more violent than primitive hunter gatherers. On the contrary, the death rates of modern foraging groups and the archeological remains of brutally slain skeletons suggest that civilization is significantly less violent than prehistoric humans. Some might object that the evidence in favor of this position has been fabricated by Western anthropologists who are intolerant towards other ways of life and who seek to glorify their own civilization. I ask such objectors to actually look at the evidence: piles of bludgeoned trophy skulls found in a cave in Germany, mass graves of skeletons with bronze spear points lodged deep in their bones, modern massacres in which one tribe surprises a group of unarmed enemies and kills them all, regardless of age or gender. The most stunning fact is that if the death rates of hunter-gatherers prevailed during the blood soaked 20th century, 2 BILLION people would died--not 100 million!!!Some might be wary of simple ratios, and insist that absolute numbers are more important than relative ones. Keeley has an ingenious response to this objection: if absolute numbers are more important to such people, then surely they would feel more comfortable receiving surgery in a tiny 3rd-world hospital than in a huge 1st-world one. The absolute number of people who die in first world hospitals is far higher (because so many more people receive treatment there), but the relative number is far lower. Yet, I don't think anyone would prefer getting surgery in a 3rd world hospital just because fewer people die there. Civilization, like modern hospitals, may generate more absolute deaths than it's primitive predecessor, but statistically it is a much safer place.This book shows that the costs of civilization--material inequality, large-scale warfare, centralized and hierarchical political authority--may be well worth the benefits."},{"Title":"War Before Civilization","review":"The book has a simple premise - primitive societies, far from being peaceful and cooperative tend to be highly violent. The perception of peace derives from the fact that \\"they\\" fight wars differently from \\"us\\" and are much smaller. He also describes the evasions that scholars use to \\"hide\\" the casualty figures of primitive warfare - namely counting war dead as \\"murders\\" because they didn't die in a good old fashioned battle the way westerners would fight.Keely deals with the different types of combat these societies tend to engage in and highlights how a society based on raids and ambushes can be as, if not more, deadly (in relative terms)than full scale modern warfare based around huge armies. In basic sum if two tribes with 50 people each fight a war and kill 10 people over a year that is a catastrophically high casualty rate for those tribes but it won't register as much for a state of 200 million people.Keely marshals an impressive array of evidence and examples and offers explanations that will make sense to people who are not anthropologists. The book is well organized and makes the solid point that \\"primitive\\" warfare isn't \\"inferior\\" warfare. It can be very effective (horribly effective in some cases) and fits the needs of these societies."},{"Title":"War Before Civilization","review":"This is a very well written, researched book, with thoughtful analysis and down to earth reasoning. Anyone who might wonder if the world is getting better or worse...will find it is much better today. Read this book and encourage your friends to give it a look. I am waiting for the authors next work. Hurry up."},{"Title":"War Before Civilization","review":"Keeley utterly demolishes the &quot;golden age&quot; idiotological mythos with hard anthropological, ethnographic and archaeological fact. He also, very cleverly to my mind, considering the biases of modern academics, gives &quot;primitives&quot; a great deal of credit for their fighting prowess. There were some flaws to his thesis, of course. But I think he gets through his point well. It also contains some great black humor, such as his recounting of a Maori chief taunting the preserved head of an enemy chief: &quot; You wanted to run away, did you? But my war club overtook you: and after you were cooked, you made food for my mouth. And where is your father? he is cooked:- and where is your brother? he is eaten:- and where is your wife? there she sits, a wife for me:- and where are your children? there they are, with loads on their backs, carrying food, as my slaves.&quot;"},{"Title":"War Before Civilization","review":"Keeley examines the history of warfare in primitive societies and argues thatpre-modern types of war are at least as destructive as warfare in modern societies. Modern war is usually regarded as more effective and more damaging to the societies in which it occurs than, but Keeley shows that in many cases primitive war is far more devastating to civilian populations, and whole societies have in fact been wiped out as a consequence of war between tribes. The evidence is gathered from a variety of geographical settings and across a number of centuries and continents. It is an interesting complement to Edgerton's Sick Socities."},{"Title":"War Before Civilization","review":"Keely discards prevailing opinion among archeologists and anthropologists that prehistoric and primitive societies were exceptionally peaceful. He argues that these societies were characterized by frequent war, raids, ambushes and homicides. War was a common cause of death in these societies. Primitive and prehistoric wars may be conducted on a small scale, but were more lethal than wars in civilized societies. Moreover, pre civilized war was total war. Victors annihilated male populations and destroyed their means of subsistence. No captives were held, because they could not be put to use. Women were taken and used as slaves. The book also deals with reasons and causes of war. Many offenses could be used as reasons for war prompting retaliation; from the abduction of women to stealing of cattle and the killing of a person by another tribe. The absence of institutions to settle differences left war as the only alternative. Moreover, victory meant the appropriation of scarce resources like land and food. Victorious populations could expand at the expense of losers. War acted as a Malthusian check on population growth in the absence of technological progress. Keeley does not stop here, but draws some fascinating parallels between modern warfare and wars in pre-civilized times."},{"Title":"War Before Civilization","review":"Wow, this really needs to be taught in schools and be required reading in Hollywood before they make another evil European entering and wrecking the utopian indian life. The subject matter of this book is well researched and covers not just North America. This book sadly proves that with free will, comes the fact that humans will kill or murder without a direct threat or need."},{"Title":"War Before Civilization","review":"This is a revisionist work criticizing what the author calls \\"the myth of the peace-loving noble savage.\\" Keeley here makes a frontal attack on the belief he finds among many anthropologists that prehistoric primitive warfare was rare and that it was usually a ritualized game with few casualties. He rebuts the tribal-zone thesis popularized by Ferguson and Whitehead's 1992 *War In the Tribal Zone*, that the warfare found in tribal societies in recent centuries was introduced only when those societies came into contact with the expansion of Europe or other \\"civilizations.\\" Keeley contends, successfully in my opinion, that warfare and violence in prehistoric bands and tribes was at least as prevalent and ruthless in the prehistoric past as after contact with expanding Europe, and that it was far more deadly than modern wars today. Keeley, an archaeology professor at University of Illinois at Chicago with a doctorate from Oxford, supports his argument with reviews of grisly archaeological evidence of ancient massacres in many areas of the world--tribal groups brutally massacring neighboring tribal groups long before there was influence from encroaching states. These primitive wars, he argues, generated homicide rates that were ten to fifty times higher than is found in any civilized societies in this century.Keeley goes beyond this thesis to philosophizing about the causes of war, whether humans are inherently violent, and how we might work for peace in the next century. I found this part of his book uninteresting; that's because as a hunter-gatherer specialist I am more interested in archaeologists enlightening me about the past, not the future, and because I am skeptical that his suggestions for peace are workable. Keeley loses me when he takes what I read as an advocacy position for a particular political order, a type of a one-world system (p. 181), a view which I suspect would cause more problems than it would solve and more human rights violations.But whether or not the reader likes Keeley's philosophical thoughts on how we might work for a more peaceful future, his archaeological review of the evidence for war in prehistory is well worth the price of the book. Keeley is at his best when he brings his readers back from any temptation to imagine that tribal life before European expansion was more idyllic and peaceful than it really was. That neo-Rousseauian tendency was popularized by neofunctionalist ideas in the 1970s and was recently crystallized by the angry reactions against the quincentennial celebrations in 1992 of Columbus's \\"glorious discovery\\" of America. If Keeley is right, prehistoric tribal people were hardly the noble savages that some anthropologists have suggested. Right or not, the book is iconoclastic, and is sure to stir up zealous debates among anthropologists and others with viewpoints about how humankind lived and treated their neighbors in prehistory.I was surprised that Keeley never mentions Edgerton's 1992 book, *Sick Societies: Challenging the Myth of Primitive Harmony*, since both books make the same point. Both Edgerton and Keeley are serious anthropologists, but both go a little further in a neo-Hobbesian direction than I am comfortable with. It is true that too many laypersons and academics visualize tribal peoples as lambs in Eden. But some anthropologists will feel that both Keeley and Edgerton may be too iconoclastic in attacking that myth. It is my hope that readers will learn from this book. For the most part, I think the shoe fits.And what is the trout in the milk? Keeley says there is no evidence that primitive tribal peoples lived more peacefully than civilized societies. Instead, he reviews lots of empirical evidence (i.e., \\"trout\\") that warfare was worse then than now. The last sentence in the book reminds us of what Thoreau said when he suspected his milkman of watering the milk: \\"Some circumstantial evidence is very strong, as when you find a trout in the milk.\\" Keeley's book is an extended exercise in finding trout in the milk.--Thomas N. Headland, anthropologist, SIL International"},{"Title":"War Before Civilization","review":"The thesis of this book is that warfare has always been an aspect of the human condition, and that it was as frequent and as deadly in Pre-historic times as in recorded history. The book relies on two types of evidence: archeological, and ethnographic. Archeological evidence can attest to the existence of warfare, not the frequency, but the distinction is lost. Another distinction not properly made is between peoples who fight defensive wars and aggressive wars. Keeley devotes entirely too much time to arguing with early 20th century scholars, and the tendency of more recent scholars to ignore evidence in order to maintain that war was primarily a function of civilization. Ironically, Keeley frequently cites a study of Yanomomo Indians, discredited by Kenneth Good's wonderful book (\\"Into the Heart ....\\"): Good did not find the aggression his mentor had declared existed. Having said all this, if the reader is willing to skim at times, this is a very interesting book It provides insight into how war was waged, the causes of war, psychology of the peoples involved, and what warfare implies as regards the human animal. It adds to the discussion on wars between primitives and Europeans found in Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book (\\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\"). Keeley makes a fascinating contrast between Indian/White conflicts in the US west vs. the Canadian west, and the causes of this difference."},{"Title":"War Before Civilization","review":"This book is highly recommended for your friends and family who think humanity was peaceful prior to civilization.

The basis of these cultures is warfare, just as the basis of U.S. society is warfare, since the society now produces no industrial products except military weapons.

Keeley thoroughly and meticulously documents that prehistoric warfare was in fact far more frequent and deadly than modern warfare between state societies. Keeley shows that prestate warriors often more than not held their own in battles against civilized armies and often defeated them. Their ultimate defeats at the hands of state societies were often more attributable to introduced diseases and the logistical superiorty of modern economies than to military strategy and tactics. One particularly illuminating passage involves a New Guinean tribal leader who after seeing an airplane for the first time, asked for a ride and then permission to take along some heavy rocks. These rocks he wanted to drop on an enemy village!! He had understood within minutes the military significance of aircraft that had eluded many generals and admirals for a generation. Some of the passages in the book make for gruesome reading, particularly the sections on cannibalism, enemy torture, and civilian massacres. Most importantly, Keeley documents how anthropologists have in his words &quot;pacified the past&quot; out of a sense of guilt over imperialism and the two world wars of the 20th century. He shows numerous examples of anthropologists and archaeologists grasping at straws to explain away unambiguous evidence of warfare at numerous sites in North America and Europe. He even points out as a young archaeologist that he also engaged in a lot of similar wishful thinking. This book should be required reading in anthropology classes throughout the world, but sadly it will probably be ignored because it challenges too many entrenched beliefs."},{"Title":"War Before Civilization","review":"Keeley utterly demolishes the \\"golden age\\" idiotological mythos with hard anthropological, ethnographic and archaeological fact. He also, very cleverly to my mind, considering the biases of modern academics, gives \\"primitives\\" a great deal of credit for their fighting prowess. There were some flaws to his thesis, of course. But this is a sort of polemic; a bludgeon with which to beat home the unarguable fact that primitive man was a violent creature; not the Rousseauean \\"noble savage\\" of popular mythology.It also contains some great black humor, such as his recounting of a Maori chief taunting the preserved head of an enemy chief: \\" You wanted to run away, did you? But my war club overtook you: and after you were cooked, you made food for my mouth. And where is your father? he is cooked:- and where is your brother? he is eaten:- and where is your wife? there she sits, a wife for me:- and where are your children? there they are, with loads on their backs, carrying food, as my slaves.\\"Humanity is ugly. The simple fact that we are unpleasant, violent apes seems to be lost on certain social classes of people. In my opinion, you can't begin to understand people without understanding that human beings are deeply flawed creatures. We are not made horrible by our social conditions, psychological trauma or any other such nonsense: humanity is just horrible. Any meaningful discussion of sociology, history or politics must start from these assumptions, or they are destructive folly."},{"Title":"War Before Civilization","review":"&quot;In the aftermath of the Battle of Little Bighorn, Indian women used marrow-cracking mallets to pound the faces of dead soldiers into pulp.&quot; - Lawrence H. KeeleyFor Lawrence Keeley, the study of prehistory (a period which, for some peoples, ended only a few dozen years ago) has been torn between two paradigms: the Hobbesian and the Rousseauian. According to the former, primitives are warlike, and need the institution of the state to put an end to the nastiness and brutishness of their lives. According to the latter, civilization is the corrupter, subverting the harmony and peacefulness of primitive life with overpopulation, greed and the encouragement of exploitative behaviour.For several decades, the Rousseauian myth has ruled academia, where swords have been &quot;beaten into metaphors&quot;: omnipresent fortifications are interpreted as expressions of &quot;the symbolism of exclusion&quot; and weapons as a form of money or status symbols, so that- to paraphrase Keeley- the obviously bellicose becomes the arcanely peaceable.But what the civilization-bashers had not counted on was that their Big Lie would ultimately be exposed by objective scientists working on the basis of incontrovertible facts: the archeologists, whose patient, reality-oriented detective work completely refutes the fashionable whitewashing of primitive peoples.What bones tell us is that wars were more common among the primitives than among modern nations, that proportionately more people were involved in them and died in them. Admittedly, those wars were waged on a smaller scale than modern man's, because primitive economies could neither support the large populations nor the impressive logistics that enable modern nations to sustain long-term and wide-ranging war efforts. But relative to their population figures, primitives are a much more violent breed than civilized men.As always, of course, statistics tell only part of the story. Just as enlightening are the picture of the corpse of a U.S. cavalryman, horribly mutilated by the Cheyenne, or the simple description of what a Tahitian warrior would do to his vanquished enemy's corpse: crush it flat with his war club, then cut a slit through it and wear it as a poncho. (Horror is mitigated by irony when one considers that, in the 18th century, &quot;the explorer Louis de Bougainville reported that Tahitians exactly fulfilled Rousseau's predictions&quot;...)*War Before Civilization* is an excellent illustration of what the application of logic to reality can do to dispel the myths woven by evaders and ideologically motivated revisionists, and so long as the author sticks to his own discipline, he shines as a beacon of perspicaciousness and objectivity. Outside of his own field, though, Keeley is less brilliant: his recommendations for the preservation of peace in our age (such as compromising with our enemies or letting foreign powers monopolize resources we could produce ourselves) are examples of fallacious induction; his choice of Hobbes as the antithesis of Rousseau creates an unsavory alternative between two proponents of absolute power (which is all the more regrettable as Locke would have served the author's purposes just as well); and his endorsement of the theory that &quot;real&quot; war is total war makes him mistake the moral constraints of civilized warfare for a lack of realism or even inefficiency. As for his analysis of the causes of the academic distortion of the prehistorical record, it would have benefited from a familiarity with Ayn Rand's Objectivism, and Gross and Levitt's debunking of the academic left in *Higher Superstition*.If you are the kind of person who always feels compelled to put such words as &quot;civilized&quot; and &quot;primitive&quot; in quotes, Lawrence Keeley's book is the best therapy I can think of, along with Robert B. Edgerton's *Sick Societies* and Ayn Rand's *Return of the Primitive*."},{"Title":"War Before Civilization","review":"In an era where cooperation, compassion and empathy are touted as neglected, even denied, aspects of human behavior, it is refreshing to have someone point out in vivid detail that humans are neither intrinsically violent nor non-violent but that our prehistoric past is littered with evidence of some pretty nasty behavior. Frans de Waal would have our monkey heritage rife with empathy in contrast to what he felt had been a universal portrayal of humans as just another species in the war of one against all.The Age of Empathy: Nature's Lessons for a Kinder SocietyThe Dalai Lama sees us as intrinsically compassionate. Now Keely bludgeons us with the evidence that prehistoric folk may have been proportionately more violent than the Nazi's or the US in Vietnam. Those ancestors of ours engaged in warfare and did it with all the vigor their fragile productive systems and hand-held weapons allowed them. Example after example of archeological and recent anthropological evidence are presented of slaughter, torture, resource devastation, slavery, etc. and the proportion of victims was much higher than in modern warfare.Prehistoric folk exercised tactical planning, invasion, denial of sustenance, all the practical aspects of war. The greatest difference between then and now is that they did it in more frequent and shorter encounters and they did not engage in warfare to dominate another people as tax farmers for food, male producers or canon fodder. They killed their male enemies right away or took them home to be tortured and maybe consumed. The extent to which captives were used as food is not clear. There were some societies, maybe the Aztecs for which this was the case. He doesn't mention New Guinea or the Solomon Islands for which this has been claimed for the recent past. Because captive males could not be controlled by small societies, they were eliminated. Western conquerors professed outrage at this but then they could afford to imprison and feed prisoners. They were also horrified at primitives' mutilation of opposing casualties but thought nothing about similarly destroying whole villages at night and burning their sources of sustenance. And, as the colonists in Eastern North America illustrated, latent imperialists became as much adept at taking scalps as their supposedly barbaric opponents. There was no lack of murder and enslavement of native women and children on frontiers.Prehistoric fighters also tried to avoid set piece battles, or did them briefly, preferring what amounted to guerilla warfare. In fact the author claims that modern armies can not win guerilla warfare without engaging in similar tactics, frequently recruiting natives to fight natives. And the bow may have been more powerful than the gun before rifling made things more accurate. It is interesting that I don't remember the author using the word genocide. For genocide was certainly practiced prehistorically. The numbers involved were simply much smaller. A raid at night could easily kill all the males of one tribe or clan, and surviving women and children would live out their lives among people whose language was different.When you think about it, the horrors of modern war experienced by the victims may have been no less horrible than having one's village or camping place swept into and destroyed, witnessing husbands and grown boys tortured and slowly killed, being raped and maybe mutilated and then being enslaved with one's children being distributed to others as slaves. Your world, though much smaller than say Byelo Russia during WWII , was destroyed more thoroughly than the damage seesawing armies of Germany and the Soviet Union visited upon the land and people of Byelo Russia. We see the latter as more violent because the total number is much much greater and it is (so to speak) us on whom it was visited, but actually proportionately much less damage was done. The German's mowed down hundreds of thousands with guns, shuffled a similar number into gas chambers and planned to work and starve the rest to death. They never got that far but prehistoric people did. Where is empathy in it all? Biologically empathy is only for our in-group, universal compassion seems oddly missing.Keeler claims that things like trade and intermarriage usually made matters worse because many conflicts about these led to warfare. The only exemption seems to have been when exchange involved products that neighbors could (or would) not make. This led to a kind of stability because destroying your neighbors also destroyed the goose that laid the golden egg. There were some pacific peoples, but few, and many of them were defeated peoples who lacked the power to strike out.Keeler tries to explain the difference between US violence towards Indians and its rarity in Canada. He sees it as a function of an even handed legal order in the west preceding occupation in Canada and the reverse south of the border. Certainly had the British in the 13 colonies and the Federalists after the revolution had their way white/Indian relationships might have been different. But the shear population density of the early US created a tidal wave never achieved north of the border. The Indian-as-trapper-white-as-buyers relationship of early commerce collapsed southward as both frontiersmen, white trappers, speculators and farmers kept pushing westward in spite of some attempts to control them. William Clark of Lewis and Clark fame, as Indian Agent in St. Louis, was a paradigm of the contradictions. He both made meager attempts to protect Indians west of the Mississippi and invested in their undoing. In Canada Hudson Bay and the crown kept conflict more under control.Although I was often impressed by the sophistication of many of Keeley's sweeping statements, I was somewhat troubled by his analysis of the rise of the anthropological view that primitives were not warlike. He sees it as a reaction to the violence of WWII and the A bomb. In revulsion to civilized violence and the vanishing of traditional peoples anthropologists sought hope for humanity by seeing our predecessors as people who lived without war. To me this seems too simple.Similarly his comments about military historians seeing total war as inventions of Grant and Sherman opens a can of worms. \\"Primitive warfare is simply total war conducted with very limited means,\\" which I agree with. It was the greater productive capacity of the West along with its diseases and pests that allowed it to dominate native peoples, not so much its superiority in arms. The author claims that lack of recognition of the ancientness of total warfare led military strategists to fight wars as games of chess leading to indecisive outcome among which he claims were the Crusades, the 100 year and 30 year wars. This claim raises lots of questions. Charles and Phillip of Spain gibbeted, burned and disemboweled with the best of them in the Lowlands. de Soto rampaging from Florida to the Mississippi was able to frighten his enemies and survive for an amazingly long time because of his armor, the sharpness of his swords, his attack dogs, his horses and, above all, his ruthlessness. At any point his indigenous enemies had the resources and the manpower to overwhelm him. Nonetheless, he almost got away with it.Although my comments may be a little disjointed, I found the book challenging and sometimes very depressing. I would have like to have found more of the world that preceded civilizations somewhat more harmless and I suppose you could say they were in terms of ability to destroy their environment and peoples distant from them. The same limitations of resources and organization which made their conflicts shorter also meant that the damage was much more local. If your village was the one that was attacked that might be of little consolation to you but at least the violence was not so universal.Has the world become more peaceful? It doesn't seem so. Who would choose to be collateral damage in Iraq or Afghanistan. Who would choose to live in Eastern Congo, Gaza, The Colombian jungle, Kashmir, Chechnya, etc., etc.? This book will really get you thnking. The author has done a great service.Charlie Fisher author of Dismantling Discontent: Buddha's Way Through Darwin's World"},{"Title":"War Before Civilization","review":"Although extremely poorly edited, this slim volume represents a revolution in understanding early human history.The received wisdom in cultural ethnology is that true war was unknown to our species before the advent of so-called civilization. Not so; this book draws upon archeological and comparative ethnological data to show persuasively that bloody war has been a constant in human development up until the latter half of the twentieth century. Indeed, despite advancements in the technology of slaughter, and despite the cataclysmic events of the two world wars, on average the likelihood of death in battle has never, at any point in human evolution, been lower than during the current century.Much of the book is dedicated to an analysis of pre-civilization battle tactics (i.e., tribal tactics as observed during the modern period, ancient descriptions of tribal adversaries, inferences from the archeological record), and of their comparison with the methodologies of modern warfare. Keeley takes great pains to \\"defend\\" pre-civilization warfare as equally deadly and even \\"total\\" as any modern campaign.Overall, this is fine scholarship, and important reading for anyone seeking to understand human culture or the conditions of human evolution."},{"Title":"War Before Civilization","review":"This book has a lot going for it. The style in which it is written may appeal to a broad audience as well as specialists. It puts lengthier, more technical discussions in notes at the back of the book and makes its points short and sweet (about 180 pages of text). The format of contrasting views of human violence by way of Rousseau and Hobbes is effective and carried throughout. Ethnographic and archeological examples are both fascinating and well chosen. These examples gain even more in interest when discussed in certain aspects of war, e.g. weaponry and fortifications. There are several ways in which this book is wanting, however. It employs a dichotomy throughout between &quot;civilized&quot; and &quot;primitive&quot; war. These words deserve to go the way of an inaccurate musket; more relevantly, they mask an acknowledged continuum of warfare. For example, a table in the appendix shows that hunter-gatherers engage in war less often than other &quot;primitive&quot; societies, such as pastoralists. It makes more sense to understand the variance in warfare among all societies than create an artifical dichotomy, despite its usefulness as an organizing theme for the book, between civilized and primitive warfare. The other major weakness of the book is its lack of a good definition of &quot;war&quot;. The author overemphasizes economic motivations in primitive warfare at expense to blood revenge, wife stealing, etc. It isn't clear whether small-scale raiding in the form of blood revenge gets counted as &quot;war&quot; among primitive societies; it shouldn't be if it involves but a wronged man and a couple of his allies raiding. More precise descriptors such as &quot;raiding&quot; should thus be used. Most readers will still find the bold and blunt exposition as well as subject matter outweighs these weaknesses. Bid farewell to paradise."},{"Title":"War Before Civilization","review":"Although Keeley dispels the myth of the peaceful savage, by recounting its universality amongst all the peoples of the populated continents, this book offers much more. He succinctly describes, along with substantial empirical evidence, and mitigated by a healthy dose of skepticism about archaeological and anthropological findings, the fundamental aspects of warfare, and human beings, in both civilized and primitive societies.Keeley's other main argument is that warfare is a function of society; indeed, quoting Turney-High, \\"Warfare is social organization\\" (p. 47). It is society's features, its population size and density, economy and social system, which determine the various natures and limits of military warfare. Sophisticated battle strategies and multitudes of complex weaponry should not be used to assess the intellectual capacity of a society's inhabitants. Indeed, time and time again, primitive warfare has defeated civilized warfare. Only when population size and logistics (the capability and means to provide food, ammunition, men, and any other resources) are brought into the picture do the civilized states, or any other societies, have a triumphant advantage. Not wanting to dehumanize the constant cruel warring of primitive societies, which he discusses in explicit detail, Keeley mentions that warriors were not awarded the highest statuses in their societies. Indeed, such warriors were considered to be polluted by their kills; and so they needed to be purged before re-entering their tribes (pp. 144-147). And like civilized societies, peace is a difficult enterprise for all societies regardless of their sophistication: the supposed mitigants of war, intermarriage and trade, are actually irritants that are more likely induce war, as modern history has also shown.Ultimately this is Keeley's fundamental thesis, that primitive peoples are as human as the citizens of modern states. To assign them the qualities of the \\"peaceful\\" savage, wistfully lost to modern man, is to deny them the same humanity as when they are called \\"bloodthirsty\\" savages."},{"Title":"War Before Civilization","review":"This is one of the more important books of recent years, persuasively dispelling the myth that non-technological societies possess an innocence and a devotion to peace that modern societies lack. Based on solid research, this book counters the popular contention that the introduction of Western values and customs tends to destroy the purported tranquility of primitive life. All students of history, particularly those inclined to view Western culture as inherently inferior to the cultures of Rousseau's &quot;noble savages,&quot; ought to read this book. An outstanding work."},{"Title":"War Before Civilization","review":"For anyone looking for a good basis of evidence to combat myths of a serene and blissful prehistory, this book will not disappoint. However, what recommends it so highly is the author's admission that he, too, participated in what he calls the \\"pacification of the past,\\" but as an archaeologist he was forced to re-examine his assumptions about primitive peoples in light of so much hard evidence that proves our ancestors were just as likely to engage in violent disputes as \\"civilized\\" people have been.Keeley is no war hawk, looking for easy justifications for war. In fact, he seems genuinely troubled by the evidence at times, and makes the point that if humans want to find ways to end war, lying to themselves about history and pre-history isn't going to produce the answers. Based on his analysis of prehistorical warfare and historical warfare, his conclusions are troublingly statist and seem to lean toward a \\"one-world government\\" scenario, though he offers some general observations about ways to avoid war.Keeley presents his case engagingly, and this book should be accessible enough for any layman. His colorful anecdotes about primitive societies may appeal to those with a dark sense of humor.Because so much of the book involves dispassionately comparing the war motives and methods of primitive societies to the corresponding aspects of civilized war-making, the book could also serve as a good primer for anyone beginning a general study of warfare."},{"Title":"War Before Civilization","review":"It has been some years since I read this book, but having come across it again by chance recalled the impact it made on my first reading. Forgive any flaws in my memory of the details, but this is what I have carried with me from &quot;War Before Civilization.&quot; If you adhere to the concept of the 'peaceful savage,' the book may offend you. If you believe in a past 'golden age' where life was simple and carefree compared to the present, you will likely dismiss this book. If you think life now is harder and more dangerous than it was in the past, you will not get much out of this read. If you are sure that primitive societies lived long, healthy, safe lives in harmony with the environment and at peace with one another, then stay in your bubble and skip this book. Keeley does not carry the guilt many today feel regarding the destruction of &quot;primitive&quot; cultures and societies. Archaeology and statistics more than sociology and anthropology form the basis of Keeley's conclusions (if I recall correctly). To summarize: people are violent regardless of the era, and more so when resources are scarce, meaning modern technology makes more resources available now than were available 'Before Civilization.' Modern science allows people to live healthier and longer now than in the past - i.e. probably very few people died from Alzheimer's or cancer in primitive societies because hardly anyone lived long enough to acquire these diseases, regardless of what the causes today are (old age, diet, genes, pollution, whatever). Sure, more people today die in armed conflict than did 'Before Civilization', but as a percentage of the whole, the numbers today are no worse, if not better, than in the past. In addition, the losses today are more easily survived by the whole, as there are more people to start with in a modern society (which doesn't do the individual dead any good, but that's not the point). And while killing methods today are both faster and more efficient, healing and recovery from non-fatal wounds has also improved (e.g. gangrene vs. penicillin). Now if you were one of the people who survived broken bones, avoided impacted wisdom teeth or the need for a root canal, recovered from injuries, always had proper clothing and shelter regardless of the weather, had abundant and consistent nutrition without access to a grocery store or vitamins or your backyard garden, had no allergic reactions to anything, reproduced with ease, skipped any birth defects, resisted all those nasty viruses, bacterial infections, and festering wounds, then you might have lived long enough to meet your grandchildren. It definitely would have been a 'Golden Age' for you and you alone, but doesn't that same thing apply to any era? With that kind of good fortune, you probably would have been running things in a primitive society just by outliving everybody else. And while any complaints we today have about the imperfections of modern 'Civilization' may be legitimate, &quot;War Before Civilization&quot; makes it abundantly clear that, ultimately, complaining is a luxury."},{"Title":"Nobody's Business","review":"Nobody's Business is everybody's business!

The characters were so realistic and you could relate to each peron's personality. The title accurately states how most victims, survivors, and batterers feel about this epidemic in our community. It's &quot;Nobody Business&quot; yet almost everyone knows someone or is experiencing a domestically violent relationship. Although it is a Fiction writing, it can be used to teach others how the staff and volunteers can get caught up in this cycle, too! A good read!!!

Rebecca \\"keeps it real\\", dealing with issues such as alcoholism and substance abuse, jealousy, insecurity, sibling rivalry and sexual abuse. What I liked about the book is that we are often so afraid to reveal what has happened in our past because we're afraid of what people will think of us. Every American family is dysfunctional in some way, and through her character of Clara, Simmons shows that healing does begin when one faces one's past. In order for us to be healthy and productive adults, we indeed need to face and resolve past issues. But how many of us are willing to take the painful step of exposing our past? All too often these things block us from achieving the greatness we all have within. Clara is so human and so real we can see her in all of us. How many times have you told the love of your life to go when you really wanted him/her to stay? How often have you thought your Mom loved your sister more than you? Or how often have you thought you weren't right for your job but you didn't quit that job? Talk about identifying! And that is what makes us like a character -- when we can empathize with her and travel with her emotionally. I loved seeing Clara's growth as a character. I am eager to see what other treasures this author has for us.

While the books primary focus is on relationships, the inclusion of Godly principles brought out a great message and worked wonderfully in the plot. We all struggle from time to time with ourselves and the main theme present in this book is to love yourself first and foremost. When we learn to look after ourselves, we're a better help and comfort to others. As a first novel, Ms. Simmons' book has left a lasting impression on me and I see potential for greater works incorporating the same themes.Clara works as a psychologist at a women's crisis shelter. She is involved in a relationship with Jason, who loves her dearly and has asked her to marry him. She has refused, even though she loves him, because she has decided that she never wants to marry or have children. This understandably causes a rift in their relationship but they struggle to hang on. The stress of Clara's job and non-addressed issues of her past threaten to destroy Clara as well as her relationship with Jason. She's taken to drinking to drown painful memories and actions. She feels that her work at the shelter isn't effective, that she's not reaching her clients. Her mother is an alcoholic and her older sister has coupled booze with drugs to bury the painful sting of her past. On the outside Clara is listening and providing counsel to people who need to talk about their problems, while on the inside she is need of counsel. As her world spirals downward she decides to seek help for herself. Enters Justine, Clara's counselor. Justine is laid back, casual and very open to discussing things at Clara's pace. The only requirement is that God be central to any advice given. The bible is the instruction manual by which the counseling center operates and Justine prays for and with each of her clients.The plot thickens. Clara teeters on the edge of sanity when her mother is hospitalized near death, her sister is out of control, an old flame comes back into her life after Jason removes himself, and her clients are sinking deeper into their problems - her only hope is to turn to the Savior. Never a religious woman, Clara finds solace in her choice to give her life to Christ and she finds comfort in continued counseling sessions with Justine. Uncovering her past, and finding that her past is tied to a client of hers that has a split personality, talking about what she's always considered to be Nobody's Business is helping her climb out of the pit of despair that her life is in. As Clara discovers painful truths about her childhood, she becomes supportive to others. As she learns more about herself, she is able to share more with others and take her own advice."},{"Title":"Nobody's Business","review":"The author's brilliant story of a crisis counselor struggling with her own personal issues, took me through a range of emotions; from intrigue, anger, happiness, to compassion.

Many times we choose to wear a mask because we are trying to maintain our reputations, because of how other people are going to perceive us if we confess that &quot;excuse me, I need some help also!&quot;, or because of the fear of backlash. Clara has opened up the door for women to feel safe and motivated to seek out help from others when they need it. Bravo!!!I am eager to read the authors next book. I know that if she was this successful with her first novel, I can just imagine what we are in store for with the next. Keep writing, you have an audience who needs to hear.

This book offers a number of essays, Q&A; with praticing educators, and a few syllabi. This book consists of 40 or so brief pieces. That's way too many for any one voice ot dominate, but certainly covers a wide range of views and practices. There are a few minor gems here, including discussions of the unique needs of Hebrew and Arabic, and about the 'voice' of a printed text. There's no organized bibliography here, but the careful reader will be rewarded with a good long list of titles, some of which are sure to be unfamiliar.Though by no means unanimous, there was wide agreement that hand-work exercises, using physical media, are helpful or necessary for understanding what computerized systems are doing. I have to agree. If nothing else, computer users have a tendency to treat the quirks and oddities of their chosen software as laws of nature. This inflexibility stands in sharp contrast to most students' use of ink, paper, and all the rest, where their goal is to push the medium to its limit or beyond. Because they have no way to adapt the software tools to their concepts, they constrain their concepts to the tools, sometimes unknowingly. Users of physical media may at least have the vision to see beyond those limits.The practicing typographer won't find much to relate to here, except a formal statement of what was probably done to her in the classroom. This book is about training educators, not about training the practitioners themselves, so there is very little discussion of the concrete design issues.This book has a rather narrow intended audience: type educators. Others (like me) can still read it, and still get some measure of insight into typography and typographers.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"The Education of a Typographer","review":"It's important to learn the elements of type before embarking on an exploration of graphic design: that's what makes Steven Heller's The Education Of A Typographer so important.

Footwear is an area that seems to be the most neglected when attempting to re-create a costume from a past era. For those who strive for accuracy in putting together the perfect historical outfit, or even if you just have an interest in shoes in general, this book fits the bill. Wonderful, colorful photos, a highly readable text detailing the history of the crazy world of footwear--the book covers everything involved with shoes and answers most questions the reader may have. From the grotesque to the mundane, we are presented with styles that run the gamut from shoes of leather and iron (ouch!) to platform soles of 12 inches or more. What is surprising is that some styles are still with us today, modernized but still very recognizable. We also learn the painful lengths that people will go for the sake of fashion. Time has changed nothing in this regard, as we still wobble around on stilleto heels and end up with bunions, corns or worse--but we still look marvelous, darling!!! Seriously, if you love to learn about footwear, like to dress in period attire, or are simply a \\"shoe freak\\", don't hesitate to buy this book.

Mathabane is very detail-oriented, interesting, specific, and descriptive about his experiences during the fateful Apartheid in South Africa and how he managed to deal with it. I had felt terribly sorry for what his family and he had to go through during the difficult sitations in South Africa. It is unfortunate and there is no doubt that he and others suffered from the negative effects of racial, ethnic, and social class discrimination. It is unfair that Mathabane's family had to deal with poverty, hunger, and a poor standard of living for no reason other than prejudice and discrimination against them. It is interesting but disturbing to read about how people had been ridiculously capable of harming the lives of other innocent people who were normal human beings just like them. I believe that it is amazing that he has been able to find ways in improving his life. I am also pleased about Mathabane's motivation and drive to overcome the barriers in his life by seeking interest in education and pursuing an exciting career. This book has certainly helped me be more appreciative of my own life and what I have. It has also taught me to be persistent in accomplishing my goals as well. I just can't imagine how pleasant life in this world would be and how at ease we would all feel if it was not for inequality. I am surely glad that my professor had my classmates and I read this book about Mathabane's life. Regardless of how much life knocks you down, please find a way to get yourself standing up again!"},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"I read this as part of my study abroad to South Africa. I did not even know such a thing as Apartheid existed until I read this book. What startled me most is that Apartheid had only collapsed in 1994.It was altogether disturbing yet interesting to learn about a child's life so marred by hardship. Mark Mathabane grows up living in a true ghetto. By comparison to the U.S., a ghetto here would seem like paradise to a South African under Apartheid. As such, there is many truly disgusting scenarios that the author went through as a child.For those interested in what life was like during Apartheid, I would strongly recommend this book for it gives the most brutally honest point of view from the black majority of South Africa."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"This book was a sad depiction of what real life was like for a young boy living poor in south Africa! I loved it!"},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"Kaffir Boy is a jaw-dropping, true account of a black boy's life growing up in apartheid South Africa. The magnitude of this boy's stuggles and the conditions which he grew up in are unbelieveable, but there is little doubt that they are accurate and true. This book will take you deeper into the effects of apartheid than you probably ever knew.Mathabane tells his story straight-up, not holding anything back; even revealing the most embarrassing details of his family life. The story is well written and, as you experience his life along with him, the book grips you from beginning to end just as he is caught in the apartheid system.Though mostly sad, the story has uplifting moments as Mathabane learns to overcome his fears and learn to survive and succeed against all odds. Even more amazing is that his ticket out was thru playing tennis of all things! So, if you are a tennis fan, you will really enjoy hearing how he came to love and excel at the sport.This book clearly shows why apartheid and any form of slavery, prejudice, or imposed inequality is detrimental and harmful to society."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"Kaffir Boy is a remarkable book. About Mark Mathabane. It is an honest and open story of his life in Apartheid South Africa. In this book, the reader is taken into a journey though his life in his recount.

Though certain aspects of Mark's life are shocking, they only help to give you a better understanding of the environment in which he lived and make Mark Mathabane human.. This deep and moving story is not only easy to read, it is also full of things to learn about.It ranks with Disciples of Fortune, Cry The Beloved Country, Triple Agent Double Cross, In the Country of Men, as boks on Africa with a depth that I enjoyed and respected."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"I recently read \\"Kaffir Boy\\" by Mark Mathabane, a true interesting autobiography story base of the brutal horror laws of Apartheid in South Africa and about Mr. Mathabane struggles and enthusiasm to overcome his dream, to be someone in life. I was sock, when I was reading this book for all the unjust laws that were apply to black Africans. Mr. Mathabane shows us the atrocities he lived through his childhood and his family in Alexandra, South Africa. First of all, he show us how non-whites were threaded like un-human beings, discriminated by whites, poverty among black community, lock of freedom, starvation, living in small shakes, and not having equal rights. I was so unaware of the hardships that black South Africa was living. I admired Mr. Mathabane for his encouragement of seeking a better life. Although he was living difficult circumstances with his family and having endless struggles to accomplish his goal, he was able to accomplish his dream such as, finishing school with a high gpa and obtaining a scholarship to study tennis in America and have freedom. Also, for never being led by bad influence, to always having his mind in continuing progressing in life. This incredibly interesting book had open my eyes to a new world that I had never knew it existed. He changes my point of view of never give up my dreams, always fight to succeed. This book really got into me, I couldn't put the book down once I was reading it and I did not even notice I was already reading the last page. I really recommend this book to all people that want to have knowledge of an important history of South Africa. If you want to know an incredible person that did everything to accomplish his goal, you should read this incredible book. I'm sure you'll like it!"},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"This is apartheid through the lucid eyes of a young, intelligent black boy. It seems more authentic perhaps because it is not seen through white lens, because although many white South Africans may have detested apartheid, they could not have felt it like the black South Africans did.This book makes one wonder why movies like CRY FREEDOM lionized a white South African while over-looking the thousands of everyday heroes in the black community. People who lived from day to day under a system that saw them as sub-human, as unworthy of simple common decency.The prose is fluid and immediate and the story is, thankfully, full of a pure, beautiful human anger and a keen desire to truthfully reflect a devastated people and community. Mathabane does not shy away, either, from indicting the black elite in addition to the white oppressors.This book is an example of The System overcoming The Person. Sometimes it is impossible for that \`pulling yourself up by your bootstraps' idea to work because in many ways, we can excel largely only as much as the system under which we live allows us to. Also, a system can, by depriving people of dignity, turn them, like Mathabane's father and thousands of other black men, into the Living Dead."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"I found the book to be well written and incredibly interesting. Being a black person myself, though i haven't been through intense racism like Mark Mathabane, I found the book extremely descriptive of the effects \\"white supremacy\\" has on the lives of blacks. The lack of black teenagers having the passion to go to college and get involved in society in some successful way is just one of the many effects. I also loved reading about the perseverance Mark had throughtout his life such as dealing with his father's ignorance, being punished school for lack of money to pay for supplies and being a black tennis player just to name a few. Mark's attitude of never giving up, which was taught to him by his mother, is exactly how i feel about my own personal life; the struggle makes a person stronger and wiser. I would recommend that a person who may consider reading this book to be prepared to bread graphic the details of a life of a black person in South America."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"Great words. Wonderful plot. Awesome characterization. All of these things can be found in Mark Mathabanes exciting autobiography, Kaffir Boy. This autobiography combines the vileness of South African apartheid and one young lad?s struggle for freedom with astonishing results. Kaffir Boy takes an aggressive look into the wickedness of apartheid and the ravishing affects it can take on the future in an engaging manner that lures the reader into the plot.Within Kaffir Boy, the plot blossoms through magnificent character development, guided by Mark. The story is encapsulated within an autobiography format- as the characters grow, so does the plot- as shown when Mark first realizes apartheid, and the detrimental effect it has on black society. By showing this truth, the reader has the opportunity to look into the world of a black South African drowning in the havoc of apartheid. The honest viewpoint shared an unbiased hope of life that kept the reader hooked. Along with this, Mark and his family build on to the story with details from daily life and family tradition. It really opened up a new viewpoint of world cultures as I felt myself being drawn into the characters lives, struggles and achievements. The character development in Kaffir Boy was a flawless, exciting addition to this book.Along with character development, Mark's true life story unfurls through the plot a wicked twist on your feelings, emotions and beliefs that will make your morals shout out from the sidelines. The events in this book that I liked the least were the racism shown to the blacks in South Africa. The ways blacks were treated throughout this work really gave me a culture shock. Although the white's actions were horrible, Mark's actions and the persistent drive behind them shone like a candle in the night, as a hero in a sorrow filled world. The event that I liked the best was when Mark was freed of the bonds of apartheid through his talents and hard work, the theme was shown strongly through his actions and I admire his die-hard attitude. Also, the motif was very encouraging and kept me hooked. The plot of Kaffir Boy was exciting and will keep any reader thirsting for more.So is Kaffir Boy a bright work or boring bummer? I encourage you to read this fabulous book and decide for yourself. Kaffir Boy astonished me with new viewpoints and aspects within the menacing world of apartheid. Make sure you add this five- star choice to your bookshelf- Kaffir Boy."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"In an era of political correctness and overly sensitive focus groups, it is refreshing to read an honest rendition of a person's point of view.Mr. Mathabane has created a simple, honest and brutally accurate description of Apartheid South Africa. He pulls no punches in his descriptions of life in the townships of S.A. and you will finish this book with a heavy heart. Yet, he tells the story with such honesty and sincerity that you do not feel as though you have been to a political rally when you turn the final page.Very few books of this ilk manage to portray these sort of situations so accurately and with such plain language. As you read the book you are transported to his family's small shack and you feel the fear he felt when the 'sweeps' would take place. You can hear the angry cries of the mobs of children and feel the desperation that he must have felt.Despite the horrid conditions imposed by the government the positive side of human nature shines through. The goodness of some of the white community and their desire to help this young man makes a huge difference in his life. The author's positive attitude allows him to make the assertion that people as individuals are good at heart.The message that socialization, economic deprivation and government repression create evil in people shines through in this narrative. But the author's honesty and success shows that human perseverence and hope can overcome all obstacles."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"A truly heartwrenching tale of what life was like growing up under the oppressive system of apartheid in South Africa.

When I first started reading the book I felt like I was reading a work of science-fiction, not an auto-biography. The horrible life that Black South Africans had to endure is hard to comprehend. I cannot believe that a system was set up to so thoroughly break people down, and that most people in the country didn't know what was going on. And this wasn't during a time of war, this was a way of life. So horrible. This book made me cry but I also couldn't put it down. Now I'll have to buy the sequel and also try to learn more about apartheid."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"I first read Mr. Mathabane's story as part of the Reader's Digest Condensed book in the 1980s and was thrilled to find it again in its entirety.Mark tells of the vicious legacy of hatred inflicted by racism upon South African citizens, and the struggle against his own culture, especially his father's insistence that he cling to old tribal ways despite Mark's and his mother's knowledge that education was the way out of poverty.Mark found both an outlet for his frustrations and an escape to a better life through tennis, and the reader will cheer his triumph as he becomes the first black South African to attend college in America on a tennis scholarship. Equally inspiring is the strength and character of his mother, whose courage and determination to gain a better life for her children almost steals the story from her son.

The Story is told from the perspective of Mark Mathabane when he is a young boy all the way up until he is a fully grown man. Mark Mathabane in his autobiography tells the story of what it is like to overcome true poverty in this story which at many times is sad and depressing, while at other times can make one laugh and smile. While reading this book one will go through a roller coaster of emotions, which will make you never weant to put down this book.The main reason I liked this book was because of the perspective it was told in, which is of course the first person perspective. What this does for the book is it make it very belivable, because you know that everything that happened in the book is true and it wasn't just though up by some author who never experienced what South Africa was really like. And the other this this does for the book is it maked is so much more detailed. Mark Mathabane make is so that the readon knows almost every detail so you can better understand the situation that is occuring in the novel. I belive the only bad thing about this book would be that some of the scenes in the book seemed like they were un-needed. One example of this would be the part of the book where a raping occures, and there are many other scenes like this in the book. But what I think Mark Mathabane is trying to do is just to help the reader better understand the situation he was in. In closing I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is trying to learn about South Africa uner the Apartide because the book gives you a really great understanding of what it was really like."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"Mr. Mathabane makes a part of history something personal. I was criminally unaware of Apartheid, except in a vague sense, and Mr. Mathabane let me see it from the inside out. I don't think I'll look at things quite the same ever again. Kaffir Boy gave me a renewed appreciation for what I have, for what I can be, and for what I've been given.Mathabane's style is eloquent in its simplicity, and stark without being vulgar, no matter how vulgar the situation.The true worth of an author is to affect their reader. I defy anyone to read Kaffir Boy and not be affected. This is no light read, to be sure, not a bedtime story for the kiddies, but it is a lesson in history, a journey of the heart, and a saga of hope and faith. In total, it is an incredibly &quot;human&quot; work."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"I have never in my life felt so unaware of the world that I live in. The book intitled &quot;Kaffir Boy&quot; gave me an inside look to a world that I never even knew had existed. From the very first scriptures I was already being revealed to the unreal truths of life in S. Africa as a black boy. The boy in this book lets you know all about how it was growing up in the ghetto of Alexandrea. With the police brutality that was going on in his cummunity, he and his family had become acustumed to living as a 4th class citizen in their own homeland. The Aparthied government in South Africa prohibited any non-white person from leaving the ghetto without having a pass in order. If you were black and you were stopped in the city by a police officer without your pass in order, you would be arrested. His father was in the city one day looking for a new job when he got arrested for being outside of the ghetto and his pass said he was unemployed. In the eyes of the law it was a major offense if a black man was unemployed.From nothing, he was forced to make something. His mother was the biggest motivation he ever needed to get by. It was his mother who first put him into school even thought his father didn't beleive education was important. But with an education he was able to take his life and turn it around for the good. He became more aware as he grew older that without this education his mother was trying so hard to feed to him, he would never be able to realize his biggest dreams and goals. His grandmother worked for a white lady who had a son of her own. When his grndmother came home with more and more books for him to read, he began to love the Enlgish language.As more time passed on and the more knowledge he gained he was also getting closer and closer to his dream. His dream was to one day be set free from the Apartheid laws but he knew now that if he ever wanted to be free it would most likely not be in his home country of S. Africa. With a full scholarship granted to him because of his outstanding work through out his first years of school, he was able to go placed he had never imagined of going to. Now that he had seen passed his short horizon, he set his goals to an even bigger dream. He was preparing himself for the most unexpected pilgrimage his kind had ever taken before."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"Kaffir Boy by Mark Mathabane was definitely a revelation to all the injustices that occurs in South Africa. It is hard for one to imagine that events such as police raids and people dying from poverty occur on daily basis. Even more shocking for me was realizing that the basic amenities I take for granted, are things they depend on for survival. This story for some may be depressing, yet we have to remember this is real life. To me this story was inspiring. It reminded me that if you work hard enough for your dreams and you do not let anyone dissuade you from them, you could accomplish them. Marks strength and will power is admirable. Through him, we relearn that education is the key to a better life. Overall, this book touched me deeply. With it's controversial issues and life experiences. This book is one that everyone should read and it should definitely be at the top of everyone's reading list."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"Kaffir Boy by Mark Mathabane is truly a compellingly authentic biography. Mark and his fourth class family grew up in Alexandra, South Africa and this is his remarkable memoir of life under apartheid there. This terrifying story describes his struggle to survive under poverty and inhumane conditions, with a tormented father who would beat him for not listening to tribal ways, and a mother set on educating Mark no matter what the sacrifice.When Mark discovers tennis his world turns around. Practicing everyday, he still manages to be the top student in his class. Mark would have never guessed that playing tennis would fulfill his dream about going to America, but when American people hear about Mark they are willing to pay his fees to go there as well as college tuition.This biography describes a black person's life so well and from a different perspective. Since I have only read books about Africans through white people's eyes, I have never really understood the pain blacks went through under the system of apartheid. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in an important piece of African history, and a truly remarkable story of a survivor."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"Mark Mathabane does a remarkable job explaining the worst nightmares a young black boy from South Africa can face.

It's an Arabic word, not African.\\"Kaffir Boy\\" is a very heartwarming yet simultaneously a heartbreaking true saga of a little mischievous, inquisitive little boy who grows up in the slums of Alexandra, South Africa. He witnesses and feels the atrocities perpetrated by the apartheid system upon him and his family. He survives the cruel and callous hardships of being very poor, the pangs of hunger, dilapidated shacks he knows as home and the fear of being left alone to fend for himself and his siblings if his parents are arrested because they don't possess the \\"proper\\" identification to the authorities in the midst of night. Inwardly, he doesn't surrender to this systemic, unjust way of life and proves it by fearlessly participating in the June, 1976 Soweto student uprising that tragically ended in many deaths courtesy of the South African Police.Yet he survives all the hardships and earns an oppty. to come to America and to continue to realize his dream.I'm nearly the same age as Mark Mathabane, but I've never heard of him. I may be wrong but I don't think he has spoken publicly at symposiums or seminars about the apartheid situation he left in the late 70's in South Africa. I never read about his plight in magazines, newspapers, or even seen him play in tennis matches.I'm happy for him but I think he should have been a little more vocal like the other black athletes such as: Jim Brown, Muhammad Ali, Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Arthur Ashe. America has its share of racial inequities also, and I'm sure he experienced it while here.Apartheid, in my opinion, still exists throughout the world although it has been benignly \\"swept under the table\\"."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"Kaffir Boy, by Mark Mathabane, is the story of Johannas and his very interesting and inspiring childhood. It is hard to imagine that the events taking place in the book are true. The book is about Johannas, a black-African in South Africa. His life is faced with many challenges, most of which he overcame. Johannas' biggest problem and fear was the racism existing in South Africa. Much of the story is about his relations with white people and his education. In the ghetto of Alexandria, where he grew up, education was very expensive and the schools did not have all the staff and supplies that were needed. Johannas began playing tennis at a young age and persisted and protested about playing with whites. He was also under a lot of pressure from people, and did not get along well with his father. His parents and other black people in the ghetto also faced frequent raids by police with the objective of catching people with passes that are out-of-order. Neither of his parents had their passes in order, or legal papers to live where they did. His family was also poor and often borrowed money for food or searched in dumpsters. However, Johannas always kept up with his education and eventually it, along with tennis, brought him to America, the dream of almost any black South African."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"I had to read kaffir boy for school. after reading the back i was very intriged. i liked the beginning. the second section was good and the last disappointed me. at first i thought of him as a deprived boy who wanted a better life. then when he started to befriend whites and used them to his advantage i no longer liked him. the book oopened my eyes to apartheid. he did i very good job at descirbing life for him. but he was not a nice person. that made me sad for the human race. i think it is a good book to read for the sake of reading it but please do not base your desicions agauint his."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"I read Kaffir Boy, which was a seemingly long time ago, however, it still remains glued into my head. The main character of the book \`Kaffir Boy' is Mark Mathabane, who was also the author of the magnificent book. The book portrays the life of an ordinary black boy living in the hatred filled streets of South Africa. The racism described is so well portrayed that it is almost painful; the author (Mark Mathabane) paints a crystal clear picture of what it was like to live at that time, with racism chasing you down.

Very revealing and expert writing."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"This book became a controversial topic in my children's school district not long ago when it was temporarily banned from the tenth grade English curriculum where it had been assigned reading for an Honors class. The Board of Education felt the the graphic sexual content was inappropriate for the age level it was assigned to. Of course, it found its way into my Book Discussion Group's agenda not long after! I found the frank descriptions of prostitution utilizing young boys the least of its problems. The writing was melodramatic, superficial and full of contradictions. It's &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; without the comic relief, humility or realism. That having been said, the book is an eye-opener to those who assume that this level of racism and poverty no longer exists. The despair that these tribal ethnic families have lived through, the rage and hatred for the ruling Afrikaaners that has been seething is profound. And to think that this incredible slavery and racial segregation existed as recently as only a decade ago! For this reason alone &quot;Kaffir Boy&quot; is a worthwhile reading experience."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"Kaffir Boy was a moving tale about a South African boys struggles with apartheid, but i had a real had time reading a lot of it (and i don't mean because of the tragic content). This book is roughly 350 pages and dreadfully drawn out, when it could have been 220 pages, engaging, wholey educational as well as entertaining.For example, their are conversations, that probably took ten seconds, that Mathabane has stretched out over THREE PAGES! Ok, my man, I get that your long, chipped toenails dug into the cold, damp, rotting floor of the diggy zing shack while you desperately seeked the bowls of your mind to find the precise words to allay your father, while not letting on that you were affraid, all the while trying to catch your breath so that you tattered red, cotton shirt that hung low against your belly stopped heaving as if it were a snake in a fire pit. No body needs that much description.Anyone who reads should be prepaired to skip a few paragraphs to keep the story moving, but they should pay close attention to the atrocities that the white man's perceived self-worth (btw, i'm white) can lead to.This book became monotonous very quickly, but is lessons shouldn't be dismissed. I immediately decided to sponsor and African child's education and medicine before i finished reading this book."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"Not much of an introduction needed here: the full title of the book accurately sums up the subject. This was a book that I bought in used paperback not certain whether I'd finish it, and found myself deeply engrossed in the story and in reflection upon Mathabane's descriptions of life under apartheid.Mathabane shows a great many literary strengths here. His candid expression of his own feelings can't help but inspire the reader's respect and interest; the whole book feels 'spoken from the heart'. His prejudices, embarrassing moments, times of despair, moments of triumph, and peer relations are all here. Of particular interest to me (naturally, as a white non-South African) was the development of his views of white people--South Africans and foreigners--and how his understanding becomes broader as he meets a wider variety of people. I came away thinking that I'd probably really like Mark Mathabane in person.His youth in fact makes a good story, one that builds nicely to a conclusion I won't spoil for you except to carefully mention that this is the story only of his youth, not of his whole life. And his descriptive talent, which painted such vivid and contrasting portraits of the life he led, is worthy of the great storytellers of the proud tribes of southern Africa from which he is descended. I would offer the caveat that the book contains explicit sexual and violent scenes that most people would consider inappropriate for children under 14 (and even then I'm assuming a pretty well-adjusted child). Mathabane is never himself vulgar, but some of his experiences certainly were, and he gets through them as quickly as possible but I see why he didn't omit them.If you ever wondered what life was like for South African blacks under apartheid, particularly for a highly gifted member of that group striving upward against every barrier that several cultures could place before him, this'll be a revelation."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"I'm in 10th grade. our teacher is having us read this.

I had thought it might just be segregation. But it was so much more than just segregation.Mark Mathabane introduces us to the horrors of his childhood growing up in South Africa, from family problems, to gangs, and the unjust Pass Laws. He learns the value of education and shows just how hard it is to persevere when oppressed by whites who believe Africans to be inferior.Starting from the 1960's, it provided an in-depth look at the Apartheid from a victim's point of view. It amazed me that it was all real...all the killing and poverty.It was a very powerful novel. It gave me good sense of the meaning of \\"apartheid\\". I would suggest it for those who want to get a good idea of the type of thinking and enduring that went on in South Africa during apartheid. Because it doesn't quite focus on the events of history, but is a personal account of a youth's hardships, the book is very effective in evoking emotions, portraying hardships, rather than just stating the facts.I really was able to take away a lot from this book. I finished it with a greater sense of the power of perserverance, hopes, and achieving goals."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"I'm homeschooling my 13 y.o. son &amp; we are currently learning about South Africa and apartheid. After much research and reading 4 other books, Waiting for the Rain, Cry the beloved Country, A dry white season, and The power of One, I read Kaffir Boy by Mark Mathabane. Since reading this book, I have not stopped thinking about Mark and his bittersweet life, mostly bitter, anything sweet coming from his mother. The horrors he and his family endured were at times hard to read, but he and his mother were so inspiring in the way they managed to lift themselves above this horrific thing called apartheid. It is a very hopeful and uplifting book putting my own petty problems into perspective. Mathabane's gift of expression and putting words on paper that turn into pictures in your mind and deep feelings of despair and hope in your heart is exceptional. He has written 3 other books which it seems to my dissapointment are currently out of print, but I will find them and read them. I could not put Kaffir Boy down and it has changed me. I highly reccommend it.Mari Yunker St. George Utah"},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"&quot;Kaffir Boy&quot; is a poignant eye-opener to the horrible experiences of South African apartheid, and the incredible power of hope in the worst of circumstances, told through the sensitive eyes of Mark Mathabane. This true story needs to be read by everyone! I cannot stop thinking about Mark's experiences growing up, and that I was growing up in America at the same time, a child with no worries, feeling safe. It shocks me that I heard nothing of apartheid until I was 13 or 14 years old, in the early 1980's. I am thankful to have chanced upon this book- Mathabane's candid writing gives me a better understanding of apartheid and its atrocities. I admire the strength and encouragement he found in his family, especially his mother. Her confidence and determination to have her family rise above extreme hardships, and her belief in the power of education seemed to be a light shining through the darkness for her children. This book has moved me deeply, and inspires me to seek ways to help children in my city to empower themselves, as Mark's mother did. I hope people everywhere have &quot;Kaffir Boy&quot; at the top of their &quot;Must Read&quot; book lists."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"Growing UpThe book Kaffir Boy, by Mark Mathabane is without a doubt a worthwhile read. Its unique detail and harsh reality is unparalleled by any other novel. It is the story of Johannes Mathabane, growing up in the racially unequal apartheid of South Africa. Throughout the book, he is treated under awful conditions, yet learns to persevere and comes out on top in a most heroic manner. It tells of overcoming all of the obstacles in his life - including his father, the government, and his tribal heritage. This book is not only enjoyable to read, but it is also an important book as it opens America's eyes to those less fortunate living under impossible odds.The book takes place in South Africa, where whites predominately rule. Johannes, who later changes his name to Mark, is a young boy just beginning to experience the hatred and racism in apartheid, a ghetto in Alexandra. The book starts out immediately showing the daily terror that he had to live. With constant raids, by the black police (headed by whites), Johannes soon develops a hate for all white people, as his parents have to constantly flee because their \\"passbooks are not in order\\". Things begin to go bad after his father is taken away to jail for a year. Poverty and hunger consumes their ever-increasing family. When his father returns, he is never the same. An internal struggle begins to develop within Johannes. He is torn between his father's tribal beliefs and the new changing era of schooling and Christianity. As he grows older his metamorphosis begins and a hatred starts to brew inside for his father. His mother turns his life around by enrolling him in school. He prospers greatly and begins to think differently of some whites as his exposure grows. Poverty is constant throughout the book, as is the disputes between him and his father. He makes it through school graduating the top of his class. It is after a few years of schooling that he is introduced to the sport tennis. This would be the changing moment in his life. Tennis opens his views to whites as he encounters those who want to help him succeed. He meets friends such as Andre and Stan who promise to help in fulfill his dreams. When everything seems to be going well in his life, revolts begin against the government which he quickly joins in. This disrupts his life and brings back his hate memories of whites. Although his life is chaotic during this period, he still manages to quench his thirst for knowledge and manages to excel in school and tennis. He begins winning tournaments as his metamorphosis slows almost to an end. He rebels against his fathers wishes, only to pursue his dream of going to America. Eventually he proves that he could overcome hate with his mothers love and embarks to an American college.Throughout this book, Johannes demonstrates tremendous heroic qualities in his quest for success. From the moment he is brought into the world, he is constantly defending himself and his family. He shows courage constantly during the entire story. This is demonstrated when he rebels against his father's tribal wishes, continues schooling even when it is unbearable, and when he refuses to quit playing tennis with whites even though its against the law. Another quality that Johannes has is his dedication. He refuses to quit school, because he promised his mother, and he practices tennis even when his family and political unrest go against it. He also is ambitious. He comes from a home with nothing, yet he sets high hopes and dreams and never forgets them. Also, Johannes has great resourcefulness. For his learning he was provided with very little yet he made the best of it to try and educate himself. He constantly read comics to try and prove to everyone that he is better than a \\"kaffir\\" boy. Lastly, and probably the most important quality he possesses, is that he loved his mother and never wanted to disappoint her. This was the driving force behind most of what he accomplished. All these qualities put together made Mark Mathabane a great, almost unstoppable, hero. He believed when no one else did, a very difficult yet inspiring task.This book is an unquestionable necessity for all to read. One reason is because of the rich detail that Mark was not afraid to write about. He crosses many racial borders and accurately describes the hell that he was forced to live in - such as the unsanitary conditions and constant fear. It is not a pretty book to read, as his truthfulness often leads to disturbing tales. But I emphasize its importance, because of its ability to grasp you and throw you right into this terrible world that most people wouldn't believe exists. This book is also very captivating. He makes you feel as if you are experiencing everything he did, a task which most writers aim for but fall short of. He powerfully conveys all his emotions- his stubbornness of his younger years, his anger at his father and his sadness at his torn family. Plainly spoken, it is a great story to hear. It's amazing that he was able to overcome such odds and hardship, and it inspires you to want to do something to end the racial oppression. The theme of a fallen, but not beaten hero appears throughout the entire book. It also does revert back to the old \\"good will always prevail over evil theme\\" as this presents itself in religion and racist disputes. This book is just as intoxicating as it horrific, which provides a sad but good read.When Mark Mathabane wrote \\"Kaffir Boy\\", he accomplished a great literary work, comprised of great emotion. This naked view into his life provides us with unbelievable detail. It should be appreciated not only as a book, but as his inspirational life poured onto pages. He proved to everyone that he could triumph over all the evils threatening him even if he didn't have all the necessary tools. This memoir is not to be overlooked, as his success story is like no other. He escaped degradation to accomplish his dreams. He showed heroism when it seemed unbearable and lives to this day to tell his story. This is a powerful and intensely moving story."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"Mark Mathabane's autobiography, Kaffir Boy, tells the story of his life while growing up in apartheid South Africa. A victim of segregation, poverty, and brutality, he learned how to survive under the harsh conditions of South Africa during the 1960s and 70s. The true story of this hero is one that everyone should read to try to understand the horror of life for the people of South Africa at this time.Mark Mathabane grew up in Alexandra, a black ghetto, under the name of Johannes Mathabane. In Alexandra, there were constant police raids, gang wars, and far less than acceptable living conditions. Tiny rented shacks provided homes for families living in this area. Since his family had very little money, Mark and his siblings were forced to sleep on the concrete floor of one of these shacks and often became ill. Early in Mark's life, he had to learn about the terror of police raids. Some of these raids against blacks are described in graphic detail throughout the book. People were arrested, beaten, or even killed, just because of their race. Although fear lived with the people of Alexandra, they had to continue to live their lives. Mark's father, a person who he would have many conflicts with in life, held a low paying job which often did not pay enough money to keep the entire family fed. There would be many times where it did not seem that life would continue for Mark. Luckily, his mother and grandmother were able to find and hold jobs, which put Mark through school. Here, he accelerated in his studies and in tennis. These two things would eventually help Mark rise above his street life.A person can be described as a hero for many reasons. Mark Mathabane, without a doubt, displayed heroism at many times throughout his life. As a young child, Mark often cared for his younger siblings when his parents could not. He accepted responsibility and did everything he could for them. He often put his brothers and sister before himself. This act shows his selflessness and willingness to help people. When Mark goes to school, he works at his studies extremely hard. He came to love reading, and wanted to learn all that he could. Even with difficult times, Mark worked his hardest at school and was always at the top of his class. Not only was this a major accomplishment for Mark, it also gave his siblings a person to look up to, and an example to follow. When there was not enough money to continue sending he and all of his siblings to school, Mark took a job and helped to pay for his family's expenses. Mark also displays his heroism at many points during his life. His selflessness, hard work, and generosity are just a few of his traits to be admired.This novel is very well written and difficult to put down. Although at times, mostly in the beginning of the book, the descriptions of police raids and fights are extremely graphic, the words can only describe the situation - not make one live it. Living in a society where all people are equal, it is nearly impossible to comprehend the treatment bestowed upon those who lived under the apartheid in South Africa. What happened there is history, and cannot be changed or ignored. While language and description are graphic, is it important to know what happened to these people so nothing like this can ever happen again. Mark Mathabane has a gift for writing and it is very well demonstrated in his story.Overall, this book is definitely a worthwhile read. It is one that stirs emotion and provokes thought. Mark Mathabane's life was undoubtedly difficult, but there is an immense feeling of satisfaction when closing the book. This autobiography is not only well-written and able to hold the reader's attention, it is also truly inspiring."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"I could not believe such story could exist, I was shocked every moment I read this book and what is even more intense is that its his own autobiography.

My reading this book made me interested in South Africa and helping the people there. The images in this true story were horrific and make me want to change the world. I have dreamt of going to South Africa and helping ending the discrimination.The story of a South African family and their life living through Apartheid was very deep and put my emotions into the pages I read. It covers the issues of Apartheid, laws against blacks and the personal story of a boy growing up embedded in these horrors. The boy, Mark, is a strong character with a great deal of determination to get out of South Africa and make something of himself. He sees his parents give in to the police and not stand up for themselves. He refuses to get sucked into the dismay of Apartheid and the atrocities the authorities have put them through.Mark's grandmother helps mark through school by teaching him the things she has learned on her own and arranges for him to get the money for school supplies, books and appropriate clothing. She arranged for him to meet the family of her employers, where he eventually learned to play tennis and meets Stan Smith. Through this connection, he is able to go to America and go to college on a tennis scholarship.This story is much more complex than the outlying shape of the plot. It leaves a scar on every reader who experiences the horrible phenomenon of Apartheid. It gives a real sense of the constant terror these people live with, the atrocities they face every day of their life and the undying dream of freedom they all share."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"Great words. Wonderful plot. Awesome characterization. All of these things can be found in Mark Mathabanes exciting autobiography, Kaffir Boy. This autobiography combines the vileness of South African apartheid and one young lad's struggle for freedom with astonishing results. Kaffir Boy takes an aggressive look into the wickedness of apartheid and the ravishing affects it can take on the future in an engaging manner that lures the reader into the plot.Within Kaffir Boy, the plot blossoms through magnificent character development, guided by Mark. The story is encapsulated within an autobiography format- as the characters grow, so does the plot- as shown when Mark first realizes apartheid, and the detrimental effect it has on black society. By showing this truth, the reader has the opportunity to look into the world of a black South African drowning in the havoc of apartheid. The honest viewpoint shared an unbiased hope of life that kept the reader hooked. Along with this, Mark and his family build on to the story with details from daily life and family tradition. It really opened up a new viewpoint of world cultures as I felt myself being drawn into the characters lives, struggles and achievements. The character development in Kaffir Boy was a flawless, exciting addition to this book.Along with character development, Mark's true life story unfurls through the plot a wicked twist on your feelings, emotions and beliefs that will make your morals shout out from the sidelines. The events in this book that I liked the least were the racism shown to the blacks in South Africa. The ways blacks were treated throughout this work really gave me a culture shock. Although the white's actions were horrible, Mark's actions and the persistent drive behind them shone like a candle in the night, as a hero in a sorrow filled world. The event that I liked the best was when Mark was freed of the bonds of apartheid through his talents and hard work, the theme was shown strongly through his actions and I admire his die-hard attitude. Also, the motif was very encouraging and kept me hooked. The plot of Kaffir Boy was exciting and will keep any reader thirsting for more.Bright work or boring bummer? I encourage you to read this fabulous book and decide for yourself. Kaffir Boy astonished me with new viewpoints and aspects within the menacing world of apartheid. Make sure you add this five- star choice to your bookshelf- Kaffir Boy."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"Mark Mathabane's book Kaffir Boy is deeply harsh and emotional. We see this firsthand in the name. Kaffir is an infidel, a derrogatory remark, much in the same context as words derived from slavery in America. From the preface to the last injustice, this novel has more shock value than even the most twisted erotica. If we were reading an account from post-civil war America this story would fit perfectly, however, the book is a true account that occured in the 1970s in South Africa. Mathabane describes the incredible strength and wisdom of his mother and her determination for her children to get an education. The injustices that the families face are heartbreaking. Mark Mathabane is one of millions that broke out of the system and the story is not finished. Kaffir Boy in America is the sequel, and another must-read.

When I originally read this book, South Africa was still in the grip of apartheid. Fortunately, the book is no longer a cry for its end, yet it is still a powerful story of perserverance.The book, thankfully, is graphic at times but this, of course, is to show what Mathabane came from and was able to overcome. I find it somewhat comical when people read a book about overcoming great adversity and complain because the &quot;before&quot; picture isn't Sunday school.

Mathabane's style of writing is remarkably direct and the frankness of his descriptions will anger, disturb and entice one to read further.

THIS IS HOW IT WAS."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"Kaffir Boy by Mark Mathabane is an inspiring book about a black youth's coming of age in Apartheid South Africa. It is an inspiring story about a young black boy growing up in the rat-infested ghetto of Alexandra struggling to be more than just another &quot;kaffir&quot; like every black man, woman, and child in Alexandra and every other ghetto in South Africa. The only life that he knew was a life of bloody gang wars, midnight police raids, and poverty and sickness. With his mother's help, he had the courage and the strength to peruse his dream of someday escaping South Africa and going to America. The theme that the author is trying to convey throughout the book is no matter how difficult things get, not to give up on the things that you want so badly. No matter how many forces are working against you, you can still accomplish your goal.Life in Alexandra was difficult because all blacks living there had to have a job and special papers authorizing them to do so. Those who did not have the papers or were unemployed were arrested or shipped back to tribal reserves where conditions were often worse than the ghettos. Like many other families living in Alexandra, the paper's belonging to Mark's parents were not in order. Because of this, they had to flee when police raided houses. Because it was illegal to be employed without them, Mark's father was many times sent to prison. This resulted in Mark's family to be one of the poorest families in the ghetto. His mother spent all her time looking after her children and was forced to be unemployed because she didn't have the proper papers and she was illiterate. They often had to resort to dumpsters to stay alive. At times when the family managed to save money, it went towards Mark's schooling. His mother's one dream in life was that one of her children become educated and lives a &quot;proper&quot; life.When Mark starts his education, because his family could afford it he learns to enjoy it. He graduates first in his class. But as the family gets deeper and deeper into debt, Mark begins to get beaten everyday in school for late payments. He was often unable to walk. His grades never sliped, but he was worn out from the beatings. Because of his mother, he didn't give up. She convinced him that without him, she would not have a will to live. His mother took a job in Alexandra (one did not need papers to work in the ghetto) to pay for his education because Mark's father proved to be no help towards him. It encouraged him to work harder than ever to prove his father wrong. He wanted Mark to give up all the &quot;nonsense&quot; which he called schooling and learn to accept the tribal ways. Mark was often forced to perform rituals by his father to please the tribal gods. Mark grew to hate his father and often took his mother's side in family quarrels.Inspired by Arthur Ashe, a black tennis champion from America, Mark desperately wanted to get out of Alexandra and beat white people at their own. Mark takes up tennis as his second hobby next to reading. With the help of Saramouche (a black tennis coach) and many of his white friends, he becomes the best black player in Alexandra even though black tennis facilities were no match for those of whites. He saw tennis as &quot;a way out.&quot; Persevering to be the best, Mark worked harder than he ever has before with the danger of people trying to murder him for playing with whites while other black children would never dream of having such a chance, someday hoping to hear from Stan Smith (a white tennis champion who won in Wimbledon with Bob Lutz) about a tennis scholarship to America.This wonderful tale is very intense story about a boy and his struggles. The reader is deeply touched by the descriptive scenes of ghetto life. It is very inspiring to read about an indiviual, which most people thought had no chance growing up in his world of harsh laws, who never gave up. Mark Mathabane takes the reader through a journey of his life. The reader feels that he or she is sharing with Mark the hardships and the good times. It is an excellent, well written, inspiring, and very descriptive story."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"This book was required for my freshman history class. I really liked the book. I know many people who have read the book found it obscene, and think that some of the sexual scenes should not have been included. However, what about some of the police brutality scenes, should these be taken out of the book too? I think that with out some of the disturbing parts, it would be hard to imagine what millions of people had to live through. I the reason why this book was issued in high school's, is because the teachers probably expect teens to be mature enough to handle most of it. In addition, just because there were obscene parts in the book does not mean that it was a bad book, or that it was poorly written. It only shows what many people had to live through, and should never have too.

The book deals with extreme racism, poverty, hope, and miracles. Born Johannes Mathabane, the boy is forced to deal with harsh police raids and lack of food daily. Through his mother's diligent work efforts, Johannes is able to attend school and finds himself first in his class. Through some connections, he realizes that not all whites are the conniving, cruel policemen that Johannes has encountered. Through one of these connections, he discovers the sport of tennis unearths his talent for the sport. Through some friendly encounters with whites at tournaments, he meets Stan Smith, a famous tennis player from the United States and learns of the free black society overseas. Through the help of his new friend, Johannes finally receives a tennis scholarship to attend an American university. Throughout this book, Johannes proves to be such a wonderful and convincing hero as he worked to better his people and his country, provided for his family, and continuously strove to be better at all aspects of his life.Johannes continuously was weighing decisions on which would be the better for his people and the future of South Africa. Reading was a passion of his that helped him to be more adept to reading English until he reached the point where no matter how hard the English was, he could read it. His main focus at the end of the story was to fulfill these dreams of his. This value of the desire to excel was another heroic trait that Johannes possessed.All of these add up to the laudable hero in Johannes \\"Mark\\" Mathabane, making his story a precious tale that is a must read. It brings awareness to horrible conditions so often overlooked, yet so recent. The scenes were graphic and tragically descriptive, making the reader sense the horror and tragedy that Johannes must have endured. Facing adversity at every turn, Johannes Mathabane, the seemingly small, stands to his full height and defies all expectations to reveal one magnificent story!"},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"Kaffir Boy is probably the best book I've ever read. I'm only 16, and we had to read a part of it for English but I decided to actually check the whole book out, and I don't regret it at all. The things that happened were unbelievable, and the story of his life really touched me. When I finished this I almost started to cry. We take things for granted, and when you're done reading Kaffir Boy, you certainly have a different view for people. There were times were I just wanted to help Mark Mathabane out.

However with a sentence like &quot;the men ranged in age from eighteen to thirty&quot; it was difficult. Kaffir Boy changed the way i felt about history. This book not only made the history of Apartheid come to life in my eyes but it ignited feeling and passion inside of me as i read each page. Discriptions like &quot;With almost three years of constant police terror behind me i had now become, at seven years old, so conditioned to expecting predawn police raids that each time my mother awakened me in the middle of the night, i would spring up and ask, Are they here?&quot; painted a vivid picture of this young boy, Mark's horror and confusion at the age of seven. I could not have put it down even if i wanted to. To this day Kaffir Boy is a part of me. I fell in love with this little boy who made the phase &quot;never give up&quot; come to life.

Mark and his fourth class family grew up in Alexandra, South Africa and this is his remarkable memoir of life under apartheid there. This terrifying story describes his struggle to survive under poverty and inhumane conditions, with a tormented father who would beat him for not listening to tribal ways, and a mother set on educating Mark no matter what the sacrifice.When Mark discovers tennis his world turns around. Practicing everyday, he still manages to be the top student in his class. Mark would have never guessed that playing tennis would fulfill his dream about going to America, but when American people hear about Mark they are willing to pay his fees to go there as well as college tuition.This biography describes a black person's life so well and from a different perspective.

Coming from a poor family, his parents couldn't afford to pay for food, let alone pay for a pass to live. The cops come after them numerous times, and the little boy tries his best to run away from them. He grows up watching discrimination, death, and destruction, which makes him indifferent towards life and education. However, his mother's insistence made him change his mind. Therefore, he went to school, where there was a lot more discrimination, not only racial, but also classis. However, he realizes his love for education, and struggles to stay in school and be one of the best. He discovers his longing for tennis, and pretty soon, becomes good at it, with the help of his white friend. As life goes on, he learns that not all white people are racial discriminators. He learns that life is not the same all around the world. He hears about Martin Luther King, and his fight for equality, which makes him long for a free life. He gets an athletic scholarship for tennis, and comes to America. Thus, 'Kaffir boy' escapes the hardships of a discriminated life by coming to the 'promised land', America.This is a wonderful book about a young boy who was forced to grow up too soon in a world filled with unspeakable evil. It is very heart touching. The emotional way in which Mark Mathabane describes the risky experiences of this boy and the in depth descriptions of his struggle for survival makes this book very interesting and affecting. It teaches us how racial discrimination can make others feel. It shows us the hardships that people in South Africa used to endure. It teaches us of a world we didn't know existed."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"Kaffir Boy is set in South Africa during apartheid in the 1960's; it is an autobiography of the life of Mark Mathabane who tells the ups and downs of his life. The story begins with a bang as the SAP (South African Police) journey uninvited into Mark's house looking for his parents to check his passport. This happens many times throughout the book and Mark begins to adapt it as a well of everyday life. Mark also encounters poverty when his father is arrested for not having his passport in order. His family results to near starvation for months until his grandmother is able to help them get back on their feet until Mark's father returns from prison. Mark's next step lands him in school, although his father is completely bent against him going his mother is able to provide for his education. Mark ends up being at the top of his class and gets a scholarship to a college. He begins to pick up tennis and plays with more white players around the world; he begins to idolize Arthur Ashe and watches one of his matches. Mark ends up being a class act tennis player and making friends with several white people. At the end of the book Mark changes as a person, he didn't like whites at the beginning but learned that all whites were not bad and he also felt like he had completed all his goals coming out of a ghetto.The reason I give the book 4 of 5 stars is really the length and content of the book. I feel as though more information then necessary was given sometimes. I see where Mark was coming from though, trying to give the raw details of the ghetto so readers from a suburban neighborhood would understand what it was like in the 1960's but I also feel like some of the mentioned material was much too explicit. Mark was able to catch my attention though and no other book before has been able to do that, it is a great autobiography to say the least. I recommend it to readers 16 years old and above and anybody with a lot of free time on their hands."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"Kaffir Boy shows the brutal reality of apartheid in South Africa.

If you are interested in the difficulties experienced by black people, you'll like this book."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"The autobiography written by Mark Mathabane displays the struggles, fears, hatred, and the constant struggle for freedom in South Africa during apartheid, which separated blacks from whites. During anytime, police raids were apparent and usual in a black ghetto, where Mark lived. Early in his life Mark developed a hatred for whites and the everlasting system of apartheid, because of these raids and how his parents conveyed their image to him. Mark's father made enough money to support a half-starving family, however once Mark's mother received a job, Mark was sent off to school. His love for literature grew, and he wanted to read constantly. The books he obtained were through a white family whom his grandmother worked for; hence Mark's hatred for whites became weaker, while his love of books became stronger. Also, the white family gave him a tennis racquet, once he learned the game, tennis was his favorite hobby, second to reading. While he was growing as an individual and intellectually, problems dealing with apartheid remained, and Mark believed strongly in freedom, his destination: America. I believe everyone who is able to read should get a copy of this because of the insight into another culture, the story of a lasting hope, and a born leader develops. Indulge yourself in the everyday problems in South Africa, where a brave, strong-minded person cries freedom.Throughout the book in its entirety, a harsh culture like no other is revealed to the imagination of the reader. The fact that police raids were a typical occurrence in the black ghettos, invading the privacy of helpless, starving humans shows the culture as cruel, and unjust. Mark builds up a strong fear toward these police to the point that whenever he would be woken up in the night, he would ask his mother if the police were there in a frightened manner. \\"Lifebuoy soap, purged me of years and years of grime till I ached and bled\\" (Page 124). Bathing to Mark was a terrible thing for he practiced it once every few years because his family did not know the pleasures of cleanness, nor did they have the money. Constant starvation faced Mark and his family day after day, week after week. The white people whom his father worked for were cruel and treated his as though he was a slave, just to receive enough to feed an inadequate amount of food to the hungry mouths of his family.Regardless of every hardship that faced Mark, he still grasped hope. When he was just a boy, he would listen to his mother's tales and would pull from them a meaningful moral as he aged. He learned to love peace instead of hate, honesty instead of deceiving, and hope instead of fear. As Mark was educated, his intelligence devoted his soul to books, and he believed they would carry him out of the hateful country into a better land. News of a \\"Promise Land\\" arrived when he heard the equality of people in America, and the fairness. He began tennis, excelled, loved, and mastered the game. High hopes for America had risen at this point when he knew he had the smartness, and the ability to play a sport well, potentially leading his to freedom. The only obstacle was money.A natural leader Mark was, and this quality proved to be his best throughout the novel. Showing Mark's independence in his decisions, early on in his life he was faced with a grotesque dilemma. His friends sold their bodies sexually, for food and money. However, Mark was strong-willed and declined regardless of how poor his family was, and how much the pain of hunger was pleading. He fled from the scene as an individual while his friends stayed a group. A quote from him says, \\"I was not prepared to prostitute myself for food or money. I would rather have died than do that\\" (Page 74). In school Mark became top of his class in grades, he continued to rise as a natural born leader. Hard work was invariably performed, and Mark received top of his class for several more years. His involvement with whites grew as his love for tennis grew, infuriating blacks all around him. Many called him \\"Uncle Sam\\" in mockery, and threatened to kill him. Mark did not break the friendships he had made to appease his own race, he didn't understand why blacks and whites could not live as one, so he simply researched America more. The desire to live in America flourished in Mark's mind, and he needed to leave the madness, which infested his native country.Mark's destination: America, but his problem is learning how to get there. Kaffir Boy is a book intended for those who want to read of a leader, and an individual struggling to win the one aspect of life he wants most...freedom. The novel is meant for serious readers who want a book of a different type of world as well. Learn about the harsh, unpleasant style of living that Mark called his childhood, and read about how he manages to depart from this terrible place."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"At first glance i thought &quot;The Kaffir Boy&quot; would end up as another dull summer read.

You may also want to consider Chris Okoli's Africans Cry for Help. It sheds much needed light on the history and happenings of the African continent. With virtually all regions of the continent embroiled in some form of civil and economic strife -- be it the events of the recent Arab Spring in the north, issues of apartheid in South Africa, civil war in Sudan, or the government corruption and despotism that plagues many African countries -- Africans Cry for Help brings the reader the much needed history, perspective, and insights required to truly understand the issues that have become synonymous with Africa today.Beyond providing an in-depth historical understanding of the European colonialism of the past and the economic colonialism of the present, Okoli exercises his airtight knowledge of the nuanced problems -- as well as their origins and trappings -- that define a modern Africa in crisis. The solid aforementioned foundations make his vision and proposals to remedy issues such as the lack of inter-African cooperation, tribalism, economic dependence, the African diaspora of the 1960s and 1970s, and the lack of support for African youths all the more compelling.If you are in need of primer, or are looking to continue the conversation on African issues today, Chris Okoli's Africans Cry for Help is a must read.

Mr. Mathabane's story is told in three parts. The first, The Road to Alexandra, offers a description of the appalling squalor and violence found in a black ghetto under fourth-class citizen status. How children learn to survive, let alone attempt to carry on any type of hopeful existence, defies any common understanding of humanity and pulls at the reader's heartstrings. The challenges, frustrations, and sacrifices that confronted Mr. Mathabane and his family are documented throughout the second section, Passport to Knowledge, where education, religion, and tribal affiliations swirl as possible solutions to combat the Influx Control Law and other forms of white-minority separatist rule. Passport to Freedom, the third section, narrates Mr. Mathabane's discovery of tennis and the difficulties of making dreams come true.Despite the repetition of incidents and the infusion of seemingly inconsequential moments, Mr. Mathabane's autobiography is readable and moving. It is hard to imagine anyone living through the impoverished conditions he describes. Confrontations with his tribal father, local gangs, missionaries, and white authorities suggest hope of a better future is nothing short of a lottery ticket. The most effective sections of the text share Mr. Mathabane's inner turmoil in deciding his place as a black South African and an agent of change. The tumultuous history of apartheid is drawn with an effective narrative voice as violent uprisings and responses are juxtaposed with tender sacrifices and determination. With the assistance of liberal whites, Mr. Mathabane turned hard work and good fortune into a plane ticket to freedom. Kaffir Boy joins Cry Freedom and Master Harold & the Boys as yet another powerful depiction of South African life."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"I picked up this book after watching the movie \\"Tsotsi\\".

I was really touched by the authors struggles and his determination (with the help of some very special people) to rise above his terrible situation.

You learn so much about apartheid itself, while experiencing all the highs and lows along with Johannes/Mark. BUY this! It's uplifting because despite all the terrible things that happened to and around Mark, he continues to push on (and you end up falling in love with his sweet, loving mother.) In short, READ THIS! I just bought the sequel and can't wait to start!"},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"Interesting story about growing up under apartheid. He is not very self speculative as to any of his own faults."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"A fantastic and almost unbelievable story.

As one of the children born in an area where de-humanizing police raids -a lot of times led by people of their own race, was a standard, almost nightly thing, he measured his life in days -not years.He writes as Johannes -the narrator and main character of the story. With the courage he learns from his mother and the education she fought for, he helps to look after and feed his younger siblings. Then with the help of his grandmother he overcomes the unimaginable rules and laws set for the \`blacks', to earn a living in the \`white' community. Eventually he meets up with a tennis star who helps him work towards a scholarship to an American University. This is where this part of the story basically ends.We all need to read about the unbelievable situations that some of our fellow humans live in -and who survive to grow and live a \`normal' life.It is a testament to the author's tenacity that he lived to tell this story.You will not easily forget this book and you will be looking forward to reading the next one."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"After reading Marks' books, all of them! I felt well prepared for my trip to South Africa. I traveled there this Fall of 2011 and the insights and information from Kaffir Boy and Meriam's Song were still valid. I could understand conversations with the locals and interpret my impressions clearly, thanks to Mark's books. I have also met the author in person and found him a very well informed and compassionate person, passionate about the well being of people of all backgrounds, anywhere in the world. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"The book gives a first hand feel for what life was like for the poorest Africans under an Apartheid government. A lot of white people didn't even know the suffering that the system they lived under caused. It was very educational."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"I recently read this book for a summer reading requirement for my sophomore year of high school, and I found it to be a very good description of apartheid in south africa. This book follows a poor black child and his family from about 8 to 18 years of age. I would reccommend this book to anyone intereested in apartheid, or just looking for a good book to read. No matter who you are this book will touch your heart to know what torture blacks in south africa went through during apartheid."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"Wow. I can't believe Mark Mathabane lived to write this book. Kaffir Boy is truly a tale of survival. Even more incredible to me is that he came away from his nightmarish childhood in South Africa unscathed enough to write about the experience in very lucid and calm prose. I am guessing if it were me in his place I would be beating on pillows in psychotherapy sessions for the rest of my life. Or taking some serious antidepressant medication. My interpretation of this book is that it reveals how patriarchal/matriarchal structures damage and destroy everyone that they touch. Obviously, these structures dominated South Africa's Judeo-Christian white minority and African tribal culture when Mathabane was growing up in the 1960s and 1970s. He has done a wonderful job at revealing how ugly the shame, violence, fear, and exploitation characteristic of patriarchal structures truly are. Everyone abuses everyone else from the top down in apartheid-archy South Africa. Unless you are fortunate enough to be a &quot;bass&quot; (white person in a position of authority), you suffer endless torments and tortures. In an odd way, Kaffir Boy reminded me of Orwell's 1984. Scarily, patriarchal structures allow situations like apartheid to happen in our world right now. All in all, I found this book to be well-crafted and beautifully written. The characters are very round and the entire plot just felt very real to me. A few criticisms: On a some occasions, the writing becomes very didactic--as if the characters are just mouthing Mathabane's philosophy about a this or that situation in South Africa, not being characters in a story. And, the character of Mathabane's mother sometimes confused me. On the one hand, she was supposed to be an illiterate person. But on some pages she came across like a university professor. Odd. Also, the character of Mathabane's father, very much prevalent for the first one hundred or so pages just seems to disapppear after that. And the book seemed to read very slowly for me. It is 350 pages, but often seemed longer. However, these are minor criticisms. This is a great book to read if you don't know much about South Africa's system of apartheid in the 1960s and 1970s and it is just a moving story altogether. As Mathabane says on the first page of the book, &quot;Amandla! Awethu! (Power is ours!).&quot; Words that every human being should feel proud to speak, regardless of race, culture, gender, or age."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"When this book was first passed out in my language arts class, I was expecting another boring BLAH classic-type book. I started reading and I couldn't put it down. Mark (Johannas) Mathabane describes his life in apartheid South Africa so well that you feel his pain. I had no idea what apartheid was or how bad South Africa was until I read this book. It is not your usual autobiography, either. Its more like a story. Flows really well and doesn't let you put it down."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"My apologies, as this is not a review. I met a South African in the plane from London to Oslo. He told me about the book. I happen to have read about Mark Matabane in the Mail and Guardian; but never bothered to check his works out, as I promised myself to. After watching a CNN programme on 20000623, I felt that I have done myself a disservice by not following up on the matter. Would you be kind enough to provide me with Mark's website address.I work for the South African Embassy in Oslo.

Mark Mathabane gave great details. This book has really touched me. When I read what happened, I felt like I was there and a part of them. A lot of people say that it was very distasteful because of the sexual parts. I think that it just showed one of the ways the blacks were treated.

I bought this book because it was on my Amazon.com Book Recommendations list and I decided to give it a try hoping it wouldn't be one of those 'whiny' books. The beginning of it worried me a little but then I discovered its uniqueness and have finally come to the conclusion that Mathabane wrote a very good novel. I recommend it to everyone who is interested to learn the life of the black people during the long years of racism."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"I just wanted to say that I picked the phone up and called Mark after having read his second book.

He went through beatings and fights, up to schools and scholarships. There are many African black people being mistreated every day of there life in the South African city, Alexandria.In South Africa, black people are being treated very poorly every day of there life's by white people in the story, \\"Kaffir Boy.\\" There are many young boys in South Africa. But Mark Matherbane was a very unique kid who had a dream, and set his mind and heart to accomplish it. His world was very tuff and treated him very unfairly. He took care of his family the best of his ability at such a young age.There was a family of five who lived in the deep heart of Alexandria. There family was starving and poor. They had no money. Mark was so young and almost hitting death of starvation, he pulled out of it. This shows that if you set a dream or a goal, and you try hard enough to reach it, it will always come true.There are many things that have happened to Mark throughout his life. Mark fought with his father every day when he was growing up. I also get in a lot of arguments with my parents. He wanted to kill his father he was so mad. I would never go that far. Mark had two things that he was good at that brought him through life. It was his tennis career, that he was so good at, and his education. His talent mad him become friends with many different whites. In the end Mark did overcome all of his obstacles and reach his goal. He got his scholarship and went to America.I would recommend it to young adults over 15 years of age. Only people who want to know the truth about how black people where treated in South Africa by whites and all others. Ignoring all of the gross stuff, the book was very good and I would give it four stars. I don't read many books, but this one was excellent."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"I'm stumped. This memoir is considered a classic, yet there are platoons of unsung memoirs out of Africa that are far superior. Granted,Mathabane wrote this when he was barely out of high school. But still. The writing is laborious and, worse, many of the scenes, particularly those from his very early childhood, feel embellished. A different shade of James Frey? That said, the book gives a sobering, stark picture of Apartheid-era township life in all its horrors and occasional joys."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"Kaffir Boy was about a boy living under the apartheid laws of South Africa. These laws prevented blacks from doing anything in their community. They had no freedoms, and no hope for jobs to make money to live their lives. Mark Mathebane was the young boy in this book. He talked about his life and how horrible it was. This book was extremely graphic and sick minded for high school students. He gave every detail about how he lived and how he survived. One section of the book that comes to mind is where Mark is getting raped by a man. He gave every single detail that made me want to throw up. In another part of the book, a man made him step in a bucket full of human feases, which is flat out disgusting. This book is horrible in the fact that he or she reading it will have a stomach ache from the gross facts. Not suited for High School students!!"},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"This book is required reading for my 14 year old son's high school English class. Beginning at page 113, the author, Mark Mathabane, thought it was neccessary to go on for another nine pages with a graphic description of little boys engaging in anal sex with adult males as payment for food. My son and many of his classmate's were dumbfounded when they came to this part of the book. I agree fully with them when they say it was completely unneccessary for the author to include such a graphic scene to get the point across about how brutal life was growing up in Apartheid South Africa. If not for this scene, I would recommend this book for high school kids. If you don't want your 14 year old to learn about male anal sex, prostitution and pedophilia, then don't let them read this. Many public schools will allow a student to read an alternate selection if they or their parents find the required book to be offensive. Please do not be fooled into thinking you or your child are close-minded, or not &quot;with-it&quot;, for finding this book inappropriate for kids under the age of 18. Don't be afraid to be a parent!"},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"This was assigned summer reading for my 9th grader and fortunately, I read it first! I do not feel that such graphic desciptions of sex and violence are necessary to portray the circumstances in which Mathabane grew up. I found it a pity, actually, because the story is inspiring yet I could not get past the grapics in the first section. Needless to say, our 9th grader did NOT read this book. As important as it is to educate about the horrors in this world, I firmly believe that if youngsters are given this much graphic exposure we are perpetrating the crime upon their souls. Why can't writers find a way to express themselves in a higher more noble fashion? Then their important stories could be read by all. I can't believe that not one review mentioned this problem!"},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"According to the author, white South Africans all lived in mansions, drove Rolls-Royces and Mercedes, had herds of black servants treated worse than slaves, white children which had never seen black school children before etc etc. Mrs. Smith was buying for her son bicycles, roller blades, ping-pong tables and other stuff (all plural), which would requre storage space size of Walmart! Get real! I visited South Africa many times in 1970's, 80's and 90's and I can say that \\"Kaffir Boy\\" is another propaganda tool aimed at ignorant Americans. Author has his agenda, himself being the white-hater he is attempting to shape the public opinion in similar fashion.He is suspended in vacuum between the dead end street of tribalism (whatever happened to \\"when we were kings\\" idea - in the book his fater and his tribe are morons), and the world built by the white people he is longing for and hating at the same time.America of 1970's is shown as the promised land of equal opportunities for the blacks. It's 2003 now and the blacks still don't think so and there are cries for more affirmative action and never ending government handouts.Love this book if you are a heart bleeding liberal, but if you have any common sense, frequent inconsistiencies should be easy to spot. No doubt that the policy of racial segregation in South Africa was wrong and cruel, but this book is not a true story it claims to be. It's a mix of truth, lies and imagined fiction. It's meant to be the author's revenge, just like Jerzy Kosinski's \\"Painted Bird\\", which at the time of it's publication was a believable and true story, until dismissed years later as bunch of lies and garbage."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"I was rescently assigned this book to read for my Humanities class.

I did not like the book because of the word choice and plot.The word choice and plot in this book are not the best in quality. This book has a great amount of word choice. The writing is very descriptive. For an example, \\"I coughed and spit, and the spittle was all red with blood.\\" Plus, It talks about \\"poop and urine\\" being dumped on his body. The word choice made me want to throw up. The plot in the story was ok.The story was about kid who grows up in a world of hate, so he wants to go to America. All Mark does is go to school, play tennis, deal with his dad, and run from the peri-urben. The peri-urben are what we call police. All the peri-urbin do is try to bust people for not having there passbook in order. The passbook is a little black book that the black people must have. It tells the peri-urbin if you are married, have a job, if you pay your taxes, and if you have any kids. The peri-urben gave Mark the most trouble besides his dad, who kept nagging him to become a man.My opinion and recommendation about this book are very poor. My opinion about the book is two thumbs down. I did not have a favorite part in the book. The whole book was poor. I really did not like the book. If I could change one part in the story, It would be the word choice.I would not recommend this book because I found this book to be very boring and nauseating. I felt like I was going to throw up at times. You would have to really like to read Autobiographies to read this book. I don't think people under the 7th grade should read this book.As you can see, the book Kaffir boy is not a very good book unless you like Autobiographies.

The &quot;pornography&quot; involving young boys happened. NOT reading it, does not mean the situation never occured. It occurs EVERYWHERE!!! The phrase &quot;Ignorance is Bliss&quot; is often followed by many individuals who like to close their minds against reality.

It is a fine read indeed, but there are several things in the content of the book which I as a black South African, having lived in a South African ghetto during and after Apartheid, found Mr. Mathabane's book a bit too commercialized. I too come from the ghetto in SA. Despite the ills of Apartheid and oppression we suffered under the white minority. There were moments for happiness in our lives in the ghettos. Mr. Mathabane paints a picture in which he tells of his life as that of the worst among them all. It is troubling to see the way he distorts and diss our culture, food, and beliefs. His description of amasonja and murogo on page 63 is very disturbing to me. This is the food that kept us strong, we enjoyed this as young people or black families in our communities. True not everybody liked amasonja or murogo, but it wasn't filthy food. Also his description of eating blood (ubende), this is a delicacy among us Zulus, especially among children and families that value culture.It is also sad to see how he fails to give proper translations of things such as muhodu on pg 30, he says is cattle's lungs--NO its not; page 84 mfana is not a brat; page 6 pap is not porridge. These are just few of the things that have I found inaccurate.It just seems like the book had its intention of being a best seller, especially catering to the American society. Only for Mr. Mathabane to forget that one day us black South Africans will get hold of this book.I must say that at least ninety percent of the book is accurate, but the very elements of our cultures are not well represented in Kaffir Boy."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"This was an autobiography about an African American growing upduring apartheid South Africa. Who would have thought that we wereforced to read a book and actually enjoyed it? I found this book to be very interesting. Because even though Mark Mathabane was young and remembers his life vividly he does an excellent job describing the hardships that he went through. This book is also a good motivational book because his whole life he did not give up at his goals. He thought about giving up but never did because his mother motivated him. If his mother were not there he would never have never been what he is now. This book can also be used as an inspirational tool. It would be good for inspiring and having Mathabane as a role model because he went from scholing in the most cruel streets of South Africa's ghettos with a hard won education raised himself from humiliation to win a scholarship to an American university, which was almost impossible in South Africa during the apartheid era. This book was written so well that you could not get confused and understand everything very well. Mark Mathabane describes his life so detailed in this book that you can picture everything that you are reading happening in front or you. Untie I started reading this book for humanities I had never heard of the age of apartheid in South Africa where it was like slavery had not ended where the whites were treated like royalty and the blacks treated like trash. I thought that that they were all living together. This opened my eyes a little more because now I know that it was not only in South Africa that a race was treated so harsh but also in other parts of the world. Mathabane discusses the living conditions that the blacks had to endure, the poverty that they were in and how they were treated like animals. I think that Mathabane wrote this for the mature audience so the will understand what is going on in the world."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"This was a great read. Very interesting and sad story. Well written and I am now anxious to read other books from this author.HIghly recommended."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"KAFFIR BOY is a must read for anyone interested in what life was like for a young boy coming of age in Apartheid South Africa. Mark Mathabane describes in vivid detail the horror of poverty and brutality which was a way of life for black children and families living in the squalor city of Alexandria near Johannesburg, the affluent suburb in South Africa. His account is heartbreaking. Yet, Mark was able to do the unthinkable. He was able to escape (thanks to the support of men like Stan Smith), and lived to write about his horrifying experiences. KAFFIR BOY is interesting and important because Mark Mathabane writes in a style as if he is talking directly to the reader, thereby allowing the reader to fully understand what it was like coping with the cruelty and injustice of apartheid.I thought that parts of the book could have been penned more concisely. Also, it was difficult at times to understand the character of Mark's mother and father. Yet, Mark Mathabane's powerful and profound account/message of life in Apartheid South Africa far outweighs the minor flaws of this book. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"This book should be a must read for anyone. Reading this book made me thankful for all the advantages I have had in my life, and how badly people in other parts of the world have it. Even though apatheid is now abolished, this book still has an impact on you. It's amazing how much Mark Mathane had to overcome to be where he is today. His strength is unbelivable, and even though he had times when he thought he could not live the way he was living any longer, he overcame that an is now living in the USA. What is the most remarkable is his changing throughout the course of the book from a boy who vows never to step into the white world to a young man whos closest friends are whites.Though this book does have scenes that may be considered inappropriate by some, I feel that they were neccasary to fully convey the horrors of living in a black ghetto under apartheid. When Mark Mathabane came to my school to speak, it amazed me to see how far he has come. From reading Kaffir Boy, you know some of the most horrific moments in his life, and seeing him up on stage and having the courage to talk about it astounded me. Reading this book helped me gain a deeper appreciation for the world around me, and, if you choose to read this book, I hope that it will do the same for you."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"This book hits you right between the eyes. Having read some other works about South Africa, including books by Alan Paton, one of the best known writers produced by that country, about apartheid and the struggles associated with it, I was eager to read Mark Mathabane's story. He writes in a no-nonsense, incredibly honest way about the disturbingly unbearable conditions of life in the ghetto where he grew up in South Africa in one of the country's more turbulent times, the years prior to the formal dismantling of the brutally oppressive system of apartheid. By giving almost day by day, year by year recounting of the impossible odds he and his family faced, we get a true sense of the struggles of every black in the country; we feel deeply his struggle to overcome the sense of shame and guilt fostered by the Afrikaners who perpetuate the system; and equally his relief in encountering a very few sympathetic (liberal, as he calls them) whites who do their best to help him overcome the enormous odds he faced. The hate that this man encountered on a daily basis was painful to read about. However, this man was exceptional. Exceptional in his giftings, in every sphere, emotionally, intellectually and physically (he was the first black South African to obtain a tennis scholarship to the US), and his talent and drive obviously opened many doors for him. A very poignant moment is at the very end as he leaves his family and friends behind, not quite overtly stating perhaps the obvious fact that the less talented and opportunistic would continue to struggle in South Africa under the life-sapping system. I read this book in 2004. It was published in 1986, and obviously much has happened in that country in the past 18 years. I will be interested to read his later works, and see how his being removed from the system, and indeed the system being removed from his country, impacted his thinking, writing and life. He was a much younger man when this story was written, with a passionate heart, and I wonder (hopefully) whether he encountered the level of freedom and liberty that he so eagerly saw awaiting him in America as this story concluded."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"The autobiography &quot;Kaffir Boy&quot; by Mark Mathabane is a very engrossing and vivid novel. Mark Mathabane encountered hardships in his life that most of the people in this world cannot even imagine. Apartheid laws in South Africa affected the lives of all the black families in both their public and private lives. Mark Mathabane grew up in society where apartheid was in total effect. The gruesome experiences that Mathabane faced were sometimes too much to bear. However, with the support of his loving mother and grandmother, Mathabane succeeded in his education by being the top in his class. Aware of the unjust laws of apartheid, Mark Mathabane was determined to somehow make a change in the community he lives in. His passion for tennis was what helped him change his life. Even with all the obstacles in his life, Mathabane hopes to be able to study in America with a tennis scholarship. With hard work and perseverance his dreams came true eventually.&quot;Kaffir Boy&quot; is a very inspiring novel to everyone that is ambitious and hopeful. I learned so much through reading Mark Mathabane's autobiography. There is always hope and there is nothing impossible in this world, as long as we never give up in what we want to succeed in. With no doubt in mind, this novel is outstanding and worth it."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"Growing UpThe book Kaffir Boy, by Mark Mathabane is without a doubt a worthwhile read. Its unique detail and harsh reality is unparalleled by any other novel. It is the story of Johannes Mathabane, growing up in the racially unequal apartheid of South Africa. Throughout the book, he is treated under awful conditions, yet learns to persevere and comes out on top in a most heroic manner. It tells of overcoming all of the obstacles in his life - including his father, the government, and his tribal heritage. This book is not only enjoyable to read, but it is also an important book as it opens America's eyes to those less fortunate living under impossible odds.The book takes place in South Africa, where whites predominately rule. Johannes, who later changes his name to Mark, is a young boy just beginning to experience the hatred and racism in apartheid, a ghetto in Alexandra. The book starts out immediately showing the daily terror that he had to live. With constant raids, by the black police (headed by whites), Johannes soon develops a hate for all white people, as his parents have to constantly flee because their \\"passbooks are not in order\\". Things begin to go bad after his father is taken away to jail for a year. Poverty and hunger consumes their ever-increasing family. When his father returns, he is never the same. An internal struggle begins to develop within Johannes. He is torn between his father's tribal beliefs and the new changing era of schooling and Christianity. As he grows older his metamorphosis begins and a hatred starts to brew inside for his father. His mother turns his life around by enrolling him in school. He prospers greatly and begins to think differently of some whites as his exposure grows. Poverty is constant throughout the book, as is the disputes between him and his father. He makes it through school graduating the top of his class. It is after a few years of schooling that he is introduced to the sport tennis. This would be the changing moment in his life. Tennis opens his views to whites as he encounters those who want to help him succeed. He meets friends such as Andre and Stan who promise to help in fulfill his dreams. When everything seems to be going well in his life, revolts begin against the government which he quickly joins in. This disrupts his life and brings back his hate memories of whites. Although his life is chaotic during this period, he still manages to quench his thirst for knowledge and manages to excel in school and tennis. He begins winning tournaments as his metamorphosis slows almost to an end. He rebels against his fathers wishes, only to pursue his dream of going to America. Eventually he proves that he could overcome hate with his mothers love and embarks to an American college.Throughout this book, Johannes demonstrates tremendous heroic qualities in his quest for success. From the moment he is brought into the world, he is constantly defending himself and his family. He shows courage constantly during the entire story. This is demonstrated when he rebels against his father's tribal wishes, continues schooling even when it is unbearable, and when he refuses to quit playing tennis with whites even though its against the law. Another quality that Johannes has is his dedication. He refuses to quit school, because he promised his mother, and he practices tennis even when his family and political unrest go against it. He also is ambitious. He comes from a home with nothing, yet he sets high hopes and dreams and never forgets them. Also, Johannes has great resourcefulness. For his learning he was provided with very little yet he made the best of it to try and educate himself. He constantly read comics to try and prove to everyone that he is better than a \\"kaffir\\" boy. Lastly, and probably the most important quality he possesses, is that he loved his mother and never wanted to disappoint her. This was the driving force behind most of what he accomplished. All these qualities put together made Mark Mathabane a great, almost unstoppable, hero. He believed when no one else did, a very difficult yet inspiring task.This book is an unquestionable necessity for all to read. One reason is because of the rich detail that Mark was not afraid to write about. He crosses many racial borders and accurately describes the hell that he was forced to live in - such as the unsanitary conditions and constant fear. It is not a pretty book to read, as his truthfulness often leads to disturbing tales. But I emphasize its importance, because of its ability to grasp you and throw you right into this terrible world that most people wouldn't believe exists. This book is also very captivating. He makes you feel as if you are experiencing everything he did, a task which most writers aim for but fall short of. He powerfully conveys all his emotions- his stubbornness of his younger years, his anger at his father and his sadness at his torn family. Plainly spoken, it is a great story to hear. It's amazing that he was able to overcome such odds and hardship, and it inspires you to want to do something to end the racial oppression. The theme of a fallen, but not beaten hero appears throughout the entire book. It also does revert back to the old \\"good will always prevail over evil theme\\" as this presents itself in religion and racist disputes. This book is just as intoxicating as it horrific, which provides a sad but good read.When Mark Mathabane wrote \\"Kaffir Boy\\", he accomplished a great literary work, comprised of great emotion. This naked view into his life provides us with unbelievable detail. It should be appreciated not only as a book, but as his inspirational life poured onto pages. He proved to everyone that he could triumph over all the evils threatening him even if he didn't have all the necessary tools. This memoir is not to be overlooked, as his success story is like no other. He escaped degradation to accomplish his dreams. He showed heroism when it seemed unbearable and lives to this day to tell his story. This is a powerful and intensely moving story."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"Honestly, when I chose this book, I thought it was going to be a \\"whatever\\" book, like any other autobiography. I expected that I would feel sympathy for reading his the experiences in his life of apartheid, but I ended up feeling so much more than that. The way that Mathabane describes his hardships of the beatings he beared and living in poverty was descriptive, real, and takes an effect on the reader. Mathabane's strength was definitely getting the reader to imagine that one was acutally watching the obstacles he dealt with. There weren't any weaknesses that I personally noticed. Although, in order for the reader to get the full effect of what he went through, Mathabane was graphic and vulgar in his writing. Certain scenes were very graphic which can be uncomfortable to read, but it's showing the reality of this world, how it's nowhere close to perfect. I am interested in reading other books that Mark Mathabane has written, especially after reading Kaffir Boy. This book was very inspiring and motivating. It really showed how if you focus yourself and become determined to achieve something, your chances are great. After reading this autobiography, I feel thankful for everything I have today and anyone who reads this should feel the same."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"I have come a to rare realization. I think back to my years at Asbury Park High School and how there was little to no educated reading of books by or of black people, which I think is strange now as Asbury Park was a mostly black town. It wasn't until I eventually got to a black university that I learned more and more of my heritage, black history and what could become a black future.Oh, as good as they were, I read \\"The Crucible,\\" \\"The Pearl,\\" \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" etc. in Asbury Park, but not until Norfolk State U. did I even know \\"Kaffir Boy\\" existed. And what a travesty! I know all about white history and such. Someone asked me the other day how I even heard of a group called \\"Frankie Goes To Hollywood.\\" Because when I was growing up in the 80's, everything on MTV was white. I had never met a Chinese person except the goof in high school who got voted \\"Class Clown.\\" My favorite television show was \\"Tales of the Gold Monkey,\\" a show with no black characters. A great deal of black life, especially literature, is lost on today's youth because it was lost on yesterday's youth.Why were we spared the turmoil of Mark Mathabane's childhood? His oppression by evil soldiers who shared the darkness of his skin tone, as they forced him to practically dance in feces? His needs, yearns for a better life studying tennis at the tutledge of a kindly white sponsor? His fright at unexpected and often raids on his poor village by storm troopers ripe with power and arrogance yet bereft of dignity and compassion? Why didn't anyone tell me of this book when I was 15? Because if we're aware of the evils of the world when we are young, there will be unlimited resources for us to change it in the future."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"This is an autobiographical account of life in South Africa during the days of apartheid.It puts a human face to the horrors of apartheid.It is the story of how a boy and his family cope with life in the shantytowns that blacks were forced to live in.It details his experience during police raids,riots during the apartheid struggle and how the system limited the lives of 80% of South African citizens.He also details his experience in school and how he was saved from a life of drudgery and no opportunities by a tennis scholarship to the united states.It is also the story of family.It details the triumph of the human spirit.I recommend this book to anybody interested in knowing what life actually was during apartheid."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"I was at a school where this book was not allowed for assigned reading.

This kid is abused first by his father, who drinks and gambles away his wages, then by the sewage collectors, who shove his face in the muck as punishment for mocking them, and then by his teachers, who beat the kids daily. I'm not talking about the typical English school canings; this kid is beaten so bad that he can barely walk home.Today, South Africa's a mess.

Crowded with his family into a squalid dwelling in the township of Alexandra, he spent his childhood battling cold, rats and hunger and with raw sewage pooling just outside the family home. As he grew older and understood the bitter injustice under which his family and community lived, he became motivated to succeed both academically and to improve his increasing tennis skills; always dreaming of winning a tennis scholarship to an American university. He experienced at first hand the draconian pass laws, the institutionalised obstructiveness of petty officials and the fear felt by the black population for the state police and neighbourhood spies.There are graphic accounts of the township riots and the death of so many children which make this a harrowing, though essential, read for anyone interested in the history of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Kaffir Boy -","review":"I purchased this book for my son to do a project and he absolutely loved it!

But it was written by a Hare Krishna devotee and anyone buying it should anticipate an emphasis which reflects this orientation. There are vast sections on Vaisnava temples and saints and less thorough treatment of sages and sites reflecting other persuasions. Thus, you get 37 pages on Vrindaban and Mathura and only 11 on Varanasi. You get elaborate details on ISKCON and its founder Prabhupada and no mention at all of Ramakrishna, Vivekananda or Ramana Maharshi. In short, it lacks balance. But if you are primarily interested in Vaisnavism, it's a great resource."},{"Title":"Holy Places & Temples of India","review":"[...].

I know because he's touched my heart."},{"Title":"Sometime Poet","review":"I'll start by saying I loved this book and found it beautifully written. Every poem from start to finish is note worthy and every poem- impressive. Bob is obviously very talented and through the years I too have branded him a shining-star emerging, a poet, no doubt. I enjoyed this book and would like to single out a few poems that stood out profoundly and beautifully. I loved each poem but thought it best to narrow this down to my personal favorites in Sometime Poet.Mr. Browning's poem Lunatic was very impressive and set the mood, so to speak, for me. When he claimed &quot;I'll feel the stars shake and scramble away from me, 'til they whirl and cyclone, toss cylinders and ash in their haste to give me room,&quot; what a powerful message! Then his poem &quot;Pretty Eyes,&quot; impressed me also, with it's yearning, resistance, and overpowering final feeling of strength. &quot;A Reason For Song,&quot; was beautiful with it's line &quot;I write for the love of one woman...&quot; wow very impressive. This poem will capture you thoroughly and push you to surrender. &quot;Ready To Vow,&quot; was refreshing and simply beautiful and I enjoyed it immensely. &quot;Too Beautiful, Too Beautiful,&quot; wow, this poem is beyond words. Let me just say, it will capture your heart with the beautiful verses that flow with ease and intensity. In fact, this poem is one of my favorites; it just stays with you. &quot;A Dark Song&quot; was compelling with its truth and sincerity. His poem &quot;Vaguely&quot; seemed written about someone we have all met, someone seen with our own eyes as well as through his own. &quot;In The Corners, A Name,&quot;again, wow this poem and book will stick with you.

This one is a keeper."},{"Title":"The Great North Trail","review":"If you are a student of the American West you will be both disappointed and completely charmed by this work. Part of the American Trail Series edited by A.B. Guthrie, Jr. , this is less about The Great North Trail and its happenings as it is a series of very interesting stories about the American West. The book starts with the traditional land bridge between Russia and Alaska that in theory lasted from 200 million years up to roughly 10,000 years ago. Across this bridge and down the Rocky Mountains to Mexico and points south Dan Cushman describes the anthropology of early man and their descendants.Next the author fast forwards to Coronado and the Spanish period, searching for Zuni in Kansas, and from there the reader is on a wild tear across the West delving into things one never reads about: Spanish ranches in Wyoming that predate Lewis and Clark, a gold rush in British Columbia, the gold trails of Montana and cattle trails from Texas. Along the way one meets the outlaws Billy the Kid and Henry Plumber, cattle baron Print Olive, Blood Chief Calf Shirt, the booziest Indian of them all and Cattle Kate, the first woman ever lynched (she rustled some, they say). Cushman finally winds up with the Klondike Gold Rush and Prohibition.This book is about the settlement of the American West, but from the West's more interesting, darker, seamy side. It is about multiple gold rushes and their impact on very transient, unstable population centers; about theft, the taking of things away from other men like land, gold or cattle; and about booze, the quite necessary lubricant that eased the fatigues of search and helped rationalize the mind. But most of all it is about the brash bawdy early American West.It is a well written good book you will enjoy."},{"Title":"The Unwelcome Child","review":"I couldn't put this book down! I loved everything about it. The characters are very real - and ANNIE is hysterical. What an amazing combination: it's a thriller in every sense of the word - really scary - but the author has such a great sense of humor, there's always comic relief around the corner. Some of the best dialogue I've ever read. Also love that it's driven by a serious issue - abortion - and shows you both sides without being preachy. It would make a great feature film. I will read everything Pampellone writes!"},{"Title":"The Unwelcome Child","review":"I had never heard of author Terese Pampellonne until I came across her book \\"The Unwelcome Child\\" in a used bookstore. The premise of the story seemed interesting and I finished it within two days. The story is quite compelling and well-written - Annie Wojtoko is a B-grade actress who makes a comfortable living in NY and happy with her independent and free-spirited life. When she gets a distress call from her best-friend since childhood, Jan Hostetter, she decides to visit her friend. Jan and her husband Kevin have recently bought and moved into an old Victorian home in a place called Sea Thistle Hill, near Martha's Vineyard. The house itself has a sordid history - it used to be a home for unmarried mothers and also an abortion clinic, run by a sinister woman named Sybil Clayton who was convicted of murdering five infants and sent to Eloise asylum to live out the rest of her days.When Annie arrives, Jan is about seven months pregnant and behaving weirdly - she confides in Annie that her marriage is in trouble, and also that she feels her pregnancy is due to the house's 'influence', specifically, she thinks it's due to the spirit of a dead girl who used to live there, Sybil's daughter. Jan is also under the sinister influence of Gail Ruskers, a seventy-year- old midwife who tells Jan that her baby will die if Jan leaves the house.With all of these weird happenings, it is left up to Annie to try and help Jan. Annie is a cynic about the supernatural, but as she spends more time in the house, she finds her cynicism being challenged as she herself experiences all sorts of strange and inexplicable occurences. The rest of the story deals with what happens to Jan and her baby and Annie's struggles to help her friend.I found the story was well-developed - of all the characters, Annie Wojtoko's is the most well-delineated and developed and she comes across as a likable woman who has some past issues to deal with. She is also strong and sticks to her convictions, and what makes her all the more appealing is her ability to see humor even in the most trying times. Jan's character seemed a typical stereotype to me - of the weak-willed hypocondriac who is easily manipulated. It was hard to feel sympathy for her character. There are other characters that are interesting like Ryan, Jan's opinionated lesbian sister and Gail Rusker, the sinister midwife with a hidden agenda.All in all, I found this novel to be a riveting read. If you are a fan of horror authors like John Saul, you might enjoy this. I tried looking for other works by this author, but sadly could not find any. Final verdict: an above-average supernatural read."},{"Title":"The Unwelcome Child","review":"This book tried to be an edge of your seat thriller, but it fell short of the mark. In fact, the whole story fell short of anything but competely silly.Annie travels to Martha's Vineyard to help out her pregnant friend Jan and Jan's husband, Kevin. The house Jan and Kevin are living in turns out to be rich in abortion history. It was once a home for wayward girls. The head mistress of the home brewed a tea concoction which induced labor before it's time. Babies who were born full term were smothered in their sleep. Jan's midwife is a scary individual who is in complete control of Jan and has even convinced Jan that she can't leave the house or allow a doctor to examine her or else her unborn child will die.The story trys to incorporate spirits, horror, and mystery, but just reads like a middle-schooler's attempt at writing a book. I don't know where the author was trying to go during this story, but she ended up stalled out in the middle of nowhere without a triple A membership. I gave it 2 stars because anyone who makes the effort deserves one star and the fact that the book had brief creepy moment awards it another star. My overall advice is there's too many great books out there to waste your time on this one."},{"Title":"The Unwelcome Child","review":"Here is a novel that breathes new life into the haunted house genre, take it from me, a haunted house story fan! It is a modern, fast paced, character-driven thrill ride set in a Victorian mansion on Martha's Vineyard. The mansion is surrounded by a pine forest on one side and water on the other, but the true darkness of the property on Sea Thistle Hill does not lie without--it lies within. A horrible thing happened in the house during the winter of 1919, a circumstance that has festered, infecting each brick and timber of the mansion for nearly a century until 1995, when the new residents move in. Jan Hostetter and her husband become the proud new owners of Sea Thistle Hill with dreams of turning the old house into a bed and breakfast. Their lives are nearly perfect but for a child they've been told they would never be able to conceive. But shortly after moving into the mansion, Jan becomes pregnant. Her best friend, Annie, who has come to help Jan, is ecstatically happy for her friend...at first. It slowly begins to become clear to Annie that Jan's pregnancy is nothing to rejoice. Rather, the arrival of Jan's child is and event to dread, because something is very wrong with Jan's pregnancy. And something is very wrong with the house on Sea Thistle Hill. The mansion's violent past history has become malignant and Annie is Jan's only hope. A truly unnerving novel from a writer of formidable talents."},{"Title":"The Unwelcome Child","review":"I read a decent amount of new horror/suspense novels, and most of them aren't very engaging. Obviously, since I wrote a cover blurb for the book, I recommend this one, but blurbs don't tell the whole story. The Unwelcome Child has a lot to say about motherhood, loss, longing, and living despite it all. At turns creepy and uplifting, it's a ride you won't soon forget. I can't wait for Pampellone's next.Thriller writer Scott Nicholson"},{"Title":"The Unwelcome Child","review":"Terrific read with people acting and reacting the way REAL people would when facing odd and frightening situations.The only problem I had was that in a book about pregnancy and pro-life versus pro-choice, it seems EVERY character is either pregnant, miscarries, had an abortion, is an orphan, etc. It gets a little over the top, the story is maybe 50 pages too long, but it breezes along nicely and I look forward to more by this writer."},{"Title":"The Unwelcome Child","review":"This was my first Terese Pampellone book and let me tell you, I can safely ad her to my new favorite writers because this book was very good indeed.Annie Wojtoko is our main character as we get to know about her cool ways in the beginning where she encounters many crazy things that go on in her daily life. She is such a solid and likable character that I would read many more stories with her in, although all of the characters were executed perfectly. This book was haunting, creepy and just when you thought that the weird stuff was your imagination, more things happen to Jan who is Annie's pregnant friend as we learn the terrible truths about the house she lives in. Apparently as this was a house for runaway pregnant girls at the beginning of last century and there is a ghost story woven through about the missing girl Sarah, daughter of the previous Owner, Sybil Clayton.Somehow Jen who was thought as sterile gets pregnant right after she moves into the house and runs into the spooky mysterious Gail, who ends up promising to be Jan's midwife but tells her that she can't leave the house that got her pregnant because the baby will die.Well from there weird things go on, missing bodies, strange medications hidden in the basement, the real horrors that happened at the house before, Annie's struggle to keep Jan's falling marriage together and her own missing period as she stays at the house to help Jan. As it seems that all females in the house get pregnant easily they also end up losing what they love the most.This book was very real, had tons of witty charm, summer storms and secrets hidden in the attic and characters who had ulterior motifs, down to what happened to Jan and her baby in the end - a great ending that left me covered in Goosebumps I will say.This was a real quick and engrossing read, I will highly recommend it for some juicy summer reading. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Unwelcome Child","review":"Somewhere underneath all those silly character stereotypes is a decent story screaming to get out. Unfortunately, I found myself chuckling at the absurdity of things more often than I was creeped-out by the horror of the story. None of the characters is very likable or even remotely sympathetic. With the exception of the ghost, you get the impression every other major character brings most of their misery upon themselves. It's hard to root for the heroine when you spend most of the read shaking your head and/or laughing at her. Again, there's a decent story buried amidst the political and social stereotypes. If you're willing to overlook a good deal of silliness, it's a decent enough story to kill a few hours."},{"Title":"The echo of the black horn,: An authentic tale of \\"the Governor\\" of \\"The Free State of Jones.\\"","review":"Well written page turner.I am amazed that a movie has not been made of this book,or maybe it has and I hadnt seen it or heard of it."},{"Title":"The echo of the black horn,: An authentic tale of \\"the Governor\\" of \\"The Free State of Jones.\\"","review":"THIS BOOK GIVES YOU AMAZING INSITE INTO THE WORLD OF ANTE-BELLUM AND POST CIVIL WAR SOUTH.IF YOU ARE A FAN OF HISTORICAL EVENTS OR PERIODS,THIS IS A MUST READ(ALTHOUGH HARD TO FIND)BOOK.AMAZINGLY ACCURATE."},{"Title":"Tudor and Elizabethan Fashions (Dover Fashion Coloring Book)","review":"I just purchased these Dover COloring Books for my mother and she loves them.

I especially love the fashions in the Tudor and Elizabethan fashions. His descriptions of the fashions and clothing of the times make the books unique and fascinating. Make sure you have plenty of color pencils on hand, though, because the books are too detailed for crayons. I would not recommend this book for impatient people or children because the coloring of the drawings can be tedious (up to 1-2 hours for one drawing depending on the book and the outfit, but then again, I'm a perfectionist)."},{"Title":"Cruising Guide N J Waters","review":"Captain Donald Launer is one of the more knowlegeable sailors along the New Jersey shore. He lives there and is devoted to marine arts and sciences as they effect boaters.His book is scrupulously accurate, unusually readable, and more than interesting for sailor, motorboater or just an interested reader.Although the book is sequential in form, in that it presents a travalogue from New Jersey's dramatic Palisades to rather scruffy Trenton Falls, it is equally useful as a reference book; the organiztion is outstanding.Captain Launer has also kindly provided a fairly complete reference section.This is a &quot;must book&quot; for any skipper who wishes to cruise New Jersey Waters. A great gift for any Garden State boater."},{"Title":"Cruising Guide N J Waters","review":"&quot;A Cruising Guide to New Jersey Waters&quot; is a delightful sail up all the little tidal rivers, through the marshes, backbays &amp; canals - a waterway tour around peninsula New Jersey.

If you want to really go off the beaten track, forget the popular tourist guides &amp; check out books like this one."},{"Title":"Cruising Guide N J Waters","review":"Captain Launer is an articulate, informative, and entertaining guide.

We vote this as a good gift for an adult or high school graduation gift for a kid who is \\"Curious\\" . If you are a grown up it is nice to have the whole set in one big book. BUT if you are a kid- nothing beats getting a hardcover single story book off the shelf and going through three or four stories. Worth the cash in hardcover for a collector. Soft cover is a great gift, and for tots- buy the series as individual books.\\"George was curious...\\"This is the phrase that lets every child know that the main character of George is about to encounter some mischief. This is a children's classic book and was created by a English speaking writer who lived in Brazil. H.A. REY and his wife were enchanted by the monkeys outside of their window and the antics surrounding how curious they were. This was not his the writers first character it is just his most popular series I encourage readers to buy the series of these books because they are the most fun read a few stories at a time.

I nearly cried when the Man In The Yellow Hat forgave George after another one of his ruckuses. George is quite the rapscallion, I must say. We can all learn something from the young monkey who always gets into trouble. Can he even be compared to Heathcliff, that wacky, tricky cat?! Perhaps the two should engage in a battle of the wills.

I assumed the stories would be like other Curious George books I've read. However, the first story made my daughter cry because the man with the yellow hat throws George in a bag and takes the scared little monkey out of his homeland. Then they give him a pipe to smoke and everything is better. It was just shocking because it is so different than the other stories I've read. I wish I had previewed the story before I read it to her.I also didn't like that characters, including George, smoked. I realize this story was written in the 1940s, but I wasn't expecting this because the newer Curious George stories I've read to her were like that. I guess I didn't remember that from when I was a child. While I wish the characters didn't smoke in the stories, I use that to discuss the topic of smoking and the fact that people didn't use to know better and that's why so many people became addicted.Just to clarify, it's only the first story that my daughter didn't like.

Great little set at a great price, would recommend it to anyone ."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"This book is so fantastic. It's so nice to have all the original George stories together, and it's so brightly colored and beautifully printed. The copy I received has been extremely durable so far.Also, a lot of people complained about the size and weight of the book, but it's really not unmanageable. I took the jacket off (the cover is bright and attractive all on its own) and that helps a lot because it makes the book less slippery. It's about the size of any large picture book, and only somewhat heavier. My 19 month baby has no problem picking it up, carrying it around, or flipping through the pages. Granted, he is big for his age, but he's never dropped it on his toe or had any trouble with it. So I think people might be exaggerating or being a wee bit overprotective when they say you can't just put it on the shelf and let the child take it down themselves. I mean, maybe I wouldn't put it on a really high shelf, but as I say it hasn't been any trouble for a toddler not even two years old."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"We love george books in our house! i liked that you had a lot of stories mixed into one book."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"This book was given to my friend's kids along with a stuffed Curious George.

They absolutely love it! I accidentally purchased one of the \\"new\\" Curious George books, before this and it was definitely not as good as the originals.

Who knew an old monkey from Africa could make a little girl so Happy?"},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"My three children love this book. I have 3 yr. old boy and girl twins and a 2 yr. old daughter. They want to read it everyday. We read Curious George Goes to the Hospital at least once a day and sometimes more. The stories are rather long but this is always the first book they choose and one story is never enough. I have always heard of Curious George but never read one of the books. I am very pleased with this book and the pictures are the best. They can sit down and tell the story to themselves by looking at the pictures. I now understand why Curious George is so popular still today."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"When I was a child, curious George was one of my favorites, and now this fine book allows me to pass along George's adventures to my own children. Perhaps the best thing about this book is that it contains so many curious George stories. You could read a different story each night for several nights. My children have quickly become as fond of George as I was when I was a child. The accompanying illustrations are very colorful and they definitely grab a young child's attention. I highly recommend this fine children's book. It is a great book to share with your children and perhaps serve as a reminder to your own childhood."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"They took parts of full length Curious George books to make them into board books. This made my 33 month both delight in the books but also want to hear the full length books a couple weeks later."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"This collection begins with an interesting history about the authors and making of the Curious George series, geared more for the adult reader than the child. It is followed by five separate Curious George stories.I downloaded the Curious George collection for my daughter, who has a whole collection of Curious George paperback books. She is in kindergarten and is able to read the stories; but they tend to run long, so she tires and needs me to help her finish.The Kindle version sports the familiar illustrations, although they are in black and white. Sometimes, an illustration in the paperback version would span two pages, which makes it awkward in the Kindle version because my daughter only sees half the illustration on a page at a time. She understands what is happening, because she has the paperback version at home; but this can be a problem for young children. Otherwise, this is a great collection for the price and a wonderful one to have when traveling with children."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"I absolutely adore this box set. It was purchased as a gift for my toddler when she was about 14 months old. The books range in complexity from the very simple \\"Curious George Rides\\" to the more detailed \\"Curious George Goes Fishing.\\" When we first opened the box set, my daughter could only sit through the most simple book, but now she is able to listen to 3 out of the 4 without getting too wiggly. She loves George and makes her monkey sounds when she wants me to read it to her. These are definitely among her very favorite books."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"The Curious George series was my absolute favorite when I was a child, and I was born much after they first came out.The Curious George books are perfect for any child. Curious George plays out every child's dreams; some stories, such as Curious George Goes To The Hospital, make unfamiliar and scary experiences friendly and familiar. The man in the yellow hat helps George, but doesn't dominate his adventures. The writing style succeeds in capturing George's mind frame and will make you laugh. Most of all, there is always a richly developed plot that leads to a powerful, happy conclusion, but not before George learns a lesson. Nobody ever discourages George's curiousity, except jokingly. The watercolors are warm and familiar. Indeed, I've forgotten about most of my children's books except the Curious Georges.In an age where children's books are mostly condescending, hyper-PC, no-suspense junk, Curious George seems almost perfect. Buy this for all the children in your family."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"I purchased this book before the birth of my first son, and began reading it to him at a very early age. It quickly became one of his favorites, and at two-and-a-half, it's going to be with us for awhile. Like most of those purchasing this book, it was probably bought for the adult more than for the child, but it certainly is enjoyable when the child develops an appreciation and love for a character that the parent affectionately remembers.The book includes several stories of Curious George, a monkey who is befriended (?) by a man wearing a yellow hat and suit. Being from Kentucky, I was stunned that so many reviewers were shocked, surprised, or \\"put off\\" by the use of tobacco products by so many characters in the book, including George. I personally didn't like George's illustrated expression when he was shown the needle immediately prior to receiving an injection, and I usually try to awkwardly skip this page in that particular story. It is also surprising that so few were saddened by George's capture from his freedom in Africa, placed in a bag by the man with the yellow hat, and taken to live in captivity in a zoo. Let me say, however, that these stories are, and rightfully should be, endearing to preschoolers, while perhaps innapropriate for older children, for those extremely inclined to political correctness.The tales of George's curiosity (and misbehavior) landing him into trouble, but with a good ending always, are treasured by children and parents alike. We need more books such as this.Buy this for yourself and child or grandchild, and share something special with them."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"These books were purchased for a one year old and are very sturdy and will last for a long time. My grandchild is too busy to sit still for more than a few pages at a time, but these books are small enough for him to hold and point to the pictures and enjoy on his own. We read to him by naming the pictures, but the reading experience can never begin too young."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"My 3-year-old wants only this book every night. And I enjoy the leisurely pace of the dialog, and the clever and charming illustrations. I also like that the stories are somewhat longer than her previous favorites as a challenge to her attention span.The treatment of animals sometimes seems a little anachronistic. I don't personally see any harm in this, but I think there are parents nowadays who might not be keen on the story with the pet bunnies, the depiction of a zoo that has a bunch of cages, or the story with the travelling performing animal show.The binding on our book has been quite durable. Perhaps if you get one that falls apart as described by a previous reviewer you should just return it and ask for a new one? My daughter has a Disney Princess storybook that I WISH would fall apart! ;-D"},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"I recently purchased this book as a 34 year old with no children of my own, perhaps only to reconnect with a literary mammal that played such a huge role in my own childhood.

You already know the adventures, but you'll be surprised at what this trip into your past will do for your soul. Buy this book and make yourself happy.

In any event, my sister--her mom--was thrilled when I recently presented this small treasure as the latest addition to the ever-growing collection.Recommended with gusto--the only way you could possibly improve upon it is to buy each story in the collection separately, the sizes of which would be easier for kids to handle.

I am so happy to able to share these stories with her!"},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"Two stars means \\"don't like it\\", which is true for me. I love Curious George and so does my child. I was excited to get this book for her so we could celebrate the classic stories. However I hadn't realized that in the original stories The Man in the Yellow Hat was sneaky and manipulative. To start he tricks George while in the jungles of Africa using his hat and then bags him up and ships him off to a zoo. Later he wants to use George to make a movie, and this is the reason he gives the nurse to keep George well in the hospital. Lot's of characters smoke pipes, including George before bedtime (which is not something he does and gets in trouble for, but is acceptable). Some of the lessons about his curiosity are bit extreme like breaking his legs or having to have open surgery. There's quite a bit that I didn't like. What I love about modern George is the lessons that are taught. I realize this is an old book and things were different at the time; the book was afterall written in Europe just around the time of Nazi Germany. I appreciate the book, but it's not something I want to share with my child at this point. There's a reason we wait till kids are older to talk about certain things and although some reviewers say that this books is a chance to expose them to reality, I prefer to wait and not use Curious George who is currently a role model/teacher of good lessons in life."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"I dimly remember reading the \\"George\\" books years ago. When I saw this collection, I couldn't resist buying it for my daughter.In a word, it's wonderful!The stories are entertaining, if unpredictable. In \\"Curious George gets a medal\\", he goes from trying to write a letter to 'borrowing' a pump and cow to riding in an experimental rocket. In \\"Curious George rides a bike\\", he goes from riding a bike to making paper boats (I learned how to do it from this book!) to appearing in a circus.The drawings themselves are also wonderful. H.A. Rey had impeccable style. And rather than be completely obsessed with the current political 'incorrectness' of showing people smoking or the minimal presence of minorities, I choose to be amused by the perspective that's given of the 40s, 50s, and 60s-it's sort of a time capsule of the period.(similarly, original Star Trek says more about the 60s than it does about the future...)Additional material providing the history and origin of George is fascinating- it's a good read for the grownups.The binding of the book is pretty durable, although it's starting to show some wear and tear. It's a havy book, but our 21-month old can carry it around.... and bring it to us when she wants to hear one of the stories yet again...Maybe that's the biggest downside- your children may enjoy it to the point that YOU get sick of it!"},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"Right now my 7 mo old isn't quite as INTO these books as I had hoped, but I'm not too disappointed since I know she'll grow into them and learn to love Curious George as much as I did when I was a child. I like how there are 4 different stories to choose from and in sturdy board book form. The box is nice with a carrying handle. The stories are abridged, based on other Curious George full-length books, so if you're looking for the entire story, you need to skip the board books, but for babies with shorter attn spans, this is the perfect length. I guess my baby is still at the age where she enjoys BRIGHT and BIG pictures, and less wordy."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"Nice, sturdy books. Stories are concise for short attention spans. I can usually get through a whole book before my 4-month old gets antsy. She likes the pictures and turning the pages is easy for her since the books are so little."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"The stories in The Complete Adventures of Curious George are as captivating to my 3 year old as they were to me as a child. This is a wonderful compendium of timeless classics."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"I read these to my son since he was a baby and he loved them! These definitely interested him in the \\"real,\\" full-length George books when he got older."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"My 3 year old daughter has recently discovered Curious George so while looking for a few books to buy her, I came across this one and thought that for the price, it was a great value. I was right. She loves the stories and we read them over and over. We have had no trouble with the binding or any other aspects of the book construction. It's been fun for my husband and I to read the background information about the Reys and how George came to be and how he's evolved. We were both George fans when we were kids so it's great fun to be able to share him with our daughter. I'd buy this again in a heartbeat."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"Curious George was a very funny book. You could laugh at any time in the book. Curious George is so cute!! You just want to cry when he leaves his homeland with all of his friends and bannanas still there.This book tells that George is always going to be a little curious. When he meets this man his life changes like no other. Then he starts an whole new adventure in his life. He starts to get in lots trouble. Some people just don't know what to do with him. First, he accidently called the fire department and the fire department thought there was a real fire i the house but there was just a naughty monkey. So, Curious George got locked up in jail but, just wait he escapes from jail by tricking the gaurd. Then he flys away with a dozen of ballons with a holding tight grip. To the rescue the man saves george's life. The man paid for all the balloon's George flew away with and on the way he went."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"My 3-year-old son loves this book. It's a little bit heavy, but he can carry it across the room. These are some of his favorite stories and they have stood the test of time well.His favorite request is the one about George learning the alphabet. It's also the longest one as well and sometimes I grown when he asks for it at bedtime. All the letter shapes are present as pictures of things which start with the letter and both uppercase and lowercase are included. I'm no teaching expert, but it seems like he's learning a little bit about the relationship between sounds and letters.Some people have noted that the binding on this book is not strong. Ours seems indestructible. We've had this since Christmas (7 months ago) and with 2 active boys under 4, our house is no place for wimps or wimpy products. Maybe someone got one which is defective. Soft-cover books seem to fare much worse in our playroom."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"I loved George so much when I was little, even before I could read. My mom bought me one and she ended up buying all the other Georgefs books. Mine were written all Japanese, George's books are everywhere in the world and famous. I am 36 year-old (!) now, I still can remember some of the stories I read and adorable drawings of the books. I think this book even had an influence my \\"personality development\\" as a child. Good influences such as: be independent, be curious, be creative, be bold, be unique, be humorous, be even a little rebellious, be lovable. Very good chilren's book."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"My Dad used to read Curious George stories to me as a child, and it became my favorite book. I had forgotten about it until recently, and now that my husband and I are expecting our first child, I wanted to start a childrens' book collection of my old favorites. The baby is not here yet, but I am enjoying the book myself!"},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"These stories are great. We love Curious George. However, the board books in the box set have thinner and flimsier cardboard pages than the singly-sold board books. They bend easily in my toddler boy's hands (who isn't gentle with books), so I'm saving them for later when he's older."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"7 Book ReviewBy: Indira PlaisimondCurious GeorgeBy: Margoret & H. A. ReyThe book, Curious George, By Margoret & H. A. Rey, is about a monkey named George. George lives with his dad, (his adopter) who helps George go through all his wild adventures. For example: when George goes to the dentists, or doctors. Or when he went to the fire station. My favorite one is when George went to an amusement park, and found a yellow hat. He also meets an elephant, who's in a circus.I loved that book so much, that I still have it! It was originally my little cousin's, but I read it to him, so it's practically mine!!! I read the book when I was 8 in a half, and my cousin at the time, was 6 in a half. I would recommend this book to young and new readers. Well, just if you like journey books with a monkey as the main character.I liked the book most when George met the elephant. I loved elephants. But now I love polar bears. I didn't like the way that in most of the books, George's father had to at one point, stop all the fun, and take George home. That's always the worst part, when the book ends."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"Every night, my 3-year old daughter has to have the first Curious George story read to her. We've read all the other ones, but the first one is her favorite. It's gotten to the point that I've memorized all the words -- which is exactly my point: I love each and every one of them. Curious George is still every bit as wonderful the hundredth time through! A minor warning: characters in the books, including Curious George, do smoke, which does worry the father in me just a bit. All in all, though, it doesn't get much better than these classics."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"We bought this for my daughter's second birthday. She LOVES Curious George and we thought this would be a perfect present. She loves it! There were a couple of things we were surprised about: George smokes a pipe in the first story and in another they talk about a \\"fat\\" man (which is not something we really want our daughter repeating). However, considering when these books were written we can over look those things and when our daughter is ready we can tell her how we feel about smoking and calling people unkind names. Those small things definitely DO NOT detract from the appeal of this book. The colors are bright - the stories are engaging. My daughter LOVES it - and that is really all that matters (and it makes her want to read more - which we love)."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"This review is for the digital version only. I would be happy if it just showed the page as it appears in the print version. Instead the print version page fills slightly more than half the screen and the text is repeated again on the bottom of the screen. We love the digital Dr. Seuss on our ipad. This version is the exact opposite of that, nothing added and the pictures are tiny. Need an option to remove redundant text bar. Pass on the digital edition until they can get this right."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"My son loves Curious George, and he is wild about this collection of classic stories. It's a very nice collection with an interesting brief biography about Margaret and H.A. Rey at the end."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"In the first week of August we took our two children - aged 4 1/2 and 2 1/2 - to see the movie of Curious George. Both loved it. As a matter of fact my wife and I had never before enjoyed a childrens movie as much as we did this one about Curious George.However the stories aren't translated in Dutch yet, so we decided to buy this complete collection instead. It's great! The adventures of Curious George translate very easily in Dutch while reading it aloud to the children, and the children love to make up their own stories looking at the terrific drawings of Curious George and all his friends. Bedtime has become the best time, 'cause that's Curious George time!"},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"The first few stories are certainly classics. Further adventures in the book are not as fine, but they certainly do entertain. George is so cute. That darn monkey!"},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"This book is beautiful. The paper is high quality and the illustrations are stunning. The stories are really fun. The only problem is that several characters in the book (including George the monkey) smoke. I simply use this as a teaching moment..."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"I have purchased several curious george books for my children. These early stories do not have much direction and are not as well written as ones today. I did not read them as a child. My unbias opinion is to skip it."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"I have a hardbound copy of this book, and was excited to purchase it for Kindle because it would be much more compact and lightweight, as well as always having it with me between Kindle and iPhone. The stories in this book are excellent, and I would highly recommend buying a print version, but I was so disappointed with the Kindle edition that I returned it for a refund.The problem with the Kindle edition is that there is no easy way to navigate to each story. This could easily be solved if the table of contents was built into clickable links that would take you to the right location, or even if the book used page numbers so you could reference the TOC and use the Go To feature to go to the corresponding page. Instead, without either of these features, you are left to guess at what Location number each story starts at, and then keep trying until you finally get there or get nearby.My initial plan of attack was to spend half an hour tracking down the Location for the start of each story, and then to put a note on the first page of the book telling me the Location number for each title. Instead, I realized that having to do this was not worth the $17 I paid for the book, and I sent a complain to Amazon and was issued a refund.I was also a little disappointed with the formatting of this edition. As is done with a lot of other children's books on Kindle, larger images are put into the book as the full image, and then broken into halves so you can see more detail. This makes sense for continuous pictures that run across two pages, but so many of the images in this book are composed of several parts and could have been broken down into separate image files for better display on Kindle. A great example of this is inCurious George and the Firefighters.Don't let this review deter you from the content of the printed editions - these are great stories and this is a great collection (I would rate those at 5 stars). But if you're thinking of buying the Kindle edition, I'd suggest buying each story separately rather than in this collection - that is, unless the publisher revises the formatting a bit."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"Bought it for a 1-year old who likes to hold it in her hand and wave it around and casually chew on it. Her 4-year old sister likes the ease of turning the pages and claims George is her favorite. Then she proceeds to \\"read\\" aloud to the younger one by describing what she sees. Purchase is a success!"},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"Critters are huge at my house. Love Robert Stanek's Bugville Critters and love Curious George. In print, this is one of the better values, and I'm talking specifically about the super-sized anniversary edition with Curious George, Curious George Gets a Medal, Curious George Flies a Kite, Curious George Rides a Bike, Curious George Goes to the Hospital, Curious George Takes a Job, and Curious George Learns the Alphabet. With the slip cover put away, it is a regular read at bedtime."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"Item was in excellent condition as stated. Delivery was quick.

More evidence that less publisher and more author is just better."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"Great book. Great story. I love how the monkey portrays the curious nature of the readers intuitive mind. What an opportunity."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"My daughter loves George. She has several George books which are compilations of stories. Such books are great for when she's sitting on my lap and I'm reading to her. But they are harder for her to flip through on her own without tearing the pages. And, they are larger so they are not that easy to carry around. Also, since the compliation books contain many stories, they are a little overwhelming for her when she is trying to \\"read\\" to herself. (My child is not yet two so she cannot actually read but she likes to try.). So, this set is a nice alternative when my child wants to look at George books and \\"read\\" on her own. Each book is a sturdy board book that contains only one story. They are the perfect size for toddler hands. The illustrations are nice. The books come in a cardboard carrying case. The case is nice for taking the set to Grandma's house or other trips. We are happy with the purchase."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"We purchased this set for our 1 year old and he still loves them at age four. The stories are the perfect length, long enough to be interesting but not too long. The books themselves are sturdy enough withstand the tortures of a rough toddler. And our pre-schooler loves putting them in the box to carry around \\"his\\" books.

The book is large and has all the original art work, so yes there is smoking in there, but they should never mess with classics to begin with.

A great buy!"},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"I've always been a fan of Curious George - and after seeing the exhibition at the Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco last spring, I was motivated to get some books for my nephew. The \\"Complete Adventures\\" was sold out at the gift shop and I had to wait for it on Amazon, too - but when I got it, I was excited to note that there was also a CD. I'm going to have to wait a few years for my nephew's feedback since he's only 18 months old. :)"},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"This big yellow book has 7 stories.

She's had them now for about 4 months."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"This book is my daughter's absolute favorite. The simplistic but clearly written narration just sucks her in. Although I love the book I sometimes want to read her something new or different at bedtime but she won't have it. The only story that doesn't really fit is 'George Learns the Alphabet' although even that has given her an idea of how letters make words and words make stories.

His intentions are always good, but he finds himself in unpredictable and sticky situations. Add that to his irresistible charm and the colorful drawings and you have a light-hearted and fun story.

When I saw that these are combined in one book, it went to the top of my wish list for Christmas, and I was delighted to receive it. Perhaps it's just been so many years since I read it, but I was drawn into the artwork even more deeply than I'd known to appreciate as a child (so apparently simple, but then so very engaging) and still giggled out loud at the stories (and wondered what would happen next since I'd forgotten). Sure, in today's times a book for children that involves snatching up a wild monkey and includes smoking or drinking probably isn't nearly as acceptable as it was in the days I grew up (just fine in my opinion, by the way), but this was for me - an all grown up kid who still loves, loves, loves the adventures of a very curious little monkey above all else, even more than I remembered. The book feels nice and hefty, and the pages are so, so smooth, too. I know the ones from the library as a kid were not nearly so smooth, so this was an extra treat!"},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"My mother got this set for my 16 month old daughter (her nursery is in a Curious George theme).

The content of this collection is unimpeachable, so I'll pass and skip onto what downgraded the collection.In short, this is a very shoddily constructed book. My wife and I carefully handled it when reading to our son, but within a couple days the page bundles were separating from the binding in two spots. This has progressed at such a rate that the whole book is threatening to come apart.This is inexcusable, particularly given the thickness of the book. If you make a collection like this that will be heavily used and will certainly be handled less than gingerly by children, you better make it strong. That ours got wonky while being read from by two responsible adults makes it worse. Shame on Houghton Mifflin for producing such a poorly made book!We purchased \\"The Complete Adventures of Curious George\\" in the hopes of saving a few dollars over purchasing all seven of the included stories separately. In light of the poor quality, though, it has proven itself to be a terrible value. Check out other options rather than purchasing a book sure to self-destruct."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"I bought this book when my three year old was born, and we have been reading it ever since. We can read other books during the day, but at night, only Curious George will do. Since the stories are rather long (50-60 pages, albeit with large text and lots of pics), I now have my son read the stories to me, and he has memorized them all by using the illustrations as cues. We also have discussions about how George must feel in different situations, and what we would do if we were in his place. For both the story lines and the wonderful, colorful illustrations we rate &quot;The Complete Adventures of Curious George&quot; a classic among classcs for children."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"I added this book to my registry because Curious George is a book I remember loving strongly when I was very young.

The books are all board books and each one has the bright and delightful cartoons that I remember inside.While my baby is still too young to get the gist of the stories, she does enjoy chewing on the book, hehe, and the bright colors keep her attention.

Does anyone really believe these stories will lead children to think that it is a good idea to go off with someone who throws a sack over their head? These are absolutely delightful books that generations of children have enjoyed and read to their own children. George is a hero kids can understand. He gets into predicaments because of his curiosity, but he has a conscience, knows when he has messed up, and always makes amends for his behavior--lessons desparately needed these days. People will be reading Curious George to their kids a hundred years from now. The stories are timeless, and it is great to have them collected in one durable edition."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"This book set is perfect for my two year old.

So of course my daughter had to be introduced to him.She loved the stories instantly. It could be because of my enthusiasm for the stories.Her favorites were the first story because of the balloons and the one with learning the alphabet. I had to read them several times. Even a couple times in one sitting.The one bad thing about this book is the binding. It wore out a little too easily. Her Winnie the Pooh book is much bigger and it is still tight. This book could have been better bound so I will knock it one point.Other then that it's a classic that will probably get read to my grandchildren someday.-edit-I happened to be in a bookstore and noticed a different binding on a copy of the book. This is probably why there is there are people saying it's bad and good. My copy is old and the book only yellow.

And I remember that I liked them. But that's almost all I remember. So, when we were given this book as a present for our two children, I didn't know what to expect.I am now in awe of what a wonderful series of stories this is. There are seven stories, published over a series of twenty-five years. By modern publishing standards, that's not a lot of books for a successful series. There's a reason for that: Margaret and H.A. Rey took their time to craft fine stories.These are stories that are written in a simple, comprehensible way, so my kids have been enjoying them since they were three years old. However, the stories are not \\"dumbed down\\" for children. The plots are interesting, with twists and turns. In \\"Curious George Gets a Medal,\\" George goes from thinking about writing letters, to trying to clean up some spilled ink, to trying to find a pump to clean up some water, to trying to find an animal to drag a pump, to a museum, where he meets the person who had written the letter that started him on his quest (!), to a rocket ride. This description cannot do justice to the natural flow the incidents have in the context of the story.The illustrations are in a bright, charming, and in what is (now) an immediately recognizable style. Unlike so many children's books, it is obvious that great care has been put into the illustrations. In one picture, George is shown floating over the city, carried aloft by some balloons he had taken. He is the focus, of course, but if we look carefully, we see on the ground the balloon-man, from whom George had taken the balloons (running after George below), the brother and sister who were buying a balloon from him when George took the other balloons, the man with the yellow hat (driving in the same blue car with a tire on the back that will reappear on the next page), and a couple of men who have obviously walked into each other and fallen down because they were looking up in the air at George. Priceless!The only entry in this collection that is not up to the general high standard is \\"Curious George Learns the Alphabet.\\" This is really not a story at all, but an introduction to the letters, showing how each resembles something that starts with that letter. It's fine for what it is, but it pales in comparison with the rich stories around it.You can really appreciate how outstanding these stories are when you compare them to contemporary efforts to continue the series, like \\"Curious George and the Dumptruck\\" (published, thank goodness, separately). This story has none of the sparkle of the authentic, original Curious George.In this era of political correctness, some parents, librarians and teachers may be concerned about certain aspects of some stories. George smokes a pipe before bed in one; in another he opens a bottle of ether, sniffs it, and goes into a woozy state before passing out. George also lives in a world in which there seem to be almost no people of color.So supplement your children's reading of Curious George with other books that reflect the diversity of the world, and add your own little glosses to parts of the book that show behavior that concerns you (\\"Oh, George shouldn't open a medicine bottle should he? You wouldn't do that, would you?\\"). But do read to your children, and encourage them to read, Curious George."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"Growing up in the 1960's, \\"Curious George\\" was \\"required reading\\" for American children, at least in the Northeast, and the original stories gathered in this volume still stand as all-time favorites in American children's literature. Our little ones love these stories the most, just like all the reviewers here say. And this is a beautifully presented collection, including the informative background info on the authors, H.A. & Margret Rey, altogether a wonderful book. So why am I giving it 3 stars, a \\"medium\\" score? Because as a parent, and from a \\"buyer beware\\" point of view, this edition is really quite a Whopper of a volume to handle for the age group of children it is intended for, similar in bulk to an encyclopedia. Our 3-yr.-old struggles with it a bit, but when our 1-yr-old tries to wrest it from the shelf we go running to prevent it from coming down on her foot. I was wondering whether it may have been wiser to go with the original \\"skinny\\" volumes with one story in each. Also, very early on with this book a page became detached during normal kids' handling, partly due to its cumbersome weight, or that the binding may not be sturdy enough for a volume of this size. So I'd advise, that if the parents are the ones who would handle the book as they read to their small children, then this really is \\"The Best of George\\" in one place. But if your kids like to pick out their own books and read, the thinner editions would be easier for them. For anyone yet unacquainted with these stories, a good place to start would be the special edition of the first story \\"Curious George\\" which features H.A. Rey's original watercolor illustrations, which were never published in the original editions due to limitations of the color-separation process. Another great classic children's favorite published the same year as Curious George - 1941 - is \\"Make Way for Ducklings\\" by Robert McCloskey. The little ones never tire of it, and if you like antique cars and angelic policemen you'll get a kick out of it yourself!"},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"My love for Curious George started as a child. I had to spend the night in the hospital when someone gave me Curious George Goes to the Hospital. I've loved this little monkey ever since. This book is all the George anyone could ever want. It's a great gift for kids of any age and something to treasure for years to come."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"Fantastic book -- great &quot;heirloom&quot; quality item that will be remembered forever. Bought this book for my 3-year-old niece -- then tried to back out of giving it to her because I got all nostaligic. Big fight with my sister-in-law. Niece ended up with the book -- I came off looking like the bad guy. If you want to score big this Christmas, buy them this book. But don't get too attached to it. Remember -- you're a grown-up."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"Got this set as a Christmas gift for our 2.5 yr old granddaughter. She LOVES her books but is very hard on them as a result. Recently had a post- Christmas visit and the books are in great shape despite having been dragged all over the place for the past 4 weeks. They are read every day and a big part of the ritual is putting them back in their carrying case. Definitely a big hit!"},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"This book has every story written by the original Curious George creators, the Reys. There are other stories available besides these, but they were not written by the Reys. Will bring back warm memories of your childhood. I have bought this for three people as a baby shower gift since I am not very good at estimating sizes of baby clothing, and everyone has loved it."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"This compilation is wonderful and my daughter (5 yrs) pulls it out every 2 or 3 days. So many of the illustrations bring flashes of memories back from when I was a child and I love reading it to her. The book is very well constructed and we'll definately have it around for the next generation!"},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"Excellent. Curious George reflects little boys everywhere. He is curious, adventurous and completely loveable. An additional treat tagged onto the end of this book is the fascinating insight into the life of H.A. Rey and his bride."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"This is an excellent collection of stories if your child likes Curious George. The first story was released in 1941 and is still in print. The other stories were published in the 1950's and 60's.George is a good monkey, but his big down fall is that he is too curious. His tales have him going from one situation to another, and the stories are simple yet suprisingly long. The pages are illistrated and not loaded with words, but each story goes on for many pages. The size of this book's pages are larger compared to the individual volumes. If you read these with a sense of humor, you may find yourself laughing at Curious George's situations, and your Kids will only find the stories more amusing if you are laughing too. My daughter cannot get enough Curious George.This hard bound collection is a nice gift for any child. If your child likes George, they may like this collection to read the stories over and over."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"These stories are uplifting, educational, and some of the finest ever written for children. In a world that is seemingly against his naive curiousity, George is always able to not only make everything right and please those that he has inadvertently foiled, but he does so by just going his own way and not even trying to. Complete with great moral undertones about exploring the world and being a better person."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"I loved Curious George when I was a kid, I mean I loved this monkey. And revisiting him or 20 years later, I found that I still love George. And it is great to find all the books in this one, nice, hardcover collection. I read it to my nephew and neice, and they loved it, as I'm sure your kids will too (and more than a few of you adults)."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"Do not buy for the kindle or iPad etc.Total crap. George is great, kindle version is just a rip off.Just looks total crap, no layout etc."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"It's a beautiful book, we just got it in the mail and have already read 2 of the stories in it! the fact that it comes with an audio CD of the stories is also great, my youngest loves listening to it on her cd player, i hear giggling as i write this because George is getting into mischief :)This book is a GREAT buy!!"},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"As a child I loved Curious George, so when I saw this book I wanted it for my collection. It's wonderful! You will love it, whether you are purchasing it because you have fond memories of reading these stories or because you have young children. What is really nice is that the book brings a CD with all the stories, so if you are tired, or your children want to read along on their own, just pop in the CD and listen. I liked that the reader gives the child time to look at the pictures, he doesn't rush through the stories and animates the stories well. Unlike one reviewer, I found the binding to be sturdy."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"My 3 year old twins (girls) are totally rivited by this book. Yes, the stories are long (allow 15-20 minutes each), but they enjoy it so much, it is well worth it. Hands down, this is their favorite book.As a parent, however, I think this book could use a little updating. Some references are harmless, like referring to a record player (what's that?!), but others are what we would now consider politically incorrect or stereotypical: \\"fireman\\" instead of \\"firefighter\\", references to a \\"fat man\\", and \\"pretty nurse\\". A few characters, including George, smoke a pipe!All in all, I would not let this stop me from purchasing the book; it's just something to be aware of."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"Curious George is the best. He is a monkey. I like him. This one time a watched his show and he ran around and ate banannas. This book is cool. I like it when he runs and eats banannas and jumps on to that one guys head. And pulls his wig off, HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA. I like Curious George. I like it when he runs around."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"Unlike all the other Curious George compilations this book has a bunch of strange stories in it. The strangest is the one written in conjusction with the Boston Children's Hospital where George swallows a puzzle piece. He then gets admitted to the hospital, drinks barium and then gets operated on. As a physician this was far too detailed for Curious George story.Another story in the book has George smelling a bottle of ether and then having stange dreams and passing out.My daughter likes the hospital story as I make up all my own words but this book will hit the trash can one day soon. Buy any other compilation of George stories just not this one - it's like the writers were drinking on duty when this book got put together."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"I got this book for my 4 yr old daughter and she really loves the stories.....they are just the right length for her age and the pictures keep her attention....Bring back alot of memories....I only gave it 4 stars though for what I write below....Parents should be warned of some illiustrations/ideas...Noteably in one, Curious George jumps up on a windowsill and makes like he is climbing/looking out (can not remember if he actually does climb out) ...You can see form the illlustration that the window is atleast a 2nd or 3rd floor window.......Now my daughter knows better but for a smaller child, this might give them ideas....ACTAULLY alot of his antics might give kids ideas that we don't really want them to have....perhaps it is that I live in the city on a 10th floor so the window thing got me.....I don't know but I really did not think that illustration was well thought out and my Mom (without me saying anything) said \\"This really should not be here\\" about the SAME page....There are several other not very PC things in the book...Riding a bike at full speed without a helmet? Riding in a car without a seat belt?.....Also all the important figures are men for example...But I don't think my daughter really notices and I don't care....I mean I read these books when I was young and I wear my seatbelt ! LOL!I think as parents we often look too much into these books and should take them for what they are - fun and for kids.......BUT I do I find myself often saying \\"But we know that we don't do that in real life, right? That is just in the book\\" cuz George is very curious and does lots of things that as parents we would not be too happy about (like, uh, running away constantly or bringing the garden hose into the hose to wash the rug?)But I have to say my daughter really likes the book and so far we have read a story a night before bed since we got the book...I think we have one left!P.S. The book weighs a TON!"},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"Service by seller was nothing special - usual delivery speed. Book is great for reading to toddlers. One of the best children book ever."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"I read Curious George to my 4 year old daughter before she goes to sleep at night. She enjoys the book and I concur with most of the praise in the other reviews. But, I am critical of a point in this book.The characters in the book smoke. In one of the stories even George is smoking without getting into trouble.This book would have been much better, if the smoking pictures were edited out."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"Curious George rocks! I LOVE Curious George! he's SO cute!"},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"Although the illustrations are irresistable, I would not recommend the content of the first few books, at least, for children without some guidance from parents/teachers. They would, however, be good springboards for discussions about changing perspectives on wildlife and animal rights. When the Reys wrote their books, human dominance and exploitation of wild animals was almost unquestioned in their culture. Today, the sight of a young chimpanzee being captured, taken to the city, given alcohol and cigarettes, being imprisoned in a jail and then a zoo and being used in the film industry is disturbing, to say the least. I could see children learning to think about animals and wildlife, and learning to empathize with other species, from these books."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"My two year-old has just met Curious George. She has never seen anyone smoke a pipe, so she asked &quot;Why that silly sailor eating the phone?&quot;. She's in no danger of taking up smoking, so I'm not fussed about that content. It is the fact that George's curiosity gets him stuffed into a sack and abducted by the man in the yellow hat, who becomes a father figure to George, that most disturbs me. Am I the only one who is made uneasy by this occurence? Here is the man in the yellow hat, eventually presented as George's friend, but he proves himself first to be a tricky person."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"I read a couple of these to my daughter, and they are ok. But one really struck me as uncomfortably strange - \\"George goes to the moon\\". It is about curious george taking part in experiments in space - and how much fun he has doing so.I looked for another in the series say \\"curious george and the polio vaccine\\" or \\"curious george volunteers to visit the vivisectionists\\" or even \\"curious george and the bush meat trade\\".I understand why we need to experiment on animals. But there is something wrong in us pretending to kids that it's fun for the animal."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"The Curious George stories are cute in small doses but after awhile they become rather repetitive."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"Curious George gets kidnapped from his natural habitat in an African jungle by a &quot;nice&quot; man who throws a sack over him, bundles him onto a ship and takes him to America where he puts him in a &quot;nice&quot; zoo.Is this the kind of &quot;niceness&quot; we want our children to learn?"},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"This book is too scary for my whole family. My child is now traumatized and needs mental help. My wife thought the water colors were very cold and made her depressed. Customers should think before buying a book like this."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"This book lives up to its expectations!

This is a great book that should be a part of any child's library or collector's stash."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"Curious Georga has long since been a favorite of mine. When I stumbled across &quot;The Complete Adventures of Curious George&quot; I had to purchase it for my children. Starting January 1996 my husband or I read a Curious George Story before bedtime for our children, then ages 3 and 2. As the children have gotten older we have been able to use Curious George as a teaching aide, thinking about our actions before we get into mischief like George always does. I recommend this book for anyone with children, especially those with children that get into mischief."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"&lt;music&gt;Curious George, the curious little monkey..He's so full of curiosity..Curious George, the curious little monkey..Why's he curious?

The only issue we found is that the book has a few pictures with people smoking a pipe. Obviously a book written in today's day and age wouldn't have such references. It is funny how the baby sort of picked up on the pictures with some character smoking (eg. George Takes a Job). However, the books are still entertaining and so well illustrated."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"These are all the original works of the Reys, not like some of the other books out there which were done by other authors."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"this is a good book for bed time. sometimes i read the first page as i put my kids to sleep and then as i turn the pages i make up my own story based on the pictures this will only work until my daughter can read then im screwed."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"My daugther likes a lot this book, she enjoys a lot of the mischiefs of this restless monkey."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"My sister recently saw this book at ... and asked me if I could get it for less on Amazon (of course!).If you love Curious George, this collection of stories will not let you down.My nephews are ages 2 and 5 and they both love it!

A must have for any family library."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"I am so happy that I can share my kindle with my 3 year old daughter, through the e-publishing of children's books such as this one. She loves Curious George and I am happy that the complete collection of these great stories are available for the kindle. However, the pictures (sometimes her favorite parts) are very hard to see on the small screen. While on some of the picture pages there is text, I think that if this was removed to make room for a little larger pictures (I know the screen real estate is limited), that this would be more enjoyable for her to read with me."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"This only needs to be short and sweet - we love Curious George! I only discovered George after an Amazon recommendation and am so glad I did. Our little boy is asking us to read George stories all day.

Would not recommend for a young reader."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"We used to check this book out at the library but then decided we needed our own copy for home. The stories are long (like two or three mini stories in one), and my 4-year-old is captivated the entire time (even when he's telling me what's going to happen next).It's a nice change from the \\"updated\\" Curious George (though we enjoy those stories as well). But be warned: the older stories contain content that probably wouldn't pass in new stories presented in today's society; where its okay to remove a monkey from his natural habitat, open a bottle of ether, and \\"accidentally\\" call the police.Still, it's CLASSIC Curious George, and as a parent it takes me back to when I was a kid (and the \\"no-nos\\" are just used as teaching opportunities). We thoroughly enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"I remembered these stories from my childhood way before they had the cartoon series on TV, now I can share some of my favoritre childhood stories with my little girls. My 5 year old can read the stories all by herself."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"He loves curious George , but cannot watch tv too often, so I figured these could substitute.

I recommend this for everybody."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"My 3 year old son was sent this book as a Christmas present and six weeks later we are still reading it every night before bed time. Admittedly, I sometimes wish he would choose a shorter story for bed time, but he just loves it. My 18 month old daughter also chooses it every night, and loves pointing at Curious George every time he appears on the page.

We would not be without George."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"My 3 year old loved it, it was easy to follow, the pictures and text were at the right location, and she was able to follow the story by looking at the pictures.I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"This book is great in that it has all of the Curious George stories in one place. Unfortunately, that makes it incredibly heavy and hard to hold with a squirming kid on your lap.I'd buy a set of the individual books, even at a higher price.On the upside, my daughter loves the George stories and wants them read to her nightly before sleep. We've had to learn how to read portions of each book to keep her interested and awake."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"I handled the book very carefully, yet in a short time the binding of the book came apart.

I think to them that man symbolizes a parent who is always there when needed the most."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"Parents, you cannot go wrong with this book. The stories are wonderful and the illustrations are bright and cheerful. A Curious George book was the first book that I ever checked out of my elementary school library and that started off my love for reading."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George, Anniversary Edition, is a collection of happy memories. Whether your parents read George's many adventures to you, or whether you read them to a beloved child, this book consolidates all those fun times into one volume. It is a wonderful way to have every book without having multiple volumes.I found the quality of this volume to be consistent with other mass-produced hard-bound books which are not deluxe, collector's, or limited edition copies. This allows the book to be priced reasonably and within the budgets of more individuals. I applaud the publishers for realizing that more expensive editions might have limited the number of families able to acquire The Complete Adventures of Curious George, Anniversary Edition.I would not recommend giving this book to a child who will not be having a parent read to them. The volume is large and heavy enough to be unwieldy for small children. It is, however, a wonderful book to give to a family who values reading aloud to their children, to grandparents who want to limit shelf space for their grandchildren's books, or to yourself as a treat. It is a classic and a five-star work!I was able to purchase this from an Amazon seller, so if it is unavailable when you want one, be sure to look at those offerings. My book arrived in perfect condition and was a real bargain."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"I bought this as a baby gift for a little boy.

She still likes to re-read some of her favorites every now and then, so I decided to get this 70th Anniversary edition to add to our home library.I was impressed at the quality of this edition. It is hardbound with two bonus CDs. CD 1 contains: Curious George, Curious George Takes a Job, Curious George Rides a Bike, and, Curious George Gets a Medal. All four have different narrators. CD 2 features: Curious George Flies a Kite, Curious George Learns the Alphabet, and Curious George Goes to the Hospital. This CD too has three different narrators performing the stories.The paper quality is very good with glossy looking color illustrations from the original books. There is an introduction by Leonard S. Marcus, a publisher's perspective, and a retrospective essay for adult readers/ fans to appreciate. The stories contained in this edition are all of the original stories:Curious GeorgeCurious George Takes a JobCurious George Rides a BikeCurious George Gets a MedalCurious George Flies a KiteCurious George Learns the AlphabetCurious George Goes to the HospitalThe bonus for me was the photographic album of Margret and H.A.

But for my daughter I'm getting these books as separate volumes. It's definitely, as the front cover indicates, a \\"Collectors Edition\\" book for adults: very heavy and with thin pages.ABOUT THE CURIOUS GEORGE STORIESI was born '71 and loved all the books that are in this collection. I don't remember how old I was when we started reading them, but I remember them well. I was and am sensitive and empathetic to a sometimes unhealthy extreme, and I love animals, but I wasn't affected negatively by anything in the stories. Some reviewers feel they aren't appropriate, or have said their children reacted badly to them. As always, try them on your kids at the library first! As for our family, my 3 yr old daughter loves the original books as well as the stop-motion animated versions of \\"Curious George\\" and \\"CG Goes to the Hospital\\" (Curious George (Collector's Edition)) which follow the books scene for scene. She is very empathetic also and hasn't react badly to anything in the stories (and she DID react badly to something in a Care Bears movie!). Incidentally my family liked that stop-motion video as well as the PBS TV series WAY better than the modernized movieCurious George (Widescreen Edition)."},{"Title":"The Complete Adventures of Curious George","review":"I really enjoyed reading these stories that I grew up with.

The author in each of these four takes a Shakespeare play as its literary theme--and so far so good. This series, featuring the young player Nicholas Revill, is an excellent read, even if the reader isn't a scholar, or even fan, of The Bard.Nicholas, while trying very hard to make his way as a serious actor, seems to find himself, book by book, in nasty, fiendish, nefarious murder situations. Of course, Gooden is free with his references to Shakespeare (who also appears as a minor character) and this gives the series not only a unique flair but hints at serious writing! This time around, Gooden treats us to \\"Troilus and Cressida\\" as his \\"central\\" theme play.We find young Nick heavily involved once again with the Chamberlain's Company. A boyhood friend comes to London seeking his own fame as an actor and turns to Nicholas for help. Happy to see his longtime friend, Nicholas obliges and within afew days comes home to find his friend murdered! Because he is found with the body, he is under investigation for the death of his friend. Soon after, an up-and-coming playwright, who's about to publish a scandalous play, is found murdered; again, because of his involvement with the man, Nicholas is charged.Finally, Nicholas' long time and dear friend Nell is found strangled to death, by Nicholas' own clothing piece. What's a boy to do under these circumstances? He runs! Back to his village, where he hopes to work things out. Alas, things only get more complicated.Yet, all's well that ends well and once more our Nick escapes the nick, using some clever reasoning and intelligent deductive skills! \\"Alms for Oblivion\\" is a a fun read.

He too sees Shostakovich as one who opposed the Soviet System and Stalin, while seeming to be a part of it. He outlines how Shostakovich's tragic and comic senses worked together to give his music layers of complexity and double- meaning. He too relates this to Shostakovich's sympathy for Jewish suffering, and his sense of how Jewish folk music mixed sadness and humor together.MacDonald explores Shostakovich's life and career in relation to others , who suffered from the Soviet Regime, Babel, Akhmatova, Osip and Nadezhda Mandelshtam,Zamyatin, Pilnyak, Tsvetayeva. His knowledge of music is the music is great, and he provides interpretations of it which connect with the whole life- struggle of Shostakovich.Here is one passage from the book which gives a sense of its flavor, and shows immediately why it is such an outstanding work\\"Conscience depends on memory. So relentlessly have Lenin's heirs striven to wipe the slate clean the national memory- first by shooting millions of Russians through the brain- stem, later by denying that such things ever happened- that almost all the creative energy of the country's artists and intellectuals since 1917 has gone into the genre of the memoir. Plays, novels, poems- the majority of these too, are memoirs in disguise. Shostakovich's music is no different.Remembrance is his theme , and if he tells the same story over and over again it is because for him , as for every other Russian, there is no other story to tell.... Notwithstanding their mutual suspicion ,Solzhenitsyn and Shostakovich were co- workers in a massive effort to keep memory alive in Russia through mid twentieth century. Obsessed by the monstrous genocidal injustice of their country's political system, they return time and again in their works to the scene of the crime to paint its horror from a different angle or to bring fresh wreaths for those tens of millions of graves.\\""},{"Title":"New Shostakovich","review":"British musicologist Ian MacDonald's The New Shostakovich first appeared around 1990 and was revised this decade with Frank Clarke's additional material, footnoted and corrected information, and other extras that help you understand the history, times and music of Soviet composer Dmitri Shotakovich (1906-75), whose dark and despairing music hides its messages better than Solomon Volkov told you inTestimony: The Memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich (Limelight), the mind-bending biography from Shostakovich that turned everyone's ideas about the man and his music upside down in 1975.To this end, it is actually two different books; MacDonald did not survive to make the 2006 revisions. While much of the content is the same, the original edition questions the authenticity of Testimony and takes issue with its characterization of the composer and his work. The later account turns 180 degrees and credits Testimony as a potent and accurate account of the composer's life, beliefs and feelings during his days as the Soviet Union's greatest composer. For this reason, it is important that purchasers buy the later edition, which my review covers.The book is divided into the sections of the composer's life, from his earliest family life and influences to his years in academy, the great Stalin purge of the 1930s, his isolation in the post-Stalin years and his assertive period at the end of his life. What best characterizes MacDonald's book is the way he dissects the composer's music, both musicologically and sociologically, and explains the meanings that come through under the guise of masterful counterpoint and training. While many of these messages were made clear by the composer himself in \\"Testimony\\", there is secondary evidence here that, using native folk tunes and other devices that deliver subliminal messages, Shostakovich was clearly a dissident voice in the Soviet Union going back at least as far as the composition of the Symphony No. 4 in the early 1930s.Here is an overview of what MacDonald tells you about the 15 symphonies:No. 1 -- this is the youthful composer's graduation exercise from the Soviet music academy. He uses subtle tactics from Stravinsky with fateful themes from Tchaikovsky to create one of the greatest first symphonies ever written.Nos. 2 and 3 -- laboring under the heavy hammer of totalitarian, Shostakovich created nonsensical music dedicated to the revolution. This pair of symphonies should be abandoned by anyone with serious interest in this composer.No. 4 -- this is Shostakovich spreading his wings, mimicking his admired Mahler, and beginning to tell you how horrible things were for him in the USSR. The cacophonous sections of the first movement are a musical expression for those what awaited a nighttime visit by the secret police, who were then taken off to the gulag for imagined crimes. Shostakovich himself feared such an event, sometimes sleeping in the hallway of his apartment to spare his family the torment of seeing him taken away.No. 5 -- Shostakovich's famous response to \\"just criticism\\", this is the second of what MacDonald calls the \\"terror\\" symphonies -- those written during Stalin's regin of terror from the early 1930s until his death in 1953. A seeming paean to Soviet greatness, it's hidden message was explained eloquently by the composer in 'Testimony.' The famous ending, with what the composer called its forced rejoicing, was described by Galina Vishnevskaya as an expression of the sons and daughters of Russia being torn from its soil by Stalin. The composer described it this way: \\"...what exultation could there be? I think it is clear what happens in the Fifth,\\" he said in 'Testimony.' \\"The rejoicing is forced, created under a threat...It's as if someone were beating you with a stick and saying, 'Your business is rejoicing, your business is rejoicing' and you rise, shakily, and go marching off muttering, 'Our business is rejoicing, our business is rejoicing,'\\" a capsulized comment on the goals of Socialist realism in USSR art.No. 6 -- an intense, dramatic three movement edifice that heralds the platform of both the Violin Concerto No. 1 and Cello Concerto No. 1, it again calls forth the exegises of Soviet totalitarianism. Its lighter, later momments call forth Shostakovich as yurodivy, the clown price whose light message hides much darker secrets.No. 7 -- written as the Nazis approached Leningrad and given worldwide recognition, MacDonald expounds on the composer's admission in \\"Testimony\\" that he was thinking about \\"other enemies of mankind\\" besides the Nazis when he wrote this, namely Stalin.No. 8 -- the first great masterpiece symphony, MacDonaled explains that this is indeed about totalitarianism and the terror, with its unrelenting darkness and drive today better understood in these terms than during the war years.No. 9 -- the yurodivy masterpiece, the absurd celebration of success in World War II with the section of Stalin puffing himself up like a frog, that Shostakovich survived over Stalin's disappointment.No. 10 -- perhaps his greatest symphonic edifice, this music is a characterization of Stalin and his times with the second movement a caricature of the dictator.No. 11 -- renewing the composer's comments in \\"Testimony\\", MacDonald further explains the parallel's between the Russian 1905 pre-revolution of the score and the Soviet military flattening of the 1956 Hungarian uprising.No. 12 -- written ostensibly to fete Lenin, this is more a bombshell dropped on the shortcomings of the revolutionary hero, with its underground message about repression carried forth from 1917 throughout Shostakovich's life.No. 13 -- Baba yir is a selection of poems about Jewish represssion the composer set to music during the first thaw under Kruschev. While poet Yevtushenko was forced to rewrite some of his harsher rhetoric -- the Soviet state officially believed there was no ill treatment of Jews -- this is a dissident landmark for Shostakovich, who sympathized with Jews as a repressed minority.No. 14 -- the songs of death hold numerous keys to second messages in one of the most fascinating sections of the entire book.No. 15 -- while on its face this is about Shostakovich fiddling with favored music and expanding into serialism under Brezhnev, MacDonald tells you how this is a hidden expression of the composer's anger at the end of his creative life, having lived through the Stalin terror, seeing hundreds of his friends and intellectual equals disappear in the night, and being disappointed by two subsequent dictators, especially the echt-Stalinist Brehznev.And this without citing a word about MacDonald's discussion of the composer's second-greatest group of compositions -- the string quartets -- and what he had to say about Soviet society in his vocal music. Appendices tell you about the 1948 musical denunication, the relative closeness to real Soviet society depicted in George Orwell's \\"1984\\", and other interesting and important slices from Shostakovich's life under the iron fist of Soviet rule. MacDonald skillfully merges musicology with history to give you a three-dimensional view of the composer's life and times, and how the two resulted in his musical visions.While MacDonald's prose can sometimes be heavy seas on the eyes and mind, the discoveries awaiting the interested reader are worth the occasional literary mudslide. This isn't easy reading and it becomes a trial for a non-musician to understand in some sections, but it builds as it goes on and helps delineate the complex creations of the 20th century's greatest symphonist. Anyone investing in this little book will be rewarded with new understanding, even if they've read Testimony countless times."},{"Title":"New Shostakovich","review":"Unfortunately, when dealing with Shostakovich, politics becomes inextricably bound up with the fact of his survival and the shape his career took by that very act of surviving. After the hot breath of official reprimand by Stalin no less, Shostakovich's sarcastic edge and spontaneity became blunted by an internalised self consciousness. The sarcasm was still there, but not on obvious display, it had been encoded, otherwise he would not have survived. The plea for less politicisation of music is a worthy one but with composers from the Soviet Union during the first half of the twentieth century, this is virtually impossible when narrating their achievements. Even a strenuously apolitical composer such as Prokofiev was constantly caught up in the political quagmire much to his disillusionment. This is a music biography from a political perspective that helps decode some of Shostakovich's perplexing and ambiguous music, enabling us to enter more deeply into his disturbing yet very moving soundscape, loaded as it is with irony and emotion: Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"New Shostakovich","review":"This is a passionate and powerful book, which has won Shostakovich's music many new admirers; but has it served the cause of truth? MacDonald takes the presentation of Shostakovich in Volkov's Testimony as Gospel Truth and extends to the main body of the composer's work Volkov's contention that even Shostakovich's most seemingly conformist works contain a secret anti-Stalin and indeed anti-Soviet code. But this is building on sand, since Volkov's work is of more than dubious authenticity (see now Richard Taruskin, On Russian Music, 318-21). Moreover, MacDonald's translation of Shostakovich scores into detailed political messages is not only fanciful but misunderstands the very nature of music, with its lack of specific and univocal reference (except, by and large, when setting a text). Another flaw is that MacDonald follows Volkov into describing Shostakovich as a 'holy fool', which is entirely to misunderstand both: holy fools, while remaining entirely orthodox in their inner beliefs (at least according to their biographers), behaved shockingly in public in order to mock society and to win abuse and maltreatment for themselves. Shostakovich, in contrast, became disillusioned with the Soviet system in private, but acted on the surface as an obedient servant of the regime -- a compromise that he shared with the great majority of the Russian population. One can appreciate the depth and eloquence of his music without trying to turn him into a hero or prophet."},{"Title":"New Shostakovich","review":"I frankly don't understand the political exploitation of Shostakovich's work in this country (USA). It is almost as bad as the very core of the Communist deal that all these books (Volkov in primis) try to undo or reveal. There is no Shostakovich's performance that does not have at least 80% of the notes describing how he was writing this music to mock Stalin; out of fear; because of pressure; because he wanted to try the regime's limits, etc. There is very little, in concert notes as well as in this book, about MUSIC. Was he a great composer? Do we like his music only because his life stirred so many opposite feelings? Do we care to analyze his relationship with Mahler's music, his many different styles (so Mahler cannot be the whole story!), the fact that he was married three times, that his son Maxim is also a conductor but not a composer (how could he with this load of genius in the background?). There is very little in these books about the structure of his (DHS's) work, besides of the usual clich&eacute; of the 4th symphony (try the regime's limits), the Fifth (Regime 1:DHS 0), etc. There is also little concerning the most of his opus, the wonderful chamber music and solo instrument music. This book barely mentions the music of the piano Trios (one short, one long, both incredible capolavori!). Maybe Leonard Bernstein was right: we often confuse music with literature and film, we are predominantly visual animals with an appetite for alphabets and grammar, and when it comes to C sharp we think about seeing an optometrist! If you like classical or contemporary music, please listen and stop reading these fake \\"biographies\\"! The author of the one I am reviewing here concludes that basically there is a \\"high probability\\" that Volkov was right, that if one \\"imagines\\" what was going through DHS's mind one can see his anti-whatever stance, etc. People who are egocentric to the point of having their head publicly examined write books, not symphonies!"},{"Title":"La musica popular en Cuba (Spanish Edition)","review":"--La m&uacute;sica popular en Cuba, de Armando Led&oacute;n, ofrece una visi&oacute;n condensada de la historia de la m&uacute;sica popular cubana desde sus or&iacute;genes hasta la &eacute;poca actual.

His book, \\"La M&uacute;sica popular en Cuba\\" (Oakland, Calif.: El Gato Tuerto, 2003; 230 p.; ISBN 0-932367-15-1), therefore, comes from an authoritative source. Because books on this subject still are rare on the musical turf, one only mentions certain kinds of reservations towards it with reluctance, but there is no doubt that this Spanish-language publication should be considered as essential to popular music, jazz, popular culture, and Cuban studies.Since Led&oacute;n S&aacute;nchez obviously tries to be as comprehensive in his coverage as possible, the book is stuffed to the hilt with names of musicians and groups and with its brief accounts of the contributions of many of them to Cuban culture. However, the text seems rather encyclopaedic in both the best and the less desirable senses of the word. There is such an effort at providing adequate coverage in few pages that Led&oacute;n S&aacute;nchez' text indeed makes for quite dry reading. Perhaps he and his publisher should have produced a longer book that covers all of what this one does, but with ampler data and, here and there, more colourfully anecdotal writing (which, judging from the few occasional but excellent anecdotes and personality sketches which the author does provide, could be very amusing, personal, and/or enlightening). More extended comments on, and analysis of, the music itself (and not so nearly exclusive discussion of its music-makers and the verbal aspects of song lyrics) also would be very welcome. The result would be a book both more informative and more interesting to read.Due to the fact that Led&oacute;n S&aacute;nchez was a singer and percussionist, perhaps his comprehension of the rudiments and theory of music, and the capacity to analyse it on purely musical terms, may be more limited than what one would expect from another writer who plays a wind, stringed, or keyboard instrument, or who is a composer and/or arranger. (Confirming this hunch is the book's absence of examples in musical notation, although this lack may have been due to the publisher's insistence rather than to the limitations of author's musical training.) This musical background also may account for directing excessive attention to classing songs too much according to their textual subject matter rather than, more strictly and pertinently, by purely musical criteria (a common failing, be it noted, of altogether too much of the literature about popular music of all kinds and places). More specific musical description of the types and rhythms of Cuban dances, with basic examples in musical notation to illustrate their basic rhythmic character, also would have helped considerably. (It is possible, of course, that the publisher, rather than the author, was the party in this monographic project which insisted on excluding musical notation.) Musical analysis certainly is not entirely absent (far from that), but it tends to be at a rather rudimentary level. However, the book does include, among the appendices, welcome information summarising the instrumental make-up of ensembles, about some of the musical instruments prominent in Cuban music, and allied matters; that would have been even more helpful if illustrations had been included, especially of instruments less known outside of Cuba.The appendices also include an useful chronology of the history of Cuban pop music. There also is a good bibliography of literature on the subject of articles, books, and of other literature in Spanish. Listing some of the articles and books on the subject in languages besides Spanish would be helpful, too, but only if the bibliography were to be lengthened; the literature in Spanish itself often is much more difficult to track down (due to the relative lack of bibliographic control of what is printed in Spanish) than to find what exists on the subject in English or German. Within the text of the book and in the chronology, Led&oacute;n S&aacute;nchez occasionally mentions and briefly describes the initial appearance of literature of particularly great historical importance that appeared on the subject of Cuban music and musicians.Led&oacute;n S&aacute;nchez discretely avoids much of any discussion about how popular music interacted with Cuban politics (perhaps prudently, given how explosively divergent are the opinions regarding such matters throughout the Western Hemisphere). However, the author does provide some good comments on matters of Cuban folklore, society, and general and regional Cuban culture and life, as they pertain to this Cuban popular and jazz (or, rather, jazz-tinged) music. Studies by authors in other countries with a freer intellectual climate that that which still prevails in Cuba (as of the time of this review, mid-2010) can supplement the book's partial lack of adequate socio-political context.Facilitating this rather small tome's use as a reference guide, the book is fairly adequately indexed for personal names per se, but without cross-references to other forms of name (especially nicknames and pseudonyms) nor, alas, for names of ensembles or for geographical names, either; neither is there is any topical (subject) indexing for the book. Despite its shortcomings, the volume serves well as a reference guide, probably the best help which this work provides.As to the actual experience of reading the text of this book from beginning to end, that is something that most readers may find becomes tedious in doses of more than thirty minutes or so at a time, due to the relentless onslaught of the array of names and places which pass by, with too little else to divert the reader about Cuba's saucy musical culture. Occasionally, especially for the music of recent decades in which the author has more direct involvement, Led&oacute;n S&aacute;nchez does loosen up a bit to provide more detail and even some anecdotes, or some welcome if hardly deep analysis of style, technics, etc., which temporarily enliven his account of Cuban music.Although Led&oacute;n S&aacute;nchez occasionally brings up controversies among specialists regarding some aspects of the music of his island country, he does not cite at such moments in the book the literature (assuming that such differences of opinion do occur in print) to which he may have made resort to support or which may differ from his convictions, in footnotes or in back references; he enumerates such literature almost solely in the book's bibliography. Footnotes and references, about these or other matters, in addition to the book's bibliography, would have been helpful to the reader. Although this study obviously is one of a popular and non-technical nature, accounting for the lack of such a scholarly nicety such as references to document the text, there are times such as this when occasional footnotes (or numbered back references), including the mention of page(s) within works cited, would have been very welcome, even if the book's bibliography, indeed, does provide a welcome resource to direct the researcher to further reading on the subject."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Journey in Time","review":"If you visit the Devil's Den portion of the Gettysburg battlefield, there's a sign describing how a famous photograph came to be. The photographer claimed that it was a picture of a confederate sharpshooter who had been mortally wounded during the battle. The soldier evidently made himself comfortable before he died. The sign explains that the photograph was staged, the soldier was not a sharpshooter and that the body was dragged some 40 yards to the spot. The sign credits William Frassanito with having made this discovery after careful study of Gettysburg photographs.This is the book that describes this and many other pictures of the Gettysburg battlefield, many depicting dead men or horses. Many of these photographs are famous in the sense that they are used frequently in civil books and now in documentaries. Frassanito demonstrates convincingly that several of these frequently used photographs are mislabeled, generally to make the photographs seem more interesting and therefore more saleable.Frassanito was an intelligence analyst during the Vietnam War and won the Bronze Star. I feel that only from a lot of practice analyzing photographs during the war could he have developed the skill needed to make the many clever observations in this book. Clearly, his wartime experiences left their mark in other ways as well. He frequently loses the detached air of a historian and reminds his readers of the horrors the subjects of the photographs must have experience. For example, he describes how rapid decomposition bloated the bodies immediately after the battle and how in some instances forced open the corpses' trouser buttons. \\"Thus the trousers on the soldier seen here were most likely open before his body was dragged to this position, the dragging action forcing them down below his hips. Here then was a young man who, only three days prior... full of life...But by July 5... was just another nameless corpse, his faced pressed against the earth, his exposed buttocks, once carefully hidden in accordance with the vanities of civilization, a sign of war's ultimate glory.\\"This book has the potential to make you feel like an expert on the battle of Gettysburg. If you read this book, you will recognize misidentified photographs in even some of the best documentaries. Further, you will be able to find the locations most of these photos with the aid of this book, even those in less frequently visited portions of the battlefield.I would recommend all of Frassanito's books to Civil War buffs, but this one above all. The section on the Rose Woods photographs is brilliant, more so than even the passage that earned a marker at Devil's Den."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Journey in Time","review":"Many of us who are historians (credentialed or uncredentialed) have viewed Civil War photographs with suspicion. Example: &quot;If these are Union soldiers, then why is there so little uniformity in their uniforms?&quot; Or: &quot;This body is described as that of a Confederate sharpshooter . . . but that's a federal issue Springfield rifle propped next to him.&quot;William Frassanito raised such issues to the level of scholarly inquiry, and through painstaking research wrote the story of the Gettysburg photographs. We now know what and who we are looking at, and on which portion of the battlefield. This book and his companion volume on the Antietam photographs are indispensable for any serious student of the Civil War in the East."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Journey in Time","review":"I found this book in a Friends of the Library book sale in Hilo, Hawaii about l980, five years after it first came out. I think I paid 35 cents for it in hardcover, in perfect condition. It is the best bargain I ever found in my life. I re-read it every four years or so. I cannot imagine its owner ever parting with it, short of dying himself and having his clueless heirs simply donate his library without scrutiny. If you care about U.S. history, the Civil War, photography, the way historians think about a fresh approach to well-covered subjects, or just good writing and thinking, buy this book. It is worth whatever Amazon wants to charge you. I live now 2,000 miles from the Battlefield, and have never visited it, but if I ever get the chance, this book will go with me. It is simply, completely, brilliant. It can make you cry, if you aren't careful. It certainly makes you envy Bill Frassanito's achievement. His idea of contrasting the historical photo with an image shot from the same spot now has been copied with the Jack the Ripper crime sites as well as in his subsequent books. It was a great idea, and no one's done it better."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Journey in Time","review":"Within a matter of days of the conclusion of the Battle of Gettysburg (July 1 -- July 3, 1863) photographers were on the scene to capture the Battlefield and its participants. These photographers included Alexander Gardner of Philadelphia, who began photographing the Battlefield on July 7 or 8, 1863, the famous Matthew Brady, the Tyson Brothers, portrait photographers who lived in Gettysburg, and others. Their photographs were arranged in series and sold in various formats to the American public which was eager to learn about the War.Over the years, the photographs have been misidentified, placed out of sequence and, in some instances, forgotten. William Frassinto's &quot;Gettyburg, a Journey in Time&quot; (1975) was among the first books to recapture this photographic legacy, to study the scenes and the makers of the pictures, and to organize his material in a book for the modern reader. Mr. Frassinto has since published a number of sequels to this inital book as well as a study of photographers at Antietam.The book consists of approximately 100 photographs, most of them dating from shortly after the battle in July, 1863 through 1866. There are also a number of photographs that Mr. Frassinto himself took dating from the late 1960s and early 1970s. These photos allow the reader to compare the original scenes with the current state of the Gettysburg Battlefield.After a short discussion giving biographical information on the photographers and information on their visits to Gettysburg, Mr Frassanito presents and discusses the photographs themselves. His presentation is arranged in six groups: 1. the first day's battle (north and west of the town); 2. Cemetery Hill; 3. Culp's Hill; 4. Cemetery Ridge; 5. Little Round Top and Devil's Den; 6. the Rose Farm.Mr. Frassanito introduces each group with a short description of the significance of the site. He then discusses each picture in detail, explaining when it was taken, what it shows, and its importance to the Battle of Gettysburg. The photographs are themselves eloquent and compelling and their effect is heightened by Mr Frassanito's commentary. I came away understanding the first day's battle and the fighting on Culp's Hill and Cemetry Hill on the Union right much better as a result of Mr. Frassanito's account and the photographs.The most famous photographs in the book are probably those of the dead soldiers (in a few cases the photos were taken of live soldiers posing as dead for the photographers) on Little Round Top and on the Rose Farm. Most of these photographs were taken by Gardner because the dead were removed from the Battlefield relatively quickly after the battle. Gardner moved from south to north on the Battlefield and captured the few instances in which the dead had not yet been buried. The photos capture the terrible costs of the Battle.Many of Gardner's photos have been erroneously identified over the years as originating from the first day's fighting on McPherson's ridge. Mr. Frassanito explains how he determined these photographs in fact originated on Rose Hill, on the southern part of the Battlefield. (The first day fighting was on the northenmost part of the Battlefield.) Yet misidentifications die hard. I have seen books which postdate Mr. Frassanito's which continue to attribute these photographs to the first day of the fighting.The photos and the text in this book will give the reader a good sense of the tragedy and cost of this seminal battle. Mr. Frassanito's book remains essential for those interested in seriously exploring the Battle of Gettysburg."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Journey in Time","review":"I feel that Mr. Frassanito's work has been the catalyst in America's renewed interest in the Civil War. Ken Burns wouldn't have gotten anywhere without the groundwork laid by William Frassanito, beginning with this book. I highly recommend any of Mr. Frassanito's works. Tom Hahner Munhall, PA"},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Journey in Time","review":"This book by Frassanito is my favorite book in my entire 200+ book library of the Civil War. I love history, and I cannot recommend this book enough for those who tramp the Gettysburg National Military Park in search of what happened in July 1863. His careful research indicates the exact position that many famous pictures were taken from. VERY WELL DONE!"},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Journey in Time","review":"An excellent and suprisingly absorbing photo record of the Gettysburg battlefield. Frassanito using exacting research and the bloodhound qualities of a detective precisely places and orients the famous Civil War photos of Gettyburg. In the biggest coup of the study he finds that some of the most renown photos were actually made around the Rose Farm and not McPherson's Wood. As the title indicates this book does seem to draw the reader back to the instant in time frozen by the camera way back in 1863-66. Coming across this book by pure chance it was with suprised pleasure that I read and studied the poinant photos."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Journey in Time","review":"Mr. Frassanito has performed magic. His painstaking research has clarified the battle of Gettysburg for all time. Because of his book, I have scoured the Gettysburg battlefield, book in hand, and have revisted each site he identifies. He truly deserves recognition as one of America's all time great historian - detectives."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Journey in Time","review":"this is a fascinating book for both civil war buffs and those interested in early photography. frassanito is an excellent writer and his detective work is unbelievably thorough. i can't recommend this book enough!"},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Journey in Time","review":"Most history books, especially those written for the public, seek to make the events come alive in some way. The author did that in a completely unique way. Take the old photos and find the positions from which they were taken and show what the areas look like today. You can use these to walk to the very point where some photo was taken, and it really brings that history home. Also, the author works those photos into a discourse on the battle, while using his photoanalysis skills to shed new light on the contents of the photos. All in all, this book is endlessly fascinating, well worth the money, and deserving of a wider audience than it probably has."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Journey in Time","review":"If a picture is worth a thousand words, then this is the book you should &quot;read&quot; about the Civil War. Certainly the goals of the book were well accomplished. I could have done without the numerous times the author explains in detail about the bloating of the bodies and how the bacteria cause it....it was brought up so many times I thought he must be a bit morbid. Nevertheless, it's not a book to entertain but to depict what was, and it does this very well."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Journey in Time","review":"Gettysburg in historically analyzed photographs5+ stars. William Frassanito has done an outstanding job in Gettysburg historical photograph research and interpretation. His Gettysburg: A journey in Time is a landmark photo-historical record of that epic battle. He breaks new ground in documentation and research of old civil war era photographs. His analysis of the main photographers of the Gettysburg battle, and his examination of their quirks and techniques sheds valuable new light on the battlefield. His fastidious \\"then and now\\" comparison of the actual ground in the photographs is an invaluable aid to those who want to walk that hallowed ground today. Since Mr. Frassanito's publication of Gettysburg: A Journey in Time, the park service has done yeoman's work to return the battlefield to the way it ways on those 3 hot days of July, 1863.An absolute must have for Civil War buffs. Excellent book for anyone interested in Gettysburg. It will help clarify the battlefield an aid in understanding just how the battlefield looked during the battle. Thank you Mr. Frassanito for an outstanding work of Gettysburg historical analysis."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Journey in Time","review":"Great book, provides accurate information.One mention on the Tyson Brothers. As a matter of religious conscience, the Tysons would not have photographed the dead on the battlefield or elsewhere (they were Quakers).My grandmother enjoyed this book (granddaughter of Charles B Tyson) but as a \\"birthright\\" Friend, mentioned this oversight."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Journey in Time","review":"GETTYSBURG: A JOURNEY IN TIME is noteworthy on at least four levels.First, it contains a history of photography of the Battle of Gettysburg. The last day of the battle was July 3, 1863, and by July 5 - while the bloated corpses of men and horses still remained on the field - professional photographers had arrived to record the scenes for a keenly interested country and for posterity. Frassanito discusses the expeditions of the major Gettysburg photographers: Alexander Gardner and his colleagues, Matthew Brady, the Tyson brothers, and a few others.Second, GETTYSBURG: A JOURNEY IN TIME contains dozens of historical photographs of Gettysburg, both the city and the battlefield, many of which were shot within a week or so after the battle and none of which was taken after 1866.Third, for most of those historical photographs, the book contains a partner photograph taken from the same camera position circa 1970. Back when the book was first published, in 1975, this feature surely was much more valuable in helping a reader understand the battle by using the contemporary photograph to orient herself on the battlefield and \\"see\\" for herself the perspective of the historical one. But Gettysburg and the battlefield have changed a lot in the past forty years - old buildings torn down and new ones raised and land use (forest, field, orchard, etc.) returned more to the conditions that prevailed in 1863 - so the \\"modern\\" photographs are not nearly as useful as they once were.Fourth, Frassanito closely analyzes the historical photographs to reach new conclusions about when and where they were taken and, in a few instances, about the course of the battle itself. There is, for instance, a famous photograph of a dead Confederate soldier at a sharpshooter's nest in Devil's Den. Today, the walled nest between two huge boulders, with perfect sight lines towards the Union position on Little Round Top, is a featured stop on any tour of the battlefield. By comparing the photo of the dead Confederate soldier with other photos of battlefield dead, Frassanito discovered that the corpse had been moved (probably by the photographer) about forty yards to the sharpshooter's nest from where the soldier had originally fallen. It is quite likely that the dead soldier had not even been a sharpshooter.It is in connection with that last level that GETTYSBURG: A JOURNEY IN TIME is particularly significant, for it demonstrated how careful analysis of historical photographs could be used to correct historical misinformation and yield new conclusions about historical events. In that sense, the book is a landmark of sorts.Still, I am less than enthusiastic about the book. Years ago I enjoyed Frassanito's similar book about Antietam, \\"Antietam: The Photographic Legacy of America's Bloodiest Day\\", so on a recent trip to Gettysburg I bought GETTYSBURG: A JOURNEY IN TIME. I found it less interesting or useful than the companion book on Antietam. Perhaps that is because Gettysburg is such a sprawling battlefield and many important areas were not visited by photographers in 1863. Or perhaps it is because the battlefield at Antietam as it now exists more closely resembles the way it was in 1862 than is the case with the battlefield at Gettysburg.In any event, new life and interest and value could be infused into the book if a new edition were issued in which the companion photographs to the historical photographs were truly modern. Perhaps we will get that for the Gettysburg Sesquicentennial."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Journey in Time","review":"The author is a historian extremely well versed in Gettysburg and it's surrounds. This book goes in depth to clarify and identify the settings of sketches and photos produced immediately after and for a time period following the battle. He also explains what the reader is viewing and puts these photos into historical perspective. This book dovetailed very well with the other Gettysburg books I purchased."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Journey in Time","review":"As Robert E. Lee and his Confederate army were heading away from Gettysburg after a grueling three day battle there was another \\"army\\" headed in to the small Pennsylvania city. The photographers. Thus begins William Frassanito's fascinating look at the the photos of perhaps the Civil War's greatest battle.While these photographs have traditionally been used either as art or as an illustration, Frassanito argues they should be used as historical documents. He then asks the following questions: who were the photographers, when were the photos taken, what parts of the battlefield were covered and what was neglected, has each photo been attributed to the correct photographer, and are the accepted captions correct and if not why.From here Frassanito goes on to discuss each of the major photographers who were on the battlefield in the period of 1863-1866. Primary photographers included Alexander Gardner who it is estimated took his first photos of the field on July 5, 1863. The majority of his photos deal with death and showing the horrors of war. Matthew Brady arrived shortly after and is believed to have taken his first photo on approximately July 15, 1863. Brady is typically known for his photos of landmarks and the general terrain of the battlefield. Charles and Isaac Tyson, owners of the Excelsior Gallery in Gettysburg, were on the field approximately two weeks after Brady. The Tyson brothers photos were similar to those taken by Brady. They took photos in both 8x10 and as album cards. Later in the period of 1864-1866 they issued a series of stereoscopes. Several other minor photographers are briefly discussed.Frassanito divides the battlefield into six areas and puts the photos into their respective areas. The areas discussed are: the first day's field, Cemetery Hill, Culp's Hill, Cemetery Ridge, Little Round Top and Devil's Den, and The Rose Farm. From there he discusses each photo and also tries to include a modern (OK the book was originally published in 1975 so the photos look extremely dated) photo of the area. Through his research Frassanito was able to find the location of almost all the original photos. He has also helped show how photographers staged many of the scenes they shot. Everything from weapons to bodies would be moved if it suited the needs of the photographer.Written in a clear and easy to follow style this book is recommended for anybody with an interest in the Civil War. For anybody who collects Civil War photography this is a must have and should be in the library of every Gettysburg historian."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Journey in Time","review":"I found this informative reference for famous Civil War Battle-this tells how these pictures were taken-who took them and when they were taken.

Not only does it trace the origins of the game (Merv Griffin's inspiration) and its history, it gives tons of tips that would be of use to a potential player. The biggest difference between the old game (with Art Fleming) and the new game is that in the old days, you could ring in anytime, so fast readers were rewarded. Now, you must wait until Alex finishes the question before you can ring in. That changed the game's dynamics quite a bit. There are virtually thousands of interesting tidbits within these pages: why it's impossible to cram, why men tend to be better at it than women, why it's so hard to get on the show even if you do well on the test, why contestants in second or third place no longer get to keep their money, etc... The book even includes sample Jeopardy! boards from popular categories. Even if you can't buy a copy of this book, I know it's available in many public libraries since it was published about 10 years ago. I highly recommend it to Jeopardy! fans.

The tryout process has changed a bit, with the online testing taking the place of sending in a postcard and hoping to be invited to a test, but I can't imagine too much has changed in the production process (especially the strict segregation of clue writers and contestants).The meat of this book is the 10 or so actual games printed in the book, though it's unfortunate that the answer pages (well, technically, the \\"question page\\", am I right?) are not marked in such a way that you can easily avoid accidentally spoiling your playing along. As another reviewer has mentioned, given the fact that this book is now 22+ years old, some of the clues are dated, but they seem to have done a good job of choosing clues that have stood the test of time.All in all, this book and the Jeopardy!

It you have a &quot;Grognard's&quot; interest in the Napoleonic period, armies, or collars and cuffs, this is a MUST. I have found no other reference which so fully dissembles Naploeon's forces, dissects them, and presents them understandably. This is not light reading. It presents discrete chapters on each type of unit used by Napoleon. Hidden within these chapters are essential tidbits on how and why these armies did what they did. It has the Place of Honor next to Etling's Atlas of the Napoleonic Wars!"},{"Title":"Swords Around A Throne","review":"I have read this book three times, and each time I find something new that I had missed before. Many books that delve into army organization, especially those addressing horse and musket era armies seem to be written by by people with less than adequate creative writing skills. Perhaps I find Elting's writing so accessible because I'm interested in the period. It could also be because he explains as he goes along, and that explanation is in a very down-to-earth tone.This book is an excellent reference for any military historian interested in the nuts and bolts of military life and organization. It's also excellent for any Napoleonic wargamer. The only other book that equals \\"Swords Around a Throne\\", is \\"The Army of Maria Theresa\\" by Christopher Duffy."},{"Title":"Swords Around A Throne","review":"This is a fantastic book that will tell you all you could ever want to know concerning the organization and operation of Napoleon's armies but be ready to drown in a sea of information.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Swords Around A Throne","review":"The best book I have read discussing the nuts and bolts of Napoleon's armies; food, clothing, organization, tactics, weapons and the characteristics of the several branches of his forces. Elting is a gifted and witty writer. Moreover, he grasps the psychology of the men and the spirit of the times and conveys it brilliantly to the lay reader. He has a great gift for the pithy epigram when summing up the personalities of the men and officers. If you were merely a novice reader before this volume, you won't be afterwards. Elting will make you eager to get deep into the period."},{"Title":"Swords Around A Throne","review":"This book could stand on its own as a work of literature. This is an exhaustive study of the minutiae of Napoleon's Grand Armee, and might easily have become a plodding reference work. The wit, irony, and, above all, the author's shear love of his subject matter make \\"Swords\\" good reading, fascinating even to people with no knowledge of Napoleonic-era warfare. Wish there were works this good on warfare in other periods."},{"Title":"Swords Around A Throne","review":"This is a review of the 1988 edition, which I checked out of the library.If you are reading a chronological history of Napoleon, this is a good side volume for looking up information on the units discussed in those kinds of texts, for instance, if you want to know what a grenadier uniform looked like or what equipment was standard issue.The description of uniforms, mounts, logistics, special units like bands and engineers, is detailed and outstanding, probably among the best to be found. The referencing and bibliography are quite professional if you want to explore further.Minus one star for not including at least a cursory unit roster or table with numbers of each type of troop, division descriptions, description of generals, etc. You have to dig through the text for this kind of stuff, and mostly it isn't there. This book could also use some color plates to show the various troops in uniform (there aren't any in my edition) because black and white doesn't cut it for this time period when the uniforms were quite flashy and colorful.As far as the descriptions of the uniforms and gear, I doubt you will be able to find a better single volume than this one.The coverage is comprehensive:-cavalry and the (usually overlooked) topic of horse remounts-generals and staff-infantry of all kinds (line, light, irregulars, etc.)-logistics-band units-cook units-mercenary and allied troops-disciplinary units-weapons and ammo-recruitmentIt is definitely worth checking out of your library if you're interested in the above topics. And if you have never read about this area before, it will provide a lot of new and interesting information."},{"Title":"Swords Around A Throne","review":"Elting does with this book a mammoth task: he provides all kind of details about the Grande Armee, from its inception in the Ancien Regime armies, to its finale at Waterloo. Every imaginable detail is included, there are chapters about the Marshals and Generals and other officers, each of the fighting and supporting arms, camp and campaign life, allies and enemies, food, discipline, Eagle standards, music, in short, every aspect is covered. What is most important, especially for a volume as hefty as this, the style is most entertaining and witty. I enjoyed it thoroughly. The only (small) drawback I could mention is that it has a quite noticeable pro-Napoleon and anti-British bias, and this could be perhaps annoying for some readers.

This is no great crime, especially in light of the predominantly British viewpoint of Napoleon found in most English volumes, but it does mean that one will need to look elsewhere for a truly objective work. That aside, this book does give the best structural overview I have seen of Napoleon's army (without diagrams and illustrations)"},{"Title":"Swords Around A Throne","review":"Colonel Elting is one of the most knowlegable authors in the business, and has a knack of telling a good story. However, there are existing errors about certain battles. For one, Elting claims that Baraguey-d'Hilliers division of dismounted dragoons arrived in time to save Dupont's infantry at the battle at Haslach on 11 October 1805 when there is overwhelming evidence that Baraquey's command never showed up. Also, some of his claims about units are questionable. For one, his claim that the 11th Legere was an outright failure after it was formed in 1811 is highly questionable. Clearly that statement could only POSSIBLY apply to 1812, when the regiment's combat performance suffered due to the quality of the 3rd and 4th battalions, but no one in the French army would have claimed that the 11th Legere did not perform well in 1813, or anything less than magnificently at Ligny in 1815.What's more, Elting criticizes other authors when they reference Thiebault's memoirs, even when a selected incident from those memoirs have corroborating witnesses or evidence, yet Elting uses Thiebault as source material for this work. Clearly, Elting's strengths are the politics within the army, the clashing personalities and the minor details of the interworkings of the army, rather than how the army performed under fire and the combat details concerning the battles. It should be utilized accordingly."},{"Title":"Swords Around A Throne","review":"'One quick blow and the wars over' with these words Napoleon led his army from the banks of the English Channel towards Austria, towards a small town named Austerlitz.This book is quite simply the best and more detailed thorough account of Napoleon and his grand army.

Skip this and you have a great book and information."},{"Title":"Swords Around A Throne","review":"Elting certainly knows a lot about Napoleon's armies, but this work is far from flawless. The author can tell you what a certain corporal's function and pay was, but he mis-states facts concerning some battles and regiments.

If you are looking of a general overview of the Grande Armee during more then two decades of the French First Republic and Empire, this book will inform. However it is not meant to provide or be a definitive statement on any of the topics discussed in the chapters. Its a guide, rather then a scholarly work. This is particularly true where armies other then French are discussed, or where equal space has been given to its largest corps, the Infantry or Cavalry.Other works dealing with specific areas should be consulted after readin this work."},{"Title":"Swords Around A Throne","review":"Swords Around A Throne is undoubtedly the best book yet published on the organizational history of the Grande Armee. Written by a recognized authority on the subject, who taught at West Point for 11 years of a 40 year Army career, it gives the reader, in concise, authoritative, and witty prose, the story of Napoleon's Grande Armee from its inception to its destruction and after. Col Elting covers the Grande Armee from muzzle to buttplate.Every possible subject is covered, from its commanders, all the combat arms and supporting services, strategy, tactics, and logistics, to such seldom covered topics as marches, bivouacs, awards, horses, discipline, law and order, military intelligence, and the Imperial General Staff. Based on thirty years of research, most of it from primary sources, some not used before in English, it puts the end to many myths and misconceptions (such as the Waterloo myths about the Imperial Guard), and enlightens the reader as to what made up that terrible instrument of war, the Grande Armee. A companion volume to the author's A Military History and Atlas of the Napoleonic Wars, it also stands alone as a work of immense depth, accuracy, and profound insight.Background material is also provided in the early chapters on the Royal Army of the Ancien Regime and the armies of the French Revolution. Additionally, allies, foreign troops in French service, and the Grande Armee's enemies are also given separate chapters. The book is also highly anecdotal, being peppered with stories of personages great and not so great. Keen insight into the character of the soldiers talked about is thorough and uncanny. Generals, captains, and the man in the ranks are all quoted and talked about throughout this engrossing study. As an added bonus, the final three chapters talk about the return, hasty departure, and final return of the hated Bourbons 'in the allies' baggage wagons', and what happened to the Grande Armee and its commanders after Napoleon's final exile. If the book has a weakness, it is that it leaves the reader with a hunger for more information. Another 300 pages would have been welcome.As it is, Sword Around A Throne is an immense achievement, seldom equalled and never surpassed. It is a must for anyone interested in the Napoleonic and Revolutionary Wars in general and the Grande Armee in particular. Epic in scope, painstakingly accurate, and romantic in its sweep and understanding of the times, it at times reads like a novel, and it is amazing to realize that these people lived, and performed the deeds told inside this the covers of this volume."},{"Title":"Swords Around A Throne","review":"Swords Around a Throne covers the organization and operations of one of the world's greatest armies. It is very detailed and fills a gap that many other Napoleonic era books leave open. The many elements of Napoleon's Grande Armee are thoroughly examined, including the cavalry, artillery, line infantry, light infantry, naval soldiers, engineers and the commanders. If you are looking for an in-depth account of the elements of the Grande Armee, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Swords Around A Throne","review":"This a a difficult book to review, because it is so very complete and thorough, and the author's style is very engaging and entertaining. The problem is that there is SO much information, the reader can't help to get bogged down on boring sections, and at times, choke on Elting's purple prose.I highly recommend this for those who already have firm background on the period, particularly the battles and campaigns. If you are keenly interested in what the grand armee ate for breakfast the morning of Austerlitz, you won't be disappointed. It is also an excellent topical reference.The downturn for me was about page 300. Elting only occassionally translates French phrases (very disconcerting for a Germanophile) and it was hard for me to get excited about the uniform piping of every single transportation, supply, service, and administrative battalion. But read on! It does get better.If you want to know about Napoleonic warfare in general, I would steer you to Rothenberg and Chandler. If you want to eat, sleep, march, breathe, and fight with one of the greatest armies in western history, it is worth the time."},{"Title":"Swords Around A Throne","review":"Thoroughly enjoyable, funniest army history ever written. Mr Elting shows a remarkable command of the subject, which is crisply presented and brought to life in chapters covering every aspect of army life - from general to private, from uniforms and organization to medals and pay - including information on the Grand Armee's allies and enemies. Napoleon once remarked that, in order to understand soldiers, you first had to love them. Mr Elting, an old soldier himself, totally proves this assertion. If you are a Napoleonic buff, this is your book. If you are not a Napoleonic fan, read it anyway, because it is one of the best histories about common people I know of.(NOTE: if you read &quot;Swords around the throne&quot; while leafing through the four-volume &quot;Napoleonic uniforms&quot; by the same author, the experience will be truly unforgettable.)"},{"Title":"Swords Around A Throne","review":"I must confess that prior to reading this book I did not know much about Napoleon, his armies or his campaigns. However since reading this book I've purchased many books on the subject and have become totally enthralled by the Napoleonic Wars. This is all due to the superb book written by Elting. His manner of writing is captivating...I could not put it down. His description of all the various facets of the Grand Army, its way of life, the different personalities, its uniforms, weapons and just about everything else one can think of is desribed in minute detail. Elting writes with much wit and apt sarcasm, which had me in stitches quite a few times. This book is a definite must for students of the era and even for people wanting an introduction to Napoleon's army. The book also left me in awe of the man himself...Napoleon. I am about to start reading it for a second time!"},{"Title":"Swords Around A Throne","review":"Swords Around a Throne is not your typical Napoleon book. Elting concentrates on topics which MAY rate a sentence or paragraph in other biographies. Elting concentrates on the different divisions of the Grand Arm&eacute;e including uniforms, in-depth looks at his marshals and the navy instead of regurgitating the different battles he fought. Swords Around a Throne is a good change of pace to the other biographies of Napoleon as it provides a different aspect to the Napoleonic Wars and his empire. Well worth the time to read."},{"Title":"Swords Around A Throne","review":"This is an excellent book, both informative and interesting. Even while discussing rather dry topics, the author manages to work in humourous anecdotes or observations.It is important to understand that this book is not a narrative history of Napoleon's campaigns--rather, it is broken down into chapters which describe various aspects of Napoleon's army--the guard, foreign units, allied units, supply organization, cavalry, artillery, and many many others; for each chapter/topic, the author describes the pre-Napoleonic context, as well as developments under Napoleon."},{"Title":"Swords Around A Throne","review":"This book is an absolute must-read for anyone who has any interest in the Napoleonic period. Simply put, it is a massive organizational study of Napoleon's armed forces, from an infantryman deep in Russia to the military police on the streets of Paris. The amount of detail contained within this volume staggers the mind, and yet Elting is such an effective writer that the book is never slow. In fact, the author's witty and sometimes sarcastic writing style makes it a delightful read.Elting assumes the reader has some general knowledge of the Napoleonic period, so if you're not well-versed in the history of that time you will encounter names of people and battles that are unfamiliar to you.Elting is also clearly fond of Napoleon as a soldier and a man, so all you Napoleon-haters out there would be well advised to avoid this book (you might learn things which challenge your viewpoint).All in all, I thought this book was a wonderful work of history and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"Swords Around A Throne","review":"Col. Elting's inimitable writing style is sorely missed. Unfortunately, he died a few years ago (which several reviewers will be saddened to learn). He wrote with such lively humor and energy, that he always entertained while he informed. Does the book contain a few flaws? Sure it does, and they have been mentioned in the other reviews. The author's approach, strictly speaking, is not what would be described as \\"scholarly.\\" Elting is a bit of a francophile, but perhaps acts as counterbalance to the anglophilia that dominates most English-language work on the Napoleonic period. (Owen Connelly, another American, is one of the most objective writers covering the period). Overall, Swords Around A Throne surpasses most other studies of the \\"Grande Armee\\" if only by merit of Elting's irreplaceble prose."},{"Title":"Swords Around A Throne","review":"This boom is a treasure trove. The book is full of interesting information that is enjoyably presented and really gives you an understanding of the talents and otherwise of some of the members of the Grand Army. The book is full of gems ( my favourite is the tale of Auguste Demas - Elting manages to tell his story objectively with such an undercurrent of contempt and irony I could have thought he was English! ( no insult Mr Elting ;) ) The author manages to make subjects that would normally have me page flicking into a fascinating read.Unbeleivably refreshing this is a must for your book shelf."},{"Title":"The Singer's Musical Theatre Anthology: Mezzo-Soprano/Belter, Vol. 4","review":"Hi!I got this book from Amazon.com a few weeks ago and it is great.It includes songs from classic Broadway shows -familiar shows and others not very known- and more recent plays, such as Spamalot, Thoroughly Modern Millie, Wicked and Urinetown.The print format is very spacey and the songs are quite accurate. Occasionally I've found little differences between the recorded tracks I own and whats written in the book, but I'm talking about one-two notes top.The book includes and introduction clearing a lot of things, which is worth reading, and an appendix about all the shows included with usefull information (authors, directors, number of performances, premiere dates, as well as a context paragraph with the show's story line, so you can know what the songs included are about).I love this book. And I will keep on buying this series.Two things I want to clear that were a bit confusing for me when I bought it:1. This book is just the sheet music. It does not include any CD or audio tape.2. The list of songs is the one mentioned in the first reviews listed. I know there's a review for another book with the same song list, but those are the songs for this book. (This was hughely confusing for me when I first bought this).Just in case, I'm re-copying the list of the song included in this volume (Singer's Musical Theater Anthology, Volume 4, Mezzo-Soprano/belter, Blue Cover), so no one else gets confused.AIDA: The past is another landI know the truthANNIE GET YOUR GUN: I got lost in his armsASPECTS OF LOVE: Anything buy LonelyAVENUE Q: There's a fine, fine lineTHE BEAUTIFUL GAME: Our kind of loveBELLS ARE RINGING: I'm going backTHE BEST LITTLE WHOREHOUSE IN TEXAS: Hard Candy ChristmasTHE BOY FROM OZ: Don't cry out loudCHESS: Heaven help my heartCHICAGO: NowadaysRoxieA CHORUS LINE: The Music and the MirrorELEGIES FOR ANGELS, PUNKS, AND RAGING QUEENS: Angels, Punks and Raging QueensFOLLIES: I'm still hereTHE FULL MONTY: Life with HaroldGRAND HOTEL: I want to go to HollywoodGREASE: There are worse things I could doHAIRSPRAY: I can hear the bellsMiss Baltimore CrabsI LOVE YOU, YOU'RE PERFECT, NOW CHANGE: I will be loved tonightJESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR: I don't know how to love himTHE LAST FIVE YEARS: Still hurtingSee I'm SmilingTHE LION KING: ShadowlandSPAMALOT: Whatever happened to my part?THE PRODUCERS: When you got it, flaunt itSONGS FOR NEW WORLD: Just one stepA STAR IS BORN: The man that got awayTHOROUGHLY MODERN Millie: Gimme gimmeWICKED: PopularI'm not that girlThe wizard and ITHE WILD PARTY: Look at me nowHow did we come to this?WISH YOU WERE HERE: Shopping aroundWONDERFUL TOWN: One hundred easy ways(Show titles are in CAPITAL LETTERS and songs follow).Best of luck!"},{"Title":"The Singer's Musical Theatre Anthology: Mezzo-Soprano/Belter, Vol. 4","review":"This book is an important addition to any mezzo's musical theater collection. Some may say that this volume is a bit heavy with the number of contemporary pieces, but I feel it picks up where the previous volumes have left off. Includes work by JRB, Marc Shiman, and pieces from Lippa's production of \\"The Wild Party\\". Of course the mega-musical of the decade, Wicked, is represented, though the show's most memorable piece \\"Defying Gravity\\" is not included. The book is, as is the case with most of the volumes, rather ballade heavy. Good up-tempos are few and far between, and many of those that are included are a overdone (i.e. Wicked's \\"Popular\\").But, despite a few short-comings, overall this volume is a must-have for anyone looking to beef up their contemporary repertoire."},{"Title":"The Singer's Musical Theatre Anthology: Mezzo-Soprano/Belter, Vol. 4","review":"Perfect condition; arrived fastGreat theatre songs in original keysNice piano partsMy girl loves it and is planning to audition with one of these numbers for college (vocal performance/musical theatre major)"},{"Title":"The Singer's Musical Theatre Anthology: Mezzo-Soprano/Belter, Vol. 4","review":"I wish the publisher would have included the CD's accompaniment along with the song book.

My daughter likes the book all in all."},{"Title":"The Singer's Musical Theatre Anthology: Mezzo-Soprano/Belter, Vol. 4","review":"This series is one of the most useful ever, because of the scope of the selections and the pracicality of them."},{"Title":"The Singer's Musical Theatre Anthology: Mezzo-Soprano/Belter, Vol. 4","review":"Excellent collection for \\"mezzos\\" from the world of musical theater entertainment.The only negative is that it needs updating so soon - there were 35 new musicals on Broadway alone in the last 15 months."},{"Title":"The Singer's Musical Theatre Anthology: Mezzo-Soprano/Belter, Vol. 4","review":"I got it fast, it was in great condition and it was easy to find in the stores.

I couldn't wait to see which tips or what subject matter would be covered next. Normally when reading technical books I tend to read just the chapters that interest me. Receiving a weekly increment was the prefect amount to digest in one week. For me the book was a mix of new info and a refresher of tips I'd learned before but wasn't currently using. I purchased the book as soon as it was available."},{"Title":"Learn Excel from Mr. Excel: 277 Excel Mysteries Solved","review":"Excellent Excel Book (loaded with information).

The perfect reference book."},{"Title":"Learn Excel from Mr. Excel: 277 Excel Mysteries Solved","review":"I consider myself to be an intermediate user of Excel. I like how he chose to put the figures the text refers too on the same page as the text. The book covers a little of everything, without going into any one topic too heavily. It will serve as a handy reference guide."},{"Title":"Learn Excel from Mr. Excel: 277 Excel Mysteries Solved","review":"This is one of those books that don't really contain anything new. What they do instead is present things in a way that as you read it you tend to say 'Of course, that's the way I can do that.'For instance, suppose you want to sort a spreadsheet on only the first three digits of an account number. You turn to page 147. It says, 'Create a new column. Use the LEFT function to populate that column. Sort on the new column.' It actually show you more instruction on how to do this, but that's the idea. 'Of course, you say, how obvious.' Then why didn't you think of it first?To make it easier to find what you're looking for, the book is broken into four sections: The Excel Environment, Calculating with Excel, Wrangling Data, Making Things Look Good. Each section then has a bunch of these 'hints & tips' I guess I'd call them. Alternatively there's a fairly complete index that is organizated alphabetically rather than functionally.I rank this an an excellent intermediate level book. If you don't know what a spreadsheet does, you need a lower level book. If you want to learn about Macros and VBA, you want a higher level. But regardless of your level, you'll find at least a few 'Of course's.'"},{"Title":"Learn Excel from Mr. Excel: 277 Excel Mysteries Solved","review":"This really is a book for those who work in the 'trenches'.

Because I created a spreadsheet for that purpose, I somehow became the \\"expert\\" for my entire department. I created a balanced scorecard spreadsheet template used by most of our IT departments. In the course of learning how to really use Excel, I purchased about fifteen different books on Excel. Some are excellent (particularly those by Mr. Walkenbach); but in the course of my research I encountered Mr. Excel, and his tools and hints have become the ones most useful to me on a daily basis. Sitting beside those Excel books is a binder with printouts of the weekly downloads from the book. I've greatly enjoyed reading the chapters I downloaded each week, and I knew early on I would purchase the book as soon as it was available. I did so as soon as I heard it had been printed. Mr. Jelen, you have made it possible for me, a non-programmer, to actually use Excel for improved management and reporting.

I had just taken the MS Expert certification for Excel missed a few items that I never even saw. I went back to Mr. Excel and there it was, plain as day.That was the best day I've had regarding software (although, I wish that I had discovered it earlier). So I signed up for the preview.WOW...so many tricks, shortcuts and ways of making things simpler. I am a very advanced Excel user and this book tops the cake!!Another review for this mentioned finding ooohs and aaahhhs - how true it is...you'll be saying..\\"WOW I can do that!\\" and \\"OH that's what that does\\" etc.I'm sure that you won't sit there and just look at the sections with a blank stare. The language is easy to understand. It is geared towards the user - real people - it helps you to understand what features/functions are used for, not just instructions. It also has great screen shots. Don't be overwhelmed - just take it as it is - step by step. I would suggest quickly running through the chapters to see what's there first..then you can begin actually USING and UTILIZING the software for what is and has.I definately recommend this to EVERYONE.It is excellent for beginners to learn the basics and useful tips and tools. As well as for advanced users.Don't forget the website!! Another excellent reference site.I know several family novices that will get this for the holiday!PS.

In between the examples, you'll find a tip on a shortcut key or other, \\"I didn't know that\\" type information. The two weaknesses that I would give it are:1) No example CD so I could follow along with the book (this was painful because I had to take time to create similar examples)2) I wish it would go over all the shortcut keys. Perhaps I missed this but I have found these to be useful and wish the material had been better organized so that you could find them all in one place rather than sporadically buried in an example that had no indication it was teaching you a new shortcut.Alas, there is much more positive than negative and I would definitely recommend the book to someone wanting to enhance their excel skills and learn a lot of tips they might have never learned otherwise."},{"Title":"Learn Excel from Mr. Excel: 277 Excel Mysteries Solved","review":"This book is very well done.

And as with most other books of reference, The Dedalus Book of the Occult is definitely not meant to be read all in one sitting (even if yours truly did just that thanks to his great sense of duty towards the readers). It's rather a book that one can return to again and again, or simply have standing ready in the bookshelf in case one needs to consult it.It's made up of two different parts. The first part offers, besides the very interesting introduction entitled A Dark Muse, five different sections. They are: Enlightenment Occultism, Romantic Occultism, Satanic Occultism, Fin de si&eacute;cle Occultism, and The Modernist Occultist. Throughout these sections, some of the most important thinkers, philosophers, authors, scientists and other important people of each era are described, along with his different connections to the occult. Both famous and not so famous names appear (or, at least many belonging to the latter category are not known to the larger mass or the ones who haven't read about the history of the occult before), such as Baudelaire, Newton, Crowley, and no less than two distinct Swedes: Emanuel Swedenborg and August Strindberg. Swedenborg wrote heavily about his different astral journeys to various planets in the (at the time) known universe and managed to influence more or less every single occultist who came after him, and Strindberg was very interested in the esoteric art of alchemy and read eagerly many of the occult texts that were available to him.The second part offers a large amount of different texts, all written by occultists mentioned in the previous part. This is a great initiative, since most occultist have been described thoroughly and have had a large amount of their work mentioned by Lachman. For the reader to now have the opportunity to read some of these works for himself is very welcome.However, The Dedalus Book of the Occult has not a single illustration. Most characters in it appear to have been very colourful, to say the least, and it would therefore have been nice if at least some of them could have been illustrated. But no, there is no such thing. The other major flaw - a flaw that unfortunately is very great - is the fact that the book have no index whatsoever. The page in the beginning having \\"Contents\\" as its heading only offer the different pages for the sections and parts, and that's it. When you get to page 378 the book suddenly comes to a very abrupt end, and in case you want to reread parts of it later, for instance if there is a certain author or work you need to refresh your memory about, then your only alternative is to painstakingly flip through the pages until you find what you're looking for.

The author gives a reasonably thorough introduction to the production of printed matter (especially books), discussing such \\"timeless\\" topics as typography and page layout. He doesn't dwell on the technology of the time, so almost all the information contained in the book is still applicable today.The book was born out of an introductory design manual prepared by Xerox for its customers. It's informal in tone and all the jargon used is explained by the author, who assumes that his readers are new to the trade. Rather than prescribe exactly how a page should be laid out and what kind of typeface should be used in each situation, the author discusses traditional solutions and tries to give the reader enough information to enable him or her to make his or her own decisions. The author gives tips, but never presents them as the only, or even the best, solutions -- a refreshing approach for people who can't stand Robin Williams's arrogance (not the actor, but the author of 'The non-designer's design book' and 'The non-designer's type book').Now a warning: this book has a rather inappropriate title. For one thing, you'll find but passing remarks about anything electronic in the book (which is good, since that would have made the book completely obsolete for our day and age). But most significantly, this is not a book on graphic design in general: it's really an introduction to page layout and typography, with an emphasis on text-intensive publications, particularly books."},{"Title":"Graphic Design for the Electronic Age","review":"This book is fun to read, with its ever tongue-in-cheeky sense of humor, yet all the while it provides a clear, authoritative explanation to not only the history and the WHY behind superior typographic style, but explains how to do it. I have used this book as a guide throughout my 16-year career in graphic design and advertising. As a creative director and layout manager, I make this book required reading for every designer who works with me. Even those with degrees in graphic design thank me, saying they learned a lot of things they never would have considered."},{"Title":"Hot Surrender: Complete & Unabridged (Soundings)","review":"When I first read this book, I thought that it was going to be one of those books that bore you in a second. Nevertheless, I was wrong, this book was wonderful. The plot is not very realistic, but it is so cute that you cannot resist turning the page. The best thing about this book, is the fact that it is like a fairytale, only in the 90's, about two people who have nothing in common but passion and love for each other. This book is great because it portrays the fantasy that opposites attract and that they can actually overlook the differences of education and social status. It is the perfect romance novel for all those people who live a controversial love life and would like to think that it can be fixed with the drop of a hat. I recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Hot Surrender: Complete & Unabridged (Soundings)","review":"This book was disappointing!! The author left me hanging with questions like:1. Why didn't she say thank you to Connel after he saved her life and was there for her due to her accident?1. What made her act the way she does?2. Why is she such a b**ch and very hard?3. Why does she behave as if she better than everyone?4. Why didn't she want to call the police when Larry tried to kill her but she told Connel she call the police if he didn't leave her house when she encouraged him to kiss and touch her body.I think Zoe has some issues that wasn't mentioned in the books."},{"Title":"Hot Surrender: Complete & Unabridged (Soundings)","review":"Felt like Connel was just a plot device. His character is never really explored. We meet him as he approaches Zoe's car and tries to get into her vehicle. He has had car trouble and needs a lift. She is a woman, alone in her vehicle on a rainy, dark night. She dissuades him from getting in, her mobile isn't charged, she promises to call a taxi when she gets home. She forgets but rings after about 30 minutes then proceeds to prepare for bed. She hears a noise and discovers Connel has let himself into her home. He claimed that he knocked but no one answered so that meant come on in!!! Then he demands to be fed, dry clothes, shower, etc. This is a STRANGER . . . HELLO!! What does Zoe says blah, blah, blah, you are an uninvited guest in my home but I will take care of you. Connel fixes a meal, does his laundry and yaks with Zoe, who apparently feels comfortable enough with this stranger who has invited himself into her home to fall asleep. The next day she finds herself in her bed and she is undressed. The nerve of this guy!! Heck Zoe isn't much better as she let him get away with it and didn't even call the police.The book carries on in that vein. There really is no thoughts of Connel's in this story so we don't know why he is in the area - he never says, why he seems to know so much about Zoe -other than the bad mouthing that his cousin has told him, why he would even be interested and why Zoe's brother-in-law and sister think that Zoe should bend over backwards to please Connel. What planet do these people exist on? Then there is another woman in the book but we aren't really sure what that angle is either as Connel doesn't explain but he does put this woman's needs above whatever it was that he was going to spout off to Zoe at the party which by the way he invited her to last minute. Like the day of the party!!There didn't seem to be any chemistry between Connel and Zoe nor could I understand how they could fall in love with each other. There seemed to be a LOT of time talking about Zoe's job and not much devoted to getting to know Connel. At one point it would have been more believable to have had the H be one of Zoe's co-workers!! It didn't make much sense when even her own sister complains that Zoe spends too much time working and not enough doing other things. Yet when Zoe is legitimately speaking to another man about work her sister doubts her. We saw the gradual change in Zoe from what she was in the beginning of the book though."},{"Title":"New England Ghosts (American Ghosts)","review":"...that the book's appearance is misleading - it does look as though it's meant to contain true ghost stories. [Since I prefer good fiction to the usual so-so \\"true\\" accounts I was delighted with this book, but can see how some readers would be disappointed!]The stories are all set in New England and include some great ones, from Benet's \\"The Devil and Daniel Webster\\" to Lovecraft's \\"Herbert West: Reanimator\\" (though that one technically isn't a ghost story at all!). Of the stories I hadn't read before, Bacon's \\"The Little Silver Heart\\" intrigued me - a mystery/ghost-story/nightmare. There's an offbeat Joyce Carol Oates story, and a charming old favorite by August Derleth (\\"The Dark Boy\\"), and more; a very nice anthology indeed."},{"Title":"New England Ghosts (American Ghosts)","review":"This is a good book but I believe that the title is misleading. I think that people who buy this book are looking for real ghost stories and these are short stories in the genre of Stephen King."},{"Title":"New England Ghosts (American Ghosts)","review":"I was really looking for a book on real accounts of ghosts in New England. I used to have a book like that, but loaned it to an ex-friend.I really did however enjoy reading this particular book, even though it was not exactly what I was looking for.I would recommend this book to anyone that like to read ghost stories."},{"Title":"New Nightingale, New Rose","review":"If you like either Hafiz or poetry, do NOT buy this book. The translator, Richard Le Gallienne, thinks Hafiz is a traditional love poet and an alcoholic. \\"Whatever mystical meanings may lie beneath,\\" he writes, \\"on the surface, at all events, the poems of Hafiz seem easy to understand. [Even] if they should have a secondary significance, most of us will, I think, be content to take them ... as lyrical expressions of joy and sorrow on earth.\\" In other words Mr. Gallienne does not understand Hafiz even slightly. His translation (which is actually a \\"rendering\\" of several real translations) is devoid of both insight and appreciation.If you like poetry, the book is equally bad. Take this: \\"You little Turk of Shiraz Town / Freebooter of the hearts of men / As beautiful, as says renown, / Are your free booting Turkomen.\\" Or this: \\"On a journey she is starting / How can I the anguish bear? / Oh the pain of her departing! / May the peace belong to her.\\" In short, the poetry is doggerel, made up of forced rhymes, twisted syntax and meaningless images.Daniel Ladinsky's sometimes too-hip translations are far better than these 19th century jingles. Avoid them!"},{"Title":"New Nightingale, New Rose","review":"To get a deeper insight into Hafiz, or any significant work of literature in a foreign language, more than one translation is usually necessary. Reading this translation by Le Galliene helped me get a better grip on this sublime poetry by this incredible sufi poet. Landinsky is also excellent. Hafiz is too profound to be captured completely by any one translator and I found reading both of these translations helped me better appreciate Hafiz the Man - Hafiz the Poet, as well as the efforts of both translators. Great stuff."},{"Title":"New Nightingale, New Rose","review":"I cannot read Persian but I have heard from people who can that Hafiz, like all great poets, wrote poetry which combines music and different levels of meaning to create something that can leave an indelible impression on the reader. No translation can truly capture that, especially when the languages are as different as English and Persian are. There are many translations of Hafiz that give us some idea of the meaning of his poetry. Many are pretty plodding as literature-the ideas and images are there but no music. At his best, Le Gallienne could transmit a feeling of lyricism and beauty that one doesn't often find in Hafiz translations. For this I feel he is a useful addition to your library if you're trying to study Hafiz."},{"Title":"New Nightingale, New Rose","review":"This a translation that I like to read aloud to myself. It gives much more of a feeling of Hafiz as a lover and a drinker, and it doesn't feel at all old fashioned. It's also a beautiful book. Great cover and design."},{"Title":"Irma: A Chicago Woman's Story, 1871-1966","review":"Ellen FitzSimmons Steinberg literally tripped over a collection of Irma Rosenthal Frankenstein's diaries in a Southern Illinois used bookstore where they had languished for years (Happily today they are now in the collections of the Chicago Jewish Archives). She weaves together a delightful biography of a woman who hadn't thought herself important; and yet Irma corresponded with Carl Sandburg and partook in nature walks with Jen Jensen and the likes of Laredo Taft. She was a mother and a middle class housewife who took time from her day to keep a diary. Her notes are invaluable glimpses into the past of a city on the make, and from the time of the great Chicago fire to the post World War period.At age 88 when most women have resigned themselves, Irma Rosenthal Frankenstein was an active part of a grass roots movement to save the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore as a National Park. She published a story about an outing to the dunes she had taken many years before in November 1917, and back when the movement to save the dunes as a park from Gary to Michigan City was in its infancy.Alas the movement to save the Indiana dunes was tabled with the outbreak of WWI. The slogan \`First Save the Country then Save the Dunes' was a battle cry that was forgotten as soon as the war ended and after a tiny state park was established in 1923. By mid century with Big Business about to gobble up the most precious part of the remaining un-saved dunes, several ladies from Ogden Dunes began an effort to rescue the enchanting bald and forest covered sand hills, and that had from time immemorial been a beach retreat for Chicagoans who lived up the lakeshore and across the state line in Illinois.It was during this last big push to save the lakeshore dunes that in1958, the widow of Dr. Victor Frankenstein, who had suffered a heart attack and from her hospital bed in Chicago orchestrated the publication of \\"The Chronicle of the Befogged Dune Bugs.\\" Her adventure story became a fundraiser for the Save the Dunes Council; the group that battled the big steel companies and other intimidating interests in the halls of Congress. After several years the ladies won the war, when Congress established the creation of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore in November 1966 but in the battle had lost the most important part of the dunes. Irma had also died the previous January 1966.Her interesting life story lives on because of the good fortune of a contemporary who stumbled onto her notes and charitably published a story Irma had always hoped to.Trent D. Pendley, President, Indiana Jewish Historical Society"},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"Very worthwhile- a classic! Everyone should read this once- lots of valuable lessons to be learned as well as entertainment to be had."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"The modern world with its IVF initiatives and other assisted fertility procedures have lead us to reflect on the role of nature and nurture as the prime developmental instrument in the character and personality of children - and also of the rights of parents. But it was a great surprise to me to find George Eliot writing of this so long ago - and I think there is little doubt where her sentiments lay (but then the issue in 'Silas Marner' was clouded by the involvement of the innocent and victimised, versus the guilty and self-possessed - but I'm sure that was written by design to emphasise a point).For a while 'Silas Marner' is a detective story. I had always thought Edgar Alan Poe was the originator of the detective story - but perhaps 'Silas Marner' may have been a trigger. This is an interesting mystery because we know who the culprit is and who the victim is - but will the culprit be exposed? and if so, how? For me, the circumstances of the crime was a little contrived but it did create a stimulating situation. But then the events of the story overtake the mystery and displace its resolution. When the resolution does come it is a real shock, not only to the reader but to characters as well - the ending is gripping and brings forth such desires for the four principle characters that I found it quite breathtaking to read.Some reviewers have bemoaned the use of this novel as a student reading text. I agree with them. I remember struggling through books inappropriate to my time when I was a student. It is only when people get older that they start becoming attuned to their history and the background to their society. The first George Eliot novel I read was 'Adam Bede' and its portayal of the Methodism I grew up with as an innovative cult was fascinating. But, as a youth, I'm sure it would have been just wierd. What would I recommend as a student text? Something current and engaging. As I have suggested elsewhere Philip K Dick's 'A Scanner Darkly' with its non-judgemental observations on the tragedy of individual destruction by the use of drugs, might have many levels of value to a student learning about literature."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"The plot of this book was very anbsorbing. At the end, I had to remember that I was just the reader and not in the book. I read sixty pages to read the conclusion. Also, George Eliot(pen name for Mary Anne Evans) has a way with words that is amazing. She uses specific words that give the reader an exact image. Though the sory was great, George Eliot needed to describe the characters greater detail. Other than Silas Marner and Eppie, the characters were left as vague beings with specific personalities, but no physical characteristics.:)"},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"An exceptional piece of literature.

I thought it would serve as a good intro into her work but the novel was far too simple in prose and spirit. While there is nothing wrong with the story of spiritual rebirth that's all it adds up to - a story. For me the definition of great literature is not just a good story but something which takes advantage of the art of writing by plumbing into the heart of humanity and translating it so the reader can feel what has been written. To put it simply, great literature can not be translated into a movie without losing what made it so great. This book can be easily translated into a movie as there is not much going on outside of the story. No deep character analysis, no discourse on anything really outside physical perception. From the plot the book should have been a very emotional read but it wasn't. Eliot's prose wouldn't allow it. She really serves as an outsider looking on these characters and situations rather then someone intimately familiar with the emotions and thoughts which make up the themes of the book. So, in turn, I felt like an outsider reading it. This would make a good movie where the story and physical emotion are the most important aspects, but as a novel it doesn't do the craft justice. In terms of English Victorian era literature Silas Marner just can't compare to novels by the likes of Thomas Hardy and Emily Bronte."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"Tragedy without compassion, a story ending with just deserves, with out loosing sight of the reality of life for the times."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"so sorry that i accidentally got my loaner book wet and had to buy a replacement. the cost for this product was a little much for such an &#34;old&#34; book, but was sure glad to find it so that I could get it replaced!"},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"The audiobook is read professionally.

Faith can be something one believes in without knowing if it is really there. In the novel Silas Marner, George Eliot makes clear how a weaver loses faith in God. The weaver [Silas Marner] regains belief when he finds a little girl around the age of two wondering around his cottage. He raises her [Eppie] and becomes very close to her. While raising Eppie, Silas takes her to church to be raised and taught like a Christian. This novel has a great shift when his love for Eppie starts changing his personality. George Eliot describes Silas's as a person with no hope. He describes the lost of devotion when his best friend steals a bag of money from a dying man. His best friend then blames it on him. The decision was left to God; whether or not he was to blame. This method convicted Silas, which is when he decided to loose all his faith. Silas hesitates when he finds out that Eppie is Godfrey's daughter.Sometimes having faith can help people continue their daily activities. This novel is really captivating, and interesting. It can make you understand the different ways in which God protects his children. When Silas was to busy avoiding confrontation with God, God put Eppie on his path. If you are a person in need of finding yourself it would be a great idea to read this novel. It focuses in the struggles one has throughout their lives. The many obstacles one will have to go through to know that at end everything will be alright. Sometimes it helps to know that there is someone waiting for you on the other side. This novel's rating is a five because it captivates the readers mind."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"I'm sure there are other good versions of Silas Marner available on CD or audiotape, but I must express my admiration for the reading by Andrew Sachs in an excellent unabrdiged edition of this Victorian classic. I was perhaps fortunate that I was not forced to read this book in high school when I might have found it a chore, so I approached the story with an open mind. Sachs manages beautifully to convey the inner life of Eliot's characters through his acting talent and his choices of slightly differing voices for each individual. A great reading of a great novel."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"This is an odd little book, but it's a good one. It's odd because the famous story of the old miser who is redeemed by taking in an angelic little girl to raise doesn't really even begin until half-way through the novel. This was definitely a surprise to me, but it wasn't a bad one. It ends up that there is a lot more to this novel than I thought there would be. In that first half of the novel, George Eliot brilliantly elucidates the fallen nature of both Silas Marner and the community. They're are revealed to be such selfish and sinful people. They are all in the throws of despair, lamenting their plight as humans and questioning a God who placed them in their lives. Eliot is really wonderful at capturing the need of each individual for redemption and also that need in the community as a whole. The individuals are criticized as is the unfair societal structure. Into this fallen world comes the angelic Eppie, and that's when the story really picks up. Eppie is the catalyst of grace offering redemption to Silas and the rest of the community.Silas Marner is really an extraordinary little novel. It's a thoroughly enjoyable book (especially after you get through the first half) with a lot of valid criticism and some hope. It's a really beautiful little classic."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"Long ago George Eliot breathed some life into these characters and their world of Raveloe, and if you look in on that place and time through the words on these pages, you'll find that things are still very vibrant there today. \\"Silas Marner\\" lives on because of the outstanding prose style and moral connundrums Eliot lays down as the foundation of her story.Her descriptions of people and places are so beautiful, her command of language so complete, and her style so refreshing, that it makes the world these people inhabit seem more alive and real than the worlds other authors attempt to spin. Her dialogue occasionly lets slip a touch of upper class pride, but overall her characters are expertly drawn, well filled out, and entertaining.The moral underpinnings of the story make it seem like a fable almost, but Eliot fortunately leaves final judgement of her characters up to the reader. Seeing Silas vindicated after so much going wrong for him made this worth the read for me. Despite some of the harsh realities of the class differences depicted, it is pleasant to watch the goings on in a small English town and to see Silas Marner at last catch some breaks and come into his own as a person. Even if it's a little unrealistic, heck, it's a novel so that's part of the fun.The choices we make for ourselves only determine part of our fate, Eliot seems to say with this story. Other things are not up to us, and those happen to us independent of any choices we make. I enjoyed pondering my own fate that way, through the lens of the little world of Raveloe. For such a short book, \\"Silas Marner\\" packs a lot of power in both language and meaning. This was my introduction to the work of George Eliot, and now I look forward to reading some of her other works."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"What can the reader of today find in a story about a weaver, who felt unable to assimilate into society, that he keeps to himself in his cottage? Quite a bit. As we read &quot;Silas Marner&quot; and watch him caress the only thing he has to love, the gold he's hoarded after so many years, we share in his grief when he comes home and sees it's been stolen. And the fact that it was the ne'er-do-well son of one of the town's most important people makes us more sympathetic. For each day, there are so many Silas Marners out there today, men and women who feel they are outsiders and who are victimized by those in a higher social rung. But we learn with Silas the more important meaning of life, when his old stack of gold is replaced by the new....the golden tresses of the child who wonders into this cottage to change his life forever. With rich characterizations, George Eliot creates a story that will move even the hardest heart. But look beyond the surface and see the indictment of the townspeople as well, who forced Silas into the outside, and then who welcome him."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"For any true connoisseur of life's ironies, there can be few finer than the fact that the radical Mary Ann Evans (George Eliot) is chiefly remembered for this completely traditional and eminently conservative tale. We needn't rehearse the elements of the story in detail because virtually every English speaking youth on the planet reads it in school. Just to jog your memory, Silas Marner is a devoutly religious weaver who is unjustly accused of theft. He moves to Raveloe where he becomes fairly reclusive both because he wishes it so and because the villagers find him odd. He devotes himself to the accumulation of wealth, but is once again devastated, this time when he is the victim of theft. Ultimately he is redeemed by a young girl who wanders up to his door. He raises the child and they come to love one another as Father and Daughter. The lesson being that neither religious fanaticism nor the love of filthy lucre will suffice to save a man's soul, but the basic love between two humans will do the trick.It's a fairly simple and straightforward story about the capacity of love to heal spiritual wounds and make damaged beings whole, hence its power. Her other novels are in vogue right now, particularly the unreadable Middlemarch, but this is clearly Eliot's best and one of the most affecting novels of the 19th Century.GRADE: A"},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"A powerful novel about despair and redemptiom, when everything in Silas's world was gone something unexpected happened to replace his gold with a new golden life.Always darkest before the dawn.Hope for the hopeless."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"THIS BOOK HAD A LOT ABOUT LIFE IN IT AND WAS A GOOD LESSON TO SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE A TENDANCY TO DO THINGS BEHIND OTHERS BACKS.

We had to read it for Freshman Literature. I thought it would be a book I wouldn't like but after I got farther in to it is got better and better."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"Silas Marner is a skillfully crafted novel to be enjoyed by readers with varied tastes. It was written by a woman, who found it necessary to use a man's name because of attitudes in England in the nineteenth century. It is built around problems that all of us face in our lives, such as, \\"How important is money?\\" As in all great novels, the characters change as the plot develops.SILAS MARNER is a realistic novel because it portrays life in a real and believable fashion. The author, Mary Ann Evans, who used the pen name, George Eliot, pays careful attention to a few distinguishing details about here characters and settings.For example, we can see Silas Marner, the central character of the novel, with his pale skin and undersized body. We know how he looks with his large, near-sighted, bulging eyes. We can see the important-looking village of Raveloe, which lives peacefully in opulent neglect.When I was a teacher, I directed many high school sophomores to read SILAS MARNER. Most students dreaded reading the novel included in their literature textbooks. Once they met Silas and spent enough time with him to become acquainted with his unique personality, they became eager readers of this well-crafted classic.It has some of the same qualities that madePride and Prejudice (Vintage Classics)an endearing and enduring novel. In both works, the idyllic English countryside is an enjoyable escape from everyday life. There is romantic courtship in both, but the romance of SILAS MARNER is not the central theme; therefore it is not as compelling as that in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Since the readers are not required to become obsessed with yearning for romantic fulfillment, young guys who were in my class felt free to enjoy it. (Sixteen year old young men are still self-conscious about these matters.) Both books contain the same kind of satire buffered with compassion. In both novels we laugh with the local rural and village people. Because the language in SILAS MARNER is less complex, adolescent readers enjoy it more than they do PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.When as a student I first read SILAS MARNER in high school and when I read it with my students, I considered the coincidences plot weaknesses. Life doesn't work that way, I thought. Now that I have experienced a life of incredible coincidences, I no longer find anything in the book unbelievable. Events caused by Silas Marner's catalepsy seemed unlikely, but now they represent no problem.Theft with its resulting bitterness provides conflict with which the readers can identify. Earlier I found it difficult to believe that the lightning of theft could strike twice, but that part of the plot is one more realistic element now. Other twists and turns with their ironic mysteries are typical of human life as I have lived it.All the parts of the novel that seemed to be a contrived fairy tale are now a vignette of life. Even if I could not believe it all, the book would still break my heart the wayForrest Gumpdoes with its twists and turns of satirical accounts.When I enjoyed SILAS MARNER in my twenties with thirty teenagers at a time, I did not notice the shaping of Silas' religious beliefs as much as I do now. I remember that the students and I were indignant about the way Silas was duped by the evil church members at Lantern Yard. Now I have compassion for them, especially William, as well as for Silas.Mary Ann Evans showed the futility of idolatry. All my students understood the disaster of worshiping money. If I could return to my students, I would like to ask them what they thought of the villagers who seemed to rely on the habits of their church to bring them close to God. Could we discuss that in the 21st century? I feel sure we would discuss the addiction to narcotics as it is realistically portrayed.SILAS MARNER is a great English novel not difficult to read, but rich in insights. It shows what is evil and what is good in human hearts."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"This is a very touching story. Our whole family loves to listen to it while we are in the car.

It is the story of a lonely man, who because he was falsely accused of stealing and because this cost him all his relationships with people, he secluded himself in his lonely house along with all his gold that he saved up. He never spent his money because he enjoyed its company. His gold was his only companion for several years of his life. Then one day, he was robbed, and he no longer had anything worth living for.Silas was slowly dying of misery and depression. He had no reason to live. Then one day a little girl walked into his house and into his life. Her mother died, leaving the baby girl as an orphan. So, Silas adopted her and took her into his home. She grew up a poor, hard-working girl who loved her new father Silas and vice-versa. Because of this new daughter of his, Silas changed for the better. He became more caring and devoted to someone else besides himself. He started to go to church again and changed his views on what really was important in life. And one day when his treasure was found and returned to him, he didn't even care for it. He had something even more precious than gold: someone to love and receive love from."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"Set in nineteenth-century England, Silas Marner is a weaver who has moved to a new town, Raveloe. Repulsed by his appearance and cataleptic fits, he is ostracized by the community. After losing his faith and having his fortune stolen from him, his fortunes change over time.The fascinating subject is not Marner but the town, Raveloe, whose characters are of particular interest. It is interesting how Eliot spends more time discussing their thoughts and actions than the does Marner, the title character.I was interested in this book from reading Middlemarch and found Marner to be decidedly more entertaining, but not as in-depth. Yet there are important themes found in Marner--the loss of faith, the good of the community vs. the rights of the individual, and the importance of social class (this is present in every British novel).Marner is a masterpiece--written by a woman in the nineteenth century, the book's unassuming nature belies its importance as a great literary work. It is also an entertaining book to read, and not too difficult, seeing its short length. Those interested in reading Eliot may want to start with this classic."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"Silas Marner is a nineteenth century Englishman. He belongs to a religious community; is falsely accused of theft and repairs to the isolated midland village of Raveloe. He is considered an alien by the clannish townsfolks. Marner is a Midas who enjoys collecting gold coins earned through long hours of weaving. One day the money is stolen by the dissolute Duncan Cass the son of the wealthy Squire Cass.Marner is devastated by this theft. And then love enters his life. Love is incarnated in little Effie the child who is orphaned by the death of her opium eating mother who dies on her way to confront Godfrey Cass with the child he and she have had together. Effie's mother was abandoned by Cass who seeks to wed the rich znd lovely Nancy.Through a series of plot machinations the ending is resolved when Effie is wed and is able to live with Silas. Godfrey Cass repents of his sordid past; acknowledges his parentage of Effie and confesses all to his forgiving wife Nancy.George Eliot wrote this short novel in 1861 prior to beginning her long and largely forgotten novel \\"Romola \\"The novel reminds this reviewer of the tale woven on the loom of Dickens imagination called \\"A Christmas CArol\\" dealing with the redemption of the miser Ebeneezer Scrooge. Scrooge is redeemed by the ghosts of Christmas and the sick lad Tiny Tim.George Eliot was a freethinker who held to a high moral standard of behavior. She knew rural England and its folkways well for it was here she grew to womanhooid. Her use of the customs, dialects and culture of the British peasantry is superb. She was before Thomas Hardy on the literary landscape and surpasses that great author in her ability to delve deeply into the human heart in conflict with itself.Many readers may have been turned off to Eliot through being forced to read \\"Silas Marner\\" in high school. These readers deserve to reread this beautiful parable of love and redemption. \\"Silas Marner\\" was the favorite novel by George Eliot. It deserves to live as long as the English language.

You travel with Silas Marner (the main character) as he finds himself through the love of a child. You see him abandon his previous life and travel far away as he starts again in a place that is unknown to him. You encounter the Cass brothers who have everything to hide and nothing to give. You will see through this novel how lies can only seep you in farther and how chance can give you everything back. This novel will have you wondering what happens next and how people will get out of trouble. You'll see Silas go from a lonely man to a law abiding citizen of his little town and how friendship and neighbors (in any form) can be helpful. The best thing about this book is that you'll see how the love of a child can change everything about a person from what they believe in to how they live their day to day life. BEWARE...you will have to get over the obstacle of reading the first couple of chapters before you get to the &quot;meat&quot; of the book. Don't fall into despair and throw the book away!!!

And then the gold is stolen.It takes a miracle for the gold to come back in the form of a fair-haired, trusting little girl whom Silas names Eppie.

That is saying a lot since it is piece of writing that is almost 150 years old."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"If you're required to read this book in high school, then kudos to your teacher for introducing you to George Eliot.Having said that, when I was in high school, I wouldn't have appreciated George Eliot either. She was a master crafter of literature, choosing words thoughtfully and laying patiently the foundation of characters, observations, storylines to form a more perfect novel. In other words, to most high school readers of classic literature, her books can be boring.But wait at least 10 years, pick up her works again, and find yourself pulled into stories that simultaneously take you back to provincial Victorian England while portraying the lives of characters who could be your friends, family, yourself.Silas Marner is a wonderful precursor to Eliot's Middlemarch. The story focuses on the main title character, of course, following this sad little weaver from the time he was a respected member of his community to the moment he was cast out to his wandering and settling in sleepy Raveloe where he seeks to be left alone. Betrayed by his best friend and rejected by his fellow worshippers at Lantern Yard, Silas loses faith in God and people. He means to live the rest of his life in Raveloe, shielded from the God who failed him and from people who would only disappoint and hurt him.He passes the next 15 or so years of his life, shunning society who responds to this odd-looking stranger by alienating him. Silas finds solace in weaving, weaving, weaving, accumulating gold for his work, and transferring his love to these gold pieces.Silas' core is shaken again by a shocking event, and he is in danger of soon dying a broken man. He is restored when a little girl with golden curls toddles into his life. He comes to believe the gold he lost came back to him in this \\"golden-haired replacement.\\" And from then, Silas is slowly drawn back to life, back to society, back to faith in God. The little orphan he saves and names Eppie ends up saving him.Sounds like a simple almost sappy story, no? Under George Eliot's pen, it's a wonderful telling of faith (in God, in people, in life) lost and found because of unconditional love for a little child. But it's also much more than that. The story explores themes of alienation, societal rejection of otherness and being different, questions of where one fits in society and how that role is interdependent on one's participation in society as well as its acceptance of one on what terms, love of course as a restorative panacea, love between a father and his adopted daughter trumping all, and so many different aspects of life and its challenges and rewards.All of these ideas are so expertly presented and turned over, my eyes were sometimes stopped dead in their tracks by a passage that I would then reread several times to appreciate the beauty of its truth and language. I'm about to date myself (I'm currently in my late 30s), but I just had to share one of the most memorable observations I'd read in a long time. It's about Godfrey Cass, a man who seems to have everything, except a child to call his own:\\"Meanwhile, why could he not make up his mind to the absence of children from a hearth brightened by such a wife? Why did his mind fly uneasily to that void, as if it were the sole reason why life was not thoroughly joyous to him? I suppose it is the way with all men and women who reach middle age without the clear perception that life never *can* be thoroughly joyous: under the vague dulness of the grey hours, dissatisfaction seeks a definite object, and finds it in the privation of an untried good.\\"I don't think George Eliot is saying here that Godfrey is silly for wanting a child when he has everything else a man could possibly want. It is the idea of many men and women never being able to be truly happy and forever chasing some thing, which they find is lacking in their life at that time, because they're sure that thing will make them happy. This is the classic middle crisis, but it is universal in us all to desire what we can't have and to think our happiness depends on us getting it. It doesn't of course.I say this book is a precursor to Middlemarch because we start to see in this novel George Eliot's beginning of writing novels with distinct townsfolk full of characters as memorable as the main characters -- folks that populate a village and are as recognizable as your kind neighbor, local bartender, neighborhood elder. I'm thoroughly entertained George Eliot's creations here: Mr. Macey, Dolly Winthrop, Squire Cass and his brood, Nancy and Priscilla and their respectable kin.So why did I not give this 5 stars? Honestly, it was too short. Much time was spent on Silas and his life before finding Eppie, but not enough was flushed out in the story after. I loved the chapter when Eliot described how this old bachelor is suddenly befuddled by the two-year-old he's adopted and becoming a father to her. Where does he begin? And when Eppie turns 3 and mischievous, it's hilarious to follow Silas as he tries to discipline his precious...and can't. Those little nuggets are treasured by this newish mom. But it comes to an end too soon and Eppie is next seen as an 18-year-old girl about to embark on her new life.The second part of the book feels hastily completed. Loose ends are tied up; difficult conversations improbably take place and are resolved in one day; Silas' journey to his old life at the former Lantern Yard and back home to Raveloe is rushed; and Eppie's story has its happy ending.Had George Eliot wanted to keep writing to flesh out all these paltry scenes, I would have happily kept reading and delighted to have given this book a 5-star rating."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"Don't read the review following this one unless you want all the plot points revealed.If you've read George Eliot before, you know to expect interweaving plot lines, good characterizations and moral themes. This story is shorter than Middlemarch and Mill on the Floss, therefore not as deep in its levels and plot lines, but still absorbing and satisfying.It's the story of a bitter man, older than his years; a young child who changes him, and how their lives are interweaved with the lives of another, wealthy family. It's filled with life: tragedy, comedy, scenes you want to read out loud. George Eliot is a wonderful writer, one who can transport you to the English countryside and to the time period so you feel like you are there, and you always care deeply for the characters.I think very young readers might find feel there are \\"too many descriptions,\\" but I found it very entertaining all the way through.

In the height of his youth, when he is healthy, happy, and totally in love, young Silas is betrayed, cast down, and taught the 'lesson' that only the criminal and avaricious get ahead in life. He moves to a new town and abandons any attempt to connect with the society around him, instead focusing on hoarding his wealth and lovingly counting his money nightly. When his precious hoard is stolen, Silas is again crushed, but the arrival of a small \\"angel\\" - a little orphan girl with golden curls - starts him down the long road to redemption.A powerful aspect of this novel is the use of foils and counterparts against the main character as he learns his life lessons. The members of the local nobility live out their seemingly \\"perfect\\" lives unhappily, having not learned the lesson that Silas has learned through his exploitation as a lower-class member of society. By the time the local nobility realize what a treasure Silas' adopted orphan would have been in their barren home, it is too late; only the poor and miserly old man truly understood in time the value of living life for the sake of another.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"I think the reader made all the difference.

In his home-town, Silas Marner is wrongly accused of a heinous murder, forcing the poor weaver to move to Raveloe; there, his life-savings are stolen by a greedy aristocrat. Through this fictional character and his grievances, George Eliot brings tremendous support to the idea that Providence will mend things and make them whole, and that we can survive our trials by trusting in this goodly power. Although the plot develops slowly, it is engaging. You cannot help but sympathize with Silas when his reason for living- his money- is taken from him. He is devastated, and when neighbors come to offer support, he remains speechless. Life seems to have crushed him with its unfairness. It is at this point of despair that Providence intervenes, bringing an orphan girl to Silas' cottage. Silas finds her mother dead in the snow, but still he &quot;had formed no conjectures of ordinary natural means by whihc [the arrival of the girl] could hav ebeen brought about&quot; (115) The little girl, Eppie, transfroms Silas' reclusive life into one full of love and new happiness. Eppie comes to life as she &quot;toddles about&quot; and &quot;clings&quot; to weaver, who receives her affection awkwardly. Eliot shows, through heart-warming descriptions, how fate has blessed Silas by its miracles. Silas learns that the key to contentment is to remain optimistic. He learns the truth of neighbor Winthrop's advice: &quot;. . . isn't there Them as was at the making on us, and knows better and has a better will? And that's all we can be sur eon, and everything else is abig puzzle to me when I think on it&quot; (148)."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"\\"Life is what happens while we're busy making other plans...\\" John Lennon's lyric are words to live by in this hardy Victorian chestnut about a simple miser who finds love at his doorstep one snowy evening.Published in 1861, George Eliot's novel has a reputation for dreary earnestness that kept me away from it for quite some time, until I decided to make an effort at reading all the books I successfully avoided in high school. \\"Silas Marner\\" turned out one of the easier assignments, not only because of its shortness and simplicity, but for Eliot's engaging manner of writing, which feels less wedded to its time than even more famous writers of her generation like Dickens.Marner is a weaver and a kind of social exile who sets up his home and business in the English country town of Raveloe. Not happy but content, he spends his time either working or sleeping, his sole recreation being the counting of his gold coins. All this is suddenly taken away from him, but Silas's misfortune turns out to be a blessing, pushing him out of what had been a rut-like comfort zone.\\"Our consciousness rarely registers the beginning of a growth within us any more than without us,\\" Eliot notes early on in Silas's transformation. \\"There have been many circulations of the sap before we detect the smallest sign of the bud.\\"There's a lot to like about \\"Marner\\" the novel. The title character is a real treasure of literature as Eliot describes him, not because he's particularly exciting so much as because he's so readily identifiable, especially with those of us who are old enough to know disappointment in life. Many reviewers here compare him to Scrooge; Marner is a materialist and a bitter social outcast, but unlike Scrooge he retains a certain palpable sympathy and humanity throughout. This in turn makes the character's journey more compelling.Eliot captures a pastoral vision of English village life that feels absorbing and affecting, even if it is a bit gauzy. Her philosophic asides are marvelously quotable without ever getting in the way of the narrative. Her plot twists are well designed and hardly predictable, at least to me; I was especially impressed by how she dealt with a long-absent antagonist late in the story.But here's an odd criticism for a Victorian novel: It wasn't long enough. That's actually a problem, as the central game-changing transformative act of \\"Silas Marner\\" takes place when the novel's already half-over, and from then on the story speeds toward a spotlessly tidy resolution. The development of Silas's relationship with the others in his village, and with the little girl that changes him, feels rushed.To want more of a book is thin criticism of what is there. Perhaps a solution might be to read it again, for Eliot's ruminations on how people deal with the specter of misfortune, using various designs to try and ward it off, are both deep and charming. Her metaphysics are a trifle muzzy (I'm not sure if she was a Deist or an agnostic; maybe she was both at various times) but her take on the human condition comes across as well-grounded and relevant. She is a keen social critic, but not a blanket one; her take on organized religion manages to be both dubious and positive.In short, this woman with a man's nom de plume is very hard to pigeonhole, which also goes for her nifty novel. To adults like me of a certain age, the title may suggest boring homework assignments thankfully dodged, but \\"Silas Marner\\" is a real treat worth picking up."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"Silas Marner is a great classic that tells a wonderful truth.

I picked it up the for the first time when I was 15 years old. It was required reading in English class. Being a cynical teenager, I balked at it at first. As the class got into reading it, I was totally taken with the complex story line. I loved it. It is one of the best books I ever read and reread. A few years ago, I mentioned it to an English teacher who jokingly asked me to \\"compare and contrast the moral revelation between Scrooge in a Christmas Carol and Silas Marner\\". Well I replied, Scrooge changed his ways and realized what was important by being confronted with the unlikely encounter with the supernaternal; Silas Marner came to his realization through \\"bad eyesight\\".

Years later I subjected one of my children to the same ordeal when she needed to write a book- report. And this because I found then and now, this moral tale of redemptive love to be moving and instructional. For young people and I expect for most readers today the complexity of Eliot's language is an obstacle to be overcome. She writes the kind of sentences the masters of style have been teaching Americans not to write for years. But she writes with great intelligence and intuition, great moral feeling. The story of the weaver unjustly accused of a robbery, who retreats into his own private world and who is later redeemed by his meeting and taking care of an orphan child is one which cannot help but touch the heart. And as Hawthorne said when the heart is touched we begin to be .And this work comes alive with the old codger's care for and love of the orphan child. Like Scrooge the other great scowling isolato of nineteenth century Literature he exemplifies and proves the greatest moral lesson of all, that in loving and caring for other human beings we become human ourselves.Who can make it through the difficult language will find not only a very detailed and convincing description of English village life in the early nineteenth century but also a warm tale of the human heart healing itself through love."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"I first read Silas Marner when I was 18 years old, and loved every word. I started reading it again immediately after finishing it! As said in other reviews, perhaps 9th grade is indeed too early because at that age, this older language style is difficult to \\"get into\\" quickly enough to hold their interest. I found myself wrapped in this little town with its odd characters and gossip, and wished I'd lived there. The imagery is so strong and sweet I still refer to the scenery evoked by this novel when I read completely unrelated historical articles! The story itself cannot be called remarkable because it is one of the basic stories about humanity and what matters in life. Yet George Eliot surpasses all others in the telling of it. There is a reason this book is on all the reading lists -- it is a great achievement."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"There are few great novels about people who are basically good and who are, in the end, rewarded for it. I can think of only three others I have read in this genre that had any literary merit: Eliot's ADAM BEDE; Elizabeth Gaskell's CRANFORD; and Oliver Goldsmith's THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. I can see why SILAS MARNER is usually regarded as a novel to be read by the young, if only because it reinforces values that most of us see as desirable.Granted that Marner starts out as a miser, if only because he is so isolated from the rural community in which he lives. When Marner's small fortune is stolen, a strange thing happens: His neighbors gather closer to him and help him, drawing him out of himself and illuminating the goodness that was always inside of him. Marner's neighbor, Dolly Winthrop -- a poor, inarticulate wheelwight's wife who does everything she can to make Silas a part of the village of Raveloe -- particularly shines through in an excellent supporting role, one of many in the book.When a toddler whose mother dies crawls into Marner's house, the process begins to accelerate as he adopts her. The weaver now has someone to live for; and the love between him and the little Eppie begins to flower.Good seems such undynamic a quality in literature. George Eliot is one of the few writers who can make the tribulations of a good person worthwhile reading. In weaver and his neighbors, Eliot has created an entire community that strives for the greatest good (with the sole exception of Dunsey Cass, who steals Marner's fortune). The best books always make you wonder what happens next; and SILAS MARNER kept me turning the pages, marvelling at my own reactions to what I would once have thought was too simple and flimsy to engage my attention.George Eliot is a writer of many surprises and many surprising strengths. I had approached this book only because I was filling in a gap in my reading. Having read it, I urge anyone to pick up this book if you are young and hope for the best in life -- or come to it, like myself, an adult who has been &quot;nicked by the scythe,&quot; who has forgotten some simple truths about which he needed reminding."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"Jan 28 2010 - Melvyn Bragg discussed this novel with leading academics in the UK. See [...] where this can be listened to............SILAS MARNERPublished in 1861, Silas Marner is by far Eliot's shortest and seemingly simplest work. Yet beneath the fairytale-like structure, of all her novels it offers the most focused expression of Eliot's moral view. Influenced by the deconstruction of Christianity pioneered by leading European thinkers including Auguste Comte and Ludwig Feuerbach, Silas Marner is a highly sophisticated attempt to translate the symbolism of religion into purely human terms.The novel tells the story of Silas, a weaver who is thrown out of his religious community after being falsely charged with theft. Silas is embittered and exists only for his work and his precious hoard of money - until that money is stolen, and an abandoned child wanders into his house.By the end of her lifetime, George Eliot was the most powerful female intellectual in the country. Her extraordinary range of publications encompassed novels, poetry, literary criticism, scientific and religious texts. But beneath her fierce intellecualism was the deep convinction that for society to continue, humans must connect with their fellow humans. And it is this idea that forms the core of her writing."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"Newspaper readers were invited recently to submit their choices for the greatest works published in the English language. When the choices were totalled, two works by Shakespeare featured in the top ten. Also featured, I was pleased to see, was a novel by George Eliot. Internet users, familiar with her works, will probably guess which of her novels was chosen. For those unfamiliar with her works, the best one to start with is \\"Silas Marner\\", a much shorter one. It is short, it is easy, it even works well in schools (as I can testify), and yet it is undoubtedly a masterpiece.George Eliot sets her 1861 novel in the early decades of the nineteenth century in rural England. Silas Marner is a weaver. In the pattern that life weaves, he usually features as a victim. Because he is unjustly \\"framed\\", he loses his reputation and his betrothed in the town where he grew up. After years working as a weaver and living like a hermit in a rural district then, he is robbed by an unknown thief who uncovers and makes off with the cache of gold guineas Silias keeps under his floor. Happiness and joy come to Silas, however, and at the end of the novel he is told, \\"Nobody could be happier than we are\\".George Eliot tells her tale with a mixture of womanly sympathy, sharp observation, tact, and humour. Her depiction of a long-gone past, and her clear pointing of right and wrong impulses, give the story qualities that are sometimes found in morality plays or in fairy tales. Don't skip over the scenes in the local inn, the Rainbow, where the simple-minded rustics discuss relevant issues, including the existence of ghosts.For those who appreciate hearing good literature read aloud, I recommend the unabridged audio format of \\"Silas Marner\\" where the reader is Andrew Sachs. As you might expect of this fine English actor, who made Manuel from Barcelona so memorable in \\"Fawlty Towers\\", he is especially wonderful in portraying the argumentative, credulous, muddle-headed rustics that foregather at the Rainbow.

I'm a particular fan of writers from the late 1800s, but this story's plot line, set in an earlier period, snagged my attention. I fully anticipated enjoying \\"Silas Marner,\\" even though it falls in a period a bit more obscure to a modern reader.Alas, I am that modern reader. When Silas Marner was center-stage, the story moved along, and it was hard not to empathize with the false accusations he endures and the self-exile he chooses. I enjoyed the plots twists from darkness and isolation to deeper darkness, and finally to unexpected redemption. The appearance of the little girl, though less enigmatic than the synopsis implied, was a nice touch. Despite these highlights, I found myself plodding through numerous pages and scenes. The writing has some high moments, but it violates so many of the modern rules of fiction-telling, telling us instead of showing us, pounding home its points instead of letting them simmer just below the service. I truly wish English teachers would use creative minds of their own, instead of succumbing to intellectual pressures and pushing books with little accessibility or interest to a new generation of readers.I can fully understand this book's appeal to readers of its day. It wrestles with certain issues of class and status, with the hypocrisy of the rich and the religious, and the superstitious but honest efforts of the working class. I'm glad to have entered the world of \\"Silas Marner,\\" but, sad to say, I was also glad to leave it behind."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"This book IS slow...it's a Victorian novel, and full of descriptions of the people and the countryside, which makes it seem to drag in places. You have to have patience to read Victorian novels, and remember that at the time they were written, most people did not travel much, a journey of 5 miles in a carriage took an hour in good weather and on good roads, riding a horse that distance would take half an hour to 45 min, depending on the ablility of the horse and skill of the rider. Without TV and movies, people had limited opportunities to see scenes of other places than where they lived, so writers needed to describe scenes in detail. It is this richness in detail that attracts me to Victorian novels. I was not bored at all by this book.Silas Marner is a complex character, a nearsighted weaver, given to \\"fits\\" (possibly petit mal seizures), not handsome, and not wealthy enough to overcome his ugliness. He is betrayed by a friend, which puzzles him, rather than angers or embitters him. His neighbors distrust him, though they bear him no ill-will, for he comes from \\"outside\\" the village, and lives a short distance outside the village. The rift--such as it is--is partly due to Marner's nature, partly due to the villagers' natures. He becomes a miser, partly because he needs something to love, and gold is what he has....this becomes the object of his affections. Not because he cares to be rich, but simply because he loves the gold.He is robbed one evening. The thief is Dunstan Cass, a younger son of Squire Cass. Dunstan is a drunkard, a wastrel, a thug, and a blackmailer....he is blackmailing his older brother Godfrey (weak willed and spineless, easily led by the stronger-willed and cunning Dunstan), who has married an opium addict and kept the marriage a secret from his family, for fear his father would disinherit him. He pays Dunstan to keep silent. At one point, Godfrey collects rent from a tenent farmer, gives the money to Dunstan to buy his silence, and hopes not to be found out. However, he is unable to raise the money to repay his father for the rent he stole. He gives his prized horse to Dunstan to sell, but Dunstan kills the horse in a hunting accident. Dunstan walks home, past Marner's cottage, sees no one home, remembers the stories of Marner's hoarding of gold, finds the money and makes off with it. Marner comes home from his short errand, finds the money gone, and is devasted. He seeks help in the village to find the theif. But by this time, Danstan is gone, and the help the villagers can give is both confused and useless. The money is never recovered, and Marner almost loses his mind.During the New Year's party at the Manor, Squire Cass, his family (minus Dunstan) and his guests are enjoying themselves, not knowing that Godfrey's secret wife is coming with their child to force Godfrey to acknowlege her and pay child support. However, she drinks opium, loses her way in the snow, and heedlessly falls asleep under a furze bush. The child, about 2 years old, toddles aawy, a short distance to Marner's cottage, and enters while Marner is at the open door, in one of his \\"fits\\". He comes to, and sees the little girl asleep at the hearth. He traces the child's footsteps back to where the mother lies, frozen to death, under the furze. He runs to the manor to summon help, for he knows the village doctor will be at the party. Godfrey goes out with the doctor, for he has a suspicion who the woman is. He is relieved to find her dead, for this frees him to marry the girl he really loves.Marner insists on raising the little girl as his own child. Godfrey occasionally gives money or goods to Marner to \\"help\\" with the raising of of the little girl (called \\"Eppie\\" after Marner's sister, who died in infancy) but the bulk of the assistance comes from the villagers. Impoverieshed themselves, they nevertheless share what they have with the weaver and his child, and gradually their suspicions of Marner ease, and they become friendly with him.Fast Forward, to 16 years later: Eppie has become a beautiful young lady, loved and courted by one of the village boys. Godfrey and his wife, Nancy (whom he married shortly after discovering his first wife dead) are childless. Godfrey finally confesses his early marriage to Nancy, and tells her that Eppie is really his own child. Meanwhile, Dunstan's body is found, in the bottom the the stone pit, long filled with water, now drained. The bags of gold Stolen from Marner are with him. Godfrey is horrified by Dunstan's crime, and wants to make right all the wrongs done to Marner by the Cass family. He and Nancy decide to adopt Eppie, Nancy with the desire of righting a wrong, Godfrey with the desire to salve his conciense (he has a conciense, it's just a weak-willed one). They approach Marner and Eppie in Marner's cottage, and tell them the story, and that they would like to adopt Eppie, and give her all the privileges, comforts, and advantages that wealth can provide. Maner, thinking of Eppie's future, agrees, though it breaks his heart. Eppie, however, thanks Godfrey and Nancy kindly, but turns them down flat. She has no desire to leave the only father she knew, the villagers she's known all her life, and the young man whom she loves. Godfrey and Nancy leave, saddened and chastened.This is a story of redemptive love. Godfrey is redeemed by Nancy's devoted love of him; rather than berating him or leaving him for his early indiscretions and marriage, she continues to love him unconditionally. Silas Marner is redeemed through his love for Eppie; she literally changes his life, and he is a new man after she comes to him. The gold that Dunstan stole is returned to him, and he no longer cares about it. The desire to hoard is gone. The villagers are also redeemed; the man they formally shunned as an odditity and outsider is accepted into their homes as one of their own, and even the most belligerant village man (the farrier) is softened when Eppie comes to visit. Eppie, had she not been saved by Silas Marner, would have been an orphan and sent to a workhouse as soon as she could walk and feed herself.This is also a story about choices, and how making a decision can affect your life. Godfrey choses to marry in secret, and that choice leads to a life of fear, even after his wife's death, fear of people learning his secret, fear of his new wife learning his secret....he is never free of fear, until he chooses to confess his transgression. Marner chooses to keep the child, though he knows doing so will change his life, not necessarily for the better. A good-hearted village woman chooses to help him in this endeavor, rather than continue to shun him, and her life is enriched as a result.The differences in the lives of the rich and the poor is well definied. The rich, dispite all their wealth and privilage are the poorest in spirit. They are the useless idlers, the parasites, the criminals. The villagers, despite being impoverished, owning little or nothing, uneducated, are the richest, in terms of happiness and love.This is a powerful book."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"I may only pity the plight of American society, for time and time again I hear complaints lodged against the British literary canon (indeed, even the American canon) that the books written long ago simply hold no relevance and plod along with no point. There is no relevance to an outcast being condemned in Victorian society for being an outsider and different? But certainly this country has no racial problems, particularly as we are so incredibly lucid and politically correct. Look at how openly we welcome outsiders into our society. We are nothing like the people of Raveloe.Is this George Eliot's masterpiece? No.Yet what parent hasn't felt the dilemma Siras faces with his future with Eppie? Who hasn't had their faith deeply questioned by a deeply-felt wrong in the world? Who hasn't felt the guilt of being unable to speak the full truth to those loved the most?Oh, the plot isn't there. That may be the point, for can the life of a man who lives without the presense of love and only ambition call his existence a plot?

She taught school turn of the century and left part of this book for us, so now I can read it myself, pleased."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"The novel Silas Mariner is 182 pages in length, and this is one of the shorter novels by George Eliot. This is an interesting story and a recommended read. Is it pure gold? No. That is an over-statement. It is not another \\"Notes From the Underground\\" or \\"Death of Ivan Ilych.\\" It is a bit of a romance smaltz novel, and it is short. It is a long short story. But it is different from what one might think. After all, consider the author and the times in which it was written.The novel does have a measure of charm. The title is taken from the name of the lead character. He is a weaver in a small English town. One might say that he is a very dull character. But he has a few interesting events in his life - which I will not reveal here. There are only four interesting characters that run the complete length of the novel. They all live in the same small village. Also, there is a secondary set 3 or 4 characters. These are interesting and almost Dickens-like characters who drift in and out of the action.Coincidences give away the plot. That is a weakness. After 100 pages or so, or about 60% through the read, it starts to become clear what will happen. And, from that moment going forward it follows a most predictable script. Still, it is well written and colourful, and the novel does hold some delightful surprises.The novel is a quick read.Recommend. It ranks 4 stars."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"I expected a masterpiece, instead I suffered through a predictable plot with religious overtones that were a little too heavy-handed & unsubtle."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"Silas Marner is an excellently written book with many applicable themes. Although written in the 1800s its central theme and life lessons are still relevant today, truly making Silas Marner a classic. Because the book was written in the 1800s many words and the style of writing are hard to follow. This makes for a slow read, and although very descriptive, beats around the bush at getting to the point. For that reason alone i give it4 stars.The central theme here is the reedeming power of love. We see this in the evolution of the protagonist Silas marner. Silas is an old miser living in the English town of Raveloe. Silas was not always a miser. In his previous life in Lantern Yard he was falsely accused of a crime, and had his fianc&egrave; stolen by his best friend. As a result of these events, Silas became hardened, denounced God and moved away. For years he spent his time weaving cloth. He grew attached to his money, particularly the gold guineas. On the other side of the story we meet the antagonist Godfriey Cass. Godfriey is the selfish spoiled grown son of Squire Cass, the richest man in Raveloe. As the plot unfurls we see how these two very different peoples problems and lives intertwine, and through the power of love a life is restored, consequences are dealt, and the realization that nothing ever stays hidden.In sum the book is powerful for the reader who chooses to pay attention. When it gets bogged down with details, just keep reading knowing something great is around the corner."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"A rather sentimental tale of the recluse who regained faith and the ability to love his fellow man. If this didn't have the name George Eliot on it, I doubt this would still be in print, cause honestly, there isn't much to see here (move along.) Middlemarch is fan-freakin-tastic, don't get me wrong, but this one is nowhere near to that status. The story itself is rather unexciting, and there isn't (to my eyes) a depth of examination by a probing mind to merit serious study. Poor kids, having to read this in school! There's so much better, so much more worthwhile...."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"Silas Marner is quite an unusual piece of work.

But in my opinion Nancy and Godfrey deserve each other in their stupid piety, Eppie is contrived and spouting with saccharine, the villagers are patronised, Molly is treated dreadfully, Dolly is held up as some kind of saint, Silas is treated like a freaky experiment subject to a string of highly unbelievable coincidences despite all Eliot's psycological reasoning. And all the time Eliot sits on her high horse above them. A large part seems to our ears to be sentimental tripe, for example Aaron's charming little carol..I'd love to hear what Goldsmith had to say about this purile pampering of the reader. I'll leave off what I think about portrayal of women in the novel before my blood boils...."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"Very chilling tale.

I found that seeing the movie version before or after reading segements of the novel helped me visualize and comprehend the action more.I particularly enjoyed seeing a book showing how greed and denouncing religion and charity only backfire. I also wish people who are about to give up their children for adoption would read it, to make them think about the precious gift they are surrendering. It also illustrates how unfair it is to try to reclaim a child you give up. On both the surface and deeper meanings, it is a good novel."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"It is interesting to note briefly George Eliot's background when setting out to examine the novel from the standpoint of a moral or religious philosopher. Brought up in a strict evangelical home, and sent to a school institution run along similar lines, she rejected this evangelicalism, forging a sort of broadly &quot;Christian&quot; humanism, which undeniably belonged strongly to Eliot. This is powerfully evident in 'Silas Marner'. Marner's rejection by the Leeds brethren on the grounds that he had stolen the church revenue, (when in fact he had be 'framed' all along,) led to his rejection of evangelical beliefs. As he moves away to ply his trade as a weaver, &quot;his God&quot; remains in the congregation in the city. Faith belonged not to him, but to a particular place. He replaces his religion, with the worship of Mammon - drawing comfort from his gold pieces. When these are stolen, his world falls apart once again. It is then that the child Eppie comes into his life, and becomes his ambition. Thus, she is seen by some as a &quot;Christ-child&quot;, in turning him from is love of the material, but importantly she is seen as the fulfilment of NATURAL JUSTICE - a concept which Eliot clearly espouses. The other predominant theme in the book, is the conflict between Nature and Nurture. As Eppie's natural father - the wealthy Godfrey Cass, a victim of circumstance who disclaimed the child - tries to claim her back at the age of eighteen she refuses. Thus, against the recieved morality of the time, nurture wins over nature, and a poor but contented way of life is chosen over one of status. The other notable feature of the book is its fairy tale quality. The first two chapters serve as an introdution to the scenario, but the third chapter, introducing village life in Raveloe, has a definate fairy tale quality about it, as does the sickly-sweet end. A radical and deeply profound, thought provoking work, it is a must for any student or lover of Victorian Literature, and should not be overlooked as it ha! s been in the past."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"This was a perfectly agreeable, though not exceptional, specimen of the 19th century British novel. Eliot was a very fine writer in the Victorian style, with an assured, elegant vocabulary and lofty moral sensibility. Like other authors of the period, she occasionally gets carried away with grandiose elliptical constructions yielding minor observations of human nature that could be conveyed much more simply. Here's one that occurs early on: &quot;For the rude mind with difficulty associates the ideas of power and benignity. A shadowy conception of power that by much persuasion can be induced to refrain from inflicting harm is the shape most easily taken by the sense of the invisible in the minds of men who have always been pressed close by primitive wants.&quot; Translation: powerless people distrust powerful people. Or this gem: &quot;a dull mind, once arriving at an inference that flatters a desire, is rarely able to retain the impression that the notion from which the inference started was purely problematic.&quot; Whew. Translation: people believe what they want to believe.OK, so sentences like these fall a bit humorously on modern ears, but that's half the fun of reading this stuff, and Shakespeare did it too. Anyway, these characters are very likeable and the story is engaging. You'll sympathize with poor Silas and fall in love with adorable Eppie, and everything turns out well in the end. It's not as great as Middlemarch, but it still delivers the goods."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"Early in the story Silas Marner has a great life - he's happily engaged, living among good friends, and doing work he enjoys.

I know I was! And I also know that, because of my age at the time of the assignment, I got little, if anything, from the reading of it. What a dire shame! This beautiful tale is literally filled with credos on how to live a quality and meaningful life! But we, being mere immature elementary students at the time, had most of these teachings allude us completely.'Silas Marner' truly is a literary classic. The author brings to light the life areas of deceit, mistrust, bribery, greed, and eventual unrepentant love through a set of intermingled and memorable characters. Her style is very similar to that of Dickens insomuch that there is not only a riveting plotline that weaves its way throughout the book but a series of side adjuncts which not only give us a firmer grasp of the life and times of a small town but the inequalities that are caused through its income and social disparities.Take the time, as I did, now that you are an adult to grasp the life-teaching tale that our 8th grade teacher so desperately wanted us to glean from this classic novel. It is worth the journey back to a long forgotten academic assignments......"},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"It's been so long since I first read this book, so when I recently reread it, it was all new to me. I absolutely love Eliot's writing style, and the story unfolds beautifully. It's a sweet and believable story that reminds us to consider the consequences of our actions. It's not easy to read out loud, because some of the words are spelled as the speakers would pronounce them in their heavy accents...unless you plan to read the entire thing in the character's accents. ;)"},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"Strange that so many people complained about this book after having been forced to read it in High School. I had never heard of this particular Elliot book until I acquired the list of \\"1001 books to read before you die.\\" I can see where the language in this book would be troublesome to many young students, particularly if they have little to no experience reading anything from the time, much less anything written in phonetic slang. But the theme should be universal.Short Synopsis - we follow to individuals through the tale, the title character - Silas Marner, a weaver who has had a long run of bad luck in dealing with people who has then holed himself away from society and fills his days with weaving and counting his slowly growing stack of gold. The other is Godfry Cass, a wealthy son of a land owner who's poor in morals and scruples. Through a series of events triggered by Godfry and his brother, Silas is thrust into various situations of both grief and joy. Always Silas maintains his high moral standard and simple way of life and is thusly rewarded for it.As is standard in the literature of the time - the good get what they deserve and the morally lacking get their just ends. The interesting part that Elliot weaves in to the tale is that the unfortunate events that happen to Silas, all end up leading him to true happiness. Now I don't want to give the story away as many others have, but I will say that once you get past the first third or so (where the reader will find themselves wondering if ANYTHING is ever going to happen) the book picks up and becomes very enjoyable.The language may be tough for some, but once you get about 20-30 pages in, you shouldn't have much trouble reading it. If all else fails, read it out loud. On the whole this is a very enjoyable book, though not my favorite - the story is fun and happy and leaves the reader feeling rather warm and fuzzy."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],G={key:0},B={key:1};function W(s,e,r,c,n,i){const f=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",E,[(t(!0),a(w,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(t(),p(f,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:n.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[n.isLoading?(t(),a("span",B,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",G,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const j=u(x,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-acfeaa25"]]),N=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/32.md","filePath":"quotes/32.md"}'),F={name:"quotes/32.md"},R=Object.assign(F,{setup(s){return(e,r)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(j)]))}});export{N as __pageData,R as default};
