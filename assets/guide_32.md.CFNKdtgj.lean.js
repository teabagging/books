From a child's perspective, I remember it being sad and scary at points, but overall cheerful and fun.It was because of Stephen King that I recently picked this up and read it as an adult. Obviously King sees this book as the classic that it is, for this book's inspiration shows in &quot;The Stand&quot; and various parts of the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series. I'm a big fan of these books and so I had to read &quot;Watership Down&quot; once again because I had forgotten the social aspects and lessons of the story, remembering only the main plot.I'm so glad I took the time to read this again! King's work is mainly about his characters and how they respond to the given situation. Now I know why he was inspired by &quot;Watership Down.&quot; I now see that it's not so much about bunny rabbits as it is about Fiver, Bigwig, Hazel and the rest. It's about social structures and how they form. It's about forming civilizations, striving for a better life, finding leadership, building friendships and trust, and protecting life.If you have children, don't let them read this book alone. Share the adventure with them. If you are a child, share this book with your parents."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is a great book for everyone who enjoy well written stories.

Although rabbits talking is kind of silly it wasn't silly at all."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is a good book! Its really detailed, and it is interesting. I would reccomend it!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down was probably the best story I have ever had the pleasure to get lost in. The imagery in this books is absolutely incredable; out of this world: Adams takes the reader deep into the story so that you are experiencing all the emotion, sounds, smells, fears, excitement, and all else that the characters experience. I got so attached to the characters that I cried at the ending. I have never ever cried over a book...a movie...but not a book. I'll never forget this story- loved it so much that I'm on amazon right now checking out some of Richard Adams' other books to purchase. Highly recommend this book to readers who enjoy having their imagination stimulated...not the right book for those who get lost in too much discription"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down encompasses a journey of rabbits in search for a new warren to live in safety. While this objective may seem simple to accomplish, the rabbits run into many obstacles along the way and such a goal becomes distant but not impossible to these fervent animals. Of course, the rabbits portray human qualities such as emotion, language, and complex cognitive thought. Needless to say then, it is obvious that each rabbit on this journey is an individual who carries their own personality. So while the novel concentrates on the journey of the rabbits itself, it effectively incorporates each of the rabbits journey also. Such a novel about brave rabbits in search for a new home, surpassing barriers, and finally reaching a content end seems to be a typical \\"hero's journey.\\" Indeed, this plot resembles the stereotypical journey, but the author does so in such a creative and interesting way. I found that reading from an animals point of view is rather interesting, even though the complexities of their thoughts are probably unlike our own. Normally, heroes are associated with people. This novel, however, defeats that archetype extending it to our fellow creatures. Next, their journey was quite suspenseful. At first, reading about rabbits finding a new home may seem anything but engrossing. Yet here again, the author tactfully renders the journey as interesting as our own would be. Reading more into the novel, the characters grow on you and the danger they face becomes important to the reader. True, nature can be so fascinating. The book itself was rather ideal in that I began to think I was reading a child's book. Not in a derogatory sense at all. It was an easy read that was enjoyable to the point where it was as if I was a kid again enjoying a heroic story. It was not as if I as a busy college student reading the book without interest just to quickly memorize the comprehension for an upcoming test. In my opinion therefore, the author creatively takes a classic tale and generates it into an unorthodox novel."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is definitely one of my favorite books. 5 stars.I had to read this book for a humanities literature course. Having never heard of it before, I was a little skeptical when I found out that the characters were rabbits. However, the professor promised us that we would enjoy the book once it got going. It was one of his personal favorites.Once I got through the first 50 pages or so, I couldn't put it down. I was reading any chance I had to see where the adventure was going next. The rabbits' epic journey makes for a great story that's easy to get into. I'm sure that I will read this one again sometime in the future."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Adapted from ISawLightningFall.blogspot.comWatership Down has a lot in common with the ancient epics. In it, a lone warrior leads a band of harried outcasts into the wilderness in search of a home. They're aided by a seer who can touch the future with his dreams. They face perilous quests and hair-breadth escapes, ferocious foes and desperate siege assaults. But unlike the works of Homer and Virgil, Watership Down is also about rabbits. Which is appropriate, as almost all of its characters are rabbits.Most four-footed protagonists in literature have been little more than humans with fur. (Think Stuart Little or Redwall.) But Adams takes a very different tack, which is evident from the get-go. The tale begins with two young rabbits named Hazel and Fiver living in a peaceful warren ruled by an old veteran named the Threarah. Scrawny, meditative Fiver has premonitions of doom falling on them all, a doom that will stain the fields with rabbit blood. But when the Threarah ignores Fiver's counsel, Hazel decides to rouse anyone he can and flee. The two are joined by Bigwig (a massive bruiser once part of the Threarah's personal guard), Dandelion (a storyteller par excellence), Blackberry (the smart-as-a-whip innovator) and Pipkin (a loyal but timid runt). When the Threarah's minions discover their plans, the motley crew must plunge into the wilds under threat of death.Adams' break with Disney-esque anthropomorphizing becomes even more apparent in the culture he created for his rabbits. Much like Tolkien did in The Lord of the Rings, Adams created a language with its own detailed grammar and vocabulary. An example: Fiver's true name, Hrairoo, comes from hrair, the term for any number over four, which is how high rabbits can count. They call these greater sums \\"thousand,\\" and Fiver's name literally means \\"little thousand.\\" He was so christened because he was small and one of the last born in his litter. Other words that crop up -- including elil (\\"predators\\"), silflay (\\"to graze\\") and narn (\\"something good to eat\\") -- possess equally detailed explanations. Frith, the word for the sun, is particularly interesting since it contains religious connotations. The rabbits, you see, are sun worshippers. They adore Lord Frith and the first rabbit he created, El-ahrairah, whose mischievous exploits get recounted several times in detail and who would put Odysseus to shame with his inventiveness.Part of the joy of reading Watership Down lies in not only in its mythological color, but in letting yourself be carried along by every twist and turn of the plot, which is half adventure and half thriller (with a smattering of British botany, warren geography and seagull dialect thrown in to keep things interesting). If you find it hard to believe that it could be a coherent read with so many disparate elements (much less an entertaining one), join the crowd. It took months of nagging from a friend to get me to crack its cover. But it most certainly works, which is a testimony to Adams' skill, as is the fact that when you reach the final page, you've begun to feel that Hazel and his friends are every bit as courageous as Achilles or Aeneas -- no matter the length of their ears."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Richard Adams is the mastermind storyteller whose beautiful imagery makes his words come alive. I couldn't seem to put this book down! I'm looking forward to reading the sequel, Tales from Watership Down. (Just can't get enough of Hazel and his wonderful friends!)

I love to read it over &amp; over &amp; over!! 5 STARS all the way!!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I am not in the habit of judging others by what they read or don't read, but after reading some of the poor reviews (I think there were about 6 out of the over 100 reviews this book received), I feel compelled to answer their claims. First, it was stated that this book is not for kids. I think this statement discourages countless intelligent young minds from reading a true classic. (Incidently-for those who think this book cannot be enjoyed by children, the author disagrees-Richard Adams originally told it as a bedtime story to his own child.) As for the claims of students who said &quot;no one in my class liked it&quot;, to me this is simply evidence of a generation raised on video games and television-children and young adults who have no creativity and are devoid of imagination. Finally, I believe I saw 3 or 4 reviews that stated this book was lacking in action and adventure. Did you people even read this book? It not only was an adventure (every step of the way) for! the characters, but also for the readers mind. Now I would like to give my own review of this wonderful story. My first introduction to it was through my oldest brother-he had read it for school in the sixth grade and loved it. I was only seven when I first read it, and I was enchanted by the new world I had discovered within its pages. To me, the benchmark of a truly great author is to make the impossible believable. Adams accomplishes this task with ease in &quot;Watership Down&quot;. By creating an entire civilization-complete with government, language, and even a unique mythology, Adams draws his readers deeper into their own imaginations where anything is possible and gives them a new way to look at our own role in the unending cycle of life. My recommendation is to read this book as young as possible-and to reread it many times throughout your life. It will expand your minds and open the doors of imagination for your children. My praise and thanks to Richard Adams for a! job very well done!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"When I was very young I was reading a child series that I really enjoyed. On the cover it said something about a book called watership Down. I ordered the book from my school library. When my teacher flopped down a 400+ word book I was taken aback. I decided to give it a try. It was One of if not the best book I have ever read, the characters are well developed and deep, the plot is fast- paced and moving, and the storys are even pretty neat. After finishing it in 3 days in fifth grade I read it again in eighth. I found it awesome again and I understood more at a deeper level. For those of you who give this book one or two stars you obviously don't know a good read when you see one. This book has plenty of action and many levels. It has also won awards and is known as a classic. I recomend it to anyone who bothers reads this."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The wonderful thing about this book is that almost anyone can read it and derive a different story. I read it first as a child, when it seemed like a wonderful adventure story about rabbits. I've read numerous times since then and each time it is different. The story isn't about rabbits, but about us, about life, death, hope. The rabbits are only symbols or masks of ourselves. This is a book that will open your mind, your heart, and your soul. Truly a classic."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"For those readers who superficially read this book as the adventures of anthropomorphic lupines it might seem implausible, dull, or stupid. For those who read it as an adventure, it might seem exciting. But for those of us who look deeper into the story, the characterization, and the relationships it is fantastic! I re-read this book every spring as an affirmation. It is as effective in opening a receptive reader's eyes to a new world as is &quot;A Sand County Almanac.&quot; Read it and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I read this book once when I was about 10, now I'm thirteen and I still read it at least twice a year!!!!!!!!This, and the Redwall series, are most definitely my most favourite books of all time!!!!!Richard Adams wrote the book so feelingly that the story is gripping and very very real."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Although this is an immensely readable story, it is not nice to see schoolchildren review it on superficial terms. This is one of the greatest works ever written, with new themes revealed after every enthralling read. Heartwarming to read, Richard Adams writes sincerely and beautifully from an incredible imagination. The themes are subtly yet powerfully put across during the story, and the last chapter becomes one of the most moving ever written. Read with an open mind, this can change your perspective on life."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is one of those rare books that is so engrossing and exciting that you won't want to put it down. After you read it, you will never look at rabbits and nature in the same light--you will love them!

There are noble meanings hidden in this story that will forever touch your heart...it is an unforgettable treasure of a book!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I have read this book 6 times. Never get tired of it. . .You will find yourself wanting to be one of the rabbits. . .trusting the main characters and sobbing by the end."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is a wonderfully written, intriguing, heartwarming book that I think everyone should at least try. I have read many great books, but Hazel and his companions will always stay with me. For those who didn't like it, I suggest you stick to Charolotte's Web and Runaway Ralph until you're a bit older. For those who did, I reccomend Tales From Watership Down and The Plague Dogs (also by Richard Adams), The Redwall Series (Brian Jacques), and Tailchaser's Song (Tad Willams). Don't hesitate- Watership Down is a great book for all ages!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"My third grade teacher read this book to our class. It is the only thing I remember from that year!

Well, let me tell you this: whoever gives this novel a 1 ought to check their head for the other half of their brain. I certainly don't expect everyone to give it raving reviews, but it doesn't take a nerd to understand the underlying meaning of this story. Those cries of &quot;Who wants to read about silly talking bunnies?&quot; and &quot;Ooo, who wants to read 400+ pages of 'Blackberry staking out a couple of females'?&quot; are from people who either didn't read it or didn't try. This novel brought out a lot more than a novel focused solely on humans, because it IS about humans, on a whole new perspective. I find it amusing to see such dejecting reviews from a person who gets a kick out of reading about factories that churns out meat loaded with rat poison and the respective rats to the American public but has such a difficult time with a heartwarming novel with such powerful background and imagery, a novel with a stongly woven plot. A novel worth a second read."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The rabbits search for a new home and happiness is an example of people in exile.

Then, about 3mths later, I decided to start the book again, but this time, only reading the last three chapters.

Except for a few junior high schoolers, this book is loved by so many. These rabbits seem so anthropomorphical (not sure that's a real word by the way !) that we can feel for their struggles and feel their joy. This is a tale about loyalty, liberty, hope, and survival. The themes are so strong here; these little bunnies make you want to laugh, cheer, cry, and shout for joy. These rabbits leave their home because of a grave danger, struggle through dangerous terrain, past wild animals, &quot;hostile&quot; groups of other rabbits, and even a slave/labor camp only to find themselves a home. All these guys want is a mate, a warm warren, and a few cowslips here and then. For a story about bunnies, it is one of the most human tales you could ever hope to read."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Read it as a senior in my English class, and it really made me mad hearing classmates trash it like they did: &quot;who cares about a bunch of talking bunnies?&quot; I do. Like they dont REPRESENT anything, or something. Stupid people commenting on a book that they read because they are required to, never making an effort to enjoy it for the same reason. And these aren't third graders, either. These are people who will be doctors and lawyers and, well, probably cashiers at grocery stores all their lives. What kind of an author would write a book on one level, anyway? I mean- these people put it on the same level as &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; or something. Oh well..."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I know I already reviewed this book, but after reading some of the other reviews, I had to respond. This is an excellent book. I loved it a lot. It made me laugh, it made me cry. I think the kids who read this book should reread it when they are older. Maybe then they would like it. I do not understand how a person could give this book a 1 or 2. You do not need to be boring to like this book."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book was not only interesting but also fun. When I first heard about this book, I thought it sounded boring--a book about rabbits? but I read it for a book report and I loved it. It is about rabbits who leave their old warren because Fiver, a rabbit who has &quot;foresight,&quot; says to leave. It is all about their search for a new warren and their struggle to survive.I got to know all of the rabbits by the end of the book--Hazel, Bigwig, Fiver, and the rest of them. At first, the language the rabbits use, &quot;Lapine,&quot; has different words, so it was hard to figure out what they meant, but there was a glossary in the back telling you what most of the words meant.I would definitely recommend this book for anyone who loves to read."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Sure, some people probably wretch at Mickey Mouse, sensitivity, introspection and happy endings - though this book, if I recall from when I was 17, doesn't have the very latter. What I do recall, however, is pure enchantment. Live in another world, ride a magic carpet and become further sensitized to what's around us (should you dare). May not frost everyone's cupcakes, but life's too short to not read Watership Down."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This was an very exquisite book, yet I cannot believe all those idiots who rated this book a one or two can actually be serios. One thing that sort of gives it away is that they only read it to page three! Many kids that read this book and found it terrible are not very seemingly bright.

And you haven't just got to read it either, you've got to believe that it could be real. Who doesn't believe after reading this book that somewhere out there could be a warren full of rabbits with Fiver, Bigwig, Pipkin, Hazel, Dandelion, Blackberry and the others in it? That they are journeying accross farmland to find a new home? And doesn't it say something that out of 185 reviews that there are only a few individuals who only gave it a couple of stars?

A great fun book."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"I must say, before I ever picked up this book I knew it had to be good. Vampires, Scott Westerfeld, and what promised to be an exciting story? It sounded too good to be true. But it wasn't. This was, and still remains to be, one of the best books I have read in a very long time.I have anguished in the fast that the day after I bought the book I had it in the cafeteria with me, and I walked away from the table for no more than a minute, to clean up after my friends had left for class, and when I returned someone had stolen it. I was already so immersed after having read it all through the day that I was distraught. Alas, I never found it. But I had considered taking some major action and vowed to kill whoever took it. That's how good it was-- right from the begining.It starts with a peep, or part vampire, who is searching for a vampire who could be a danger to other people. Scott Westerfeld immediately sets the mood and explains only enough to keep you wondering, but nonthless well informed.The story is good enough on its own, but throughout the book, inbetween every chapter, is a short and infomative piece on a various parasite. Though I didn't realize it at first each had a twisted relavence to the story. So just when you were fighting for breath because of some very close escape or romantic moment, he would suddenly break into something about a repulsing little bug or worm. It was all so well layed out, and though you may think the change would be jaring is slipped smoothly into this different kind of storytelling. Cleverly using the main charcter as a narrator I sometimes even failed to notice that he wasn't simply having a conversation with someone.I have to admit, the book was a fair bit confusing at times, but I suspect it was all to keep the reader on their toes. The twist at the end was almost dissapointing to me at first, because I had like how the story was going to far, but it set it up nicely for the sequal. Full of romance--and lust, and seemingly bloodthirsty vampires, and huge killer worms, and intelligent catsruling armies, it's a true Scott Westerfeld book, refusing to stay in the shadow of his other great works such as \\"Pretties\\" and \\"Midnighters\\".This book is so worth buying and I am so very dissapointed that it was stolen because I would have loved to read this over and over again.Inccidentally, I found out that our school library had a copy and so, after about a week of frantically searching and planning how I could most painfully torture who took it, I begrudgingly read the ratty old copy that was supplied for me. Until the end of the school year I still continued (halfheartedly) to look for it. It still upsets me to think about it. I earned that money and I bought the book for MY personal library. It was MY truest luffy (yeah that's what I call books). MINE. And some theif took it. Sorry for the rant. ^_^"},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"A new take on the vampire genre, and a must read for sci-fi lovers!"},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"I finished the book within a day, would not put it down.

It will probably leave you very paranoid about washing your hands.The story itself was quite complex and interesting with many unexpected and confusing twists and turns. Overall, it was a decent story but I didn't really like it. There will most likely be a sequel as the entire book felt like it was setting the stage for the real action to begin.I like Scott Westerfeld's books in general and this book was all right. Not, in my opinion, worth owning though. Get it from the library."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"Peeps by Scott Westerfeld is a very captivating novel. The novel's main character is a guy named Cal. Cal moved from New Jersey to New York. Cal has a disease called peeps. Rats, cat, and any other person or thing that already has the disease (peeps) can spread it. Later in the novel Cal meets a girl named Lace, and they go through numerous \\"adventures\\" together. You will be able to follow them though all of them.I really did not enjoy Peeps by Scott Westerfeld very much. The novel was captivating at some parts. It was interesting learning about Cal's disease and finding out what he was going to do next. In the end I feel that the novel Peeps by Scott Westerfeld could have been more believable.I would recommend this novel to people who enjoy science fiction, and are at least 12 years old."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"This book is about a boy named Cal with the disease that causes vampirism. It is a disease that can be transmitted by bodily fluids or by the air. Cal hooks up with a mysterious girl one night after coming home from a bar and he gets the disease from her. He becomes a carrier of the disease so he doesn't become a full vampire but he gets all of the symptoms worse than the actual vampires do. They don't like to be called vampires, the prefer \\"parasite positives\\" or peeps for short. Cal goes on a journey throughout the story to find the person that gave him the disease. Along the way he meets a girl names Lace who becomes very interested and tags along to help. He runs into some big problems and obstacles in the book, but with the help of Lace and the Nigh Watch he gets through.I thought this story was very exciting. There was constantly something new happening. It was very action filled which made me want to keep reading. Once I started to read it, it was hard to put down. Even though it is a fictional story it was easy to understand and believe what was taking place throughout the story. The characters in the story are very interesting as well. Every time you meet a new character in the story you immediately want to know more about them and their story. It is also a very descriptive book so, you can picture the setting and the characters very well as you read. The story takes place in Manhattan in many different places of the city. The science content that is in the book is presented very nice I thought. Besides all of the science that takes place in the actual story, every other chapter is about a different kind of disease or parasite. Some of the in between chapters were interesting and some weren't. At least to me. Some of them would be interesting to further research.My opinion of the book is very high. I really liked the book. Once I started to really get into the book I really enjoyed it. I would recommend the book to anyone who likes books that have to do with science. Even if you don't like science related stuff I would still recommend the book to you. I think that girls would like this book more than boys just because it turns out to be a love story at the end. I think that this book is more for like young adults and teens. It isn't a very hard read and the words are pretty big. Overall I thought this was a very good book."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"Scott Westerfeld's book, Peeps, is a rather interesting fictional book. The main character is Cal Thompson. He was infected with the parasite for vampirism. In the book, he is working at finding other Peeps or \\"vampires\\" with the parasite. Whether it is an animal or a human. He tracks down his ex's that he infected without knowing. The parasite is transmitted by a sexual vector...or even kissing. They also discover the cat vector. He re-meets the girl who infected him and a group of her friends, and they are spreading the parasite like an epidemic. He also falls in love with a human, who gets infected and becomes a carrier team with Cal. The story is very interesting and the author manages to pull the reader in. It is something that sounds rather believable. He also makes the characters very realistic. Cal is a teenage kid who goes through the same thoughts and feelings as any teenager today. It makes me more interested to want to read another book to find out how the characters ended up. The story takes place in New York City..but more like a future city. This book also contains science concepts about different infections, parasites, or diseases. The information about these concepts are really full and provide a lot of new information that the average person most likely does not know. Based on reading this book, you might even want to learn more about the book!! In my opinion, this is a great read. It may start out slowly, but it is interesting and unique. My favorite part in the book was towards the end: the climax. But i also love how Scott Westerfeld pulled in a young couple in love into the plot. Once you get into it, you will always want to be reading it! I would definitely recommend reading this book! If you are a teenager or young adult; or if you are into science, vampires, or parasite hunting: you're in for a real treat! Out of five stars I rate Scott Westerfeld's, Peeps, a four."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"I thought that this book was much better than I thought it would be. I read it at the recommendation of John Green, with him stating that this was his favorite vampire novel.I did not expect to like this book. I was worried about the idea that this was a paranormal romance from a science fiction writer. I am not much of a fan of either of those genres, so I was slightly worried.This book surprised me with its realism and lack of genre. The closes description would be realistic young adult literature, which is slightly ridiculous, considering it is about vampires. However, the realism was apparent in the way that the characters (or agencies) reacted in certain situations or events. However, it was science fiction, so some of the scenes in the book made me pause. I also thought this novel could have benefitted from describing certain locations or actions better, but that is in character with the writer, so I was okay with it for the most part.Overall, a great, fun read that will have you smiling even in the unhappy parts, and a great way for non paranormal-romance fans to become acquainted with the genre. I will definitely be checking out some of Scott Westerfeld's other novels."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"Cal Thompson gets a disease from Morgan Rider, a girl he had a thing with at a bar. He then discovers that he got a parasite disease from her. He doesn't have it bad but his former exes got it from him. So he has to find all of his ex lovers because they've gone crazy from the disease, unlike him. In this journey he helps his exes and also finds other things below buildings and the sewers. Morgan Rider disappeared but he found her and joined her team to help fight the new parasite. They're the new night watch. This story was really exciting and I did believe it when I was reading the book. I was very involved in it. I couldn't put it down so it's a really good read. The characters were not really realistic just because they had made up diseases. I was interested in finding out about them when I was reading the book and what would happen to them. The pictures on the cover helped me picture the characters. The story takes place in Manhattan. The science in this movie is sometimes real but a lot of the times it's made up. Just because parasites don't make people go crazy. I'm not a big science person so I wouldn't want to learn more about the parasites. I actually loved this book. It kept me on my toes all the time and it kept me reading. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys science fiction and mystery. I think anyone would enjoy this book. Except younger readers. This book definitely gets 5 stars from me."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"Peeps was a surprisingly good book. I thought it was going to be really bad because it's about vampires and vampire books are usually stupid. Peeps is another word for vampires. It means \\"parasite-positive.\\" The odd chapters are about the main character Cal's life, and the even chapters are about real parasites.It all started when Cal had a one-night-stand with a girl named Morgan. The parasite is transferred by sex, so Cal got it from her and became a carrier. Cal loses his memory from that night and he has to try to remember everything that happened. Cal has to find every girl that he infected and turn them into the \\"Night Watch.\\" The Night Watch is like the secret police that keep the peeps under control. They are trying to keep the peeps a secret. The parasite can be spread by rats, and eventually they are found to be spread by cats. On his way to finding Morgan, he meets Lace. Lace is a girl that lives in the same apartment building that Morgan use to live in. Cal tells Lace more than he should have and she finds out about the parasite. Lace ends up staying at Cal's apartment for a while and gets the parasite from Cal's cat, Cornelius.The even chapters describe real parasites. They talk about things like toxoplasmosis, trematoda, wolbachia, screwworms, lice, and mealworms. These chapters were actually very interesting and informational. I never realized that there are so many disgusting parasites and bacteria out there that harm you but also help you.I liked how the book was written. I like how in between Cal's chapters, there's the part about real parasites. It kind of gives you a feel about how actual parasites fit into the real world. I thought that there were some very interesting parts in the book, but there were also some very slow parts. I can honestly say that I did not like the end of it. The last chapter and they were just sitting there on the roof of a building and it didn't really talk about anything. It didn't really make me want to read the sequel at all. I think the book was a really easy read. I pretty much knew what every word meant and everything. I would recommend this book to 13-15 year old girls. I don't think boys would enjoy it as much as girls. Peeps had a great plot to it, but I probably won't be reading the next one."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"Vampire. When you hear that name you usually think bloodsucking, old, mysterious but parasite positives or \\"Peeps\\" as they are called puts the story of vampires into a different perspective. This thrilling tale takes place in NY. Cal Thompson is the narrator and also a Peep hunter. His job is to find infected peeps and capture them so they can do no harm. Cal is special though because he has been infected by the parasite but unlike most of the other peeps, he can live normally. He still has superpowers and wants to feed on people but he can control his hunger. Cal's mission is to find Morgan the women who infected him and while on that mission he journeys into farther territories dealing with crazed rats, cats and finds out some mysterious things about an apartment building and unlocks a lot more then he can expect.This is a an exciting book that once you start you get hooked on. The author develops the characters pretty well and has a great story line. Cal is the main character but he meets a girl named Lace. She helps him along the ride and begins to like him. Throughout the book, every other chapter he put in a short chapter about a parasite and I found them to be very interesting and it makes you want to read on. The information is very interesting and I wouldn't mind reading some more about it. I really liked the book and had no trouble reading it. I recommend this book to high school kids but I do think some older people would enjoy it too. I think girls would like it more then boys because of the whole vampire theme to it."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"It takes a writer of superlative maturity and talent to combine a snappy, user-friendly crash course in parasitology, a vampire tale, and a sweet romance into one harmonious, thoroughly satisfying work of literary art. This--more than anything else I've read in the genre--is YA fare that won't leave an adult mind feeling undernourished. The writer Westerfeld most reminds me of is William Gibson, one of a handful of literary geniuses around today, whom lesser writers would do well merely to emulate. But Westerfeld is not a mere emulator of Gibson (whom he may not even have read, though I doubt it); he is Gibsonesque in his creation of haunted, edgy, highly sympathetic anti-heros, and in his lean, unsparingly intelligent, often excoriating prose. While his subject matter isn't quite my cup of tea--at least in this work--and I do miss the lushness, sensuality, and thematic and psychological complexity of many favorite adult-fiction authors, Westerfeld's uncompromising artistic integrity and narrative brilliance are exemplary, and I can say, without question, that I have found a new favorite author."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"Cal is starting college, he is looking to party and make new friends.

They are called Peeps!Is the story exciting? YES!!The story takes place in: ManhattanScience content: It is fictitious, but also accurate when it talks about the parasites at the beggining of each chapter.My Opinion: I thought the book was very well constructed, I liked the idea of each chapter starting out with a new parasite and in the end tying it all together! I just think that Scott could of put a couple more chapters in in the end of it because it kind of left readers hanging on what was happening with Cal and Lace.Who would enjoy the book? - readers 12 and up! Boy or girl!STARS: ****"},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"Peeps is a very interesting book in the way it was made. It was made so the even chapters talk about real-life parasites, and the odd chapters tell the story of Cal and his \\"parasite\\" that he deals with everyday. Peeps are another word for vampires in this story, coming from \\"parasite-positive.\\"The story of Cal being a peep all begins with him going to a bar, and ending up having a one night stand with a girl named Morgan. Because of this, he got the parasite. There is one problem, that night is a blur to him. This parasite can transfer by having sex, so he has to be very cautious. First, he wants to find Morgan, and he also needs to track down all of his other past girlfriends to turn them into the Night Watch. The Night Watch is an underground system that is trying to keep Peeps a secret, which is difficult to accomplish because the parasite is spreading through rats, and eventually discovered through cats also. Through his journey of finding Morgan, where his parasite originated from, he meets a girl named Lace. Lace lives in Morgan's old apartment building and she is curious of what happened, because no one will say anything about it. Eventually the mystery unravels and she stays at Cal's house for a short period of time. She then, gets infested with the parasite from Cal's cat, Cornelius.The odd chapters of this story describe real-life parasites. The parasites these chapters describe are trematodes, toxoplasma, lancet flukes, lice, screwworms, wolbachia, plasmodium, and mealworms. I think these chapters were very interesting and I enjoyed learning about real parasites, and some history and facts about each of them.The main character is Cal, who is a peep in search of who he might have transferred the parasite to and who he got it from. I think Cal was a pretty well-developed character, but it would have been nice if the author could have described the way the characters looked. It's easier for me to read and picture a book if they are really descriptive in the way the characters look. I also wished there were more main characters rather than just Cal, it might have been more interesting with at least one other main character, to get a female's version of dealing with the parasite.In conclusion, I did like this book and the way it was written. I enjoyed how it had a story about one parasite, and it also told about real parasites. I liked the story of Cal and thought it was very interesting, and there were times when I couldn't put the book down because it was very intriguing; but, there were also parts I didn't enjoy because they were too fantasy-like for my taste. Other than it being too fantasy-like and not more than one main character, I liked the book Peeps but I would recommend it for 13 - 14 year old girls, because of the reading level. It had a great story, and I loved learning about the real parasites."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"Peeps is a science fiction novel by Scott Westerfeld. There are actually two parts to the book; the story and information about real life parasites. The story is very similar to Westerfeld's other books. It's an easy read filled with adventure and mystery. The story is aimed more towards teenagers, but the scientific content was very intriguing. Personally I did not enjoy the story. The writing style reminded me of something that you would find in a children's book. The content was mature, but the reading level was almost remedial. The plot could have been very interesting, but it didn't live up to the potential it had.Peeps, or parasite-positives, are raving cannibals that are running loose in New York City. It is up to the Night Watch, made up of mostly carriers of the parasite, to track down these peeps and capture them. The Night Watch is trying to keep the peeps a secret, but they have a difficult time containing the parasite because it is spread by rats. The narrator, Cal, is a carrier and a member of the Night Watch. He was infected with the parasite after a one night stand. Now it is his responsibility to track down all of the girls he has kissed since that night and capture them before they can spread this parasite to others, and he wants to find the girl who infected him. There is only one problem with his plan; he doesn't remember anything from that night. His search for his progenitor leads him to Lace, an average teenage girl living in New York City. Her lease is about to end, and she is looking for a way to stay in her apartment. She knows that something strange has happened in her building, but no one will talk about it. This is what causes her to team up with Cal in a search for the truth.This story has a lot of potential. The description sounds very interesting, but the author failed to develop the story and characters enough to reach this potential. The Shrink, who is supposed to be mysterious, just seems annoying. She has lived for centuries, and is now quarantined because she has contracted every disease known to man. In my opinion she should have played a larger role in the book because her description when you first meet her makes it seem like she is a huge part of the Night Watch. Instead she only shows up a few times. The only character who is fully developed in the book is Cal, but the conflicts that he faces aren't fully developed causing the book to seem fake. He is 19 years old and can't kiss anyone without turning them into a peep, but this is merely mentioned a few times and you don't really understand the full affect that it has on him.Even though I didn't like the story, I did enjoy the parasite information. Every other chapter was a description about actual parasites. It was intriguing, and I was left wanting to know more. There was a wide variety of different parasites including plasmodium, wolbachia, and lancet flukes. These chapters were somewhat disturbing, but they were written in a way that made you want to continue to read. They covered the history, symptoms, and life cycle of many different parasites. These chapters also talked about diseases caused by a lack of parasites and the history behind the medical symbol of two snakes on a staff. I believe that this book is worth reading just for these chapters."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"Cal the main character is infected by a girl named Sarah, with an unusual STD, this STD turns its victims into \\"peeps.\\" Cal is now a carrier.

Later, Cal meets a girl named Lacey, and they investigate the apartment where Cal had gotten the disease. Lacy ends up getting the same disease as Cal and they end up falling in love. Lacy and Cal join Morgan's army and stay in New York to fight the worms. (another parasite).The story is a little bit exciting, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I was going too. There were some parts that I liked, like when Cal would talk about all the different parasites. But that is what I thought was the most interesting. It's not a story that is believable.The characters can be realistic in some ways, like falling in love, living in New York, going into tunnels, being infected by a disease. But the unrealistic things about the story that I think is getting infected with a disease where you go around infecting people who can finally see night vision, and have a connection with rats. I got a clear idea of what the characters look like, I have my own imagination what they would look like in real life.Yes I do think that the science content is fictitious. Because people aren't like that in life. I would like to learn more about the different parasites that they talked about in the book because they all have different characteristics on what each of them do.The book was an interesting one. I thought I would have liked it more because I liked to read the Twilight series, but I didn't it was just an odd type of style. I would recommend the book to people who like to read about parasites, and vampires, even if you like to read love stories.I think girl, teenagers especially would like to read this book, I can't see an older women, men or young teenage boys reading the book.

Every second chapter tells the story of a different parasite. But it's done so well, it doesnt't feel like a lecture, just more interesting reading.

You shouldn't read this book if you don't believe in evolution, I had that mistake. Scott Westerfeld sets the story with parasites that have adapted to the environment and Peeps are humans infected with the parasite, with vampire/cannibalism type traits. It's pretty addicting with all the conspiracies and living organism traits. I think Scott Westerfeld gets carried away with evolution though, it's only a theory, and he uses the book to share his opinion about it very annoyingly."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"This YA book was head and shoulders above the adult novels I've read in the last six months. Well-written, creepy as all get-out, it had well-defined characters, an entertaining plot, and even a bit of 'stealth science'. The best part was the way in which vampirism was addressed as a parasitical infestation. Every symptom, from photosensitivity to cruciphobia, was discussed in terms that were not only internally consistent, but perfectly plausible.The title, \\"Peeps\\", refers to a shorthand designation for the vampires - as in \\"Parasite-Positive\\". The narrator, Cal, is also infested - he's a carrier, capable of infecting others, but not suffering the more dire effects of the infestation (i.e., the blood-drinking and cannibalism). He's recruited to join the Night Watch, an ancient organization that monitors and controls outbreaks of Echinococcus cannibalis -- the organism which causes vampirism -- to act as a vampire hunter, tracking and capturing others who don't have his lucky immunity. In the process, he learns that vampires aren't the only things that go bump in the night.Highly recommended for teens and adults alike (middle-schoolers may also enjoy this, but parents should be aware that there are references to sex and \\"being horny\\" that may require some discussion, and there are numerous discussions of real parasites that may cause uneasiness.)"},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"First rule: Don't call them vampires. That's just a ridiculous term. The proper label is parasite-positives, or \\"peeps.\\" Maybe some people think that peeps have a few things in common with vampires of legend, but New York City is a long way from the Carpathian Mountains.Second rule: Whatever you do, don't forget the anathema, when peeps start hating the things they used to love. The anathema hurts, but in a good way.These rules to live by are a part of Cal Thompson's daily life. Cal is a peep hunter, sworn to protect New York from the spread of the parasite that, well, makes people act like vampires, if you have to use that word. Cal himself was infected with the parasite, but on him it works differently. He has the superpowers and the urge to feed, but he can still live among those who don't carry the parasite. In a quest to track down the woman who gave him the parasite, he peels away the layers of a mystery involving rats, cats, writing on a wall, and a building with more than a health club in its basement.Be forewarned: PEEPS is neither for the faint of heart nor for the faint of stomach. But if descriptions of parasites and some truly disgusting life forms under New York City are what you live for, then pick up this book immediately.

Instead of calling them vampires, they call them peeps. Being a peep isn't a curse either; it is a disease. There are full -blown peeps and there are people called carriers. Carriers are like peeps without all of the symptoms. They are still fast, night-visioned and good listeners, but they don't have the urge to kill.This story is about a carrier named Cal. Cal is a hunter of peeps. He hunts down peeps and sends them away so that they wont kill any more people. All of the peeps that Cal hunts are his ex-girlfriends. Carriers can still transmit the disease, even through a kiss.

I usually read books before I want to own them, but this looked so good. \\"Peeps\\" looked fresh and new and I couldn't wait to read it. I took it out of the library a couple weeks ago and read it in a few hours.It gets three stars because of that. It didn't bore me so I had to toss it aside every now and then, and it kept me going, period.Westerfeld's prose can run a little bit tiresome, especially in the beginning. I found myself rolling my eyes once, sighing another, because his little turns of phrase sometimes seemed more caught up in how clever they were, rather than setting the stage. Things got rolling, and I thought it was going to be okay.There may be light spoilers ahead, but nothing too shocking or revealing.Things weren't always developed to their full potential, I felt, and characterizations were weak. I've read a few reviews that say quite the opposite, but this is my opinion, as a writer. For example, the Shrink: I liked the idea of this very old peep who had contracted every disease known to man from living through all those plagues and epidemics needing to be quarantined. But she was never made quite as mysterious and all-knowing as I think she was supposed to be. Oh, she was supposed to be a bit human, not aloof, but the way she was presented was never backed up. She isn't given the room to grow, anyway, and she's introduced as if she is supposed to. A minor let-down. Part of the plot-twist (the ultimate towards the ending) had me WAY ahead and actually getting angry at them for messing it up, even though you're supposed to be just as caught up in it as the characters. This isn't right; you're supposed to like the characters, not rant against them for stupidity. And it was because of that that I felt as though my intelligence was being insulted.Lace, short for Lacy: I confess I did not like her, and, as with the other characters, she was never really developed. I can't speak for everyone on the planet, but I don't know any girl, including myself, who says DUDE so much. Not just part of her vocabulary, no... OFTEN. Instead of calling Cal by his name, it was Dude, at least seventy percent of the time (this is taking into consideration her friendship with him, a time where she knew his name). She said Dude a lot, and it was annoying. I could be wrong; this might not bother some. Also, Lace never seemed to have a growing attraction for Cal; rather, there was no heat between them. It was a hard time defining when she was actually his friend and then suddenly she wanted more.Cal, our hero, you have to get to know, and he's an okay guy. I liked him. His age (nineteen) floored me, but I guess part of his characterization was that he was mature for his age, and that fits pretty well. I feel like he could have been older, but that might just be my age (twenties) talking; I believe this is also recommended for teens. The biggest thing I have to stress is that his struggle with the fact that he can't even kiss anyone (the parasite can be spread by bites, sex, and even saliva) was just not amplified enough for me. It was reiterated, yes; just not explored. I thought that could have really been something. There isn't a lot of conflict involving it, and what there is, I feel as though it isn't real. I think it could've been a great aspect of the novel and his struggle. He's a nineteen year old guy and he cannot have sex; how could this be glossed over? Nothing is more human than a struggle with lust and attraction and the need for a mate; but I suppose this wasn't the point of this novel.I had plenty complaints with this book, but I don't want it to seem as though I am trashing it. It was a fine enough read for the most part and the storyline is pretty clean, nothing too gritty and nothing too complicated, so it's a good read for teens who don't care for profanity or sexual themes (it's not good for very young teens, however), and for those who just like a straightforward book, not a lot of thinking, just a fast-paced read. And it's not a dumb book, either; it's got enough mystery to keep you engaged.Every other chapter is actually a couple pages on actual parasites; it's gross and interesting, and even though at times I was impatient with the interruption, you CAN skip them and read later.So there's my final word: Pardon my gripes, because I felt it could have been better developed, but it's a fair read for fans of this type of genre or the author."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"I found this book when I was digging around Ollie's for 4 bucks thinking \\"Oh, another vampire book, why not?\\" But when I read it, I was amazed and couldn't stop reading it.Westerfeld started out with a good creative take on vampirism. Then he added action, lust, and fear, and interesting(?) parasite triva. Also, even though the story is placed in a sci-fi pre-apocalyptic world, the characters were real. When it all mixed together he popped out a great book."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"This book is rated for grades 9-12, but I'm 37 years old, and I just love the hell out of this book. Sure, it reads a little young now and then, but its a quick read, the story is engaging, and the theory of vampirism is one I've been wanting to see for years!The book is set in the present day, and based on the concept that vampirism is caused by a parasite transmitted via exchange of bodily fluids, even saliva. Many of the classic symptoms of vampirism (fear of crosses, sun avoidance, etc.) are explained via the concept of \\"anathema\\". Specifically, the parasite causes a brain reversal, causing fear and loathing where once there was love.Anyone who wants to read an engaging scientific (as opposed to mystical) portrayal of vampirism should read this book - whether they're 15, 37 or 73! (And I'd love to see this as a movie! Hollywood, are you listening?)"},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"I picked this up because I loved the four Uglies books currently out, and I really wanted something new from the author. This book didn't disappoint!Cal is a carrier for a parasite - THE parasite, the one which makes you a vampire, or Peep (Parasite Positive). But unlike most of the people who get the disease, he hasn't turned into an unmanageable eater of humans, and is able to manage his disease with only a few strange side effects - like, he's always hungry for meat, and constantly hungry for sex. Seeing as the parasite is spread through saliva and other body fluids, though, Cal's pretty much out of luck on one of those, or so he thinks.Since non-murderous carriers are pretty rare, Cal works with the Night Watch to help contain the vampire problem, and he tracks down his old girlfriends and gets them the medication they need to be almost sane. But when he begins tracking the person who gave him the disease, he is led into a foul underworld of carrier rats, unusually rational peeps, and evidence of an ancient and vile monster underground.As he investigates, he becomes closer to Lace, the journalism student who lives in the building under which he is investigating. She isn't infected, and even for a journalism student she is far too careless about her wellbeing, preferring finding out the whole story to keeping herself safe.Is the disease evolving new ways of spreading? Why are so many of the new peeps acting almost sane? And most importantly, will Cal be able to keep his hands off of the very hot Lace?Interspersed with the story are disgusting and accurate descriptions of real-life parasites, which help us think about the story in new ways and give us a backdrop to place the new characters against.While the book is in many ways WAY overly graphic about the parasites (I admit, I enjoyed those parts even so!), I enjoyed it thoroughly. I was absorbed into the story after just the first chapter, and stayed up late to finish it the first night I started it, because I couldn't bear to put it down. If you liked Stephenie Meyer's Twilight books, Westerfeld's Uglies series, or just are in the mood for something very different, then I highly recommend this."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"After reading others of Mr. Westerfeld's books, I tried this one, and it was very good. A take on the classic vampire story, it's a haunting but funny tale of Cal Thompson's survival with Peeps.The suspense will keep you reading until you finish, and the author has a way of using every other chapter to describe something (like a parasite), and although these don't seem like they fit in, the author does so with skill."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"I, like many others, read Peeps because I enjoyed the Uglies series tremendously. I was very disapointed. While the book was both exciting and action-packed it was also very disgusting.I think Peeps would have been far better off it there was less information about random parasites.However, the Scott Westerfeld we all know and love came through on the plot. It was very creative.The story takes place in New York City through the eyes of Cal a college student from Texas. Cal works for the Night Watch, a very old organization that keeps peeps or 'parasite positives'under control. Peeps are those who are infected with a very ancient disease that for many years remained underground. Cal being a carrier of this disease must find out how he recieved the disease and stop it from reaching the surface. But many secrets lie before him and may cause him a change in plans. Throughout all of this Lace, a girl Cal met during investigation, stands by his side.I would only recomend this novel to those who don't mind the breif history of parasite's that is imbedded in this novel. Otherwise enjoy!"},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"Scott Westerfeld is a highly respected author and I have heard nothing but good things about his books. Peeps did not disappoint. Instead of going the usual route with a vampire story, Westerfeld took the CSI path. This book is part science book, park horror and 100% excellent. Along with the witty dialogue and great story, it's really funny and clever. This quote gives you a good idea of the different take on vampires:\\"The main thing to remember is that there's no magic involved. No flying, no transforming into bats or rats either. We're talking about a disease.\\"Cal is lonely and miserable in his state of forced celibacy, but determined to find some purpose in the bad hand that he was dealt. When he comes across Lacey, a charmingly nosy journalism student, and can't seem to get rid of her, he finally lets someone in to his life. This lonely bit of romance in the book is a perfect compliment to the hard truths that Cal faces every day. The scientific facts blended into old legend make this unique story very enjoyable. I gave this book 4 stars."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"This book was better than I expected.

Scott Westerfeld's take of them.My Thoughts...This book was a very pleasant surprise. All and all it was a really cool and fascinating take on Vampires. I was very hesitant to read it. It just wasn't quite what I'm used to. I mean I loved the Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld, but I just wasn't so sure about this one. I couldn't have been more wrong. I enjoyed it way more than I ever thought (4/5 Stars). This is a very smart, interesting book. It took vampires on in a whole new way. Now there is a lot of talk about parasites--and those with squeamish stomach may not like it, but I'm pretty much a baby and it was fine for me--but all the parasite talk was my favorite part about this book. I actually learned something. Very interesting. Try it out. You might be pleasantly surprised too."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"I loved the use of alternating chapters showcasing interesting/gross parasites taken from the book PARASITE REX.

It isn't preachy or too fanciful like the works of Anne \\"Lolcow\\" Rice or Heaven forbid, Stephanie Meyer. It actually tries to detaill the idea that Vampirism could have started out as a kind of parasite which which influences the culture of people around it and messes with your mind to make you do things to spread it easier, like biting.I won't go into too many details, but its a good read, makes you feel like the setting could be right outside your window, and kinda makes you wish such a thing could actually exist. The characters are relatable and have the feel of someone tossed into circumstances beyond their control and more or less have the look and feel of ascended geeks; or people who read such fiction and find a kind of ambivalence to their circumstnaces rather than mortal terror.Another fresh take on the 'vampirism as an illness' is that, rather than give into the cliche of vampire hunters we have characters whom are sympathetic and attempt to treat the afflicted with drugs that surpress the parasites' growth and rehabilitation rather than 'Gwar, slay and kill'.Again, this would make a fantastic movie. If only people weren't so focused on drivel like Newish Moon."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"I don't know if I am suppose to think Peeps is funny and creeptastick at the same time, but I do. It has this odd campy B-movie feel to it and I loved every minute of it. I mean come on guys when was the last time you read a vampire book that was all: \\"Don't have sex you will die!\\" Well in Peeps vampirisms is an STD so chew on that for a while.Cal, who is one of the rare few to only have the good side effects of Peeps, is put upon with the sad task of finding everyone he has unknowingly infected with the decease. The person Cal wans to find most is Morgan, the girl who infected him. When Cal finds Morgan, he finds out not everything he has been told is true. He also meets up with Rachel and Lace who also have Peeps. From there the story breaks wide open.Peeps can be super gross at times. It involves rats, cats, and every other chapter tells of a different parasite that adds to the creepfest. Then at the end to find out that the reason everyone is turning into these super strong parasites is so that they can actually... Yeah right. Y'all know I don't do big spoilers.

It's THAT good! I definitely recommend this book to others. Yet another great book from Scott Westerfeld!"},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"I've read my share of of vampire novels, some of which were good and some of which were not so good, but Peeps is the first vampire novel I've read that places vampirism in the context of a larger ecosystem. Particularly for a sci-fi take on vampirism as opposed to a fantasy one, this lends it a surprising depth and interest. In fact it makes me feel retrospectively like some of the other fairly good \\"scientific vampirism\\" books I'd read were missing something. It makes complete sense to ground the trope of predator versus prey into a larger web, because in the natural world there's no such a thing as a species that exists only as a predator or only as prey; everything is interlinked in complex ways.Peeps does a good job of developing this more complex parasite/predator/prey theme with the parasite chapters, setting the reader up to consider that things are rarely as simple as they seem, and that the relationships between parasites and hosts, prey and preyed upon, can be shifting and deceptive.As always, any YA book that so much as breathes a word about sexual activity sends the prudes for the smelling salts; whatever. I wouldn't have any compunction about letting a teen read this book. There are no graphic descriptions or dirty parts. And if there are murky ethics anywhere, it's not in the fully consensual and really quite tame sexual lives of the characters; it's in the passing on of a lifechanging parasite without another human's knowledge.I think Westerfeld often winds up his plots too quickly, and the resolution of the book was disappointingly pat for me; but I recognize that part of this is due to story arcs being written as multiple books, and the end of Peeps is not so much an end as it is a transition to Last Days."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"Although this book has some...creepy moments I really liked reading Peeps.

Thankfully, Scott Westerfeld delivers with Peeps, which drips with snarky dialogue, well-researched diseases, and fresh twists.In this novel, vampirism isn't a curse; it's a disease. There's no big Dracula-esque bloodsucker, but there are plenty of rats and cats. Cal learns all this and more when he moves from Texas to the Big Apple, meets a girl, and gets infected. Instead of getting the full-scale disease, he is a carrier, a peep, slang for parasite-positive.Ultimately, Peeps is about science and natural selection, rather than horror and campfire tales. This dark comedy will make readers laugh and think - two great elements of escapism.

The book was extremely hard for me to get into and it wasn't until about the last 75 pages or so that I got sucked in. Then the ending was a disappointment because it is book 1 in the series.

Frankly, as a teenager (who also has read many classics) this was a disappointment. It's about Cal, a peep, or parasite positive, (aka vampire) who got the parasite when he lost his virginity during a one-night stand. However, he was lucky, and is not a full-blown, crazy peep. He hunts down those he has infected and is now looking to find the one who infected him. Along the way, he meets Lace.Alright. A pretty normal plot. It's not. And I don't mean that in a good way. It's absurd, frankly, and I hope the conclusions to Westerfield's trilogys (both the trilogy that began with UGLIES, and THE MIDNIGHTERS trilogy) are better than this! The strange, convuluded plot was punctured by 'essays' about parasites which came off as though he were talking to third graders who find anything creepy or disgusting fascinating. Not that it wasn't interesting, per say, but it wasn't written well. Although some parts of Westerfield's vampires are better because they are a bit more 'scientific', or at least he explains some things and myths with science, most are just foolish.Among the strangeness is the complete reversal of point of views: Cal goes from hunting peeps to advocating them, and in the end, joining them. This transition makes no sense and feels like it was stapled on because the author got lazt. Of course, like every other goddamned vampire novel, Lacy becomes a peep too. The two different types of peeps--those infected by rats, those by cats--...did I miss something?!? This made no sense. I mean, I understood it, but I wondered how a seemingly good author could write a novel comparable to Darren Shan's Cirque Du Freak series: Shan's an alright author, but definitely not Margaret Mitchel.The character development was off, and the ending left it open, although made no sense: worms are coming up to kill everything, and only the peeps can save humankind 'oh no'. Seeing as there wasn't even an allusion to this earlier, it is just ridiculous. It was tacked on.If you want a good vampire novel, read FEED by M.T. Anderson. Or INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE by Anne Rice (if you're a bit older, and don't mind that the chronicles are all downhill from there). But not this. It will insult your intelligence. The only reason I read this was because, despite the condescending, retarded tone of the essays, it was slightly interesting to learn about parasites."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"I was first introduced to Scott Westerfeld when I read The Risen Empire and The Killing of Worlds which had some really intriguing ideas. Now I've read Peeps. Its fresh angle on vampires sparked the same initial interest, but in the end I felt the same disappointment.In the Peeps world, vampirism is caused by a parasite. Full blown cases (\\"peeps\\") exhibit all the vampire symptoms we've come to expect, but you can also be just a carrier and have superhuman powers, which is what our hero Cal is and has. It's a sexually transmitted disease, so Cal has resolved to live chastely. (He lived very unchastely before, catching it from a girl he picked up in a bar, and passing it to his girlfriend and several others). Unfortunately, though, the disease makes his sexual desires even stronger. He now works for the Night Watch, an underground organization that helps study and track the disease and catch vampires. He meets and is very attracted to a girl named Lace whose apartment building is the scene of a peeps infestation.The twist is that it turns out that Cal is a carrier of a new strain of the disease which is good, not bad (well, actually, it's a very old strain...the new, bad strain is blamed on the Inquisition, I kid you not). It's good because the superhuman powers it gives you are now needed to fight ancient worm-beasts getting ready to invade the earth via the subway stations. So what is needed is to give everyone superhuman powers as fast as possible...and it's a sexually transmitted disease...what fun!This flawed understanding of the nature of human sexual relations is at the heart of Westerfeld's vision in Peeps. Rather than the love of two persons bringing about the creation of a third, sex is strongly associated with death and disease. Its marvelous procreative powers are not part of the picture. In fact, this inverted view of sex positively portrayed as a means to spreading a disease rather than as a means to creating new life is what is truly creepy about Peeps.When Cal's first girlfriend Sarah has healed (vampirism seems to be just a phase rather than permanent with the new strain, but they also need to take a drug), nothing is said about them getting back together. What if Sarah wanted to get back together with Cal? What if Cal and Lace want to have a monogamous relationship rather than spending their time having sex with strangers so they can save the world?There are also Gnostic overtones in that only certain people have knowledge of the true nature of the disease. The \\"good vampires\\" seem to have no concept of the inherent dignity of individual human beings; the parasite carriers who wish to build an army of worm-fighters by seducing them do not inform them (informed consent, anyone?). They purposely plan not to give the pills to those they infect (p. 272; Cal steals Sarah's pills to give to Lace). And it is most likely that the newly infected, unless they are just carriers like Cal, will undergo a phase of vampirism during which they will be preying on their fellow human beings. Hey, but it's all for a good cause, right? \\"Chaos is a fair trade for our protection,\\" says one of the insiders (p. 292). The end justifies the means.I felt similarly ambushed when I read The Risen Empire and The Killing of Worlds. In that case, I had bought into the initial premise that the \\"compound mind\\" that was trying to take over a planet with the help of the Rix, an Amazon lesbian race that mutilate themselves in order to achieve superhuman powers, was evil. I never really bought into the twist that resulted in the hero and heroine, a military commander and a senator, respectively, to join them.As an aside, one plot problem is that the vampires are much scarier than the worms. It's not clear whether the worms are malevolent or only animals (or why we're supposed to root for the humans over the worms--species sympathy?), but vampires with superhuman powers who live in the apartment next door and who want to eat you would have me hiding in a worm-infested subway any day."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"We chose this book for our book group, we have adult members, teenagers and pre-teens, all serious readers.

I DEFINATELY love this book and totally recomend it!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"I was going to say this is one of Scott Westerfeld's earlier novels, but they all seem to have come onto the scene around 2005. Instead I'll say this, it's one that's set in New York City.So, here's a reason to advocate abstinence only sex education: You can turn into a vampire if you exchange saliva with the wrong person. Cal, unfortunately, misses out on this lesson--so after a drunken one night stand he ends up as a vampire. As you might have guessed, these are not your grandmother's vampires. Sure, the legends are the same, but that's about it. Because in Westerfeld's story, vampirism is a disease spread by a little parasite called Toxoplasma. So, instead of being called vampires, Cal and others who have been infected (or are carriers) are called \\"Parasite Positives\\" or \\"Peeps\\" for short.The upshot is that Cal is recruited by a secret government organization to hunt peeps and especially to capture those that he infected. Then he has to find the girl who made him a carrier. Sounds simple, right? Think again. As Cal gets closer to tracking down his progenitor things keep getting more complicated until everything Cal thought he knew to be true is thrown into question.Let me also say that you will never look at rats, or cats, the same way after reading this novel. There is something about a cat with a vampiric parasite that is just so much more appealing than a normal one.The even numbered chapters of this book don't directly relate to the action-packed plot described above. Instead, chapter by chapter, Cal acquaints us with the world of parasitology (you might want to keep the Purel handy for certain segments). Some readers might find these narrative \\"interruptions\\" to be a bit annoying and unecessary, I'd politely disagree saying that the information is interesting and, well, cool. Even if you skip all the others, read chapter four. It's relevant (I also saw Scott Westerfeld at a reading where he read this section of the book and it was ah-may-zing).So, while the parasite information might be icky, the book is awesome. The story is really fast-paced and has a lot of action and suspense. Lots of chapters end on cliff hangers that make you want to read that much faster. Even more exciting, the book is just as enjoyable for male and female readers (not too gory, not too mushy--a happy medium). Cal is a likable narrator as well as a reliable one--readers know everything that he does.My only issue with the novel comes at the last thirty some odd pages because it got confusing. At this point, Call learns a lot of new information which, of course, the readers also have to digest. Combined with the fast pace, it got a little hard to follow everything. In fact, I had to reread the last couple of chapters to be sure I knew what was going on.Confusion aside, the story was awesome. I love Scott Westerfeld unconditionally, but this book was lots of fun to read. The set up and early chapters prepare you for one kind of book, but by the end it's something entirely different. If you want a new take on an old monster, Peeps is your book."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"Wow. Peeps was an awesome book.

I am now telling all my friends about it, and I would love a sequel!!!I liked Peeps because it explores an old idea/legend and adds twists and new ideas that freshen up the old legends of vampires and spruces them up into a lively entertaining read. This is so cleverly done that I hardly realized the book was themed around vampires until the main character, Cal, mentioned it explicitlyI'm [...], and I don't think it's inappropriate at all. This book might make a couple parents uncomfortable, but my frank prediction is that pre-teens and teens will love it, and parents will just be happy to have their teens loving such a great book.I really like the characters and character development, and I think the plot is very well done also. I stayed up until 1:00 AM too finish this book, and then couldn't sleep because it was so exciting and thought-provoking. Some of this stuff really freaked me out, especially as Cal finds new clues leading to the source of his disease, Morgan.I am really, really glad I read this book and would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone, really. Scott Westerfield's books are gaining more and more popularity and it's easy to see why: they are entertaining, well written, with fresh ideas and thought-provoking passages. I liked Peeps maybe even more than the Uglies series, which is saying a lot.Out of 10, I rate:The plot an 8.The characters a 7.The character development a 6.The quality of writing a 7.This is a really awesome book!"},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"Vampire.The word calls up a host of gothic images - capes, bats, wolves, maidens. Sometimes they seem to stand in for sexual impulses and desire, a dark force just beyond the horizon.This book isn't like that. It's better.Start with a strong dose of biology, a credible explanation for vampire behavior, a dash of Lovecraftian big bads, and toss in Westerfield's usual degree of compelling characterization. The result is a gripping novel that blew me away.You see, vampires aren't some unknown supernatural force - they're parasite-positives, or \\"peeps\\". As Westerfield's characters delve into the central mystery, we get brief explanations of other, real-world parasites, that helps us realize exactly how believable this world could be.An awesome book, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"\\"Pressing one ear to the icy glass, palming the other to mute the roar of the traffic, I listened.

You may have heard of them before, sensitive to light, able to scale walls, super-hearing, smelling, seeing, and strength. Well these are vampires with a twist. Modern day parasite infected people that hunger for human flesh. Cal Thompson is one of them with the exception of the symptom of insanity. He is part of an organization call the Night Watch, hunting down and ridding New York of these psychotic killers and trying to stop more from becoming infected. This is his story.I really enjoyed this book. The character Cal was easy to relate with and the story is full of action. This book being science fiction, stretches your imagination to the possibility that this could actually happen. It's believable because of all the science facts backing it up. I would recommend this book to guys though, because some of the science facts are really nasty."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"Peeps is a truly awesome book. It is amazing how Scott Westerfield can create new universes but that would seem so real. I've read his first two books in the Uglies series and they are very well written but they are both very different from that of Peeps.Peeps takes place in modern day New York. It gives you a behind the scences look at what goes on in the New Watch, an organization dedicated to controlling the peep population. Cal, a nineteen year that just moved to New York from Texas, was infected with the peep virus. It gives you superhuman powers, and can basically be called vampirism. But it's not all that it's cracked up to be. Cal isn't full blown infected; he's still sane and can control his urges. But if Cal kisses another girl, she will become a peep. When Cal meets Lace, he is confronted with problems he hasn't dealt with since he has been given the crash courses on the dangers of being infected.This is a truly a book that should be read.

Vampires are usually not at all my thing, but I've heard good things about Westerfeld from teens and YA librarians, so I decided to give this one a try. It's the story of Cal, a Texas transplant to New York who happens to be a parasite-positive, or peep - basically, he's a vampire without any negative symptoms and all the enhancements - better vision, super strength, et cetera. Turns out that the vampire parasite is a sexually transmitted disease, it's spreading throughout New York, and it's Cal's job to track down other peeps before they cause utter destruction and mayhem. Every other chapter is a break from the story into a gory description of various nightmarish parasites - I could see some people really getting into these chapters, and others wanting to just skip them to get back to the story. I can't decide if they were too much of a distraction or if they worked for me (Also, I'm afraid I'll have nightmares about some of the nasties Westerfeld describes). I'm also not quite sure about the bizarre twist the plot takes towards the end. I was just settling in to buying the existence of peeps and the underground Night Watch, and then everything takes a decidedly different turn.

The night vision and amazing strength don't really make up for having to track down and capture every girl he's so much as kissed since then, since his exes are Parasite-positives - 'Peeps' for short - and have a habit of being mindless cannibals. Being a sexual vector for the apocalypse sucks. But as Cal gets closer to finding the girl who infected him, he discovers that the parasite may be more then a disease - and that he's involved in a plot older then civilization.Peeps is possibly my favorite of the many YA vampire books out there, both for it's focus on evolutionary theory and the explicit (rather then the more usual metaphorical) treatment of Vampirism as an especially inconvenient STD. And the plot isn't bad either. Some of the best and most disturbing parts of the book are its chapters about the strange and somehow fascinating world of parasites. I don't think I'll ever feel quite as secure about humans' place on top of the evolutionary chain."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"I really loved the idea that being a vampire was like catching a disease, and it was also very zombie-like. I thought the inner chapters of other species of parasites was intruging and disgusting, and made me really look at stuff differently after that!My only disappointment was the end, well sort of. The way the parasite was transferred seemed silly and cheesy to me, and I found myself laughing, and not in a good way. Other than that though this was pretty good!"},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"Scott Westerfield delivers a wonderfully different take on Vampires (or Peeps for this book). His are caused by a parasite (oh the things you will learn about them in this book, you'll either enjoy the information or skip the even numbered chapters), and are oddly believable and quite fun.The plot was enjoyable, but still suffers from Westerfield's inability to write action scenes tat you can follow without having to re-read sentences. His Peeps where interesting and fun, up till the end when they got confusing, he obviously intended for this to be a big reveal, and it came off very head-scratchy. I think I would have preferred just a little more explanation for this book, instead of saving it for the next.As others have said, Cal's forced celibacy should have been more present and enforced. After all he is a teenage boy (albeit a very mature one), and I didn't find it completely believable how little he thought about sex.I think this book is a great teen read for anyone ages 14 and above, who is looking for either a new take on vampires or is big on the biology and fantasy."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"When I picked up this book I didn't know what to think of it.

An elegantly-sfnal sort-of vampire story, interleaved with really cool True Stories of biological parasites.

A winner!I can't resist quoting from the appendix: \\"Don't Swim in Tropical Rivers!...if you must swim in tropical rivers, for heaven's sake, don't pee!

Though that does get pretty damn annoying.Happy reading--Peter D. Tillman"},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"On the back of the book Peeps is described as, basically, a vampire story. In reality, the only thing Peeps has in common with vampires is that the disease at the center of the story turns its hosts into sun-fearing, blood-craving, hate-everything-you-used-to-love whackos. Ok, maybe that kind of sounds like vampirism, but Westerfeld's story is a pretty different take on the basic vampire story (think I am Legend, not Twilight), so don't run yet.Cal, our hero in Peeps is a parasite positive (that is, a peep. Did you think the title was referencing marshmallow treats?) That means Cal is infected with the parasite that causes Westerfeld's version of vampirism. Only thing is, Cal hasn't developed the vampy side effects; he's just a carrier. So what does Cal do? He swears off women (he'll give them the parasite if he even so much as kisses someone), joins an elite team of carrier peeps, and becomes a vampire slayer--I mean, a peep catcher (they don't kill them, they try to cure them, with garlic). All is going well until Cal meets a pretty girl and discovers a super-spreadable mutated version of the parasite running rampant in the basement of her apartment building. Sounds fun, doesn't it?What I like most about Peeps is that Westerfeld reconstructed the played out vampire story around a plausible biological framework. The clich&eacute;d vamp traits, like fear of sunlight, are explained using biology and theories like natural selection. Every other chapter of the book is a look at a real parasite, including its basic mode of transmission and how it affects its host. It's kind of gross, but really interesting. The other chapters apply this information and follow Cal as he attempts to contain the new strain of the parasite, and slowly uncover why the original parasite exists and why the new mutation has occurred.Cal's voice is fun and young, without being forced or awkward. Cal is a likable character that stands out among countless flat YA leads. He carries the story well, even if the other characters are somewhat flat. I would recommend this book to people who both like and dislike vampire stories. Actually, those who dislike traditional vampire stories may appreciate the scientific reasoning Westerfeld employs. Overall, an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"Just so you know, I won't be including anything that might spoil the novel if you haven't read it yet. The first thing you, the reader, should know about me, the reviewer, is that I am a fan of Scott Westerfeld. That's the context; his writing works for me. Peeps had been strongly recommended to me as a fan of vampire stories, so I was already interested in the subject matter when I picked it up. I had a great time while reading this book, pausing often to pass along ideas, concepts, and information from it to my friends and family. It has a great deal of grit and acknowledges the importance of love without being a love story or romance. It seems like the opening to a more grand tale, but stands alone well enough. I haven't read the other book set in this universe yet, though I'm planning on it. One thing I noticed after reading the Uglies trilogy was that Peeps felt like a much shorter book than they did. Part of that is the sparse overall tone, I think. It is a social commentary done in a clever voice, and I particularly loved the facts about parasites at the openings of each chapter. To me, that was the crowning glory of this book.I passionately hate books that try to bribe me into reading the second one by not having a complete story. What I mean by this is not that there are no loose ends, but that there is enough of a resolution for me to feel like I bought a complete book. Since it is the first in a series, the most important question I can ask is: does it feel like a complete story?I think this applies, even though it's not part of a series, exactly. It stands alone superbly- it doesn't tie everything up in neat little packages, and it gives the sense that life tends to keep moving, even after the words stop. However, the story is self-contained and interesting enough to provide inspiration for a second novel set in the universe.Was it worth my time AND money?Very much so.Will it be seeing a trip to the local used bookstore as a trade-in?Nope!Was there ever a point where I groaned because I just knew X-event had to happen?Not that I can recall.Was there anything truly incredible or surprising about this story?It's a very unique take on the vampire mythos, in that it's not part of the mythos, per se.Did the characters ever act in a way that felt forced or inconsistent with the rules of the universe as the author has presented them? (Or, did the author in any way hijack the characters and sacrifice their realism for the sake of a plot point?)No.Is it a guilty pleasure? (A book I have to hide from my husband, the geek, because I'm too embarrassed to even share it with him)It's a pleasure, but not one I feel I have to hide!

We work in a bookstore and apparently nobody else that we worked with had ever read any of them and she wanted to talk with somebody that had read them. Lets just say, WOW! I didn't realize that teen lit could be good! I really liked this book. I don't normally like books about vampires, but this book was more about vampirism as a parasite. And at the end the book made it seem like it was a necessary parasite, which sent chills down my spine. I would have given this book 5 stars except for some of the vocabulary. It was absolutely ridiculous how many times the author used the word 'anathema' in the book. Nobody uses that word, especially a teenager, but if I hear a ton of teens using that word, I will know why. It is almost like he kept using that word to make the teens feel like they were reading a 'grown up' book, when 'grown up' books don't even use that word. I just took the book less and less seriously every time that word was used, which was probably a hundred or more times."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"Peeps is a book about a virus that is spreads by Blood, Saliva, and bodily fluids. When you get infected with the virus you get super-human strength, the ability to see in the dark, a fear of the light, hunger for flesh, and hating the things you used to love. There is a secret organization called the Night Watch. They hunt the evil Peeps or Parasite Positives. Cal is a carrier, which means he has the super powers but he can control it and he doesn't want to eat people. He works for the Night Watch and hunts down his old girlfriends whom he turned into Peeps.My favorite part of the book is when Cal goes down to the bottom of the apartment building. There were thousands of rats in a huge swimming pool. Then Cal sees the Cat. It was a Peep so it was controlling the rats. He had never seen a cat be parasite positive so it was pretty amazing. There was a big hole in the middle of the pool where the rats and the cat could go down. Then the cat came up to him and he realized that it was family to him, which means it was the cat that infected the person that infected him. Then one of the ancient worms passed beneath and the rats went crazy.I recommend this book 100%. It is a great book for people who like to get scared and grossed out. I really like that between the chapters there was little blurbs of information about diseases and parasites. This is also a good book for people who like supernatural phenomenon and stuff like that. All in all it is a great book and one of the best by Scott Westerfeld."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It certainly is not your typical vampire story. It is the story of Cal, who was a college student from Texas that became a carrier of a virus which caused anyone he kisses (or more) to become a \\"Peep\\" (vampire). When the story opens Cal is in the process of rounding up his ex-girlfriends he infected before realizing he had the virus. Although some of the virus descriptions were rather disgusting (\\"ew, repeat\\") it was all very informative. I liked that the ending left it open so that you could just imagine what would happen next, but am also happy to learn that the sequel \\"End of Days\\" is available. I do have to say this book left me with a strong desire to see if my cats' eyes would show up red by the light of a flashlight."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"You may have heard about them before, but they aren't what you think. They have superhuman strength and can hear, smell, and see things from farther away than you can imagine. These Peeps, or Parasite-Positives, start to hate the sunlight and everything else they've ever loved. And they begin to crave human blood, the kind still flowing through people's bodies.So when Cal Thompson moves to New York City and spends the night with Morgan, a girl he's never met, his desires and passions change forever. He finds out he's been infected by the parasite, but not in the worst way. He's only a carrier, which means he's able to control his desires, to a point. Even still, he's not allowed to kiss or do anything else with a girl because things could get out of hand, and the last thing he wants is to infect someone else.Cal gets a job with the Night Watch, a secret organization as old as the city itself, searching the streets for parasite-positives. His investigation leads him to a girl named Lace, who has information that may be able to help him. He's forced to fight back his fear of infecting her because he needs her help to follow this strange trail of clues that may end up changing everything, once again.There's something special about a novel that can take the mysteriously paranormal and make it seem so everyday, so normal. Perhaps it's the way every other chapter offers an intriguing glimpse into the world of parasites and the way that resonates with the cleverly-crafted storyline of Scott Westerfeld's PEEPS. Or maybe it's Cal's encounter with the unknown and the way he grapples with his fears that connects with readers and, ultimately, entertains them.Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens"},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"Scott Westerfeld is someone I'd like to be sitting next to on a cross-country flight. He's a hardcore science and techno geek with a great imagination and a gift for really witty invented nomenclature. I read Uglies first, and was impressed by how richly and logically imagined his future world was, and then gobbled up Peeps in a couple of hours. Its retelling of the vampire legend as essentially a medical mystery (a la CSI, which gets a reference in the book) benefits greatly from the voice of its narrator, Cal, whose colloquial and conversational tone hooked me and connected me personally to the story. I will not recommend this book to my 12-year-old daughter, who is currently reading Uglies; it's too gross, a little too sexy (nothing explicit happens, but the atmosphere is frantically hormonal), and maybe too scary in places. I would absolutely recommend it to older adolescents who are up for an intellectual challenge packaged in a terrific adventure story, and to adults as well.Note to evolution deniers: the author goes into considerable detail about why he never wants to hear the words \\"it's only a theory\\" again.

Particularly if they are slightly geeky and enjoy smart and (mostly) science-based \\"reinterpretations\\" of old fantasy-cliches such as \\"vampire myths\\". Disappointing ending - the cool Darwinian reinterpretations got sort of lost in more mumbo-jumbo stuff, and the ending as a whole felt a bit sudden and contrived.

This book just takes off from the start with action."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"I read Peeps in one day. Absolutely could not put it down, in fact. Scott Westerfeld is a terrific YA sci fi author, and once again, he lays the foundation for a stellar dystopian fiction series in the tradition of his Uglies books.I am a big fan of paranormal urban fiction and speculative fiction, and Peeps manages to walk the line between both genres. The novel's main character, 19-year-old Cal, is a hunter who spends his nights in search of his ex-girlfriends. But Cal isn't a stalker -- he's a carrier of the disease that has left every girl he kissed a homocidal, bloodthirsty maniac. These modern day vampires aren't supernatural. Their condition is the result of an age-old virus that has lived in the rat population of every modern metropolis since the dawn of time. Now, a new strain of the virus is emerging or the old disease is changing, and Cal is in a desperate search to find his progenator Morgan -- the girl who changed his life with a one-night stand. His search for Morgan unveils a much larger secret that has the power to threaten the entire world as we know it.The mythology laid out in this book is fantastic. I loved the concept of the Night Watch network working under the radar of modern government to keep the world's cities safe from the infected. I also loved Cal's character, and thought his first-person narration of the action did a great job of doling out the mysteries of Peeps. Readers are just as surprised as Cal as the book's strange events unfold, and feel genuine sympathy for our hero's sad circumstances.As an aside, though -- this book is not for the squeamish. Every other chapter is an anecdote or informational snapshot of a parasite. It works with the book's theme and I have to say, I learned a ton of Jeopardy-esque knowledge nuggets throughout the book. But if you're easily grossed out, you many want to skip these passages."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"Peeps is one of the best science fiction books I've read. It was both engrossing and gross, humorous and horrifying, real and surreal; in other words, Scott Westerfeld did not disappoint.I'm not really used to reading books from a male perspective but I found myself loving Cal and his personality. I feel that he was the perfect character to tell this story; he was funny, in a sarcastic kind of way, witty, and very believable. As for Lace, she was smart and interesting, but I had just one teensy weensy problem with her. She said the word 'dude' a tad bit too often. Other than that, I really liked her and the other characters were just as cool.Peeps is definitely more of a plot-driven book. I found it to be very fast-paced; it contained action, adventure, and even the slightest touch of romance. This is one of the few books out there that has sucked me in from page one. Everything was revealed in appropriate timing, keeping me guessing right up until the end. Something I found to be a very original aspect to this book was how all the even numbered chapters were short, informative but entertaining sections about various parasites. Now you may think, \\"Ew, gross.\\" or \\"How dull.\\" I will admit that, yes, they could be gross, but I found myself strangely intrigued by them. Another thing I loved about Peeps was the unique, and more scientific, take on vampirism that Westerfeld provided.The writing wasn't really anything fancy or complicated yet I still enjoyed it. Everything was well described, leaving me feeling like I was actually there. The reasoning behind the peeps and the way he depicts them almost had me believing that they could actually be out there. And who knows, maybe they are. *makes spooky noises and wiggles fingers*The ending left me wanting so, so much more. I can honestly say this was not a book I had easily figured out, so I was not really expecting the ending; honestly though, I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting. In general, I thought the ending was great. It was left open and as I'm sure most of you know, there is a companion novel, The Last Days, that follows this one, but with different characters. I am really going to miss Cal, Lace and Cornelius, Cal's kitteh.All in all, Peeps was a highly original, unforgettable, and exciting read that I absolutely adored. I think this is a story that could easily be enjoyed by both guys and girls, teen and adults; I highly recommend Peeps to those fans of sci-fi, apocalypse, Westerfeld's other great works, or anyone just looking for a new take on vampires. I'm so proud to own this book and am really looking forward to The Last Days and re-reading Peeps."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"Echinococcus cannibillus - a parasite that prefers human hosts. Symptoms include insanity, cannibalism, super strength and hearing, enhanced night vision and ultra-long life. Colloquially, those infected are known as peeps, short for parasite positive. In rare cases, an infected human host may be merely a carrier, and the insanity and cannibalism will be absent.Shortly after Texan Cal Thompson arrived in New York to attend college, he lost his virginity in a drunken liaison that left him with an unpleasant souvenir - the parasite echinococcus cannibillus. Now a carrier for vampirism, Cal is recruited by the Night Watch, a centuries-old organization whose mission it is to control the peep population while keeping the disease a secret.After rounding up the women he inadvertently infected before he was diagnosed, Cal finally gets a line on his progenitor (the girl who infected him). As he works to find her, Cal realizes that her strain of the parasite has mutated, and that this mutated strain may be all that stands between the city and something far older and more dangerous than a few rogue peeps.Peeps is a very different kind of vampire novel. By grounding his story more in evolution, parasitology and hard science than in mythology and legend, Westerfeld is able to tell a tale that is original and truly terrifying."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"Scott Westerfeld's books are off-the-wall, intriguing, imaginative, and, best of all, unique in a sea of Tolkein, Rowling, and Meyer rip-offs. Have you ever heard of vampirism portrayed as a pathogenic virus? It may be implicit in other series about vampires and their ability to transform humans into vampires, but I've never seen it dealt with so literally as it is with this book. He's the Joss Whedon of the literary world, but with the advantage of a lack of TV execs to mess up his vision.The book follows a very logical progression, with funny and scary and imaginative turns. The only disappointing part was the subway tunnel battle with the worm or whatever it was. I'm sure the reader wasn't given much to go on because the narrative is first person--how can the audience know what the main character-narrator doesn't?--but the fight itself was a little anti-climatic. But I thought the things with the cats and the rats and the anathema (Elvis added some needed comic relief) were all well-thought out and interesting ideas, and thus balanced out the worm thing. That was really creepy.The kicker is, of course, that the books don't probe into deeper questions. Unless there's some sort of metaphor with AIDS going on here, but that doesn't make any sense. When I read this, though, I just needed a distraction, not something to philosophically muse over. Westerfeld's books are great for that, and great to read again and again, beacause though they may be a little shallow, it's excellently written, shallow stuff. And that's rare.I will continue reading this series, and Westerfeld's books."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"I have read other books by this author and unfortunately did not like this one quite as much, mostly because it was not what I was expecting, so I was a little disappointed. From reading the book description, I thought this would be a different take on vampires and after reading the Twilight series, I am all about the vampires. Monster worms, not so much. That said, the writing is very descriptive and the author spins a good tale. The frequent chapters interspersed throughout describing various parasites and what they do was interesting, in a rather weird, disgusting sort of way. This is one young adult book that I think is really better suited to the young adults. My official rating is 3.5 stars, I thought it was just \\"okay\\" for me personally, but the writing is very good and I do think young teenagers will love this."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"I've been working on this book for weeks. So, why did it take so long to finally reach that point where I couldn't put the book down?1. Every even chapter in the book is non-fiction talks about parasites. Parasites? Yep. Mealworms, lice, tapeworms. They infect your blood, your eyes, your brain, your imune system. And all of it was true. As Scott Westerfeld says many times, \\"Ew. Yuck. Repeat.\\"Okay, in case that wasn't enough for me to stop reading, why else did I sluff off instead of read?2. The book is sci-fi, not fantasy. Like Uglies, this book has no \\"magic\\" in it whatsoever. Everything is scientifically based. Even the giant worms. That can get a little boring to me sometimes. Especially when the book's theme is explaining vampirism through scientific theories. Yawn. Sleep. Repeat.But, you protest, I DID read this book! In fact, I finished it about 5 minutes ago. So, here's my review:Peeps was written by one of my very favorite authors and one who inspired my own book,Behind Every Illusion (The GreenEarth Series), Scott Westerfeld. The first half of the book was slow in my opinion. Too much about parasites and vampire history (in a scientific way) and too little about the cute girl, Lace(y), who pops into our narrator's life as he tries to discover what happened to the girl who infected him. I read on and off for a while, enjoying the parasite talk (while imagining all the conversation's Scott had with his poor wife about the subject the year he wrote it), but hating the science.However, once Cal tells Lacey what the heck is going on, things get interesting and I couldn't put the book down at all. Yes, I ate dinner while reading about mealworms. Fun times. But it was amazing! All the parasite talk fit in perfectly with the story so that by the end, huge worms from the underground made perfect sense and only aided in making the story BETTER! Yes, better!I can't tell you what happens to Lace (although, even just from reading this review, you're probably guessing it's a) she's infected and becomes a cannabalistic vampire, b) she runs to New Jersey to escape and lives happily ever after or c) she gets eaten by a giant tapeworm).I know this review is a bit basic, especially since I had to keep mentioning the parasites all the time (did I tell you there are giant worms in this book?), but remember: the book was highly fascinating, finally giving us a logical reason for Vampires and making them believable. (And no, in this book, becoming a Vampire does NOT mean you sparkle. Sorry!) It was funny (laughed out loud many times, as the narrator has my sarcastic sense of humor). It was romantic (despite all the raw meat eating going on). It was interesting (did I mention the giant worms?). And it was really really good.So, thank you Scott, for writing yet another thoroughly enjoyable sci-fi adventure to blow my hatred of the genre right out of the water again."},{"Title":"Peeps (Bccb Blue Ribbon Fiction Books (Awards))","review":"I liked the idea of the story, but I didn't like the story itself, or the writing style.

I've searched for books on it, and none of them seem to be more than 100 pages. The reason is that there isn't much to mapping out a process.So, for the limited subject material, this book does an excellent job. It was a fast read. I think I read it in about 2 hours, going pretty slowly through it.This book talks about three types of process maps, and from the book it says:\\"Since most readers may already have experience with flowcharts, the main emphasis of this book will be on relationship and process maps. The steps you should follow to create both types of maps are included.\\"However, I think it focused equally on all three of the types of process maps. I mention this so you don't think that this will jut be a book on flowcharting.I thought it was good, and helpful. It gave me some new stuff to think about, and it's a basic look at process mapping. And, like I said, there really isn't a much more complex way of looking at it."},{"Title":"The Basics of Process Mapping","review":"The books attempts to give the reader a short introduction or insight into process mapping. Yet, it would go to in-depth for the basics. In addition, the author guises the reader by using different terminology for maps, such as deployment flowcharts, and IDEF models. The astonishing fact about the book is that in the end it attempts to tell you how to analyze a business. Readers are better off reviewing rengineering books."},{"Title":"The Basics of Process Mapping","review":"I was looking for a book to help me broader my knowledge of processes. I didn't want a complete encyclopedia, just something usefull for begineers. This book is fine if you just want to have a general idea of mapping processes but it's quite simple.

At the outset, the author lays out the three main types of process maps and their corresponding purposes and levels of detail. This is of immense benefit to somebody new to process mapping. The \\"Relationship Map\\" shows how various departments of an enterprise (e.g. HR, Supply Chain, Manufacturing) exchange resources, while the \\"flowchart\\" shows various tasks involved in accomplishing a specific end (thus, this has the most detail). A working group can use this guideline to prevent from getting into details too quickly, or having prolonged generic discussions.The rest of the book unfolds, with examples, the \\"Relationship Map\\" and the \\"Crossfunctional Map\\". Tips to improve processes such as identifying disconnects and imbalance of detail are discussed. There is a section on anlayzing the developed processes.The book is relatively tiny containing only 60 pages and can thus be studied in a very short time."},{"Title":"The Photograph","review":"Once again Virginia Ellis captures the tone of a past era. This time she takes us to the 1940s and WWII. Who would have thought an author with the ability to bring the late 1800s alive could do the same for an era many of our parents lived through? But she does it with grace and style and a compelling characters. This is a story once again about woman who band together in crisis. It's a theme obviously close to Ms. Ellis' heart, one she understands and portrays beautifully.If you loved The Wedding Dress, than you'll love The Photograph. And if you've read neither, treat yourself. BOth are books you'll read more than once."},{"Title":"The Photograph","review":"On the advice of a friend I read this book. I was very glad I did. The story takes place during WWII when Maddie and her sister-in-law Ruth move to Miami to be closer to Ruth's husband before he departs for war. Although they intend to be in Miami for just a short period of time, a tragedy happens and they continue to live there until after the war.The author is very gifted at developing people who you genuinely grow to love. Ruth and Maddie are finely drawn characters, as are Tully, Jack, Davey, the Silers, and even Maddie's mother. Ellis also does a great job at telling a good story. This one has it all: heartbreak, loss, fear, motherhood, love, friendship and family.She also does a very credible job of making us feel that we are present during WWII and we can understand the hardships, uncertainties and deprivations that the main characters are going through. I also found it interesting how close Maddie and Ruth became and how loyal they were to each other.Whatever your reading interests are, I am sure you will be charmed by this sweet and unassuming book."},{"Title":"The Photograph","review":"December 7, 1941. The day the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, and the day Maddy Marshall turned seventeen. Maddy had lived a relatively quiet small town life in Radley, Pennsylvania, until now. Suddenly her fianc&eacute; has announced that he has joined the Navy and is leaving. Her brother Davey had joined the Marines previously and is getting ready for Paris Island. So all within one week Maddy is left with her mother, Davey's wife (Ruth), and heartache ... until that fateful letter arrives and Maddy's life changes forever.Miami brings a whole new world to Maddy and Ruth. It also changes their lives. As these two sisters of the heart find themselves in trials they never dreamed of, their bong grows stronger. But will one fateful night, down at the pier, and the photograph be too much for the sisters as they wait for their men to come home?***** Romance, intrigue, and heartfelt bonds set the stage for this wonderful saga that brought me into the world of these two women. Author Virginia Ellis has a way of bringing a time long gone to life again. I definitely loved this book. If you are looking for a good heartfelt book to help pass the winter away, then pick this one! *****Reviewed by K. Blair"},{"Title":"The Photograph","review":"I absolutely loved \\"The Wedding Dress\\" and was very excited when I learned of Ms. Ellis' new book \\"The Photograph\\". Even with it being much lengthier than her first, I had it read in only a few short days! Like her first book, the writing is so captivating that I couldn't stop reading. Every free moment was spent with Maddy, Ruth and their unfolding deception amid their heart-felt dreams. When I was not reading, I was thinking of them, knowing them so well that they seemed good friends of mine. Ms. Ellis is a talented writer who keeps me wanting more. I am anxious for her next book!The only complaint (if you can call it that) that I have about The Photograph is that the ending seemed too accelerated. After spending so much time with the characters, it seemed as though it got wrapped up too quick in the end... it's really a compliment, I guess, that I would have rather spent another chapter or two with them! A true feel good story that will capture your heart."},{"Title":"The Photograph","review":"After just recently finishing 'The Wedding Dress' and being only somewhat pleased with it, I was a little reluctant to pick this up, but I'm soooo glad I did. This is an excellent story of two girls and their struggles with life, war, and family.Taking place during WWII, Maddy and Ruth (Maddy's brother Davey's wife) head down to Miami to spend what little time they have left with Davey before he ships out. He sets them up at a friends parents house, the Silers. There are a bunch of great characters in this book, too many to name, but in short, a terrible thing happens to Maddy, and her and Ruth must stick together to sooth each others fears and concerns. And there is of course the photograph, a picture of a group of them taken the night before the boys depart. Only Ruth can see it, but it shows whats happening to each person in it, so the girls cling to it as their only hope to know the truth behind what the war's doing to the one's they loveTold from the alternating view point of both girls, this book is very hard to put down. I very highly recommend this read, especially if you like war period romantic type books. Don't get me wrong, this is NOT a romance novel, but the whole story has a romantic feel about it. I was very pleased, and feel much better about picking up another one of this authors books in the future."},{"Title":"The Photograph","review":"The Photograph, by Virginia Ellis, was such an amazing story! I hardly put it down until I was finished with it. The story had so many twists and turns; most books you can predict the outcome so early on. I always would think that I knew what was coming next and then found myself shocked. It also seemed kind of realistic for the time period, with all the women supporting the war and the conservativeness of society. At the same time it was really difficult to accept everything that happened to Maddy, and I felt really sorry for her to have to go through all of that."},{"Title":"The Photograph","review":"I really enjoyed this book! I finished it quickly (2 days). It dealt with some pretty heavy subjects such as war and rape, but I thought that Ellis kept it very &quot;readable&quot;. It wasn't depressing like a lot of books written about those subjects can be. I read her previous book The Wedding Dress and enjoyed that as well. The way Ellis writes makes you believe that you are really in the era that she is writing about. This takes place during World War II, and although I wasn't alive at the time, I certainly could envision the world at that time through her writings. She really draws you in with the characters, and you feel as if you really know them and have a vested interest in what happens to them. I thought that this was well written and definately worth reading."},{"Title":"The Photograph","review":"The Japanese turned Maddy Marshall's seventeenth birthday into a day that will live in infamy. The boys she has known all her life in Radley, Pennsylvania quickly start volunteering to serve in the military. Her brother Davey joins the marines and her almost engaged to boyfriend Lyle enlists in the navy.A few weeks later, Davey sends for his wife Ruth recovering from a miscarriage and Maddy to join him in Miami before he ships out. In Miami, Maddy meets injured English pilot turned instructor Lieutenant Stephen Tull-Martin. The first night they meet, a photograph is taken of the extended group. As Stephen and Maddy fall in love, she understands the danger her beloved and her brother face, but it is the photograph that eerily portrays reality.This is an exciting World War II tale that vividly brings to life the home front especially places like Miami bustling with soldiers and no available abodes for family members to reside. The characters are a deep group, providing much more than a romance as each one opens a window to the past, especially 1942. The mysticism of the photograph seems strange and yet fits the mood of fear for loved ones. Virginia Ellis provides fans of historical tales with a powerfully timely descriptive look at mostly 1942 America.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Photograph","review":"I loved feeling of togetherness and support evoked by the description of WW II civilian life and sacrifice.

Loved it. Love it. Still in my top five of all time."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"One of the major burdens one faces when watching \\"Citizen Kane\\" in the 21st century is having to determine whether or not it is the greatest film of all time; similarly, reading Salman Rushdie's \\"Midnight's Children\\" carries with it the additional burdent of whether or not it is worthy of being perhaps the most praised novel of the last 40 years (winner not only of the 1981 Booker Prize, but both the 25th and 40th anniversary Booker Prizes). As with \\"Kane\\", it's a question best put out of mind, in my opinion; better to try and assess and appreciate the book on its own terms. This was the novel that made Rushdie famous (though not the one that got the hit put out on him by the Supreme Leader), and it is indeed well worth reading. Some spoilers follow.The high concept in \\"Midnight's Children\\" is that, in the first hour of Indian independence in 1947, 1001 children are born with special abilities (some of them fantastical, some only mildly weird and not especially useful) - the Midnight's Children, as one of them, our protagonist Saleem Sinai, calls them. Saleem, whose ability is telepathy, is one of the most powerful, and the one who locates the others. But this is not the story you might think it was just from looking at the premise, which is one of the issues some people take with the book. The children are pretty far in the background, for the most part, one or two exceptions aside; indeed, you could rewrite this novel to remove the fantasy aspects and I don't think you would change anything fundamental about it. This is perhaps a bit disappointing on one level - when the government at the end comes down hard on the Children, fearing them as potential rival 'gods', it comes across particularly strangely since they've been around for 30 years and haven't really done anything of overt significance. But then, given that Rushdie is making a bitter attack on the policies of the government during the Emergency, perhaps that is meant to heighten the pointless barbarity of it.Rather than being about the children as a group, this is really the story of one Indian family over the course of three generations, and how the tumultous history of India in the years from the 1910s to the 1970s affects them. Our narrator Saleem begins with the story of his grandparents, moving to his parents, and only gradually do we arrive at the moment of his own birth, and his life story. As Rushdie himself notes in the foreword included in this anniversary edition, most of the figures in his family are based to some extent on people in his life (though not too much; the author notes he was annoyed that his real father was unnecessarily (in his view) offended by the fictional Ahmed Sinai). Rushdie's writing style is quite marvelously musical prose, with numerous interseting stylistic points, and he creates a very interesting narrator/narrative interacton - there's plenty of metatext and unreliable narrative employed (my personal favourite being when one chapter concludes with the unglamorous death of the main antagonist, only for the narrator to confess in the next chapter that he has no idea what happened to the villain, and is only vainly hoping that he died). I'm not normally a fan of magical realism (the works of Garcia Marquez never particularly impressed me), but Rushdie makes it work.Though perhaps not the story one might expect, I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Rushdie's prose is dense, filled with great writing and magical imagery. The problem is that there's no real plot to make it chug along, so it's a very long read. I ended up skimming the second half of the book, so that I could brag that I finished it."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This book took me a while to read. It is very wordy and a bit of a challenge, but if you are up for a challenge this book is definitely worth reading. The story is so different from anything I had ever read before, and it gives such a detailed depiction of India and her history."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This is the first Rushdie book I've read, and I am completely blown away. An autobiographic account of an unlikely protagonist whose life is intertwined with the destiny of his country, Midnight's Children is an all-encompassing account of post-independence India, its people, cultures and politics. An eclectic cast of gifted children, army generals, impotent husbands, religious zealots, movie actresses play out their extraordinary parts in the tranquil valley of Kashmir, \\"magical\\" slums of Old Delhi, an oppulent British estate in Bombay, the enchanted jungles of Sundarban and military encampments in Pakistan, connecting dots that bring out a picture which is astounding and surreal even to a native like me."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"I don't have the time or inclination to go into a long rant about what makes this book so outstanding, but I will say that it is by far the best book I've ever picked up. I learned a lot about India and its turbulent history, but that was just an added bonus. As with any great novel, some of the characters in the book reminded me of myself, and taught me some things about myself, but that too was just a bonus. Rushdie's writing style is very pleasing and his methods of storytelling are far better than anything I've ever read. Those are the things that make this book so great. You simply MUST read it!"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"One of Rushdie's best works and far more accessible to those without knowledge of Southasian history and Islam.

It is a fairly easy read and a book I think everyone should read!"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"I had this book around the house for years, and, frankly, was afraid to read it. For some reason, I thought that Salman Rushdie was one of those &quot;literary&quot; writers that could only be appreciated by English majors. I was fascinated by his life of exile and respected him, but could never bring myself to reading him.Then, my son David and my wife Mary both read the book, along with some of David's friends. They all raved about it. Since my family knows my literary tastes better than anyone and were so insistent I would like the book, I had no choice but to give it a try.Once, again, they were right. The book was a joy to read, and far more accessible, interesting, and funny than I had would have expected. The narration by Saleem Sinai is priceless. The story is told mostly chronologically with just enough tangential stream of consciousness ramblings and foretellings to stay interesting. The premise (the tale of those 1001 children born within the first hour of India's independence) was a stroke of genius. The fact that I learned a lot about Indian and Pakistani history was a bonus.The only downside was that the story began to slow down a bit at the end, but since it was essentially the story of the birth of a nation (two, actually), the author couldn't possibly be expected to keep up the fever pitch he began at. All in all, it was a great read and a great story and I, for one, will be sure to read more of Mr. Rushdie's work!!"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"I can't compete with all the wonderful reviews listed below. Just a few of my thoughts on the book: It's one of the very best I've ever read. It's poetry at its best. It's full of magical ideas and the first half of the book might just be the best part of a book I've ever read. I was a tiny bit disappointed with the second half which was still great but lacked a bit of the magic with which the novel started (something I've noticed in the other two books of Rushdie I've finished, The Moor's last Sigh (also excellent) and The Ground Beneath Her Feet, good but not up to par to the other two, as well)(I never got through more than 10 pages of the Satanic Verses which was too complicated for me). Try this book. Chances are you'll love it too."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Salman Rushdie's &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; has been honoured by book critics as the &quot;Booker of Bookers&quot; and no wonder ! It's one of the most original, brilliant and stunning novels I have read in years. How apt too that Rushdie's technique or genre of writing should be described as &quot;magical realism&quot;, for MC dresses the telling of post-war Indian history with so much fun, humour and imagination from references drawn from such a deep ancient well, your senses reel from the rush and cultural overload. Granted, Rushdie's method with language doesn't make for easy or casual reading. Words meticulously chosen, assembled and invested with meaning tumble helter skelter onto the pages in dazzling and colourful rapid fire prose - &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; style - you really need to concentrate to understand and savour its riches. Its huge cast of characters evoke the sense of a grand pantheon of gods overlooking the lives of its divided people. Not surprisingly, these same gods (or God) - depending on whether you're Hindu or Muslim - connive to coincide births, deaths and marriages and the mercurial fate of these &quot;midnight's children&quot; who come from disparate social and religious backgrounds with the making of history. The use of the &quot;switched-at-birth good Saleem/bad Shiva&quot; as a central motif in the novel is also a masterful stroke conveying both irony and plurality that characterises India. &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; is one of those important novels that just has to be read by everyone who loves serious fiction. I'd be willing to bet that it'll get on the reading list of every literature student, if it hasn't already done so. A rare and genuine masterpiece. Make time to read it. You will be richly rewarded."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"I read Rushdie's incredible novel when I was in India and it was all the more special. Within the lives of 30 or so people born at Midnight on 14/8/47 (the moment India and Pakistan were cut free from British rule) Rushdie weaves an allegorical novel that summarises India's past and as those lives are lived comments on her future. The problems of Islamic Kashmir and the beautiful language that he uses in describing it are unforgettable."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Rushdie's kaleidoscopic tale weaves the political intrigueof India's revolution into the fantastic story of anextraordinary boy with supernatural powers. This novel isreminiscent of Gabriel Garcia Marquez' sublime One HundredYears of solitude--dreamlike in character, at timesheart-wrenching and profound while continually comicaland entertaining."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Midnight's Children is in essence a history of Modern India told through the life of one boy/man. It is a dense read and throughout its 500 some pages, there are no pauses in the development of the magical realist plot. It's a great book that will be an enjoyable read for anyone intersted in international politics, religion, sociology, history, or simple human nature."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Expertly woven, startlingly unique, refreshingly honest, Midnight's Children won me over completely. It took a while to get the hang of Rushdie's style of writing--he requests that you pay attention--but once I got used to being challenged now and then, the pages began to turn faster and faster, and I became more and more intrigued with his story and with South Asia.Saleem Sinai is born at the very moment of India's independence, and his life is like that of his country's: ever-changing, tumultuous, loveable, corrupt, mysterious, confusing, rich, poor, at peace, at war, on and on. Plus, he and everybody else born on that same midnight have magic powers. Saleem's power, super smell, doesn't seem like much at first, but it gives him a keen telepathy and it propels him along one hell of a series of adventures. The spirit of India is everywhere in the book. Saleem is both one in a billion and one of a billion. He shows you everybody completely, and one person even more completely, and that makes for a very enlightening and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This book is a COMMITMENT!I read it for a paper I wrote on Religious Prejudices in Indian Literature (dealing with Hinduism) along with \\"God of Small Things\\" and \\"Death of Vishnu.\\" I got only 1/2 way through when it came time to write my paper... and still I'm pressing through it.530 pages... wow.This book was a little hard to get into at first. But then pages 80-200 were incredible. When the main character \\"comes of age\\" and recieves his \\"gift\\"... the book is so intruiging and compels the reader to think of his/her own growing up experience.But as Saleem becomes an adult and goes to war, the book drags on and on for 200 more pages.I have 80 pages left, and i'm just excited to move on and read something else - not to hear the ending.This book has been beautiful... but a little too long. Just realize that you're getting yourself in for a LONG haul before starting it!"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"I could go on for a long time about this book. I have read a lot of books but this one is probaly the best post war book, and for sure on of the best books ever written."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Rushdie's Midnight's Children is sucessful on three levels.First, it is an enjoyable read. The imagery, style, and langauge are clearly first rate, and highly remniscent of Garcia-Marquez.Second, for a western reader with little knowledge of Pakistani-Indian history, the book provides a sweeping background of this important contentious region.Finally, the themes and ideas contained within the book, such as 'snakes and ladders' and 'midnight's children', are often insightful and novel.I was somewhat disappointed by the good-guy/bad-guy allusions to contempory politics, but overall, I felt that the knowledge and insight I gained from this book was clearly worth the effort."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"&quot;Midnight's Children&quot; was the second novel from Rushdie I read, but it remains my favorite. While my tastes in novels runs more towards Hemmingway I was unable to put this book down. I was held captive by the author's ability to include historical refferences of the birth of a nation into the complex story of Shiva and Saleem. I particularly liked the parallelism between the two boys and the gifts given to them by their midnight births. While this book can be difficult to follow due to it's historical reffernces I felt that it only added to the understanding of fate of Saleem's live. Overall I would highly recomend this book to those who have an interest in Indian History or enjoy an author with a great command of the English Lanugage."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"The book is a allegorical polemic, done in great style. It has flashes of brilliance and very clever passages. But ultimately, it fails to transcend the contortions of its plot to great, universal literature."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Certainly all the hub-bub about this Booker-Prize-winning novel is somewhat deserved -- but only somewhat. For an author as erudite as Rushdie, you do finish the book expecting something else, something *more* than this. Rushdie's precise diction, his mastery of ear and voice in English, and his bitingly dry wit all come through in this narrative, but it is clearly not his best effort. Occasionally repetitive, needlessly melodramatic at times, and not-quite certain in purpose, Midnight's Children shows flashes of brilliance and genius, but it is an uneven effort. Although anyone can see how adept Rushdie is at storytelling (and telling tales-within-tales) after a few pages, and almost anyone is certain to read this cover-to-cover, Midnight's Children has some dull, obscure, rambling moments that are noticable. The epic scale of the novel, the clever use of recent history, and the vivid portrayal of India/Pakistan/Bangladesh are all strong pluses in its favor -- Rushdie certainly deserves high praise for this work -- but he can (and has) done better. Read it, enjoy it, and then move on to his later publications."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This book is a tome, and for its kaleidescope of impressions, one to be savored. There are some books where after a point, the length is wearying, and the last hundred pages are half read, half skimmed, the right hand fingers feeling the slimming of the pages in anticipation. Not this book.The story is justifiably grand, the partitioning of India and Pakistan in the aftermath of the second world war and the emotional analog in the minds of the two countries' citizens. But what keeps ones interest is not the heavy politics, which for the most part remain the background as in most great historical fiction (Tolstoy notwithstanding).Rather, it is the bridging of individuals and events with achingly tender descriptions that are burned in the reader's mind. Take, for example, two lovers who communicate only with their hands, like moths that hover over a flame--impelled by some force toward the fire, just close enough to stay warm but always in danger of being consumed. The symbolism, like self-immolation, that India is represented to outsiders and in some ways it disingenuously is to itself, that surprises and rewards the reader.You probably won't be able to finish the novel in one sitting, but that is a blessing, in that with each sitting and turn of the page, you are refreshed with the power of language and how the unforgettable images appear vividly in the mind."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This is the first and only Rushdie book that I have read, and I am very glad I picked it. The plot and narrative are large, that's for sure, but this is part of what makes the book so fine. The story focuses on the lives of the children in India who are born in the midnight hour of the day of the nation's independence. This special birth date and time convey to the children unique powers, in particular to the main character, Saleem. The book follows Saleem through his life as he interacts with his fellow midnight's children and his family. It is basically all flash-back as Saleem recounts the story as he nears the end of his life. While events in the novel are fantastical, the world is self-contained, believable, and thoroughly engaging. I am not well-versed in the history of India, and might have more to comment on in terms of how the book relates to it if I knew more. What I do know is that this is one of the most original books I have read, and ended up caring very much for the characters it contained. Exceptional."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Knees and a nose, a nose and knees. Around these improbable features Salman Rushdie builds a narrative that takes in the history, sounds, and smells of India. I have read this book about 6 times over a number of years and never seem to tire of it. I have read all of the Booker Prize winners and most of the shortlisted nominees. There are a couple that come close, but I still smile to myself with pleasure when I think of the joy that reading &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; brings me. It has also informed my reading of Rushdie's other books and led me to admire this master wordsmith even above Peter Carey, my other favourite. &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; is about a group of children born at midnight on the eve of Independence. They each have a special characteristic. Critically, two of them are swapped at birth and raised in circumstances which allow Rushdie to portray the real India - a multiplicity of parallel dimensions ... hindu / parsi/ islamic/ mega-rich/ shockingly poor. And so terribly divided since that fateful day in 1947. That Rushdie gives us the panorama while at the same time amusing us with his wordplay is an aspect that this book achieves at a higher level than in his other books. Bringing to mind aspects of Indian life, particularly the teaming hordes of Bombay (or Mumbai as it now called by the fundamentalist hindu government), does help with comprehending the scale of much that Rushdie writes about. It is, after all, his home town. Nevertheless, I think the writing can be enjoyed just for the pleasure it gives to the reader. I think it's about time I read it again"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Saleem, the protagonist of Midnight's Children, repeatedly says that to understand him, his readers will have to \\"swallow a world\\"--that is, to understand his story, they will have to understand every single detail that influences it in any way. And here is the genius of Rushdie's novel: in its epic attempt to document the myriad seemingly insignificant details that make up a life, Midnight's Children creates something much more than autobiography, much larger than personal intrigue, and ultimately much more important than the simple story the back of the book makes it out to be. Midnight's Children, the fictional autobiography of Saleem Sinai, is the best novelistic testament to memory--both personal and national--that I have ever read. Asking what it means to remember, what it means to forget, what it means when the most character-shaping memories you have are factually inaccurate, it leads to one huge question: is it the way things actually happened or the way you remember them happening that is important?In the 500 or so pages of this novel, Rushdie weaves a clever and fantastical story about Saleem Sinai, born exactly as India becomes independent, and his perceived influence on the fate of the nation. Because his birth links him so intimately to his country, Saleem believes that he is the center of every historical event of note, causing wars, international incidents, and interpersonal fiascos by what he calls his \\"rearranging of history.\\" To the reader, of course, his influence is absurd, as is the idea that one relatively insignificant person could have so much effect on so large a scale. But the genius of Rushdie's writing is that Saleem's position is simply a relatively common one writ large: don't we all feel that we are somehow the center of all that happens around us? Saleem's story strikes any of us who would like to feel that we are significant beyond the borders of our own selves.A word of warning: if you're expecting to learn factual Indian history from this book, beware. Though it is loosely based on actual events, Rushdie is clear that this is a story of memory--memory which necessarily distorts and rechronologizes according to its whims. In fact, if you read Imaginary Homelands, a collection of essays also by Rushdie, he's explicitly clear that some of the details are blatantly wrong, and he means them to be so. Don't read this book as the end-all truth about Indian post-colonial history. But if you're looking for a compelling read combining personal and national identity, factual past and remembered past, individuality and its war against communal insiginificance, by all means, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Clever idea. Politically correct book. Historical fiction. An educational book for the uninformed western observer. Despite all these positives, there is little that drives the narrative, and much like the magical realism of Love in the Time of Cholera, the story is overly weighted by anecdote after anecdote and by the seeming inevitability of a trite conclusion. Rushdie's language is at times inventive and rich, and at moment's stirring. But overall the story is bogged down by inconsequential details, overly repetitive motifs and structure, and the lack of a really compelling and immediate story. As a middle-aged man, in general I no longer find novels highly engaging, so you can take that with a grain of salt as well."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This was my book club's \\"big book\\" for the summer, with mixed results. Those who read it, loved it, but lots of people had problems getting through the book. What an experienced reader might find charming, entertaining, and thought-provoking - multitudes of characters, glorious digressions, rich and satirical reinterpretations of history, and Rushdie's far-flung wordplay - people with busy schedules or not enough patience to allow themselves a chunk of time to \\"get into\\" might just give up on. But the rewards for reading it are high - I have this undefinable criterion I attach to what I consider truly genius works, whether they're novels or poetry, that I can only describe as a feeling of their having not been made by mere mortals. Ok, that's a bit of purple prose. There are some literary works that are so well constructed that they seem to exist pretty perfectly, you're absorbed in that constructed word-world. I don't mean minimalist, though; this book is Dickensian. Here, you've got an entertaining/self-conscious/comically unreliable narrator, seemingly all of India, everyone in India, crammed into it, niftily named chapters labelled like jars of chutney (a metaphor I borrow directly from the book), it all turns into a bit of controlled chaos in your own mind, yet it's (I think) flawlessly executed, and it really bears re-reading. What helped me organize my thoughts about this book was drawing myself an oft-revised geneological tree of most of the characters, doing a little reading about the history of India, especially about the Partition and after, and putting myself in a Bollywood state of mind. I can't imagine recommending a contemporary novel more highly. And the discussion that results from reading this book with a group of people can be very rich."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This novel is Rushdie's most highly regarded. It is certainly the novel in which he unleashes what he terms 'mad prose pyrotechnics' to their utmost capabilities, telling a multitude of fantastical stories involving witches, noses, sheets with holes in, finger mutilation, washing-chests, pickles... the list is as perpetual and complex almost as the history of Modern India itself. A prose style that makes the magic realism of Gabriel Garcia Marquez seem almost muted and restrained.This novel then, is a seemingly endless parade of storytelling -and not a simple, linear narrative either. Saleem's story swoops and loops and dives and frequently circles. It is a highly post modern novel that frequently stalls while the narrator forgets (dates such as the assasination of Ghandi and the 1957 elections) summarizes what has gone before and fortells what is yet to come. Why such a curious, strange style? Because Saleem is a character who, in his words is 'the sum total of everything that went before me, of all that I have seen done, of everything done-to-me...To understand me, you'll have to swallow the world'. Yes, Saleem is, in a sense, India itself, coming into being at exactly the same moment - 15th August 1947 and blessed with magical powers that allow him to see into the minds of other people and hear their voices in his head. Saleem's life is inextricably linked to Indian history since 1947 - so it's not surprising that the poor fellow can't tell his story straight.Inside this narrative is a multitude of political commentary, allegory, leifmoteif symbolism- humble objects such as a spitoon frequently recur in the stories, satirical riffs, ruminations on the nature of history, enchanting descriptions of Indian scenes, parody and digression. In this last aspect it reminded me somewhat of a much older post modern novel - Lawrence Sterne's 'Tristram Shandy'.Saleem's experience as a 'swallower of lives' ultimately overwhelms him, and the complex richness of this novel has overwhelmed and will overwhelm many readers. Those familiar with the complex heterogeneity of Indian culture will find much to inspire and challenge them here. And for readers prepared to hunker down and engage with the prose will find a great Indian novel from a highly exuberent and talented writer."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"At the surface, Midnight's Children is a novel of the Indian subcontinent. The characters and events tend to run parallel to the history of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh in the modern era. Defining the book as such is both entirely accurate and breathtakingly false, for Midnight's Children is also a novel of the mysteries of life, with an emphasis on mystery.Rather than approach the book as a brilliant deconstruction of the politics of the subcontinent-which it does, or as an indictment of rigid religiosity-which it is, Midnight's Children should be read for a pure enthusiasm for life, distilled into book form. The novel is both tragedy and comedy and, in its embrace of the fantastic, the ineffable, the magical, it transcends all the modern fiction that remains mired in dour realism.Rushdie is a fine-perhaps great-writer working at his peak here. Don't be put off by its surface plot (although I find India compelling). Pick up this book, read it for its life and humanity and joie de vivre."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"A stylishly written masterpiece that chronicles the life of the narrator and parrallells it with the independence of India.Saleem Sinai is born in Bombay at the very moment of India's independence from Britain. Fortunately for Saleem he is switched at birth with Shiva, his alter ego, and raised by wealthy Muslim parents. Shiva in turn is raised as a Hindu pauper.Saleem, although physically imperfect, shares fantastic paranormal abilities with the other 1001 children born during the first hour of India's independence. Midnight's Children, as they call themselves, can communicate telepathically, however, Saleem and Shiva are blessed with abilities that are even more advanced than the other Children of Midnight. The two of them vie for leadership within the midnight childrens conferences. After Saleem finds out the circumstances of their birth, he unsuccessfully attempts tries to hide these facts from Shiva. Once Shiva finds out the truth he and begins to plot his revenge.Rushdie masterfully interweaves the events of Saleem's life with those historical events that occurred during the first thirty years of India's independence; including wars with China and Pakistan and the fromation of Bangladesh. He introduces a plethera of unique and fascinating characters who epitomize the diversity of the region. The language is a bastardized English, combining the King's English, ancient Hindi,Persian and varoius regional dialects. Rushdie does his best at giving the reader a glimpse of just how complicated India is with its different religions and customs.The humor is very tongue in cheek and prevelant throughout. Rushdie uses variations of spelling and punctuation to accentuate his drama and humour."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This is a landmark novel. Not many people can do something so original in this post-modern age. Although this style is not unique to Rushdie, his analogies and metaphors stand him out from the crowd. As Joyce was to Dublin, Rushdie is to Bombay not merely a stream of consciousness but a torrent, flowing perpetually with the rhythm of India at the time of independence. The modern and the traditional clash with an unbelievably colourful explosion in this book. The story swings in and out of magic and realism. Rushdie was born himself at the birth of independence in India, he is therefore putting himself forward as the special few, the &quot;Midnight's Children&quot;, with special powers, indeed he has. He is as colourful and diverse as the new India. The &quot;sequel&quot; &quot;The Moor's Last Sigh&quot;, has nothing on this his best work. He casts a dream, and as for the cast - a boy with super strong killer knees, a boy with a radio in his head and with the sense of smell that can sniff out hate, love and colours. I don't know much about the politics of India or the partition of Pakistan, but it didn't matter. This is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"I came to the US Amazon site to have read of the editorial reviews having just finished this wonderful book.

This book has so many things to recommend it. It is a fabulous story first of all but also set against the backdrop of Indian culture and politics. I found it fascinating, engaging and informative.It is certainly one of the best books I have ever read and I would highly recommend it. I preferred it to Grimus - his first novel"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Saleem Sinai, the narrator, was born when the clock struck twelve on the day when India became free of Britain at last (1947). Through some strange effect of physics, each of the children born at that time has something wrong with him-or right, some special spooky power they cannot figure out. Some have extra special sensitivity, others super strength. Some of the superpowers are funny, some quite poignant. Like the X Men, Midnight's Children are (mostly) ashamed of their special gifts; and this becomes a metaphor for the admixture of Hindu and Muslim that made up India until the partition a year or so later and the birth of Pakistan. And still the races and religions cavort in an eternal spectacle of high and low. Saleem's own power is the ability to experience smells with more punch than ordinary citizens, and you can imagine in the pungent provinces of India he visits this is as much a curse as a blessing.The two babies, switched at birth, become each other's opposite number. A Hindu boy, raised as a Muslim; a Muslim, raised Hindu. As Shakespeare said, in ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL: \\"For I the ballad will repeat/ Which men full true shall find:/ Your marriage comes by destiny,/ Your cuckoo sings by kind.\\" As the servant Padma listens to this modern Scheherezade, the relations of master and servant also dissolve from within, a dark allegory of the postcolonial nexus of modern writing. Rushdie seems to be hinting that we're none of us where we're meant to be, and that at this late date there's not much we can do but lump it.After 25 years MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN continues to sell happy numbers of copies for its author, the controversial and limelight-dwelling Salman Rushdie. He lives comfortably off the many editions his masterpiece has gone through. Every now and then you hear an imaginative screenwriter announce that he's \\"conquered\\" MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN, but in truth the pleasure of the book is very much in its intratextual details, and I can't imagine a successful movie version, though I said the same about MYSTERIOUS SKIN and look how wrong I was there."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This book should have been a favorite of mine, as it combines the overall concept of a small, misunderstood group of people with extraspecial powers (a la X-Men in the comics) with the style of Latin American magic realists (a la Jorge Luis Borges or Gabriel Garcia Marques) and the literary theme of trying to make one thing match another (in this case, the life of Saleem Sinai with the history of India itself). But I found it much too slow, repetitive, and obtuse. Perhaps I needed an annotated version, so that I could appreciate it more?This is indeed very disappointing to me, as I think Rushdie's style of mixing the highbrow literary art with pop culture references and scatalogical content a refreshing change. I like it a lot more than literary pretension like that of New Yorker darlings Matt Klam. The problem really came down to the way that the style came together in that, while I found the story and the theme elements fascinating, I thought the sentences way too bloated, where entire sentences and paragraphs could easily have been cut. This is not to mention the repitition of earlier events in an underscore of the themes, that might have been useful if you were the type of reader who couldn't connect the dots the first time the lines were drawn.I also found the conceit of the narrator storyteller, and his impotence, to be a little too precious. Rushdie was walking the fine line of metastory and I felt he slipped off it way too much into a self-conscious parody of literary (...)I know I'm going to be in the minority on this one, for not only has Midnight's Children already won major awards, it's been virtually canonized by the Booker people as the best of the Bookers. Oh, well. I'll chalk yet another one up to the vagaries of taste. It's not that I don't think Rushdie can't write, but that his writing just doesn't work for me."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"I wanted to like this book more than I did and ended up calling it quits about halfway through. It's not that Rushdie isn't a brilliant writer, but his generation-sweeping narrative felt like a long exercise in allegory and self-referentialness without characters or a plot that I managed to find involving.You'll find that the usual checkmarks of \\"magic realism\\" apply here. The writing has a fanciful storybook quality, as does the plot logic. The author blends real-world history with myth and pseudo-myth. Characters have exaggerated personality and physical traits, and strange ailments, some of which seem to grant them extraordinary powers of telepathy and foresight. Don't get me wrong -- I appreciate symbolism and thematic depth, but there was a bit too much literary flash at the expense of characters or a story arc I could relate to. Maybe it's just me -- I was also left cold by Mark Helprin's much-loved Winter's Tale, for similar reasons.Too bad, because Rushdie really can write colorful descriptive passages that sing in audiobook form, combining poetry, satire, Bollywood imagery, and bits of the real world in a rollicking series of well-crafted scenes. But it's also one of those books where the author is constantly and consciously being \\"clever\\", mainly through manipulative foreshadowing and an air of ah-but-you-don't-see-where-I'm-going-with-this. To me, that sort of thing gets annoying, as though Rushdie wants to bait critics into being impressed with his novel through structural trickery (\\"this a novel for *smart* readers -- like us!\\"). I say put on some pants, Emperor.Still, Rushdie is quite brilliant, and for literary adventurers who appreciate dense novels and are perhaps a bit more knowledgeable about India/Pakistan/Kashmir than I am, there's a lot here. Depending on your tastes, it's certainly worth consideration. But, as generation-spanning multicultural novels go, I *liked* Zadie Smith's White Teeth and Jeffrey Eugenides' Middlesex a lot more."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This is possibly the best novel ever written. Some people might take it to be symbolic, I'm not one of those, to me the events are literal (I am originally from a third world country), but I can imagine that people who grew up in the West might think none of the situations in the book to be realistically possible.I never knew how influential to modern literature this book has been (I was too young to be interested when this book was first published). When reading it I was able to make connections to many first rate novels I have read in my lifetime whose author's were beyond a doubt inspired by Rushdie's work, and that is by no means the only reason I recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"So, this isn't so much a review of the book as it is a criticism of some of the reviews I have read for this book. I can understand people not understanding it, I get that, there are books I just can't get into because of the author's style, however, just because you don't get it, doesn't mean it isn't good. This book is complicated, poetic, and deep, but it is also beautiful, passionate, and inspiring, so if you are one of the people who gave it one star after reading 75 pages, please do us a favor in the future and don't post a review of a book you either don't understand or don't read in its entirety."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children is a complex, intricate political and social commentary on India during the mid 20th century, told from the perspective of young Saleem Sinai.Oh so magical...- I'm a sucker for magical realsim, therefore its constant presence in this text was right up my alley. It's blatant, sometimes wonderful, often grotesque.- Saleem Sinai's family is constructed of a cast of eccentric characters, present primarily in the first two books, provide the reader with adventures, tumultuous relationships, and an in-depth look at why Saleem turns out the way he does.- The concept behind Midnight's Children is fascinating, as is the supernatural bonds that are created amongst its members.- The writing is of course terrific- humorous, descriptive, and brilliant. Whether you think the confidence Rushdie's text exudes is cockiness or talent is up to you to decide.Back to Reality...- This book is long, which is fine, but for me the last \\"book\\" (a little over 100 pages) lost a lot of steam. Saleem's family was mostly out of the picture, and his life as a young adult just didn't captivate me.- I'm not a huge fan of the \\"I'm going to tell you a story about my past\\" structure, which is used. I guess the notion of hindsight and retrospect can be effective, but as a whole I definitely didn't look forward to the present snippets between him and Padma.This is not a quick, easy read, if that's what you're looking for.

It's magical, but I wouldn't classify it as a fantasy. Though set in India and certainly an Indian novel, it was written in English and is very approachable to readers of different cultures. It's a long book, and dense, but not especially difficult read.The book follows a character born at the exact moment of India's independence, and traces the rich history of that region along with the narrator's own story (and that of his family.) Written in the first person, the narrator evokes everything from humor to heartbreak. The novel's characters weave a rich tapestry that shows some of the diversity of the region at that time.As an subjective telling of history, the novel unfolds in a circular pattern, accustoming readers to ideas more slowly and also repeating symbolic elements. On the one hand, it worked well, but when it felt repetitive I was reminded of the length and got a bit impatient. Overall, I would recommend this book widely, and consider it the sort of contemporary novel that may stand the test of time.

Saleem Sinai, an Indian Muslim born on the stroke of midnight August 15, 1947, at the instant of India's independence, recounts a mystical, doleful tale of his own birth and trials as they coincided with those of India and Pakistan. All children born at the hour of independence were endowed with extraordinary gifts, the great potential of a new nation. Saleem of elephantine nose and dual parentage sees them all in his paranormally perceptive mind as he is witness to the initial optimism, two Indo-Pakistani wars, and India's oppressive State of Emergency instigated by Prime Minister Indira Ghandi.\\"Midnight's Children\\" is an opinionated, critical tour of modern India's struggles with its own diversity and demons. Its overwhelming pessimism seems out of place now, as India has become one of the world's fastest-growing economies. The book must be viewed in the context of the time at which it was written, the late 1970s. Salman Rushdie has a lot to say, and says most of it more than once. He pulls no punches and makes no excuses for anyone. In spite of Saleem's first-person narration, Rushdie's fractured, repetitive prose style impedes its accessibility and slows the reader down. And I would not have thought it possible to pile so many metaphors on top of metaphors and remain coherent. \\"Midnight's Children\\" is a long, provocative lament but somewhat overworked."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Best novel i have ever read"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"yes, i give it 3 stars. this is odd because it's the lowest i've ever rated a book. i think. the book was wonderful but it just took Rushdie so darn long to bring it together. and even when this was accomplished (in the last 150 pages of 520), it was a bit anticlimactic. very vivid ending to the story but i just think that you might pick up 'the moors last sigh' before you pick this one up."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"It is a strange thing that the modern elites of India are unconnected to their own civilization and for them impressing the westerner is the most important task. Rushdie is the perfect example of such an Indian. For an authentic view of India we must still turn to V.S. Naipaul."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"I enjoyed the first couple of chapters of this book immensely but got lost at the end. It flows brilliantly in some parts, and is completely confusing in others. Honestly I did not know what to make of the book."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"For a book that has received so much praise this is maddeningly self-indulgent. Rushdie details the struggles of partitioning and the development of India with fantastic skill but the main plot is too self-aware. In any other guise this might be described as fantasy but, of course, it is too worthy to be listed as such. Tiresome in the extreme despite the poetic nature of the prose, this is one to read if you want to show off at dinner parties."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"A novel must do two things: it must entertain, and explain. It is through stories - delivered through mythology, literature, movies or just plain gossip - that humans meet their most fundamental need (besides food) for tools to help understand the world and their role in it.I could care less if Midnight's Children was judged the 'Booker of Bookers', but it does not tell a compelling story nor it does it explain India's history or its society in any relevant way.There is no need for a plot synopsis here, but Rushdie invents a thousand or so children born at India's independence at midnight of August 15 1947, who are gifted with magical powers - which presumably could have been used to intervene and help in their Nation's halting advance into modernity.Saleem Sinai - the hero - instead immerses himself in a world of feckless friends and relatives, whose concerns and ambitions seem seem completely out of phase and magnitude with the history unfolding around them.He invents a Bombay where nearly everyone is a Kashmiri Muslim, a Parsi or an upper class Gujarati - who live in the Methwold's Estate, shop at Breach Candy and, of course, the children go to the Cathedral and John Connon school. They are all charmingly European in their sensibilities (or at least light-skinned!).Now Parsis and Kashmiris are a nice enough people, but they make up less than 1% of India's (Mumbai's) population. Rushdie still wants to use the history of the remaining hundreds million Indians - many or most of whom are like the 'black South Indian fisherwoman' that, except for the servant Padma, never seem to become part of the story. How does he attempt to pull this off, and still write a novel meant to reach the (Western, not Indian) reader?Through 'magical realism' of course. Why deal with a real, compelling story when you can have magic whenever you like. The novel is not only full of numerous nicknames, metaphorical titles, but every page seems to have a character being transmigrated, transmuted or just plain transported somewhere or into something else. This makes it impossible to follow enough of the hero's story in order to care what becomes of him (or his country). You are trying to follow a family or nation's drama - and there are jugglers, acrobats and magicians pulling silly tricks all the time.There was a reason why Shakespeare split up his plays in to tragedies, comedies and histories. He realized that it was not possible to mix up the three and still entertain and explain, and Salman Rushdie is unable to succeed here."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Unfortunately this is one of those books that are not to be taken lightly.It is a very difficult read, the author has no desire to make it easy for the reader, the temptation to put down the book is constant.I finally decided to skip entire parts that made no sense at all and tried not to waste completely my time. It will take a lot of time and attention, think twice before embarking on it"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Presented as the pinnacle of the magic realism movement, this novel left me cold. There are aseveral reasons why one SHOULD like it: -about India -by an Indian (kind of) -&quot;difficult&quot; -Liberal/socialist -decadent However, no matter how these stack up -for me it was completely boring. I had no interest in any of the characters and as a metaphor for modern India it was markedly unmetaphorical. I learnt nothing of that country. I learnt a lot about the limitations of Magical Realism -an essentially lazy, self indulgent genre. The ego of Rushdie is prominent -as he wrote it he was clearly thinking &quot;This is an important work&quot;. He should read Eliot, Proust and Dosteovsky -and learn his place"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"When I saw the lavish reviews thrown by well known critics of The Times, NYTimes, Observer, etc, I didn't mind wasting my pocket money on this book. What I got in return for my wastage of my pocket money and two days, was utter wastage of my time, when Gunter Grass, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, V.S. Naipaul and Sir John Milton are awaiting me in my shelf.The book is merely so-so.To write a critique of it I must divide it into two fragments to review it. Or in the terms of Salman Rushdie, let us view it in two fragments through the perforated sheet.To judge Salman Rushdie's talent as a storyteller, we must judge the story and the way in which it is writtenThe story, I must admit, is quite well thought and the descriptive talent of the author is revealed here. It is thrilling, which, before Midnight's Children, only Clancy and Ludlum could provide.But then, it is written in toasted english. Rushdie, like a spectre, is swaying, his context changing faster than the climaxes in which the events are set. He is trying to make an Indian version of the English Language and he has'nt quite succeded in it. English has been baked roasted and mixed with Indian spices, with chilly in excess which has compelled me to spit out the dish altogether. Indian words have been used for the international audiences to celebrate. Rushdie through his novel, has failed in achieving his aim, laying the bricks as the foundation for a massive Indian Literary Castle in a forest where India is not drawn on the map.But, I admit again, despite a fantasy filled story, Salman Rushdie, unlike Rowling, has succeded in making his novel a literary masterpiece in some intellectual sense."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"There's a lot of praise for this book, and I thought I'd put my two cents in. One important note: Rushdie PURPOSELY inserts historical innacuracies, so don't think you're getting an accurate historical account - that's done on purpose. Indeed, from a post-structuralist theoretical standpoint, Rushdie's project is clearly to deconstruct. But, he goes nowhere with it. His whole novel can be summed up in a few lines: The popular version of history is inherently corrupted by social mediating forces; so, in order to combat that force, I'm going to offer MY version of history to show that there is no ONE history. It's a pretty standard argument, but he doesn't develop it beyond that. I would suggest that you look to Faulkner (who focuses on history's lingering qualities) or Ellison's Invisible Man (in which he focuses on how to break through cycles of historical oppression). They handle the effects of history in a much more engaging and profound way."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Complex, interesting characters and plot.

The irony ..It is a well known fact that Sanjay Gandhi (Indira's son) led the mass forced sterilization of mostly poor people. There was very little opposition; many even welcomed it (why should the poor have so many children, when they cannot afford them). Add the religious angle to it (Hindus vs Moslems)..... yes everyone knows that Morarji drank his own urine. Maybe, that's why he lived to a ripe old age.... how wonderful to have so many mothers and fathers... my son who is NOT my son, but is the real grandson of my father ...... and Padma, the dung lotus ....everyone will form their own impressions of the book. The metaphors, symbolism and irony cannot be missed. For me, the sprinkling of all the familiar things (Kolynos toothpaste., pan, spittoons,chutneys, pickles..) provided the relief in the form of nostalgia.

A boring story line if any at all. I could not complete the book; sorry."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children is an incredible achievement. Mr. Rushdie is able to relate the complex story of twentieth century India through a personal narrative that is entertaining, magical and beautiful. The novel is presented as the autobiography of Saleem Sinai, who was born at the exact moment of India's independence. This gives him supernatural powers, namely the ability to communicate telepathically with 420 other \\"midnight children.\\" These children, all born in the first hour of India's independence, all have some supernatural ability. Saleem's account goes beyond his own experience, including stories from the lives of his grandparents, parents, neighbors, and many others. Using him as a symbol, Rushdie explains the multifaceted and somewhat confused identity of India as a whole, a theme that surfaces in many ways throughout the novel. Rushdie's story combines fact and fantasy to create a magnificent picture of the modern history of India.From his birth, Saleem's life is tied to his country. Due to the incredible situation of his birth, Prime Minister Nehru writes to him, \\"We shall be watching over your life with the closest attention; it will be, in a sense, the mirror of our own\\" (139). Parallels between Saleem's life and the life of India are found throughout the novel. In addition to his mother and father, he names many people as \\"parents,\\" including his nurse, a neighbor, his friend, and a number of others. This parallels the numerous \\"parents\\" of India's culture, including British, Hindu, Muslim, and other influences. Saleem's childhood sees issues with identity and purpose. Similarly, he witnesses many events that show identity issues for the new nation, including language marches and the Indo-Pakistan war. Additionally, Saleem is fragmented and falling apart. He describes a physical ailment that he has, \\"I have begun to crack all over like an old jug ...I am literally disintegrating\\" (36). This resembles the fragmented culture of India. In numerous ways, the history of modern India is echoed in Saleem's life.Rushdie's unique style is as magical as the story itself. The novel constantly uses vivid images to convey meaning. Saleem states that he is able to smell history, referring to \\"the vinegary force of Adam Aziz's determination\\" (14) and \\"the acrid stench of his mother's embarrassment\\" (14). Rushdie combines symbols, rich images, and expressive prose in a way that adds to the dream-like aspect of the novel. When writing about a moment of insecurity, Saleem says, \\"green shards lacerated my hands as I entered that swirling universe in which I was doomed, until it was far too late, to be plagued by constant doubts about what I was for\\" (187). This picturesque style greatly contributes to the surreal character of the story.If one goal of Midnight's Children was to convey the history and culture of twentieth century India, this novel is very effective. Rushdie covers the wide range of people that make up this nation by including countless diverse individuals and scenes. Saleem writes, \\"I have been a shallower of lives; and to know me, just the one of me, you'll have to swallow the lot as well\\" (4) symbolically saying that to understand India, one must understand all of these stories. Considering the sheer amount of characters and plot developments, the book is amazingly smooth and easy to read. The author is able to tie the whole range of these varied accounts into one coherent picture. Yet this novel goes far beyond that goal. It historically documents a culture and simultaneously composes a magical personal story. Rushdie does all of this with a brilliant, unique style that makes the entire novel a remarkable work of art.Salman Rushdie's Midnight Children conveys the multifaceted history of India with the incredible story of one person's life using symbolism and metaphor. The dream-like quality of Rushdie's style adds greatly to the magical aspects of the story. The novel effectively achieves its goal, and is both fascinating and beautiful."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Salman Rushdie is a celebrity writer, so I approach his work with a heavy amount of skepticism. Many times, authors fail to live up to their fans' praises or their enemy's condemnations. But Rushdie resists my attempts to dismiss him as an author whose success hinges solely on inflated emotions.Midnight's Children deals with some time shortly before and after India obtained its independence from England. The novel leads slowly to the birth of its narrator, Saleem Sinai, who, incidentally, is born at midnight on the first day of an independent India. After an incident in a hamper, Saleem's nose bestows him with a magical ability to communicate with all other Indian children born in the first hour of India's independent birth. Hence, \\"Midnight's Children.\\"Rushdie's characters parody those found in certain sacred texts, so the derision he draws form religious figures is no surprise. Mary and Joseph appear in the story. But Joseph is a terrorist, and Mary, well, I do not want to give away that surprise. She makes excellent chutney.The novel repeats frequently, for a purpose. In order to produce a magical-realist allegory, Rushdie must iterate things over and over again until he has persuaded the reader of the correspondences between the quotidian and the privileged narrative of history. Saleem's frequent interruptions in the narrative serve both implicitly and explicitly as moments of self-reflection. A text that is self-aware and admits to its own faults is one that allows space for criticism and even invites it. It is a sophisticated and mature authorship to deny one's own authorial power.Midnight's Children is especially useful for literature students looking for a fictional narrative of India's independence and struggle for self-identity. He presents Saleem Sinai's India, and consequently, calls into question the privilege of so-called \\"objective histories.\\" Might the truest histories, in fact, be the \\"subjective\\" stories of the common people? Even though the novel is fiction, it presents an extremely personal view of India's tumultuous post-colonial history."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This is an excellent and in some ways ground-breaking work. It deserves a lot of accolades, and I share many kudos from some previous reviewers. However, the work falls short of a masterpiece, for the following reasons.1. It's too long. At a skilled and parsimonious hand, the novel could be half the length to tell the same story.2. Mr. Rushdie has a tendency to flaunt the same (admittedly) good ideas or puns over and over again. Example: the perforated sheet, when first introduced, is ingenious, and the initial narration quite funny and touching. But it gets too many repeated airings later, as if Mr. Rushdie believes that the reader is too dumb to get the symbolism.3. The work lacks subtlety. Mr. Rushdie writes exuberantly, which is a good thing. However, he often overdid it, making no room for personal discovery of hidden treasures. In other words, the feeling one has out of second and (rarely) third reading is the same-ol and not infrequently, a mild revulsion at literary exhibitionism. Mr. Rushdie's eagerness, in my opinion, has resulted in several shortcomings in the plot. For instance, revealing Mary's \\"crime\\" immediately after it was committed is not as good a strategy as delayed climax.4. Some sybolism is confusing. Saleem is obviously portrayed as a symbol, witness, living (and then dying) embodiment of India with a Muslim heritage. But him being the bastard son of an Englishman and an accordianist's wife seems to confuse that. I can appreciate the implication that India is held up as a bastard of Britain by this parentage, but how that gets into the Muslim aspect is something I cannot sort out clearly (despite Saleem's upbringing by Amina, with a Christian twist through Mary). This lack of clarity, maybe intentional, is nonetheless a detraction from the novel, in my opinion.In totality, M/C is a very good novel, and its Booker of Bookers, in my opinion, is deserved, in the sense that other Bookers are mostly mediocre to good offerings. Some weaknesses evident in the novel (lack of patience and exhibitionist knack), sadly, foretells Mr. Rushdie's decline as an author."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This is one of the absolute masterpieces - and comparisions to 100 years and the works of Borges are inevitable because of the use of magic realism. However, it differs from works of Marquez in 100 years because his style is not as controlled and the flow of word play is more abundant, creating a riot of colours and smells - which overwhelm you even more if you were born in a large indian city in the 60s or 70s. A note to appreciate this book - please read up just a bit of indian history from independence to the late 80s - i guarantee you'll enjoy this book substantially more if you do so. Rushdie is not Joyce - and you can easily get the incredible wordplays and metaphors with a half hour homework before reading Midnight's Children. Happy reading."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"What an incredible surprise! And to think I had nearly dismissed this writer as someone for the West to parade around just to spite &quot;Islamic extremists.&quot; Besides, I'm also often skeptical of artists who disrespect religious traditions.But upon a friend's recommendation, this became my first experience reading Rushdie- and I'm now a true believer! Encountering this author heightened my senses to the dangers of censorship- what a deeply personal experience. This is a magnificent book- one of my favorites ever.100 Years of Solitude and A Passage to India make nice complements."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"The thing that really surprised me about Midnight's Children, by the end of it, was its generally sardonic attitude towards the magical symbolism and omens that are so central to the plot. So much is made of the mystical connections relating to the main character (Saleem Sinai), so much promise is set up in the story, that it's surprising when the abuse starts being heaped on Saleem with almost sadistic relentlessness. By the end of the story Rushdie has portrayed a startlingly pessimistic view of the \\"potential\\" of the innocent. And, with the obvious parallels between the life of Saleem Sinai and the development of modern India, Rushdie also exhibits a pessimistic and fairly depressing forecast for the future of one of the world's most populous nations.But amidst all that is an epic; a collection of stories that seems almost like \\"A Thousand and One Nights\\" in its scope. The magical realism style Rushdie employs is far less confusing than that of Gabriel Garcia Marquez: where Marquez's rambling, stream of consciousness writing serves largely to (intentionally) disorient the reader, Rushdie (through a liberal use of semi-colons) gently guides the reader through narrative leaps spanning both time and distance. Astonishingly descriptive, Rushdie is almost more a painter than a writer in this book: the near 550 pages pass by with a very economical use of dialogue, and it is the scenes and descriptions that provide the meat and memories of the novel.Those who are fans of Tolkein and other authors who write lavishly detailed stories simply cannot miss this novel. \\"Midnight's Children\\" plays out like an Oscar-winning film or a very vivid, elaborate dream."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"I hate fighting my food, and I similarly hate to fight what I'm reading. I've read too many rambling books that one is \\"supposed\\" to enjoy, only to put them down in disgust. However, this one came across to me as completely enjoyable and straightforward! Why? Because I've lived in India for two years, and had no problems following the characters or the march of history behind them. I only wish I had this kind of context with other such books. My very unconstructive advice? Move to India--wait for some time--and then read this."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This is an extremely ambitious book. Rushdie attempts to weave together so many different ideas and threads, that it's hard to imagine conceiving of such a thing, let alone writing it. There is ample talent and brilliance and inspiration to be found, but ultimately Rushdie simply makes the reader work way too hard. You must juggle so many things at once, in order to keep it going, and it's exhausting.The chronological leaps, the ceaseless foreshadowing (you must constantly ask whether some new piece of information will be elaborated later, or if you must re-read a passage to figure it out), the liberties taken with punctuation, the \\"Hinglish\\" language challenges, the historical/cultural references, the magical/fantasy elements... all of these things are great on their own, but collectively it's just too damn much.Glad I read it, but can't recall another book where I was so glad to be done. It's hard work and the payoff is not quite there in the end, even tho I love Indian culture and history."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Midnight's Children is a very well thought out book; the whole narrative is obviously laid out from the beginning. The narrator, Saleem, is a rambling sort who is scrambling to write down his life story before he cracks and breaks away - \\"Now the crack, the cracks and always the cracks are narrowing my future towards its single inescapable fullpoint; and even Padma must take a back seat if I'm to finish my tales.\\" The narration isn't rushed though, but it does tend to delve off into personal speculation at times. I wasn't bothered by this because I found it entertaining, but some people might be. Saleem was born on the stroke of midnight on the day of the birth of the nation of India, so his story is also the story of India as it transforms from a tender and weak country into an adult and dangerous one. The best part of the story is Salman Rushdie's writing, in my opinion. He tends to use what I call adjective or noun or verb strings - putting words together like in this one: \\"driven on by the imperatives of rip tear crack, I abandon reflections.\\" Salman Rushdie has such a unique style of writing, one that forces the reader to completely focus on what is being said or else he/she will miss something vital. It's gorgeous, colored by Indian phrases and sentence-structuring. Midnight's Children is a very interesting story, and I'd recommend it to anyone, but especially lovers of unique prose."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Rushdie lectured the motto in this tome: the life story of anyone can be the result of the whole world, and the whole world can be nothing but triggered by or explicited on someone. This is a historic fiction with fantasy, and a great fiction in its own.Rushdie is so ambitious that he tried to depict the history of India in a book, in a very gorgeous language and style, while simaltaneously ruthlessly burdening our poor good protagonist, Saleem, and his morbid family.I am so dazzled by the ambition and the language of the book, and am deeply moved not only by the book itself but also Rushdie. I can feel the ardent love and eager struggle for India in Rushdie. It is definitely not for the faint-hearted. And I am so happy that I finally finished this book. Its a deeply true-heartedly wow."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"\\"Midnight's Children\\" by Salman Rushdie is called a 'Great Book of the 20th Century\\" and \\"a modern classic,\\" and rightly so. This novel is one of the most interesting and memorable of the 20th century, and one of the best novels by a living writer, at least that I have read. Rushdie weaves a semi-historical, semi-mythical portrayal of the newly formed nation-state of India. Throughout the book, I kept thinking that the protagonist was actually Rushdie himself; or, perhaps the protagonist represents Rushdie's generation, since he was born in Bombay in 1947. The plot is interesting indeed, which I won't get into because I don't want to spoil it for anyone. Let's just say that the protagonist relates the life of himself and his immediate ancestors in such a way to make Rushdie the \\"Indian mythmaker.\\" The writing is often too much in some places, and I feel that Rushdie over did it in a few places. I do like how Rushdie would refer to his own metaphors throughtout the book to keep the reader focused, because the reader can indeed get lost in the plot if one is not careful. This novel is often put next to \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" because of its style. I might agree to that to some extent, primarily because each of these two novels have a different purpose. They are both written in the style of magical realism, but again, each novel has it's own purpose. If Rushdie had kept his writing focused on India in his subsequent novels, I believe that he would be to India what J.M. Coetzee is to South Africa. However, Rushdie's scope is much broader than one country or even one culture. Anyway, that's another topic. Overall, if you have never read Rushdie, this is a great place to start."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This book came highly recommended by my English professor, who - if she had a choice - would name this Booker of Bookers one of the top three novels ever written.

Sure, I liked the imaginative prose and his \\"magic realism\\" elements, but I didn't really feel like I connected with any of the characters in the book. It was only when I looked at my clock and realized it was three in the morning that it hit me. I had devoured almost half the book and I kept going because I wanted to see what would happen. When I finally finished the book, I realized that she was right: if not one of the top three, then definitely high up.

That's not really saying much because I don't think a book exists that is suited for everyone, save for maybe a dictionary. Still, this is an intense, methodical book. Those looking for a quick read are best suited to seek something else, because this one is not a quick read by any stretch of the imagination.Within that intensity and thickness one finds the brilliant yet insane world of Saleem Sinai, the main character of this story. Both allegorical and literal, this story winds though such a myriad of well-woven sub-stories that one needs to put the book down every few pages to think about what was just read.From his birth to the book's finality, we rise up the ups and fall down the downs with Saleem. We are twisted, confused, wrought out, and yet manage to survive through thick and more thick. From front to back, side to side, this narrative thoroughly tosses you about. From chapter to chapter one never knows where you're going to end up.With excellent writing plus both laughable and dramatic scenes, Rushdie shows why he is one of the greatest writers of our time. Truly an instant classic, this book is a must read for those who want to explore some of this generation's greatest. This work is wonderful, beautiful, exasperating, and terrifying. All of these things Rushdie manages to squeeze into one pickle jar of a character in Saleem Sanai.Excellent."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This piece of artwork was simply astonishing. Rushdie's voice is poetic and clear; there is no other work like this.Throughout the book, you can almost see Rushdie's writing style change. This may usually be a weakness in other pieces, but in this book it is perfect, strengthening the power of the novel, changing along with the people in the story- it takes my breath away!All the characters are human; they become your friends and enemies. Just as everyone in the story leaves their mark on the main character, Saleem, Rushdie leaves his mark on you."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Wonderful Imagery!Rushdie creates a wonderful panorama and guides us through post-1947 nehru's india toward indira's new india as his characters move across the length and breadth of india, associating themselves with history, witnessing its events, and occasionally being a part of them. From the old Kashmir with the silent dal lake to the massacre at Jallianwalbagh, From the Streets and Forts of Delhi to the language riots of Bombay, From the military coups in pakistan, along the mysterious rann of kutch to the Mangroves of the Sunderbans, the story keeps turning while showing you all the nuances, sentiments, and personalities of the indian subcontinent. The characters are brilliantly depicted in rich variety and grab the readers attention immediately. It's not a history book but it presents history with stunning images in rushdie's wonderful hinglish. A wonderful read!"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This book is dense. Make no mistake about it. It is a tough jungle of thick, and often, obscure words. But pay the price of patience, and your imagination is in for a wild treat. You will meet snake charmers and pickle barons, you will be bombed by fruits and spittoons, you will, in short, be taken on a ride of unprcedented weirdness.I abhor giving too much of the plot away, since part of the magic of this book is the wild and unpredictable turns that constantly keeps a reader on edge. But suffice to say, it is the story of Saleem Sinai, a midnight child, born at the moment of India's Independance, and therefore, absolutely and irrevocably tied to his nation's events. He will be your guide. Follow him, if you are ready to take your imagination on an uncontrolable roller coaster of sights, sounds, and ESPECIALLY smells!"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Midnight's Children is the zenith of the talents of one of the greatest and most misunderstood writers of our era. Unlike most of Rushdie's other novels, Midnight's Children is almost relentlessly serious, with little of Rushdie's trademark quipping interfering with the progress of the story. And while some fans may miss it, it works, as Rushdie delves into magical realism to tell the story of children across India born at the stroke of the nation's independence in August 1947, and their telekinetic powers and ability to communicate with each other across great distances. In addition to mirroring the history of India during its first half-century as an independent, unified nation, Rushdie uses the children's &quot;superpowers&quot; as a metaphor for India's own erratic and often misdirected ascension as a nation-state."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This book is truly pathbreaking. It's got pathos, tragedy, comedy, drama and 'tear-jerking' ...all in all, a totally &quot;masala&quot; book. Lesser writers would have floundered to paint on such a huge canvas, but not Rushdie. He straddles the past and the future, the magical and the mundane, the east and the west, history and fantasy with equal grace. If Rushdie were a filmmaker, he would be a person who could mix Manmohan Desai, Ram Gopal Verma and Ray into a lethal combination.Saleem Sinai is not however the typical potboiler hero...he's got his magical moments but the weight of power and history weighs him down.Shiva, however, is the villian like a Bollywood villian.But, reviewing this book here seems so difficult, my advice is to go read it!"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Rushdie is a true master with a skill for story telling that not many can match. This book is not to be missed by those who care about politics and how people are affected by it on an everyday level. And as I have never yet been to India, I feel like I have already visited surrounded by it's sites &amp; smells. I can't wait to read more of his works!"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"When I first started to read this, I thought I'd never finish it, so I decided to read slowly, but carefuly, and I haven't done wrong - I really enjoyed it. There's not one boring part in it. It knid of reminds me of G. Garcia Marquez because of the involving of elements of fantastic, but still Rushie has his own special style. You don't need to know everything about India to be able to read this - common knowldge is enough."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"I was really looking forward to this book. The subject, the repercussions till today ... I have lived a very long time in this geographical area and have therefore a deep interest.Rushdie's book reminded me of so many visits of locals where at the end you were asking yourself, what was the purpose and what were we talking about? These instances and the book have one thing in common: a complete waste of time. And Indians, as well as Nepalis, are very good at that.In Midnight's Children it seems that SR's ego - and boy, so called Indian intellectuals do sport quite some ego - simply went haywire. The book is an exercise in overtwisting a twist, in being oh so very clever or as the Germans say it approaches the subject 'from the back through the chest and into the eye'."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Rushdie is so in love with his own writing and condescending of his reader that he feels it necessary to explain his themes and symbols, and to periodically review the main points of the story. I admit that I enjoyed the first few chapters and some of the wordplay, but most of it is out-of-control, self-indulgent rubbish. It is very disappointing to me that this book has won so much critical acclaim."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"I've read another one of his books and thought it was very good. This one was too disjointed for me.Frankly no one in our reading group enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Rushdie's book Midnight's Children is unbearable. The book is extremely repetitive and boring. Rushdie attempts to avoid this criticism by being \\"unique\\" and using a stream of consciousness technique that infuriated me consistently during the reading. The book is filled with supposedly \\"deep\\" metaphors, which are actually incredibly superficial and annoying. Rushdie's arrogance and narcissism is reflected by the main character of the book, Saleem, who spends the majority of a 500 page novel complaining about how life hasn't treated him fairly. Prior to reading the novel I was disgusted by what I knew of Indian tradition in general, particularly the caste system and pervasive racism in the country. This novel did little to enlighten western readers to some redeeming quality in their society, and left me, a staunch liberal, reconsidering how bad colonialism actually was. Since I realize that colonialism was one of the most immoral actions perpetrated by any group of people in history, it only goes to show you how negatively Rushdie portrays what should be a vibrant culture. Since this seems to be the only reason to market this novel towards western readers, I am forced to conclude that this novel is a complete failure."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This is a lousy book. It's really amazing to me that the world had made such a fuss about such a mediocre writer as Salman Rushdie. The reason is properly that he is of somewhat Indian origin and that Khomeini got pissed off. Anyway Midnight's Children is a socio-political account. It revolves around some crucial times in newer Indian history, like the declaration of post colonial India on midnight August 15, 1947 and the declaration of state of emergency on June 25, 1975, the war with Pakistan, etc. Upon these historical facts Rushdie then brews an account inspired by magical realism and interspersed with personal experiences. Often Rushdie tries to be funny, but I didn't laugh one single time!"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Started reading it and put it down three times, just couldn't hold my interest."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This book is a heaping pile of garbage and here's why. It is extremely boring, and excruciatingly painful to read. Every teacher I've ever had in my creative writing workshop classes always emphasized two very specific things that a writer needs to keep in mind in order to write very good fiction. The first thing is that you need to grab the reader's attention right from the beginning of the story, and try to maintain this attention as best as possible. The second, is that the writing needs to be clear so that the story flows well. Salman Rushdie does neither of these two things. Folks, describing what someone's nose looks like as the introduction of a novel is not how you get someone's attention. In fact, its a pretty good way to ensure that people think you are retarded. Also, the novel jumps all over the place in terms of everything - the characters, the time, etc. The result is a reader that is inundated with places and names that he or she could remotely give a rat's ass about.Second, the premise of the story, which is about a thousand children born on the stroke of midnight that possess supernatural powers, doesn't impress me at all. The premise doesn't impress me at all. Why? Because if Saleem had an ounce of common sense, and if he could really tap into other people's minds, then wouldn't it be extremely logical for him to become a professional poker player? Gambling in horse races is legal in India, as mentioned in the novel, so it is clear that it is a gambling-friendly country. Think about it. Creating a Midnight's Children's Conference is probably the last thing I would do if I were Saleem and I could read people's minds. And Saleem has the nerve to think that a bunch of idiotic 10 year olds, yimmering and yammering about what toys they want, have the ability to save a country? Please, screw that. I woulnd't care about India. India can go save itself because I would be too busy at the casino and buying Ferraris and mansions.Third, now this is a bit nitpicky, but the name Salman Rushdie distracted me from the novel, of which I could only read about 4 pages at a time at most because it was horrendously boring. Salman should be the name of a delicious and tasty fish that I like to eat once or twice a month, not a prominent author. And Rushdie? This distracted me even more, because what is Rushdie supposed to mean? That he wants to rush to die? Or wants us to rush to die? It's a goofy name, and serious novels require authors with serious names, like Stephen King, or Tom Clancy, and not silly names like J.K. Rowling. You know what J.K. stands for? JUST KIDDING. Harry Potter and his friends gain magical powers to defeat the jackass that killed his parents, and finally, has a tea party, but JUST KIDDING. But Rowling has achieved a level of wealth and stardom that Rushdie can only dream of, and I'm willing to bet that when he had heard about Rowling's success, he instantly grew another grey hair. I looked up Rushdie's picture on the internet, but only saw a picture of a sad hobo.Midnight's Children, is a form of verbal diarrhea in that Rushdie is simply stroking his own ego, and possibly himself right in front of our eyes, except only through the form of words. How many times is he going to repeat the motif of the smell of chutneys and sweetmeats and the smell of human waste in the air whenever Saleem goes out into public? Once, twice? Try possibly almost a hundred times. Books like these should be frowned upon, and the people that are giving this guy accolades and awards for this novel, need to put down their PCP pipes, and enter drug counseling and rehabilitation therapy, because these people are contributing to the slow death of literature as we know it. I think literature is like technology. It needs to evolve over time and newer versions of things should make previous ones obsolete so that we always have an influx of fresh new material. No car manufacturer today would put the engine of a Model T Ford into any car, it's just stupid. When the semester is over, and the exams and papers are all finished and submitted, I will celebrate with a small glass of champagne, and wait about 30 to 45 minutes. Then I would take Midnight's Children to my backyard, set it on the ground, and proceed to go to the bathroom on it. Midnight's Children, by Salman Rushdie, I give it a 1 star."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"I feel about Salman Rushdie's first big book roughly the same way I feel about Indian food. The food features a fascinating melange of spices, smells and textures, but I have no desire to consume it. Nor do I particularly comprehend the attraction of the cuisine of a dirt poor Third World country with more dietary taboos than you can shake a sitar at and, while heavy spicing is a perfectly logical substitute for substance, at the end of the meal one longs to ask: &quot;Where's the beef?&quot;. Similarly, in his novel, Rushdie combines his signature Magical Realist style and the actual historical background of India since Independence with the family history of the Sinai's to create a bewildering mess of a novel that is heavy on Bombay slang. The language is pungent but indecipherable and the story is ambitious but confusing. The linguistic pyrotechnics and luxuriant prose have displaced the meat of the story.I actually believe that India offers a unique opportunity to the author of today. With the end of the Cold War and peace in the Middle East, South Africa and Northern Ireland, many of the settings that offered built in tension have disappeared. India, however, remains a corrupt political state, is rife with ethnic tension and is nearly at war with both Pakistan and China. There are so many latent plot lines that it would seem an irresistible setting and I very much enjoyed books like Rohinton Mistry's Such a Long Journey and Vikram Seth's A Suitable Boy (1993). But, both are much more traditional, Western-style novels. As is usually the case, the injection of magical realism into Rushdie's story ends up detracting from his tale rather than enhancing it. The effort to create an Indian, or postcolonial, style did not work for me; a straightforward narrative, stripped of hocus pocus gimmickry, would have been much more enjoyable.GRADE: C-"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"had fair expectations. rushdie spends too much time being cutesy and obnoxiously witty. read a book on indian history instead."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"im not a wordsmith and will not be able to do this book justice.the first few chapters are jumpy and staccato and difficult to read. once past this initial investment, rushdie unfurls a rich and complex story. as i continue to read, it seems the main character transitions from the current to the next... as the story unfolds offspring to offspring, generation to generation. of course this is all weaved with history in the kashmir region... delightfully vivid and imaginative. my favorite book so far"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Although anyone can present arguments against Midnight's Children receiving the Best of the Bookers award, it certainly belongs on a short list for the best novels (and a very short list of the most important) of the last 3 decades.

However, as a native of the Indian subcontinent, I feel that he falls short in giving a true sketch of life there. Perhaps this is because he himself is a migrant. This is an aspect of the novel that many Westerners cannot really pick up on, but that sticks out in my mind. Also, it would help if Rushdie weren't such a pervert."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Midnight's Children potrays the life of Saleem Sinai, one ofthe many children born precisely at the stroke of midnight of August15,1947 when India woke up to its freedom.

I will read another of his books someday, but I will not recommend it for book club!"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"I am biased, and there is no two ways about that. I believe Rushdie is the greatest mordern writer in history, hence if he wrote the eqivalent of 'Amsterdam' I would probably rave about. If I had to name a favourite of Rushdie's written work, I would always name 'Satanic Verses' as my perfered, due to it's sheer brilliance and busyness, however it is closely followed by 'Midnight's Children.' I read it a couple of months ago, and my message remained unposted, hence my recollection is a bit blurry, however I remember raving in that review immediately after reading it. I think that Salman Rushdie, along with the 1997 Booker prize winner and the likes of Rohiston Mistry and the novel 'Flower Boy' have created a standard of writing that the rest of the world should to aim to match. I absolutely love Indian literature, much of it being as many have mentioned, being in the little known, but highly interesting genre of magic realism, along with the fabulous Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Love in Times of Chlorea. I plead for people to give this style of writing, and 'Midnight's Children' a chance. The later is an interesting, consistant and busy novel, which I enjoyed from every aspect, and will remember for much of my reading life."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"I love Salman Rushdie, so any review I may write will be biased simply because I value everything Salman has to say. I love his bitting sense of humour particularly when looking at despondent issues such as poverty, I love his vivid descriptions and his almost obsessive love of small details, when describing even the most inconsquencal of his characters. But what I love most is the gross ironies he presents in his novels. Midnight's Children is no exception to Rushdie's favourite fable method, and if full of hilariously detailed paradoxes. The idea of swapped births, rich to poor and poor to rich, but still ending up in the manner which they were born, to me, is ingenius. While I did not enjoy this one quite as much as Satanic Verses, I believe Salman's writing is something you begin to appericate after you give his novel's considerable thought. They are somewhat hard to digest at the beginning, but once thought over; the links, the hidden messages and abundent symbols make it all much clearer why Salman has earned the praise he recieves. A busy, beautiful and saddening novel, andd one which I will remember forever."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This is a truly luscious book to be savored slowly.

To my infinite surprise I discovered one of the true masterpieces of 20th century literature. My only complaint is that the latter half of the book does not seem to follow the impressive lyrical precedent of the first 300 pages - but this is to be expected as the beauty of the writing is unparallelled."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"After reading a different Rushdie book I jumped at the chance to read Midnight's Children for my high school AP English class. The details and imagination are outstanding. The book is over flowing with not only drama, but humor as well. As for all of the word plays and puns made in the book and interview with Rushdie revealied that he used them merely to make a family type language and individual habits of speaking.

Everything else was dead writing. This was FANTASTIC!"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This book won the Booker of Bookers, so when I saw it sitting on the shelf, it said, \\"I must be good, take me home!\\" After all, I've adored some other Booker winners.Not this one.Saleem Sinai is born at the stroke of midnight, August 15th, 1947, at the same moment that India becomes an independent nation. He knows that he must be special - he even receives a letter from the Prime Minister for such a fortuitious birth time. This book isn't just about him, though, it is about several generations of his family and the history of his country, all of which makes it into a lengthy literary saga.I didn't like Saleem. He drove me crazy with his dodging of topics and endless diversions. I wasn't interested in his relationship with Padma and I got completely fed up with his self-important attitude. I understand that his condition is reflected by India throughout the novel, but that didn't mean I enjoyed reading about it just because it had literary value. His connection with the other midnight children was interesting, but once again his arrogance ruined it. He's an unreliable narrator to an extent, but not in the way that I like, if that makes any sense at all. He's just trying to make himself sound good. Maybe because he is, apparently, not very attractive.India, as a country, was by far the most compelling character throughout the book. I loved reading about the different regions, about Bombay and Delhi, about how rapidly India was changing. I'd certainly recommend this book for insight into the culture and that is easily the best part of it. I wouldn't mind seeing the Kashmir region for myself, now, after reading about it so many times.So, in the end? I think Midnight's Children was too literary for me. I can tell that I'd get more enjoyment out of it if I went through in a class and then had to write a paper on it to pick it apart. As I was going through, I actually picked out paper topics that would illuminate the subject matter better. I'm not quite crazy enough to go out and write a paper just now, though. If I ever have fewer TBRs waiting for me, I might pick it up again and see if I can catch some of the threads that I missed this time, but I don't anticipate that happening for a long time."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Midnight's Children has tried to shake the foundations of some power structures , which is the main aim of any postmodern work. Rushdie has mixed fantasy with facts in right proportion to picturise Post-Independent India. Children born during the night of Indian independence are called \\"Midnight's Children.\\" They suffer from all the ailments of Independent India. They are made unproductive like the country. Declaration of Emergency by Indira Gandhi is compared to the labour pangs of Parvati, a witch. All the important historical events like The Jalianwala Bagh Massacre, Bangladesh War, and The Emergency are mixed with magical elements like Aziz's itching nose saving him from the bullets of English soldiers on the Jallianwala Bagh ground. Rushdie aptly uses terms like 'chutnification of history' and 'pickles of history' to explain his treatment of history. There is 'discontinuity' in narration. But we see 'permutation' in places where Saleem brings all the women of his life in an order to explain Parvati, the witch, about his marriage. Saleem lives a 'fragmented' life. He is split into 'fragments' by his grandfather's rationality, grandmother's credulity, father's numbness, mother's fragmented life, and sister's lovelessness. He has no constant identity. He gets lost in a jostling crowd of 'I's. Rushdie mixes all genres. He includes film trailors, gossips, advertisements, posters, and third rate similes, and jokes to break the distinction between high and low literature. This is called 'hybridity.' Rushdie seems to give his own comments through Saleem. Salman merges into Saleem in some places, and it is clear in the text. This is called 'short circuit'. Rushdie's 'Midnight's Children' shares many of the post modern techniques, and can be called a novel with post- modern features."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Giving away the ending of a book or movie is considered an unforgivable social sin in some quarters, so what the heck are we to do about an author who commits it against his own work?There's always that risk of self-exposure in any memoir, real or fictional, but the example of Salman Rushdie's \\"Midnight's Children\\" is particularly egregious. The narrator, Saleem Sinai, in some very cleverly-turned phrases, immediately puts us on notice that he was born at the exact moment that India gained its independence from Britain and that as he writes this memoir he expects to die at any time. That in itself is enough to make you sit up and beg for more; a profoundly significant nativity, coupled with the urgency of impending doom? What could possibly happen next?Well, I'll tell you what happens next; Saleem Sinai informs us that the powers which devolved upon him due to the time of his birth had no impact whatsoever on anyone, and he confidently expects that his death will be no more notable. In other words, this is the story of a man who might as well never have lived at all. God knows what kept me reading after that.Okay, it was Rushdie's undeniable gift of words that kept me reading after that, but the whole book is the same game; Saleem Sinai, in the middle of his narrative, drops a dark hint or two about future events like hidden murder suspects, devastating fire and bomb attacks, wives and sons who aren't truly wives and sons, fascinatingly various magical powers leading to vicious magical wars, and some cruel and dangerous figure called the Widow. Eventually, all of these oracular utterances come true, you find out what really happened, and because the narrative has built them up to such a pitch the events themselves seem trite and you're left wondering what all the fuss was about.In a way, Rushdie got himself into a real bind here. If he'd told the story of Saleem Sinai, all the magical ties surrounding his life, his and India's parallel courses, \\"Midnight's Children\\" would have been a much better story, but he would have lost the chance to weave the opulence of his prose and that would have been a serious loss. On the other hand, by giving his language all this room to stretch and bend into all these mystical hints about what's to come, he robs his plot of its power when the events he's foreshadowed come to pass. Like the old saying goes, it's always something.Unfortunately, my sympathy for Rushdie in his literary difficulties does not extend to excusing his book for its flaws. If he couldn't find a way to balance the beauty of his language, the weight of his themes and the power of his story, that's his problem, frankly. It doesn't change the fact that he shot himself in the foot. (I know, there are a lot of bloodthirsty hooligans and brain-dead sheep out there who'd like to shoot him in a more damaging spot because some group of thin-skinned busybodies told them to, but you know what I mean.) For all his ambition, admirable as it is, the fact remains that with \\"Midnight's Children\\" Rushdie messed up a perfectly good story by calling too much attention to himself.These \\"slice of life\\" sorts of books - the type that go from miscellaneous Point A to random Point B rather than from beginning to end - have their advantages at times. They are certainly more prevalent now than in ages past; they're probably easier to write, and authors can throw into these books anything they like without regard for how well those details fit the story, since there is no story as such. However, as with most modern practices that disregard old traditions, the practitioners of \\"slice of life\\" stories have to be careful; the abandonment of the old rules does not mean that there are no rules, it just means that the new rules have not been discovered yet. Even players of modern free jazz can make mistakes. Salman Rushdie has uncovered one of those new rules for us, to wit, if you wish to trade the beginning-middle-end structure for the simple joy of the journey, do not - I repeat, do not - begin by telling us how the journey ends!In short, \\"Midnight's Children\\" is one of those books where you can get more pleasure by turning to a random page and basking in the warmth of the author's narrative skill than you can get by reading the whole thing from beginning to end. And that, my friends, is why lending libraries are sometimes more useful than bookstores.Benshlomo says, A journey of a thousand miles may begin with a single step, but that single step had better not be the last one."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":".... This book is no doubt good, and possibly great. However, for me, it doesn't reach truly elevated sublime \\"best book in 25 years\\" or top ten list status. With that said it's a worthwhile read for a phantasmorgorical look at India and Pakistan history and the plight of the countries. The 1,001 Midnight's Children carry around supernatural gifts, some pretty powerful, some not so spectacular. The protagonist Saleem Sinai, just happens to have a super-dooper nose and can converse with all the midnight's children in his head. His archenemy, Shiva, he of the gargantuan knees spoils Saleem's leadership of the Midnight's Children .... It's a cautionary tale of what could have been and deeper underlying, Rushdie weeps for his country of India and what could have been. The most unique convention of the novel is that Saleem's life parallels the development of India. It's a rather ambitious task that Rushdie sets out to do to capture India's development within a fictional life. The writing is well-versed, intelligent, and compelling. There is a good command of language, not quite as elevated as that of Nabokov, but good nonetheless. It reminded me a great deal of Gunter Grass' Tin Drum in the aspect of a fanciful characters reflecting a Country's development, so may lose some originality points for that. All in all though, an enjoyable read, but not one that I want to go back and read anytime soon, which is the true test of literary greatness for me. I would read Catch-22, the Underworld, and Crime and Punishment again and again. For Midnight's Children, once was enough."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"... I think I may just be turned off by the way he writes. I only made it through the first half of this book before I was completely confused and turned around and frustrated. I felt exactly the same way for his \\"Satanic Verses\\"... only got about half way through that one, too. I am very well versed in Islamic culture and religion, but I know next to nothing of Indian culture, so I was very confused by his profusion of culturally-rich references and descriptions of Indian mindset and history.I am only giving it two stars because he does have a very lyrical and descriptive writing style; I saw another writer compare it to Nabakov's style of writing, and that seems pretty apt. Very colorful, very imaginitive, very pleasing to the mind's eye.However, all the prosaic narration in the world will not help you understand a complex, stuttering, warped, fiercely non-chronological tale. I think it's safe to say that if you have read one Rushdie novel and you like it, you'll like them all. If, on the other hand, you find one novel to be scream-inducing, it's probably best to avoid the rest of them."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Difficult for someone who doesn't even get the symbolism of black and green. I looked up the colors of the flag and they are red and green (Paksitan is white and green). So don't expect much from me.Set in India during the independence movement and told by a Muslim. Won the Booker Prize for Best Book in 25 Years. Concept is that the guy (and others) born at exactly midnight on the day of independence have some special powers. The author is able to read peoples' thoughts and to communicate with the other 1000 children born at midnight. It is fantasy told in context as historical novel.This novel is difficult to read and therefore not for the average reader; the style is Faukneresque in grammar and punctuation, virtually every sentence is filled with metaphore and symbolism. If the reader had a good knowledge of India-Pakistan history, the story would be more interesting as there is a good deal of hidden (or not so hidden) political analysis. These are the reasons I didn't rate the novel higher so probably a little unfair.Here is an example (ok, this is an extreme example):Hint: The Widow is Indira Ghandi; Monkey is the sisterFrom the chapter \\"At the Pioneer Caf&eacute;\\" --No colours except green and black the walls are green the sky is black (there is no roof) the stars are green the Widow is green abut her hair is black as black.

Whether this is a reflection of the author in general or this book in particular I cannot say (for admittedly, this is the only book by Rushdie I have read to-date), but this book smacks of Grass' The Tin Drum in more than mere coincidental measures. While I am not the first to make this comparison between these two authors; I found the similarities between Midnight's Children and The Tin Drum to walk a dubious line (perhaps out of my own ignorance). The resemblances don't end in style alone but spill over into the story and the characters as well. There are even parts of the book (particularly some of the more poetic passages) which seemed to be &quot;lifted&quot; from the Tin Drum and reworked for Midnight's Children. Suffice it to say that I am not accusing Rushdie of plagiarism here, only suggesting, perhaps, an overlty ardent fawning over the great Mr. Grass. Likewise, I am not proposing that this is not a good book in it's own right or that it should not be read. It is and it should. I am merely recommending for those interested in reading this book (or the author) to read The Tin Drum first so that it may lend new perspective to Midnight's Children. These two works do make for an interesting comparison. Again a very good book, well-written, and definately worth the read, but for this reader it pales in comparison to its predecessor."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Reading \\"Midnight's Children\\", much like Gabriel Garcia-Marquez's \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" is in a way like reading a dream. The people and places are surreal and distorted, yet familiar at the same time. In a lot of ways, its similar to the distorted vision from which we view the world as children, where everything seems larger than life and more important than it really is. I've read articles where Marquez and Rushdie's writing styles have been favorably compared before and if you've read one, the similarities will become immediately apparent upon reading the other. Rushdie has done a fantastic job of telling a story with a political message that doesn't really feel like a political message because it was so masterfully told. Like most good books, this is one you find yourself remembering for a while."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This book has been written by an extraordinary being, whose linguistic arsenal of celestial creativity manifested through impeccable writing skills... have founded my No. 1 author; with Midnight's Children being my personal favourite.Rushdie's magnificent narrative style coupled with a richly-textured storyline all added up to the substance of this best seller; which is beyond my humble words to describe.One of the best fictions that I have read so far.

The prose is absolutely gorgeous at times, and is consistently awe-inspiring. However, this book frequently digresses into a state of borderline tedium. This is not a book that you can just plow through on a couple of rainy afternoons (unless you're some kind of inhuman literate beast - something we should all aspire to be =P), this is a book that you bite off in digestible pieces and savor.Rushdie has been and will always be a writer's writer. Even so, there is plenty of entertainment value in this work that anyone with a modicum of literary fortitude would be well-served to enjoy.If you are deciding whether to start with \\"Midnight's Children\\" or \\"Satanic Verses\\" I would suggest SV for avid readers as I believe it is better, and I would recommend MC for the more casual reader as it is more accessible.My rating for \\"Midnight's Children\\": 9/10"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Rushdie really is the most extraordinary stylist. Reading \\"Midnight's Children\\", I came up with the appellation \\"The Steve Vai of the Pen\\". If you're not a rock fan it may bear pointing out that Vai is the guitarist who can make his guitar laugh and speak like a human voice. I swear Rushdie could write sentences that sound like an electric guitar if he wanted.Rushdie has a reputation as an intellectual and a hard read, but nothing could be farther from the truth. This book is a riot - complex and deep, but ebullient and compulsive. By turns orotund and bawdy, fragrant and crude, it simply crams so much in that it is impossible to pin the book down with a simple phrase. Part solipsistic fantasy, part psychosis, part history-by-proxy, it is several books in parallel. One stylistic trick that reminds me, jarringly, of Stephen King is Rushdie's device of events echoing forward in time - not prolepsis, but hints and fragments of what is to come, sometimes accompanied by an affected narrative twitch as the writer steers himself back to the matters at hand. The effect is one of a compulsive forward momentum, drawing the reader into a book like the perspective lines and streets of a painting.So what is the book about? Well, that's a hard one. I would call it the tragedy of Indian nationhood. The protagonist, Midnight's Child, is born with India at the stroke of independence and fated to live out its life in synecdoche. The supernaturalist bent of its realisation is a little clunky, but then I live surrounded by homoeopaths, creationists and astrologers. Such is modern life. The climacteric in which he is sundered from his fate is the horror of India's forced sterilisations, a final loss of innocence for a state already hopelessly compromised by contact with realpolitik and superpower patronage. Perhaps this was the point at which the Mahatma's sanctifying imprint was finally washed from the soil and India became just another lost, modern state. If so, welcome to Earth.At any rate, the Child is finally eaten up and churned away in the mass, individual talent macerated and lost in a cacophony of 600 million voices. An allegory of the wider individual in the midst of the conflict of ideologies that scarred the 20th Century?This is perhaps not the greatest book in 25 years, as the Booker prize would have it, but it is an important one, maybe even a work of genius. Perhaps it is about lost hopes. Then again, perhaps it is about the ambiguity of venom. And perhaps it is about pickles. I'm going to go with the latter."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"If you are looking for a nice relaxing book to read this is not the one for you.

It's much less claustrophobic and crazed than the Satanic Verses, this definitely shares the same playful mixing of the mystical and the mundane, but it seems much less dark, and even the bleakest parts feel thrillingly alive. He just has this incredibly lyrical way of making coincidences, foreshadowing and outright prophecies collide and mix in with each other. I can't speak for others, but I found it very hard to not be drawn into Saleem's world, nose and all"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This book is a masterpiece of literature and history. It has a unique style which combines prose, storytelling, magic realism, and historical fiction and moves them along like a horse at the racetrack. It is like caviar: I can't read too much at one sitting for it's too rich. I like to savor it one chapter at a time. I laugh and cry while my mind is churned up with images and ideas. The references to Indian languages, religions, culture, history and folklore enrich the adventure, allowing me to emmerse myself in the writer's universe, and also the world of the 1940's and 50's. I reread passages and constantly find something new. Although this book was written over 25 years ago, it still resonates with us today. Salman Rushdie is not only a genuis but a phenomenon, and, in case you couldn't tell, I love this book. I took it from the library, but had to return it after three weeks because it was on hold for someone else. I wanted to have my own copy, so I could read and reread it whenever I wanted, and share it with family and friends."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Very voluminous, but a great read. I love the way Rushdie, cajoles you into his themes and plots and sub-plots. Not a simple read, but of a generation of writers who take the time to write, and hence you need to take the time to read!"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This is, in every way, a perfect novel. Both humorous and heartbreaking. I found myself deeply moved and very suprised that I enjoyed this novel as much as I did. I have never been very interested in Indian history, and knew close to nothing about it. But upon reading this novel, I found myself drawn into the rich fictional history of the Aziz family, as well as the equally rich history of India. Rushdie may have ruined reading for me, as every book I read will now have much higher standards! Not for light reading, though. I imagine this is a book that you could read over and over and still find something new each time. This is a tough novel, and it takes a lot of work to truly \\"get it\\". The only reason I stuck with it is because I had to for class. But it was very rewarding in the end. The novel reveals itself in layers, with recurring themes and motifs that grow in extremely deep and powerful meanings. The character of Saleem, self-described savior of India, is one of the most memorable characters to have graced the pages of a novel. I have heard some people say that this book is a let down in the end, as though it never comes to a full climax. In answer to that: I felt that was the whole point. Saleems dreams are always dreams, they are never completely realized. The language is beautiful and lyrical, and the plot is highly detailed, as though each sentence was carefully planned. Rushdie may be the ultimate architect of this century when it comes to plot building. As a writer myself, I was both green with envy and speechless with awe over this novel. I have never read anything else by Rushdie, but now I definitly plan to!A couple of tips:1. There are many different characters, so you may want to make a family tree to keep track.2. Pay close attention to Rushdie's use of color in the novel, particularly green, saffron and blue, as well as numbers.3. The narrator, Saleem, breaks away from linear storytelling in a big way. Often, the story jumps around and he gives a lot of foreshadowing. It helps to let go of our western idea of time (i.e. events happening in a timeline) and just let the story unfold. Trust me, once you can let go of your confusion and just let it be, the reading becomes much easier! Also, it's interesting to consider what he chooses to tell us ahead of time, and what he doesn't.And finally, you will definitly want to brush up on your Indian history! I'm not talking a whole lot, just an Encarta article or something so you know what's going on. Also, when historical figures are mentioned in the book, you should do a little research and find out more about them. This is especially true for the political figures, such as Indira Ghandi.Like I said, this book is A LOT of work, but worth all the effort."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Midnight's Children is considered to be Rushdie's masterpiece; it won the Booker Prize, and then, in 1993, it won the 'Booker of Bookers', ie the best book to have won the Booker Prize in the first 25 years of the award. In addition to this, Rushdie's reputation is not built upon his literary merits so much as the surrounding controversy of another book, The Satanic Verses, which all but condemned him to years of hiding and constant moving about in an effort to escape fundamentalist Muslim assassination-attempts.The premise for this novel is amazing. At the stroke of midnight on August 15th, 1947, India achieved independence and became a valid country, free from the shackles of Britain. One thousand and one children were born in the hour from midnight to 1am, one thousand and one children with magical powers, the potency of which increases the closer the child was born to midnight.The narrator, Saleem Sinai, was one of two children born on the exact stroke of midnight, and throughout the novel various allusions to yin and yang, good and evil, up and down, et cetera are made between Saleem and Shiva, the other child, but unfortunately nothing really comes from this. Although mentioned often and with great vehemence on the part of the narrator, Shiva never really came across as a 'bad guy', or even someone that should be worried about at all.The story meanders through thirty odd years of life before Saleem's birth, detailing the lives and idiosyncracies of his parent's and grandparent's adventures, which, admittedly, are described with great sweeping motions and tantalizing literary strokes. Sentences marvel, paragraphs sing with wit or beauty, but...what was the point? After Saleem is born, events take an incredibly epic turn, as the implications of the children of midnight are revealed, but then, the narrator just sort of forgets about it and rambles on about things that, given the immensely intruiging concept of the children, just doesn't spark any interest.The narrator is an interesting writer. He repeats reiterates recapitulates words in threes, often, and that works. He used parentheses artfully, and well. But the narrator foreshadows everything and anything, so that we are always reading about events that will come to pass, soon or otherwise, and in cryptic ways, 'He kept himself in the background of our lives, always, except twice...once when he left us; once when he returned to destroy the world by accident'. It is an exceptionally annoying literary technique, serving only to make the reader wish that events would hurry up so that the portentous-sounding episodes will occur, but...even they are marred by fore-shadowing and never really live up to the promises, anyway.The last one hundred and fifty pages drag, seemingly without cohesion, in an effort to combine the plot-threads, to actually make the children a part of the story - and, disappointingly, they really aren't very predominant - but it doesn't work. Then, in a whirlwind twenty pages, everything is tied up neatly, the children are dealt with, and the book ends. The fantastic premise never really lived up to its promise, and the book suffers.Is Midnight's Children a failure? No. As a story, it is enjoyable, written well, and at times, beautiful. Certain passages are crafted with amazing skill, and the narrator is a pleasant enough fellow. But the concept of the midnight's children should have been ditched - the story would have worked well enough without them because they never really played a part - and the book would have been greater as the spectre of great things to come would not have existed."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Towards the beginning of this book, there is a minor character who is an artist whose paintings have grown huge because he keeps trying to fit life into them. He mourns because he'd wanted to be a miniaturist, but instead has elephantiasis. Even though the character never recurs, I thought about him through the huge landscape of this book.Rushdie has the eye for detail of a miniaturist, but writes in epic sweeps, fitting in countless lives and actions. If done badly, this would have been nearly impossible to read, but the execution is brilliant and instead gives the impression of a huge rich tapestry running by like film.The book is about the Midnight's Children (children born in the first hour after the birth of India as a nation) and their erstwhile leader Saleem Sinai. It traces him (and them) through childhood, the creation of Pakistan, and beyond. Even though the events are crucial, to have an understanding of the plot won't give you any help with the book.My advice to people attempting Midnight's Children is to not worry too much about catching and understanding every detail. Yes, knowing more about Indian history will make certain things clear (although it may obscure others), but there's so much here that it isn't really necessary. I already know that this is a book I'm going to re-read, and that will be the chance to pick up missing pieces.One of the highest of recommends."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Salman Rushdie's &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; appears to be an allegory, spiced with satirical commentary, on the political course of modern India and the in-fighting of its various social and religious factions. It is an endlessly inventive book with a cheeky sense of humor and wild, exotic imagery, but it does not eschew somber moments. Rushdie presents this novel as the autobiography of Saleem Sinai, writing from his current residence at a Bombay pickle factory under the critical eye of his frequently interruptive lover/fiance Padma.Saleem was born on the stroke of midnight on August 15, 1947, the precise moment of India's independence from Great Britain and Pakistan's formation. He and one thousand other babies (the Midnight's Children) born in India throughout the hour each has some supernatural power such as witchcraft, time travel, gender alteration, etc., or otherwise is simply a mutant. Kind of like the X-Men, except they're too self-serving to band together and fight crime (and too bad, as there is a lot of narrative potential in this idea).Saleem routinely hides in a washing-chest in his house to find inner peace away from neighborhood kids who taunt him for his large misshapen nose and other odd facial features. One day in the chest, he has a strange accident -- he sniffs a pajama cord up his nose, triggering an effect which causes him to hear voices in his head and realize he has telepathic powers. By telepathy, he establishes communication with the (heretofore unknown to him) other Midnight's Children, but they prove unwilling to unite. An operation performed on his nose to stop his severe dripping snot problem clears his nasal passages to reveal an uncanny olfactory ability, enabling him to sniff out emotions and ideas as well as smells.Saleem also gives an extensive background on his family, beginning with how his maternal grandparents met, up to his pyromaniac-turned-singing-star younger sister. After his (Muslim) family relocates to Pakistan, almost all of them are killed in the 1965 India-Pakistan war, and in the 1971 war for the independence of Bangladesh, Saleem is conscripted in the Pakistani Army as a human bloodhound.Eventually, Saleem marries Parvati, one of the Midnight's Children, the witch, who bears a child fathered by his arch enemy Shiva, another of the Midnight's Children, whose special attribute is his ability to crush people with his overdeveloped knees. Shiva works as an agent for the government of India, who demand to know the indentities and whereabouts of all the Midnight's Children, and Saleem is the only one who can tell them...Like E.L. Doctorow's &quot;Ragtime,&quot; &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; blurs the line between historical fact and fiction, weaving fantastic events against a realistic backdrop of a land in turmoil. Saleem is an extraordinary character, not a hero in the traditional sense but a deformed symbol, a vessel for carrying and displaying the problems and hopes of the people of India."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"&quot;Midnight's Children&quot; is the first Rushdie book I've read, and only the second one by an 'exile Indian'. I'd heard so much about Rushdie's literary talent that I went off and bought it.At first I was a little disappointed, I must say. Rushdie's prose at the beginning of the book is clever, intelligent, witty - but it didn't touch me emotionally. I very much enjoyed reading it, but I wasn't too interested in what was going on.Then, before I'd noticed it, I was hooked. From the moment the narrator actually became a protagonist, I was involved in the plot. Driven on by the dozens of hints and foreshadowings, I simply had to know what would happen, and I began to care about most of the characters.More than that, Rushdie's novel is a rich tapestry of politics, magic, metaphor; there's so much imagination in this book, but it doesn't become overladen as other novels sometimes do. The author juggles his multiple plot lines, characters and his version of history and India deftly, and for me reading this novel was a real joy.P.S.: Some readers - and critics - have complained that Rushdie's India is not really India. So what? I believe that &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; can be enjoyed tremendously as an imaginative, clever, involving and intelligent novel. Why look for the 'truth' in it? While some readers with a limited knowledge of the country might take this novel's geography and history as 'the real thing', I don't think you should judge literature by its readers."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Previously, during a scandal with 'The Satanic Verses' and Salmon Rushdie's death sentence, I tried to read his 'Shame' but was absolutely disappointed and stopped reading after first 100-150 pages. Now I discern at least two of my mistakes: I read Rushdie in Russian translation and not up to the end. 'Midnight's Children' was my second attempt to understand Rushdie, I was attracted by its Booker and Booker of Bookers. The book consists of three parts: at first I was tired with author's derisive style, then I became interested in the fate of its protagonist, only at the end I appraised author's intention and mastery of its realization.An undeniable strong point of the novel is its excellent language, a wonderful gallimaufry of indigenous words and such an amazing gamut of English that can do credit to every unabridged dictionary. Rushdie masterly wields his skillful pen, a reading of his phrases is a pure pleasure for a literary gourmet. His style is influenced by the Arabian tales of 1001 nights and - among modern writers- by famous 'magical realism' of Gabriel Garcia Marquez.The novel is an expression of author's genuine love to his native India. Rushdie weaves into the intricate lace of his story all important events in political, social and spiritual life of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh since the beginning of the century. But some of his interpretations are rather disputable (the reviews of readers from Eastern countries confirm this). In depiction of Indira Gandhi author's sharp mockery turns into blind hate, and the Prime Minister of India transforms into a real devil incarnate, a fiend that sterelizes midnight's children depriving them not only of their magical gifts but the hope itself. It is hard to understand such undisguised selective rage. The third part of the novel is the best one. Relating about the innumarable sufferings of his people in Indo-Pakistan conflicts and during formation of Bangladesh, Salman Rushdie reaches the highest and culminating point of his story.The novel is full of interesting images such as 'the perforated sheet', 'snakes and ladders' and - first and foremost - 'midnight's children'. All countries, that had passed through social disturbances and collisions, have known their midnight's children, a quixotic generation bestowed with their wonderful gifts but deprived of any possibility of their realization. Midnight's children dream that they are inseparably linked with the future of their beloved country, that they are its part and parcel with all its misfortunes and joys. They will be overcome by the persons without illusions but with hard elbows (or knees?) and jaws longing for power and money.The last chapter of the book gives the joyless and distressing picture of 'new' India after defeat of midnight children (one more image - &quot;Abracadabra'). But the protagonist, ending his story, leaves one empty pickle jar - a symbol of hope: the children of the vanquished are alive, they differ from their parents but nevertheless they ARE their children."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Claims of \\"Masterpiece! Bravo! C'est manifique!\\" and multitudes of roses gloriously wafting down from the expensive seats in the balcony are justified. This book made Rushdie a star. Rushdie who? Isn't he the guy who wrote that bizarre quasi-sci-fi novel about some birdguy? Yes, he is. And five years following that dabble (entitled \\"Grimus\\" which, to steal Hume's thunder, \\"fell deadborn from the press\\") Rushdie sprung some new fantastic oil reserve of novel writing and produced this utter gem. What a difference a mere five years can make!This is a thick book. It's a very thick book. Thick with meaning. Thick with stories. Is it about time? Sure. Is it about family? Yup. Is it a political book? Well, sorta. Is it about the vicissitudes of memory and history? Probably, yes, that sounds good. Is it about India? Oh, yup. A lot of India in it, sure sure. Its bulk is impossible to summarize to any degree of fairness. Its bulk in meaning is nearly incomprehensible. Still, it all comes down to the narrator: Saleem Sinai, who, equipped with numerous nicknames and adoptive parents, is pummelled and dragged and drained through India's independence. Having been born at the very stroke of midnight (or was that his rival, born in the same room, who was the real son of Saleem's unsuspecting first set of \\"parents\\") on the cusp and lip of India's independence, Saleem later finds himself, and 1001 other children (you guessed it, the \\"Children of Midnight\\"), imbued with magical powers beyond belief. The magic of India's independence from Britain shoots forth wonders. Of course the government under Indira Gandhi isn't too happy about this, and Saleem finds himself in a very bad sort of pickle later on. These scenes make up some of the more disturbing and violent chapters (and Rushdie was accused by some of being too hard on the Indira r&eacute;gime). Cover your eyes! Plug your ears!This is historical fiction at its best. There's much to learn about the history of India in these pages of pulp. Some familiar names will pounce out from the ink: Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi (no blood relation to the Mahatma; she was assassinated in 1984, four years after this book was published), Morarji Desai, Lord Viceroy Mountbatten, etc., etc., the names and history they encompass pile up page after page. Saleem and his family are also victims (very unfortunate ones) of the partition of India (into India, Pakistan, and soon after Bangladesh). This event still holds the record for most people moved from one place to another at one time: 14 million people (with about 1 million dead). Then war war war, more war war, and a state of Emergency, war war. Saleem is buffetted through it all, as countless millions were. The novel brings out the complexity and bulk of modern independent India through the voice of Saleem. Make some room in your brain for Rushdie's \\"many headed monsters\\".One of the best scenes is \\"the perforated sheet\\" in which a doctor, Saleem's Grandfather, is only allowed to examine a Muslim woman through a hole in a large sheet. One part at a time, no more, no less. One day he looks through the hole and sees a...Book three is a wild ride which will likely evoke the response \\"how did Saleem get here?\\" This book is Saleem's \\"rebirth\\" ending with the \\"Abracadabra\\" that changes everything; as book two is about Saleem's birth and childhood, and book one attempts to sum up the events leading up to Saleem's birth (the perforated sheet will haunt).Is Saleem an honest narrator, though? Or does he lie through his big teeth (and much bigger and talented nose)? This is one of the many tensions that rips through the novel, and questions and examines biography as well as history. Saleem only admits to lying once.The novel has some debts also. It owes a big one to \\"Tristram Shandy\\" written by Lawrence Sterne in the 18th century, in which an autobiographer attempts to write his life and keeps getting mired in digressions. Rushdie takes the best elements of this brilliantly bizarre book and meshes it into his own story of Saleem. Rushdie himself has acknowledged the influence of Sterne. Also, some have called this novel \\"India's 'Tim Drum'\\" with its parallel stories of nations with growing pains siphoned through single characters. Regardless of influence, \\"Midnight's Children\\" is an amazing novel rich with meaning, detail, humor, love, tragedy, childhood, family, philosophy, religion, sibling rivarly, and people people people people people people burgeoning out through the lines of text like on a crowded Mumbai street. There are, in short, people everywhere.This book is worth the effort. It may take a little more effort than expected. It's huge, it's complex, it's part history part fantasy. What it attempts to do, in a very human way, is posit meaning to events and lives and their very multifarious interpretations. It can all be found in cleverly labeled pickle jars. C'est manifique!"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"\\"...our physical alienation from India almost inevitably means that we will not be capable of reclaiming precisely the thing that was lost; that we will, in short, create fictions, not actual cities or villages, but invisible ones, imaginary homelands, Indias of the mind.\\" -Salman RushdieRushdie uses his characters to help develop these imaginary homelands. In turn they represent different aspects of India and the overarching ideas of the time. Saleem's memory and subsequent loss of it during the Indo-Pakistani war (where Bangladesh declares independence from Pakistan) is an example of the confusion of the social memory at that time. An example of this representation of Saleem as the memory of India, or that he represents India is the geography lesson where Zagallo says to the class about Saleem, \\"In the face of these ugly ape you don't see the whole map of India?\\"(231) They use his nose to represent the Deccan peninsula; the \`stains' represent Pakistan, \\"a stain of the face of India\\" (232). So Saleem's face represents the lands over which the wars are fought throughout the book. \\"In any war, the field of battle suffers worse devastation than either army. This is natural\\" (43), says Aziz in the beginning of the book, foreshadowing the suffering of his own grandson.Saleem seems to understand his own ostracism from his family even before he becomes aware that he is literally not of their blood. He resists falling into the same cracks as his grandfather early in the narration:Family history, of course, has its proper dietary laws. One is supposed to swallow and digest only the permitted parts of it, the halal portions of the past, drained of their redness, their blood. Unfortunately, this makes stories less juicy; so I am about to become the first and only member of my family to flout laws of halal. (59)One of the most memorable quotes of the novel:...maybe there is something unnatural about me, some fundamental lack of emotional response; but my thoughts have always aspired to higher things. Hence my resilience. Hit me: I bounce back (But no resistance is of any use against the cracks.) (396-397)Here he is resisting his family's ways, and the ways of his family's culture with the reference to his grandfather's admission of religion. Saleem addresses the cracks again at the end of the novel after his grandfather has died. He gives himself a piece of advice about his grandfather's ways on page 187 when he quotes \\"What can't be cured must be endured.\\" He is referring to the first page of the novel, when he introduces his grandfather:...he resolved never again to kiss any earth for any god or man. This decision, however, made a hole in him, a vacancy in a vital inner chamber, leaving him vulnerable to women and history. (10)Aziz becomes the splitting India figuratively. Aziz's education comes from Tai, early in the Novel, \\"From Tai, Aadam learned the secrets of the lake\\" (17). The lake represents older more violent ways, as Tai is known for his murder and drowning of European women who come to ride in his boat. Tai's resistance is more of a rebellion to Colonialism, if violent at that. Aziz absorbs these older traditions but maintains a newer generational understanding of his culture that he discusses in his marriage to Naseem. Before he marries her he comes to a symbolic realization about her (and consequently India):So gradually Doctor Aziz came to have a picture of Naseem in his mind, a badly fitting collage of her severally-inspected parts. This phantasm of a partitioned woman began to haunt him, and not only in his dreams. Glued together by his imagination she accompanied him on all his rounds, she moved into the front room of his mind, so that waking and sleeping he could feel in his fingertips the softness of her ticklish skin or the perfect tiny wrists or the beauty of her ankles; he could smell her scent of lavender and chambeli; he could hear her voice and her helpless laughter of a little girl; but she was headless, because he had never seen her face. (25)When Aziz marries her, he finds that the sex is disappointing. He says to her, \\"Forget about being a good Kashmiri girl. Start thinking about being a modern Indian woman\\" (34). He resists from saying for her to be a modern \`British' woman, even though India has not become independent yet, but refers to their own culture. Instead of taking his advice, Naseem does her own resisting that is seen in the rest of their marriage as a result.Naseem is called assiduous throughout the novel (especially on 67), a word that means, \\"Constant in application or effort; working diligently at a task; persevering; industrious; attentive: an assiduous student.\\" She resists the sexual education of her marriage for tradition, and claims power from it:It is a sign of power of this custom that even when her husband was afflicted by constipation, she never once permitted him to choose his food, and listened to no requests or words of advice. A fortress may not move. Not even when its dependants' movements become irregular. (41)The battle between Aziz's modernisms and Naseem's traditional ways culminates in a starvation war. Aziz sends about the children's religious instructor and Naseem refuses to cook for him anymore in rebellion. Aziz stubbornly refuses to eat anything else and wastes away. When Aziz becomes deathly thin, Alia and Naseem devise a plan and Naseem pretends to fall ill. Alia feeds both of them until everything is better and they have both reclaimed their pride. This domestic version of the impact of modern colonialism, the resistance and the reclamation mirrors exactly what was going on in many families and India at the time. It is hard to encapsulate the entire reality, as Rushdie has Saleem suddenly admit, \\"Is this an Indian disease, this urge to encapsulate the whole reality? Worse: am I infected, too?\\" (75). Saleem revisits his grandfather who has just found religion at age sixty-eight and finds Aziz:I saw the cracks in his eyes - a delicate tracery of colourless lines against the blue; I saw a network of fissures spreading beneath his leathery skin. (275)(Saleem recognizes these cracks as death.) Aziz tells his family of his religious experience meeting God,...although the details of the particular deity he had seen grew blurred in his mind, leaving behind only a passionate, drooling desire for revenge (which is also common to us both)...he would refuse to go to Pakistan (as Reverend Mother planned). (276-277)Aziz dies on Christmas Day, 1963. The allusions to muscular Christianity and Colonialism are not lost. Even when presented with this force in his old age, Aziz responds with resistance. Aziz has always represented the secular generation in the novel. When he gets rid of the religious tutor in the beginning of the novel he says to his wife, \\"He was teaching them to hate, wife. He tells them to hate Hindus and Buddhists and Jains and Sikhs...\\" (42-43). Rushdie himself admits that he is secular:I am a member of that generation of Indians who were sold the secular ideal. One of the things I liked, and still like, about India is that is based on a non-sectarian philosophy. I was not raised in a narrowly Muslim environment; I do not consider Hindu culture to be either alien from me or more important than the Islamic heritage. I believe this has something to do with the nature of Bombay, a metropolis in which the multiplicity of commingled faiths and cultures curiously creates a remarkably secular ambience. Saleem Sinai makes use, eclectically, of whatever elements from whatever sources he chooses. It may have been easier for his author to do this from outside modern India than inside it. (431)Even with the resistance of his own religion, Aziz succumbs to reclaim one before he dies. His openness to all religions shows that the idea of secularism transcends the nation of India, and Pakistan and Bangladesh and aspires to familiarize itself to the world. The religious, secular and resistant characters are Rushdie's way to signal that his characters transcend narrowly defined cultures.All of the characters in the novel, while transcending narrowly defined cultures are trying to come to and understanding about colonialism, resistance and reclamation. Rushdie's perception of the \`big picture symbolism' (which he reveals through his characters) is coming to an understanding about something from experience, and by doing so, coming to a consciousness of both personal and collective identity. Rushdie was able to see \\"the big picture\\" from his deracination from India as he writes the novel in England. The secular character in the novel, Saleem's grandfather Aadam Aziz, introduces this generation of secular thinkers. This school of thought then existed before the Independence of India, and the birth of Saleem. Secularism is one example of an idea that transcends the nation of India, and Pakistan and Bangladesh. This seems to be Rushdie's overarching objective: to leave us all with an understanding about something, and by doing so coming to a consciousness of both personal and collective identity. We must remember the events the characters and the history of this story for:\\"It may be argued that the past is a country from which we have all emigrated, That its loss is part of our common humanity.\\" -Salman Rushdie"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"If this book was described by 1001 readers, I think you'd get 10,001 different views of what they experienced. Some knowledge of the history of India & Pakistan before and after independence and the partition will be helpful. Perhaps some \\"-ism\\" (magical real(ism), coming-of-age(ism); post-modern(ism); stream of .....) reading would prepare you for this. But neither is required to enjoy it. Having read many of the less than stellar reviews, it seems that many had preconceived notions that weren't met or they tried to make it a fast read.This is not a \\"page turner\\" suspense novel; nor is it Joycean (or any other author's). It is Rushdie. This is what he writes and how he writes. Read it for its own style rather than trying to compare it with someone else.I think too much effort is made by publishers and reviewers to put authors into groups. I'm sure the publishers do it to capture buyers with \\"if you like A, then you'll like B\\". Reviewers too often do it to show how many authors they have read rather than making valid comparisons.Base your judgment of Rushdie (or any of his books) on what you like or dislike about his work rather than by \\"someone says he is like Marquez and he isn't, so I didn't like it\\"."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Much has been written about the unique writing style of Salman Rushdie and Midnight's Children. It is hip to like it and thus call oneself a literary, and not unusual to dislike it as an uninitiated reader who cannot possibly know what to expect a priori. For what it's worth, here is my attempt to characterize the style. The book is written as a \\"stream of consciousness\\", long long long sentences, side-by-side repetition of adjectives for emphasis (hint hint hint!), use of synonyms similes parellels without punctuation or separators (again for emphasis), revealing the plot's end-game in advance yet (or thus) engaging the reader in the path to getting there, repeated summaries each to make an overarching point than to simply recollect the story so far, admitted insecurity and intermittent defense of the story's believability, and did I mention rechristening of events and characters with metaphoric names. If you could read and follow the last sentence in one shot, you are ready to read and enjoy Midnight's Children. The story-telling is hallucinatory on the surface, but enlightened underneath; deliriously exaggerated on the surface, but scrupulously balanced underneath; grossly fatalistic on the surface, but hopelessly optimistic underneath; carelessly raw on the surface, but meticulous genius underneath.Never judge a book by its cover, judge it by its metaphors. Besides being one intense allegory, the book is a collection of the richest metaphors I've ever read in a piece of literature. Metaphors, mind you, and not its evil cousin, Analogies. Every event and character is first rechristened with its metaphoric name. In the process of writing the book, Rushdie has created a new vocabulary of words that become the best way (if not the only way) to describe those characters and events.Spoiler alert: To pick from this new vocabulary, one way of characterizing the life of Saleem Sinai, and therefore the book, is Sperectomy: the draining-out of hope. To quote the last sentence of the book that sums it up \\"...because it is the privilege and the curse of midnight's children to be both masters and victims of their times, to forsake privacy and be sucked into the annihilating whirlpool of the multitudes, and to be unable to live or die in peace.\\"Midnight's Children is a great way to live vicariously through post-colonial India. IfA Fine Balanceis a bus-ride through India with a good commentator, Midnight's Children is your dark roller-coaster with ghosts popping out at you at every turn. IfA Fine Balanceis real in a touchy-and-feely way that you wish it was unreal, Midnight's Children is unreal in a mystical way that you will hate to, and yet force yourself to believe it is real; just like a post-traumatic nightmare, only it was a re-enactment."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Dipping into controversial and expansive review of India's nouveau independence, Rushdie's autobiographical recitation (in fiction) of protagonist nasal-telepathic Saleem Sinai bestows lessons and conjures imagination.Some novelists have received acclaim for making allegory through adventure - Coello for \\"The Alchemist\\" or Kosinski for \\"The Painted Bird.\\" As great as those novels are, neither has the depth of review that this novel has. And, much to Rushdie's credit, this adventure intertwines with real events of the recent histories of India and Pakistan - thereby making it more relevant to those who lived or have heard about the many historical references contained throughout this book.Being an American usually means reading little about the history or culture of India. We are ignorant of their struggles - and this book enlivens us to a certain degree - such that the reader can conclude from reading this book that this country has struggled as greatly since its independence from Britain, than it did under British rule. Forster's portrait of British degradation of India in \\"A Passage to India\\" made westerners believe that Gandhi's plight was both necessary and inevitable. This book tells us that freedom from British rule did not necessarily deliver better karma or even sounder ruling. The \\"Emergency\\" of Indira Gandhi delivers an appalling caricature of Indians being cruel to Indians - as Saleem must be emasculated by the ruling party's dictate - for reasons no more discernable than the German holocaust or any other genocide.This book travels chronologically from Saleem's grandparents' romance to his 31st birthday. Saleem lives an incredible life -worthy of this book's size. His life - or really his son's life - is encapsulated in one sentence: \\"He was the child of a father who was not his father; but also the child of a time which damaged reality so badly that no one managed to put it together again; He was the true great-grandson of his great-grandfather. . .\\" It makes nonsense until you read the book - then this statement is both valid and true.Amid this adventure we meet snake charmers, a succubus wet nurse, a witch, a 512-year old prostitute - as well as typical western literature characters, e.g. a man who shoots his wife and her lover, a corrupt general, and a son who kills his father out of pure hatred.This is a thoroughly drawn portrait of a literary character. Amassing 445 pages in my hardback edition - each page having approximately 550 words - it is a long read. And, Rushdie's swirling writing style, where he touches upon a topic and a few paragraphs or pages later descends upon that same topic with more resonance or more detail, can leave readers feeling half empty at times as the complete description will not come to light until a later time. This is not a quick read. This is not easy reading. But, this is worthwhile reading.Rushdie writes with great literary style. Full of metaphors and complete with magical insight, this book is understandably incorporated by many universities' English departments"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"I have to admit I had a real problem with the beginning, it started out kind of slow. And there was also a bunch of characters, so many it was really hard to keep track of. But with careful reading, it went to to get more and more exciting, and after a while I simply couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"The premise of the book is just beautiful: the children born around midnight on the night that India gains independence from Great Britain all have special powers. One boy can jump through time at will. Another can change sex. The narrator can peer into others' thoughts, or at other times (surrounding an interesting plot device) can smell trouble through a remarkably sensitive nose.The book's style is addictive. The narrator liberally jumps into and out of his own story; he's reading it to his lover (Padma, a reference to Rushdie's own companion) as he rushes to tell the story before he disintegrates into 600 million pieces, as he foresees happening shortly.Since the entire basis of the story are these magical children, the book is necessarily part fantasy. (I've heard it compared to Garcia Marquez's \`\`magical realism&quot;, but I wouldn't know.) As a result, Rushdie can take frequent flights of fancy into events that wouldn't make sense anywhere outside of Midnight's Children. But it's all totally believable, because these children are all magical in their own way.Midnight's Children is Rushdie's way of describing India as he sees it. To him, the nation is part fantasy, part reality, part horror story. Some of the horrific events in India's postcolonial past come off sounding unbelievable, which is why they fit into the fantasy-fiction construct so well. One wonders throughout, \`\`Is this real, or is this India?&quot; In this way, Rushdie's postmodern flights of fancy aren't just stylistic wankery; they serve a meaningful purpose in the plot.This is certainly one of the most beautiful books I've ever read. I went immediately from Midnight's Children into One Day In The Life Of Ivan Denisovich by Alexandr Solzhenitsyn, which is something like moving from six years of filet mignon into a day of cold gruel. Nothing's wrong with Ivan Denisovich, but the stylistic differences are mighty. I can only recommend that you read them sequentially; you'll see what I mean."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Rushdie is obviously a master writer and shows his skills in this long, expansive and creative piece. I'm a fan of the magical historical fiction style and have read Marquez and plan to read Grass soon; not a big fan but I like the style well enough. I wish it was book a bit shorter (I am a slow reader), but the scope and range of the work (from tragedy to comedy and back) along with it's historical reach make it a very good read. Whip out your dictionary on this work too, it certainly expanded my vocabulary."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Saleem is born at midnight at the very moment India gains its independence. Thus, he is connected to his nation right from the start, as are the 1001 children born during that magical hour. Saleem sets out to preserve his story and finds he cannot separate his history from his country's history. Nor can he leave out the stories of the other children of midnight. Rushdi's book is long and complex, and sometimes it is tough to get through. However, it is not one of Penguin's Great Books of the 20th Century without reason. It is an analysis of self and nation and history and truth. An excellent work of fiction, to say the least."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Just like all Rushdie books, MC requires a good deal of attention from the reader. But with good nurturing, this will be your favourite book. The tale of Saleem Sinai from his grandfather's youth to his old age spans the modern history of India. His fate is entangled with that of the country, his complexity reflects the problematic political state.I was lucky enough to be in India as I read the book, and that enabled me to get more out of his local terms and customs. So I believe it'll help to be familiar with the country.Rushie's play on words, observations and blurry fact and fiction make this an R-rated fairy tale. DO NOT miss this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Okay, so some people may have a problem with the &quot;Indian-ness&quot; of the book. The book is not a history text, nor is it a report on India, it is a work of fiction! The writing is beautiful, the story is mesmerizing, and it is a terrific, entertaining, and thought provoking read."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"The children in question are those hundreds of infants born at midnight on August 15, 1947 - the precise moment at which the independent Indian nation state came into existence. They all have supernatural gifts, but few more so than the narrator, Saleem Sinai, blessed (or cursed) with the enormous nose of his presumed ancestors which gives him the gift of telepathy, the ability to \\"sniff out\\" what others are thinking. But he is not his father's son. Switched at birth with another baby, Saleem is a Hindu child raised by wealthy Muslims. This book is his written record of Indian national history from 1910 to 1978, through its concordances with his own family life - an expression of what Rushdie calls \\"the national longing for form\\", the obsession with correspondences and similarities. We follow Saleem and his riotous extended family through the partition of India and Pakistan, the ascendancy of \\"The Widow\\" Indira Gandhi, war, and, eventually, the imposition of martial law. As Saleem discovers, \\"midnight has many children; the offspring of Independence were not all human. Violence, corruption, poverty, generals, chaos, greed and pepperpots ...\\" Readers familiar with the history of twentieth-century India will find this more enjoyable than most, as much of the pleasure here lies in the way Rushdie folds national-political events into Saleem's experiences using four modes of connection which Saleem helpfully describes midway through - active-literal, passive-metaphorical, passive-literal, and active-metaphorical. The other pleasure is Rushdie's language, which is rich and complex (however there were times when I found his rhetorical style almost tedious). Fortunately, this is a very funny book, taking many of its cues from Bollywood cinema, and it's also quite acidic: part comedy, part angry polemic, it's a an odd combination but the result is a wonderful piece of literature. This is a book you will probably read several times in your life and enjoy in new ways with each encounter."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"The subject matter and vocabulary in Midnight's Children are unfamiliar to American readers, and Salman Rushdie loves his flashbacks and digressions. So this book is tough going for much of the way. Somewhere near halfway through the book, you begin to recognize the different threads of the plot and the book begins to make more sense. At this point, you want to begin marking up every page with cross-references and notes, to keep track of what is going on. I would say that this book is a good subject for study but I'm not sure that it's a good read. In fact, I'm not even sure it can be read, in the usual sense of the word, by most people outside India.But it's worth the effort to try. Midnight's Children is an intense and revealing exploration of India's culture and politics, mixing factual information (\\" . . . although there is considerable disagreement about the number of 'political' prisoners taken during the Emergency, either thirty thousand or a quarter of a million persons certainly lost their freedom.\\"), humorous observations (\\" . . . the water shortage had reached the point where milkmen could no longer find clean water with which to adulterate the milk . . .\\"), and wildly imagined events (a communist snake charmer induces a pair of cobras to act out a rich man refusing to give alms to a beggar, police harassment, hunger, disease, and illiteracy). The narrator is Saleem Sinai, a man born at midnight on the day of India's independence. His destiny, of course, is closely bound up with that of his country. He and one thousand other \\"midnight's children,\\" alternately influence the course of history and are influenced by it in all sorts of improbable ways. In tracing Sinai's life, Rushdie finds occasion to comment on scores of important developments in India's history."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Salmon Rushdie may be most famous for \\"Satanic Verses\\" and the subsequent death warrant it earned him from Muslim fundamentalists. However, his previous book, \\"Midnight's Children,\\" is a genuine reason for fame.Simply put, the book is outstanding in almost every way - well written, plotted and characterized, it contains a whole kaleidoscopic world. However, it is Rushdie's gift for metaphor (especially in a political context) that sets him apart. Not since Nietzsche in \\"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\\" has metaphor been so sharp and multifaceted. It truly takes on a level that few other authors can reach.The plot certainly does owe something to the Bombay movie industry, however the final result is much more than a Bollywood musical. In fact, it made me (whose knowledge of India admittedly was mostly limited to movie portrayals) rethink my happy-go-lucky view of that country as a place where everyone ate well, sang about love and occasionally rode an elephant. What a fascinating introduction to an equally fascinating culture and uniquely Asian melting pot!Perhaps the most lasting concept to come out of the work is the illusive need for personal centrality. We all want to be the center of not just our own individual worlds or lives but the entire world. It's the subjective striving for universality that truly leads to tyranny and despotism. Fascinating!This connects the text with Derrida's post modern theory of the unsustainability of centers, too. Why is it that only America ignores these themes preferring instead to concentrate on titillation and culture alone?In any case, \\"Midnight's Children\\" is an exceptional work of fantastic realism that keeps you thinking as well as guessing about another culture as well as human nature, itself."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"I wanted to read a Rushdie book and I've heard this book being called the \\"Booker of the Bookers\\" (referring to the prize). Rusdie's writing may be poetic and beautiful, but it is hard to trudge through this fairly long book. Furthermore, Midnight's Children is not particularly educational as far as Indian history and culture. The author may deserve his great reputation for his writing style but don't expect to be entertained.Reading this book made me feel like I was back in highschool and reading a required book for English class. My apologies to literature lovers who may consider me a philistine."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This novel was really awful. Terribly slow, terribly boring, just plain terrible in general. ***spoiler alert*** Rusdie even knows it is terrible. Six pages from the end of the novel, where you are \\"finding out the mysteries\\" that the narrator has been \\"holding until the right time\\" he takes a 17 inch crap in front of the reader. By the way, there is nothing revealed really, the whole novel is just one long drawn out promise of SOMETHING happening, and then nothing happens.There is some wit in the novel, but it is tedious and excruciating rather than entertaining. Rushdie thinks it is cute to describe things or events or feeling as a string of words without punctuation. I will give an example: This novel is boring tedious obnoxious. That last example makes me feel like I should win a Booker prize.Every character in this novel is annoying. Every event is intended to confuse and reduce the reader's pleasure as they are reading it.I don't understand why this novel is so heavily regarded. I feel like it appeals to the more pretentious reader that thinks it is neat when the real is mixed with the fantastical, and then repeated over and over again. Every puzzle is just revealed after it has occured, so there is really no reward in understanding the author's cleverness. The narrator keeps telling us to \\"listen carefully\\" because he is going to tell us something important, but there is nothing important in this novel at all. It doesn't break any new ground, and it certainly isn't entertaining. It is also not interesting or intelligent. Though it is very frustrating to read, for when the reader works to understand it, the reader is not rewarded with anything. Except for poop, right there on page 527 out of 533, Salman states right there and then \\"You finished my book, and now I am taking a big old poop. That is what you get for getting to the end. Aren't I funny!\\"Rushdie has a fatwa out on him for writing \\"Satanic Verses\\". Why doesn't anyone want him dead over this book?"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This book is as close to perfect as you can get.Worth noting, the Mistry book, A Fine Balance, while good, is basically a full on rip off of this book. If you want the original, read Rushdie. Mistry should be ashamed. His is not even a different take, it is just another take of the same image and not as good."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Midnight's Children is a fantasy voyage into the world (and underworld) of modern Indian life. Rushdie seems to relish in introducing whimsical characters and side-stories to balance the rather disturbing elements of Indian(/Pakistani) society.Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find Midnight's Children to be a masterpiece. It often becomes a tedious read as Rushdie seems to elaborate on his characters into needless detail. And the fantastical elements of the story are, well, a bit over the top. Having said this, this book is a must read for people who are fascinated with modern India (..such as myself).While comparing novels is a dangerous (and unfair) game, I have to recommend Son of a Circus by John Irving over Midnight's Children. Both share the same overall theme (story on modern India without taking itself too seriously), with Irving's novel being a much better read (funnier, less fussy on details, generally easier to read)."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Midnight's Children is certainly an interesting read, and I admire Rushdie's attempt at writing a very different type of novel. I will spare you the novel synopsis, as others have probably gone to great lengths to recap the story. Keep in mind, that the story does flip back and forth in the memories of the writer (which is different from Rusdie).I didn't particularly like the Satanic Verses and I read this novel for a class on Expatriate Literature. As Expatriate Literature goes, this was a great exploration of the theme.Well worth reading."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"I was expecting much from this book not having read Rusdie before. I have came away slightly dissapointed. The first few chapters lived up to my expectations with excellent word play and metaphors but overall I found the style this book is written in detracted from the novel. I also found the book too fantastical. I am a hug fan of God of small things so I did not expect the different style to bother me but unfortunately it did. THis is still a good book though &amp; due to the previous reviews there is a good chance that I am missing something ! Perhaps a second chance wouldn't go amiss."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"There's a good 200-250 page novel in here; the question is whether or not you're willing to slog through nearly 600 pages to find it. The biggest problem I had with this book is that Rushdie apparently thinks his reader is an absolute idiot who must be led by the hand across even the most obvious metaphorical thresholds. It speaks volumes, I think, that the reader surrogate here is the lumpen, dim-witted Padma, seated fawningly at the narrator's feet while he writes. Yes, I know we shouldn't conflate the author and the narrator, but it's hard not to think that Rushdie shares more than a little of Saleem's condescension toward his reader. At least Rushdie has the courtesy to warn you on the first page -- \\"Oh, spell it out, spell it out.\\" That he does. It's an interesting story, but the tedium of the overbearing narrator just sunk it for me."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"The ideas behind this novel are very creative and promising however the actual story drags more than once. The last third of the book is slow and boring then rushed at the very end as if Rushdie lost interest himself. I was enraptured for the first half and yawning for the second. I'll pass on seconds."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Discount the 3 stars, because what I really mean is 3.5 stars. Althought not the great work of literature that many believe it to be, it is still a good book that is well worth reading. It has a compelling narrative and Rushdie is talented storyteller. The story is what is really worth getting into here, but the main problem is with its style, and that is what makes it not great literature. Quite frankly, Rushdie just doesn't seem as talented at getting his story into written form as he is at having the story itself. Rushdie seems to be trying to do for India what Marquez did so well for Colombia with \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" but heproves hampered by numerous stylistic mistkaes. The most glaring and overarching problem with this book is how Rushdie tries to incorporate magical realism. \\"Midnight's Children\\" attempts to utilize magical realism in a looser, less fable-like tone than that used by Marquez. While noble in intention, the style that Rushdie uses simply proves to not be as conducive to this type of story-telling as the folkloric style of Marquez and various others. My other problems with the prose are most likely personal preferences, but there are many gimmicks that are used that I found to fall flat or to kill narrative tension (especially how the majority of the events are told many times before they happen so that by the time the book ends, I felt like I had read an additional 100 page epilogue summarizing what I'd read before). All of this can be tied the fact that prose seemed unduly messy. Not in a get-inside-the-narrating-character's-style messy, but a messy that cries out for a better editor. However, these complaints are easily overshadowed by the greatness of the story itself and in the compelling characters, as well as Rushdie's skill in weaving the story into the greater story of the book, that of Postcolonial India. Looking back over this, I think that three stars might be a tad too harsh, but I feel that the complaints about the prose and its inflated status as in the last twenty-four years warrant it as a warning of sorts. However, don't let the rating drive you away from the book, but also don't fall into the trap of overvaluing this \\"Booker of the Bookers\\" (as it was awarded) and take the book for what it is: a good story wrapped in poor wrapping."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"The first half of the book is a drag regarding his growing up stage. Seen along with Satanic Verses that had even a larger portion that was difficult to keep my attention, no more of Salman Rushdie for me."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"And so I've been there - in the depth of the jungle, in the thin air of the high mountains, I've been blinded by the blue, I've been dizzy with the thousands of whispers, colours, smells; I've felt the cold and the wind and the heat and the never ending showering rain - and above all, those extraordinary people: a pregnant woman stopping a crazy mob, a good doctor with a formidable nose, fakirs and politicians and military men, and midnight's children, so very much like me, and so different. This is Salman Rushdie's India to me: not just a foreign exotic country, it's but me myself - in a different form. It was a fascinating, unforgettable journey"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"If ever the world ends, and it was left to me to repopulate the planet, my progeny will all be required to read Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children.

(I was told this was a good place to start with Rushdie.) I admired very much the ambition of MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN. Rushdie is to be commended for trying to write a great book. He almost did it. The first half is really vivid and enthralling. Rushdie's prose is truly winged. However, somewhere about halfway through the novel (about the time the narrator leaves Pakistan), I lost interest and the rest of the book became a chore to finish. There really wasn't much of a payoff either, considering all the time invested in reading such a thick book. I think MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN would have been a much stronger book had it been pruned by at least a third. There were also too many loose ends for my taste. I'm glad I read the book though, and I think I have a pretty good idea of Rushdie's strengths and weaknesses as a writer now. It's not a bad book, but it's far from being a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This review essentially deals with the author Salman Rushdie rather than this book, because after all Midnight's Children is the 'Booker of Bookers', what more can one add? - except to state that if you are preoccupied with 'magic' then you have spectacularly missed the point of this book. The allegorical nature of its construction, its metaphors and its historical dramas are what is important here; its allusions and not any apparent wizardry. As my title said, this most certainly is not Harry Potter for readers and I wish reviewers would stop wasting their words on that topic and instead re-read and re-examine the core themes, dramas and constructs of what is undoubtedly one of the greatest books ever written.Salman Rushdie is to Literature, what George W. Bush was to American politics. Seldom has history witnessed individuals who possess such an ability to thoroughly polarize their respective audiences. Love or loathe, there can be nothing in between. For reference, my feet are firmly on the 'love' side of the divide.In continuum, one thing I personally find fascinating about Rushdie is his ability to alienate people in equal numbers to those he utterly enthralls. As per the aforementioned correlation there are those that he utterly repulses and repels and that fascinates me. What is the reason for this? It is fair to say that, that which we are able to 'read' (and by read I mean in the Mortimer Aldler sense of the word), is a direct reflection of our own intellect or lack thereof, and I sincerely believe that this is one reason why Rushdie irritates so many people. He irritates people because most people are not that bright and are not really 'readers'; not actually literate per se. What I mean by that last comment is that people no longer seem able to concentrate on a book (or much else besides television), or to dig for deeper meaning; to read between the lines and to grasp allegory and metaphorical allusions. In today's world of get-rich-quick everyone wants to be Eric Clapton but no one wants to put in the hours, henceforth people buy 'Guitar Hero'. Life is not a game of 'Guitar Hero'.It's interesting to draw parallels between Rushdie and another English author, Stephen Fry. Fry is also an intellectual heavyweight with a wonderfully sharp and agile brain and an extensive vocabulary. Unlike Rushdie, however, Fry is big and cuddly, has round edges and not sharp corners and I think that is one reason why the public take to him more easily. Besides which he is also flawed and slightly imperfect; he reaches out to us where Rushdie pulls away. To Fry's non-threatening modelling-clay persona Rushdie is perfect, unforgiving and cold, a statuesque individual carved from the hardest granite. One can't also help but feel that perhaps Rushdie's ethnicity rubs people up the wrong way, or is that just a cheap shot on my part and merely an easy way to find an answer to my question? One cannot help but wonder, though, if it isn't hard for those outside the liberal Literary establishment to accept a man of colour is more brilliant, better educated and ore mellifluous than they could ever hope to be. Again, that might just be smoke-and-mirrors, a cheap shot on my behalf, a quick-fix to a more complex quandary.To return to my second paragraph, I personally adore the fact that I have to read Rushdie with a green highlighter in hand (green is my colour for unknown words). I adore the fact that Rushdie crushes my ego, and belittles my vocabulary. I love the fact he challenges me to become a better reader to widen my vocabulary. I love the fact that Cambridge-educated Rushdie has a higher intellect than I, because he is SUPPOSED to have. An author (like any artiste) should ideally not be an everyman, should not be a Stephen King or a Jeffery Archer. Authors of Literature should shoulder the responsibility of raising the bar and challenging our collective consciousness, and Rushdie relishes that opportunity and performs that rle admirably, a perfect casting.If you don't get the beauty and elegance of this book, then you simply have not understood it and I sincerely urge you re-read it, preferably with a green highlighter in hand!"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"The first time I tred to read this book I got about one third of the way through. It didn't hold my interest. I liked the writing style sometimes, but it didn't seem to be going anywhere. Then I tried again. This time I found it much easier, but I was still sometimes bored, and I was not sure why this was such a great book. Finally, I started nearing the end, and I began to figure out what this book actually was. It wasn't so much some particular thing in the book at that point as the entire narrative starting to cumulatively come together.This book is a masterpiece, entirely deserving of the Booker Prize it won. It gives one a sense of Indian history--not the country as a whole, which would be boring and impersonal, but as lived by the protagonist, Saleem. (And presumably by Rushdie, who is almost the same age--though the novel as a whole is certainly not autobiographical.) The humor, joy, tragedy, and anger all work. This was the first book of Rushdie's I read. It will not be the last."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"While Salman Rushdie released in the mid-seventies a book called GRIMUS that bombed and promptly went out of print, it was his 1980 work MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN that catapaulted Rushdie to international attention and really started his career. Winning first the Booker Prize, and later the \\"Booker of Bookers\\" (that is, the best of all novels to win that British prize), MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN is a tale of India from the beginning of the 20th century to 1977 that holds a mirror up to history.Narrated by Saleem Sinai, born on the stroke of midnight on the August night in 1947 when India officially became independent, MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN begins with the history of his grandparents in Kashmir and then alludes to the killings of practioners of Gandhi's civil disobedience by British occupiers. Rushdie builds up considerable suspense as the timeline of his narrative approaches Sinai's birth. Afterwards, the novel deals with Saleem's upbringing, his coming of age, and a stint in Pakistan's army before returing to the heart of India. While the book could have used a more energetic editor and some parts drag, the final 200 pages of MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN make it entirely deserving of the heaps of praise showered on it so far.There are elements of magical realism in MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN, but often with a characteristically Indian twist. All of the surviving members of the 1001 children born at midnight of August 15, 1947 have special powers, in Saleem's case it is a form of telepathy that allows his to bring together telepathically the children of midnight in a conclave each evening. Towards the end of the novel Saleem encounters practioners of magic influenced by Hindu mysticism that impacts the plot immensely. But alongside the magical elements is astute commentary on the reality of modern India. Rushdie's tendency to always look at Pakistan (and Bangladesh) and India together, in spite of lines on a map, gives an interesting perspective to the culture and politics of the region.While Rushdie is always an entertaining author, his tendency to take an absurd amount of elements from other works of literature sometimes dilutes his originality. Much of MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN is taken from Gunter Grass' novel THE TIN DRUM, a book with which Rushdie claims inspired his to begin writing. Like Oskar Mazerath, Saleem Sinai is a young man of questionable paternity who has special powers and remains aloof from the madness of his age as he reports it. Saleem, just like the narrator of THE TIN DRUM, follows his mother to a cafe to watch an adulterous meeting, and instead of a tin drum Saleem refuses to be parted from a silver spitoon. While all authors are influenced by their predecessors, I found MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN to be far too unoriginal at times. Rushdie's later work is much better in this respect.I find THE SATANIC VERSES to be Rushdie's finest novel, and would recommend that to anyone who has not read his work before. It's a brilliant and excellently constructed roller-coaster (and I say that with no hyperbole) of a novel that is all the more important because of its impact on East-West relations of the late 80's and early 90's. After reading that, MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN is a good choice for further Rushdie."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Ok I've re-read this book eight times, since the age of fourteen. I think that's why it took me till the sixth time to realize the book was about India, from Independence upto the 1970s. 'Midnight's Children' refers to that generations of Indians which lived right after independence, i.e. 1947. So-called because it was at midnight, 15th August 1947 that India(and Pakistan + the about-to-be Bangladesh) were born out of British India. It tells the story of Saleem Sinai who was born on Midnight, Independence day, and whose life is tied to that of his country's. Along with Saleem, another son was born almost at the same time: Shiva. These two represent the two different sides of India that are so familiar: Saleem represented the affluent, British-educated cosmopolitan and tolerant India. Shiva, represented the hungry-starving dog-eat-dog India, and how those two grew up together, separated, yet tied together. Plus all the hopes and dreams which were assocaited with the formation of this new India, the \\"tryst with Destiny\\" e.t.c. With the actual history of India as the backdrop. Saleem was one of many 'Midnight's Children', another name for India's democracy, and parliament. And goes on to show how Indira Gandhi neutered them (she declared a National Emergency, declared martial Law, and brought on the onset of disabling Socialist policies, the effect of which are still being felt). The book is written very well, but some of the Indian references will go over non-Indian readers' heads. Also, the state of India as Rushdie describes it is correct for the late 70s and early 80s, and has no bearing on the India of the 90s onwards. I think it's time to write a novel on Midnight's Grand-children, to the see the sparkling changes they are making on their nation. This book is only for people who have a significant interest in India. Not for the casual reader, and not a book to read for anybody who wants the most up-to-date story on India. Unfortunately there isn't a novel on that as of now."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"While prolific at times, there is too much \\"borrowing\\" from other authors, which I found upsetting. Particularly Marquez's use of \\"butterfly imagry\\" and the non-stop sentences. Can't we be a little more original? This really irritated me. I plowed through this book, and found some parts flowing and well written, while other parts were forced over exaggerations, and very pretentious on the authors part. Don't know how I ever managed to finish it, but was glad when it ended, leaving me with very little (I read it in India, but that didn't help). While an Indophile, I tend to read everything Rushdie anyways, and feel he doesn't come into his own until \\"The Moors Last Sigh,\\" which I really loved. I am now busy with \\"Ground Beneath Her Feet,\\" which so far (and I just began), has a bit of immaturity and silliness to it, but I'll give it a chance. I feel \\"Midnight's Children\\" is a bit disjointed and its \\"brilliance\\" is very inconsistent."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"In 1981, Salman Rushdie published Midnight Children, a novel that one can say belongs to the genre of magic realism. Though the genre has been totally dominated by Latin American writers --Garcia Marquez, Juan Rulfo, Isabel Allende, and Laura Esquivel-- the Indian author Rushdie holds his own.Not only does he use magic realism --the fantastic, the magical, the strange-- as a useful technical tool, but he transcends it to portray the almost unreal and surreal dimensions of the Indian subcontinent. And much like the Latin American writers, he brings a magic and refreshing view of the effects of colonialism.Though far from being a work immersed in social realism alone, Midnight Children, contains a great deal of parody and satire of India--but all done with artistry. Given to paradox and the absurd, it is hard at times to tell the serious from the comic. All in all we can say that humor prevails. And when we are in doubt we accept that the author means well and we read his humorous antics with goodwill--much as we do with Lawrence Sterne's Tristram Shandy.For those who are language-oriented, the novel owns a treasure of hyperbole, similes, and metaphors: as when he refers to \\"pickles of history.\\" Pickles, for those who like them and eat them, leave a sour taste in your mouth, just like some episodes of Indian history.To present his own interpretation of reality, Rushdie tells us that \\"Sometimes legends make reality, and become more useful than the facts.\\" And he goes on the insert a series of tales and legends within the novel. Saleem, the busy and tireless narrator, is an almost incredible character. No sooner has he told us a few verities than he quickly jabs at us with exaggerations; no sooner he treats a fact than he contradicts it; no sooner he falls asleep than we see him acting in real life; no sooner he awakes than we know he's dreaming. And if that wasn't enough, the witch Parvati changes Saleem into an invisible being for some time. Ah! What a fine writer can do with language!When Saleem says:\\"Midnight has many children; the offspring of Independence were not all human. Violence, corruption, poverty, generals, chaos, greed, and pepperpots.... I had to go into exile to learn that the children of midnight were more varied than I--even I--had dreamed.\\" (333)Three points catch my attention: the enumeration of abstractions is capped with one concrete noun--pepperpots. On the surface this is an innocuous juxtaposition, but on deeper scrutiny we can see that Saleem is appealing to our sense of taste and smell, for pepper can be pungent and explosive. Just as we chuckle at \\"pickles of history,\\" we smile at Saleem's magical nose (or perhaps divine as in the elephant-headed god Ganesh): \\"Using my nose (because although it has lost the powers which enabled it, so recently, to make history), it has acquired other compensatory gifts....\\" Next, we can only imagine how psychotic the other children could be to outdo Saleem. And next, we are confronted with the problem of chaos.As readers, we are forced to keep track of time; a task that is easier said than done. Time in the novel is circular, fragmented, mythical, and cyclical--never linear. I cannot help thinking that all this is deliberate to simulate the chaotic societies that form the Indian nation.Much of what was prophesied of Saleem --a symbol for India-- has come to pass:\\"Newspapers shall praise him, two mothers shall raise him.! Bicyclists love him, but crowds will shove him! Washing will hide him- voices will guide him! Friends mutilate him- blood will betray him! Spitoons will brain him- doctors will drain him- jungle will claim him - wizards reclaim him! Soldiers will try him- tyrants will fry him. He will have sons without having sons. He will be old before he is old... And he will die....before he is dead.\\"With one exception: India will never die, for very much like China, India is a thriving force and the economic heart and pulse of the planet. Not only is Salman Rushdie a true child of Scheherazade's, just like her he will also go on telling stories to go on living one more day.The only writing guide I consult to write my articles is Mary Duffy's Toolbox for Writers, which amazon.com sells."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Midnight's Children skyrocketed its author Salman Rushdie to fame winning him a Booker Prize. The novel has since been named the best novel ever to win a Booker. it was written in 1980 having every promise of becoming part of the English literature canon of great literature.The book is long, dense, magic-realistic and episodic. Like David Copperfield the Bombay born narrator states he was born! Saleem Sinai was born on August 15, 1947 the very hour in which India gained her independence from Great Britain. Saleem is one of 1001 children born in this magical hour. All of the midnight children are granted special gifts. Saleem has a large nose and is able to smell better than anyone. He is also able to conjure up in his mind a meeting from time to time of all the midnight children! Saleem is born to a poor Hindu named Wee Winkie. A nurse switches the Aziz baby with Winkie so that Saleem ends up growing up in a well to do Muslim's doctor's home. Triumph but more often tragedy plague this family. Saleem's family is killed in the war between India and Pakistan. Saleem endures child abuse, poverty, impotence and sorrow . He meets many mentors especially women. His life's ups and downs mirror those of his native India in the first years of independence.Rushdie writes in a vivid style filled with the sounds, colors, smells and volatile emotions of the Indian and Pakistani people. A knowledge of the Muslim religion and the history of India will help the reader understand the complex plot. Each of the thirty chapters is a gem of narration which requires close concentration on the part of the reader.This book will not be to everyone's taste. It is a wild ride whose tour guide author is the brilliant author. Undoubtedly,much of the book is based on Rushdie's own youth in India. This book can be read allegorically and lends itself to rereading. It warrants discussion and analysis. An excellent novel which is probably the best fiction ever written on India!"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Midnight's Children is the epic story of post-colonial India. All of India, across all of India's children and also across time. Our fateful narrator is Saleem Sinai, a boy who was born on the stroke of midnight on August 15, 1947, the exact time that India gained its independence from Britain. He is destined to always be exactly the same age as his homeland. In some sense, he represents the whole country.Who is Saleem Sinai? Well in his own words from the novel,\\"Who what am I? My answer: I am the sum total of everything that went before me, of all I have been seen done, of everything done-to-me. I am everyone everything whose being-in-the-world affected was affected by mine. I am anything that happens after I've gone which would not have happened if I had not come. Nor am I particularly exceptional in this matter; each \\"I\\", everyone of the now-six-hundred-million-plus of us, contains a similar multitude. I repeat for the last time: to understand me, you'll have to swallow a world.\\"And from that, you get a sense of the grandiosity of the novel. No doubt, Midnight's Children is a challenge to read. No doubt, the narrative style is disorienting at first. No doubt, you will get bored when Rushdie waxes on for pages about a nose. But for some readers, like myself, it will have been a magnificently worthwhile read, a difficult uphill climb with the most astonishing views. The passages are beyond beautiful. The symbols are everywhere. The metaphors are endless. And the emotional impact is overwhelming.I absolutely loved this novel and am very grateful to have read it. I know it's not for everyone, but for me, it was intensely powerful. It showed me a new height of what can be achieved with literature as an art form."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Mr. Rushdie never disappoints.

Rushdie is the Shakespeare of our time."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"It is hard to categorize or pinpoint this novel's style. \\"Magical realism\\" comes to mind as a label, referring to the succession of supernatural and absurd situations, tightly enclosed within the cold reality of society and politics. But that same frame, as well as the personalized and introspective tone of the book, tie it too much to its specific context. For the same reasons, the adjective \\"epic\\" would be inadequate, even if Saleem Sinai's story is, playfully, the direct or indirect cause of modern India's historical landmarks. It reads like a novel from the Latin American \\"Boom\\" movement of the 1950's and 1960's, but it's not. In any case, it is a hard to follow novel but one that richly rewards the reader.The plot is most original and witty: Saleem Sinai is born exactly at 00:00 hours on August 15, 1947, at the same time as independent India. Within the following hour, some 500 kids are also born, who will be called \\"Midnight's Children\\" and who also will, each of them, posess a specific supernatural power. Saleem is born the son of a poor, wandering English musician and an Indian woman, but for mysterious reasons he is changed places with the heir of a rich Muslim family, the Sinais. Saleems carries, then, an original sin. He is malformed and reclusive, a seemingly natural born loser form who, however, great wonders are expected, as the result of an omen given to his \\"mother\\", as well as a portrait in the newspaper and a letter from Nehru.The novel traces the history of Saleems's family, his wealthy childhod, and the moment of coincidence between his adolescence and his magical power: the ability to listen to people's thoughts, and so to influence, deliberately or not, the history of India.There are to many characters, anecdotes, and suplots to be summarized here, but it is worth remarking the general sense of self-flagellation, the vocation for sordidness, and the unhappiness of History. Kind of an anti-Harry Potter, or more like a tropical Oskar Matzerath (\\"The Tin Drum\\") or unhappy Tristram Shandy, Saleem is a memorable character, and the story is very rich, funny, sad, political, intimate, and many things more. Do not expect, of course, a strict chronological line, nor things making realistic sense.

Narrating his own story, Saleem tells his country's story, and that of the other 1,001 children who were born that day, and blessed with special powers because of their special place in history --not that it helped with their survival in many cases, but then nation-building is fraught with risks.Salman Rushdie, also fortuitously born in 1947, took to heart the classic advice to budding authors: write what you know. The result is beyond history, beyond testimony; it is art. He identifies the truth in the storytelling, or as he puts it: he liberates the truth from history.The book is tightly interwoven although at times it seems loose and meandering. Saleem's faithful companion Padma speaks for the reader and urges Saleem to get back on track. My favorite aspect of the writing was the sensual quality: it is tremendously atmospheric, and permeated with considerable wry humor. The imagery is rich and resonating. Nothing is gratuitous. Every detail, every description, has either symbolic or historical relevance. This is what sets Salman Rushdie apart from writers who can spin a good yarn and keep the reader engaged, but who have no sense of literary construction, not to mention history.History is the main theme of the book; personal history, the nation's history, and the need to create one's own history. History has cracks, it comes together and disintegrates, memory is faulty. But overall, history is always invented and it depends on who is doing the telling.\\"Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans\\"One aspect that several people at book club mentioned as being difficult was the fact that this is the kind of book that must be read while paying close attention; you can't skim through it or else you will miss key information. Often Rushdie will offhandedly toss out a fact, or mention an event, and then 20 pages later (not just one or two pages) it will be revealed that the aforementioned detail was a key turning point in the life of a character or the country.Rushdie plays freely with the supernatural (ghosts, but are they?), oral storytelling, voices, prophecies, Christian, Muslim, and Hindu religious conventions, melding them into a unified, if surreal, whole. The priests are instructed to tell their Indian Christian converts who might be concerned about whether they will be accepted into Heaven if their skin is darks: Tell them that Jesus is blue as the \\"Hindu love-god, Krishna, is always depicted with blue skin. Tell them blue; it will be a sort of bridge between the faiths.\\" This is a Solomonic solution rife with absurdity. Upon being told that Jesus is blue, Saleem's nurse Mary Pereira is indignant, \\"You should write to Holy Father Pope in Rome, he will surely put you straight; but one does not have to be Pope to know that the mens are not ever blue!\\"The multiplicity of voices was another aspect that was problematic for some readers. Events unfold simultaneously. We get to hear different voices speaking at the same time, just as Saleem hears the voices of the midnight's children in his head. This is the literary convention that Rushdie uses to express what the main character is experiencing, as well as representing the conflicting forces in the country.Midnight's Children is a book that is epic heroic, historic, and yet completely human and accessible, because for all its scope and grandeur, it is a story about life, as it unfolds and is told from the perspective of a fictitious narrator who reveals his world as he sees it, with his inconsistencies, frustrations, and memory lapses, but with the honesty of an inhabitant of the world he describes. He is no stranger to this land. And even though the readers of this book may come from widely divergent cultural backgrounds, the underlying humanity of the story is universal.This is one of the great novels of the 20th century, and the Man Booker Prize committee agrees: in 1993 Salman Rushdie was awarded the Man Booker Prize as the best book selected in the past 25 years. It is also one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Midnight's Children centers around the protagonist, Saleem Sinai, recounting the story of his life to his lover one night. In his life is the entirety of Indian post-independent history; in and on his body are the markings and symbols that relate to his country. He is a member of a group of people born the evening that Indian was freed from British rule, each person born with special powers elevating them from the rest of the population. This story at its core is of the parallels that Saleem (and his friends) shares with India, and what a most unusual story it is. This book is 560 pages of complete storytelling mastery. It is an epic of magical realism, fully deserving its comparisons with \\"The Tin Drum\\" and \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude.\\" Rushdie writes to the edges of the page and beyond, filling every sentence with originality and crazy invention that (wildly) has the control never to veer off into complete farce, which is indeed a gift. It is highly intellectual and complex, but written with deep humor and pathos, told by a narrator that continually holds the reader's hand to get them through the tough spots. The places that this book goes and the experiences it offers the reader could not be properly encapsulated in any review, so just note that it is worthy of all its praise and is easily one of the best books of the last century."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"He (salman rushide) displays a unique style of writing in his Midnight's children, besides being very playful with his words and sentences. His work is not structured like a typical novel - list of characters, a plot/suspense and a climax..In his view, after all this is a memoir, he describes how he has organized it. Each chapter is a jar of pickle. Has a raw material (character) and he adds the right amount of spices (characteristics) to make them irresistible.His characters die before they are born, he has no interest in suspense. While each jar focuses on one character, bits and pieces of other characters are added to enhance/enrich taste of the pickle in making, exhibiting different characteristics. After tasking all the jars, one is only left with awe of characters. they are seasoned so well that one can't be judgemental about them and this applies to both the major and minor. There is no good or bad. They are just there!Content however is common sense. He captures the pulse of South Asian families. (Indian/Pakistan/Bangladesh) across different economic statures and how they are affected by personal and political views of the day. He is exhaustive with the content (without being boring) that it is hard to notice anything missing from the book. (Of course there will be something missing, because it is a fixed edition and he acknowledges and convinces the reader that it is not his fault...)What exhaustive book, can be complete without asking the basic question...\\"Who what am I?\\". (Thats right, he plays with the words, makes his own sentences.)Now who can conjure a new answer to that, and yet has anyone answered this question yet? here he goes...\\"My answer (he says) : I am the sum total of everything that went before me, of all I have been seen done, of everything done-to-me. I am everyone everything whose being-in-the-world affected was affected by mine. I am anything that happens after I've gone which would not have happened if I had not come.\\""},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Midnight's Children is perhaps strange in that it is an immensely popular novel but is also very intellectual and even esoteric. The story is narrated by Saleem Sinai, who was born at the exact moment of India's Independence. He is a very self-reflective narrator, who lets us in on his own perspective on his story-telling, as well as telling us the reaction of his servant Padma who is also listening to the story and who affects it as well. There are many twists and turns regarding the relationships between characters; there are name changes, nick-names, false-starts. This is of course what Salman Rushdie is interested in.Rushdie has said that he thought this novel is about excess. You can see what he means as so much is packed into this novel and it is a credit to the author that he keeps this up all the way through (it took 5 years to write, apparently). But it also feels like it has been worked at, and requires a fair bit of working on the part of the reader. There are touching moments, and comic moments. These are genuine, but must be won by the reader who has to pay attention and keep up with the complexity of the novel.There is so much in this book that you notice new things about it each time you read it. Rushdie has said that he quite likes it when he comes across words from different cultures in books (e.g. Jewish phrases in Roth). It would be best if readers share Rushdie's view when reading Rushdie himself as there are all sorts of words and phrases here that are not all explained."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Rushdie's writing style is magic to read, and his words pull you into the stories he weaves. At some points in the book, you do start to notice how long it is, but for the most part, it's very enjoyable! I will read another of his books!"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Rushdie certainly stands out in style from other authors and that makes this book a refreshing change of pace. If you are looking for a quick and easy read, this isn't for you. This book, like many classics of the 20th century, has a complicated and convoluted storyline in places. His writing style can be difficult to follow at times as he doesn't follow the typical rules of grammar. As one reviewer indicated, you will enjoy the story more and get more out of it, with even a nominal understanding of some of India's culture and history. That being said, I found myself actually enjoying the story more in retrospect than I did as I was reading it. This book actually lived up to its hype but not in the way I expected."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"While I enjoyed the magical realism of the book and the exotic setting, I did not care for the characters. Feces run through this book. At one point, the narrator describes a man defecating into his own hand and proudly proclaiming the length of this fecal masterpiece. The beauty of the language is literally mired in filth."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Midnight's Children is a flamboyant account of the history of a boy, Saleem, who is intertwined with the history of a new country, India. He is born at the stroke of midnight carrying with him powers of telepathy that connect him to the other 1001 midnight's children that our born on the birth of India. The other children also carry gifts, changing genders, witchcraft, levitation, time-travel, etc.Saleem's nemesis, Shiva, was also born at the same moment but born into poverty and has the powers to resist Saleem's telepathic powers. In the book, we witness the growing pains of a new country and the ill-conceived notion of what these talented children try to accomplish - changing India for the better. Instead we witness the fragmentation of the new country and religious boundaries being drawn between the Indian (Hindu) and Pakistanis (Muslim) and Bangladesh (Muslim). Saleem's life and family are intertwined with the history of India, as the country separates and clash, the life and family of Saleem are also destroyed.This is the first novel I've read of Rushdie's after he performed a reading at the Chicago Public Library. He is clearly a talented writer, but I wish I was more in tune with Indian history and politics; some of the symbolism was over my head. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the book very much and plan on reading his new book that takes place in New York, Fury."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"There is little else to say. Rushdie provides a mystical portrait of independence. Make sure to read a book covering the history of India to gain a deeper understanding of this ever evolving land."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"I first read this novel in 1988.I was 15.I was entranced by its complexity and word play and the realism of its characters.I have read it five times to date, over a time span of 11 years. Each reading has given a different perspective, a different depth of thought and images that I had missed before. This is a novel of the intellect, for the intellectual and by an intellectual. Is it India? Yes. No. It represents the complexity and the clash of culture that is India."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Flipping through the reviews, I was amazed at the number of two and five star reviews. I came up with a possible explanation : either reviewers were Indian or very familiar with Indian culture (5), or they were not, and found the subtleties of Rushdie's language and the culture too difficult to negotiate (2). The book is a masterpiece, but requires a serious investment in getting to know India. If you fall in the first category of reviewer, it is a must read. If you are less familiar with Indian culture, you will still marvel at the beatiful language, but be prepared to be a little left out of the inside jokes."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"I have to say, I don't get this book. I struggled through the whole thing, but found the narrative turns annoying and the story somewhat disjointed. Obviously people much more qualified than I have deemed this a great book, but it just wasn't for me."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"I used this book in a graduate school course and was delighted with the story. What a great non-English/American piece of literature."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"It took a few chapters to get used to Rushdie's writing style. By the end of the book it really grew on me and I ended up enjoying the book. The writing has a negative tone, and all the events in the main character's life were foreshadowed - not the whimsical book I was expecting. Still a very good book and worth the read. I look forward to reading more of his work."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"My introduction to Rushdie was via his novel Shame. By the end of that novel, I was just enamoured with the man. Every one told me that the midnights children is his best work and I could only salivate at the quality of story telling that I would get from reading this book then. Afterall if this was supposed to be better then Shame, it had to be the best thing ever written (for me that is).Based on this assumption, I started reading midnights children but unfortunately where Shame took me 4 days to finish, this book took me over 3 weeks to read. The story is not very interesting though the character development and weaving was well done. The book does drag on sometimes and caused me to lose track of what the story was at certain specific points in the book.This is a 3 star book for me at best."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This is one of those books I tell everyone to read, and have read several times myself.

The story is linear, but the author is not and thats what makes the book brilliant.The story would be ultra bland were it not for Salman Rushdie's sheer brilliance & imaginative narration. There are many detailed reviews here.If you've seen Quentin Tarantino's movies, you know to expect the outrageous being paraded nonchalantly. Thats what reading this book is like. Its like watching a Tarantino movie only that the subject is drama!This book will test your patience with its size, but you wont forget it either.The book is dripping with awesome prose, satire and drama.Rushdie adds life to his characters in an amazing and ultra realistic way, each with their own flaws, idiosyncracies, way of speaking & thinking! This book is a must read for all book lovers."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"The three stars does not indicate any lack of ability on Rushdie's part, only my lack of connection. I can read an Eco novel and laugh myself silly because I have enough knowledge of his references to get most of the metaphors. Too late I found a website that promises to unravel Midnight's Children for Westerners without a background of Indian history and mythology - I think I'll try to read a bit of that as the days go on to see if I can get a better grasp on the novel I just read. I don't give up on Rushdie. I loved The Enchantress of Florence and the interviews I have heard with him have left me with the desire to read more of his stuff. If you're going to tackle Midnight, however, I'd bone up a little first.

Definitely the most enjoyable way to learn about the history of India since independence. It was hard to put down, even while traveling through distant and novel landscapes."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"The narrator for this book was Lyndam Gregory. This is the first time that I have heard him, but I thought he did a great job. I enjoy listening to books where it is obvious who is speaking by the characterizations done by the reader. Gregory did that extremely well and his accents, tones, and everything else he did with the voices of the different characters made this a pleasurable listening experience.This is the first time that I have read Rushdie and I enjoyed the novel. It was quite different than anything else I have read and I thought that the premise that the history of India was tied to the life of this boy was a fun concept. This is basically an historical allegory. The cultural milieu is quite different than what I am used to, but it gave me a new perspective. I found the introduction to this edition interesting when Rushdie talked about the lawsuit Indira Gandhi brought against him for defamation due to a single sentence about her personal life. Given how he made fun of almost all historical figures, it is interesting that she took it seriously enough to react that way; he must have really hit a sensitive spot.I highly recommend this audio book. It is a fun way to be introduced to Salmon Rushdie."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"I liked the story in this book.

I'm not much of a history buff, but I did enjoy learning more about India's recent history from Saleem's perspective. When I finished the novel, I was physically and mentally exhausted, more glad to be done than anything else, but, despite that, I am very glad to have read it. The story itself is not boring, but it does take a lot of time to get through, so I would not recommend reading this when you are particularly stressed or hurried (as I did), because you won't be able to get through it."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"In Midnight's Children, Salman Rushdie integrates self-awareness with national identity. He demonstrates brilliantly how the national events in which we live influences our perceptions and worldview, and how our subsequent reactions (emotional, actual) become integral to ourselves. As when Saleem Sinai is born at the stroke of midnight on August 15, 1947, and India becomes a free nation, each of us experiences the midnight effect of being born into a nation at the moment of our birth. We are very much the product of our culture and consequential political envelope. We devise our own interpretation of events and distort them in memory to serve an (ever-changing) identity that drifts in an illusion of permanence and reality. The intentional distortion of historic events by a multitude of political factions adds to the illusionary veil of reality so that our assertions of truth and fact are further clouded. Rushdie's mystic reality is a perfect method to portray the mysticism of India, yet surely serves as a cross-cultural illustration of the deep mysticism of the human condition. We are all a chimera of our conscious/unconscious perceptions, associations, emotional reflections, and memory. The outward manifestations of change due aging are held together by the content of our surroundings; a history of events and experiences, some verifiable by supporting accounts, others more fraught with illusion and fantasy.Midnight's Children carries the reader through a mirage of associations, reoccurring themes, and events - self-evolved by the selective recall of the author/character - in an intense reenactment of Saleem's life, a life portrayed within changing national backdrops, family, friends, loves and enemies, desires, fears, dreams, all melded in meaning and illusion. Are we the same at nine years old as at ten, or thirty, or sixty? Is vacillation in actions and convictions apparent, evident? The flow of existence is a continuity, a continuity of recalled events, external markers, and physical evidence; but of internal perceptions, beliefs, we have little empirical evidence to fall back on other than memory, a fallible proposition at best! We, like Saleem, are constantly adrift between these states.Saleem is gifted, as a result of his magical moment of birth coinciding with his India's independence, with \\"...the greatest talent of all - the ability to look into the hearts and minds of men.\\" This telepathy at an early age, however, leads to a combination of uncertainty, disillusion, and an unfocused call to action that ultimately results in a sort of observational existence, more a life of commentary and evasion than direction or goals. But maybe that's the point, direction itself is an illusion. The steps we take must surely be connected, yet the path that results is as much chance as fortitude. How were the hands dealt at birth determined? Why an estate rather than a slum, or a slum rather than an estate? It all seems real enough, until you read Midnight's Children and explore those assumptions."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This is my second experience with Salman Rushdie. I read Haroun and the Sea of Stories awhile back. I believe that I chose to read this after seeing it highly recommended in Nancy Perl's \\"Book Lust\\" lists. I am looking for novels that will engross me with a story, give me a characters that I care about, and have a narrative voice that I trust. Like Ellison's \\"Invisibile Man\\", one of my favorite novels, I found Rushdie's Midnight Children to create a compelling narrator whose voice lingers and reveals great truth about his nation and culture.Some readers may not care for Saleem Sinai. He's unreliable as a narrator. He's loose with time and sequence and foreshadows. He meanders. He is struck with his self-importance. I found all of the digressions and explorations of Saleem Sinai to give the book its character and spice.The premise of the novel is extraordinary. The concept of the magical Midnight's Children who are both all powerful and powerless in and India that is not accomodating to their powers is a potent allegorical device. Saleem's relation to his own gifts and his own connection to the fate of his nation is especially profound and I wish that I had more knowledge of history, especially the history of Pakistan, to be able to fully appreciate the scope of Rushdie's nation revealing efforts.Ultimately, this is a book that is as much about a family and for those readers who are not into the allegorical and political dimensions of the book I still feel that it is worth giving the book 25 pages or so and seeing what you feel about it. If you can appreciate Saleem's voice and the story of his grandfather that begins the novel, you will certainly appreciate the book when Saleem enters his story and the plot moves more consistently through his life. Even missing the political and allegorical dimensions of the book, this can be read as a meditation on how a supremely gifted child succeeds and fails to be fully embraced by his family.Midnight's Children sucked me in and was worth the effort to get through. I hope that you will be similarly blessed by this ambitious book.5 stars"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Salman Rushdie's voice is unique, and if you haven't read anything by him yet, Midnight's Children is a good place to start. Be prepared for intriguing characters, long flights of fancy, enough historical facts to keep the novel anchored in reality, and insightful comments on human nature.

I cannot help but contrast it with 'A Fine Balance' which I so recently read. Both are brilliantly written, inspiring books that intricately intertwine with India's tumultuous history. Yet they are as different as night and day. Midnight's children, although similarly passing through some quite dark hours of history, does not have the deflating, depression quality that the other book has. If anything Rushdie's writing shows symptoms of the 'disease of optimism' that his characters and his country so often succumb to in the novel. Despite the flawed narrator Saleem's neverending series of mishaps and his sense of inevitable doom, I couldn't help but feeling upbeat throughout this novel.Part of what makes this book so interesting is that it combines history with fantasy. Not just in the usual sense of historical fiction, but in a more magical, mystical sense. I won't go into detail but this makes this book a delight to read. The first person narration is quirky, racing forwards and backwards and admittedly suffering from errors of memory and chronology but never too off-beat so as to get confusing (or rarely so).Yet another book I highly recommend.

I wasn't sure whether this book was poetry or prose as I read it. Much like Faulkner's, Rushdie's words flow almost musically around his characters. Yes, you learn a lot about India and its independence struggles, but more importantly Rushdie pulls you into this swirl of magical characters, so much so that you don't want to leave"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"The book is magical - a blend of history and absurdity that yields profound insights into the human condition. Set around the independence of India, it affords the reader some insights into that sub-continent. Of course, many lesser forms, such as TV programs, do the same thing. This book goes far beyond that buoyed by its wonderful humor (I promise you won't forget the black mango or Saleem as a 10-year-old &quot;comforting&quot; his distraught and beautiful aunt. This book both celebrates and transcends time and place - while you will learn much about India and Pakistan, you do not need that knowledge to appreciate the insights into the human condition that come shining through. There is sadness and disappointment beneath all of the hilarity of Saleem's adventures, behind the irony of Rushdie's description of the Indo-Pakastani war in which &quot;only three bombs were dropped&quot;, but those three bombs killed nearly all his family in both India and Pakistan. This book will make you laugh out loud, sigh inwardly, and ponder the human condition. Midnight's Children succeeds at doing for the birth of India what Thomas Pynchon failed so miserably to do for the birth of the U.S. in Mason &amp; Dixon."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Excellent storytelling - with a mixture ofopinions, philosophy and history that is never boring, blended with endless surprises."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"A masterpiece of fiction, Midnight's Children is not to bemissed. Rushdie is the master of suspense, humor, drama and historyin this page-turner. Midnight's Children is chock full of illusion, humor, history, drama, mysticism and more....a full plate for many readers, and yet you cannot put it down once you enter the world of the protagonist, Saleem. Rushdie keeps you guessing, makes you laugh out loud, and provides small clues along the way through the birth of a nation, and the life of Saleem. Rushdie is never predictable, and neither is Saleem. The author has a definitive knowledge of not only India, Islam and the culture, but also of that which we call the human experience. His characters are real, and at times surreal. Saleem experiences life and the trials and tribulations with humorous hindsight, and the foundation of a culture unknown to many in the west. Of all of Rushdie's books, this is one that will definitely be the classic in the ages to come."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"So what was all the fuss about? The Book to beat all Bookers, the Booker of Bookers... a breathtaking, beguiling and even bulging book packed with words spun by a master of the written form - yeah, I liked it!Certainly, it's a bit of a plateful and a touch overcooked in parts, but this smorgasbord of a novel left me stuffed and satisfied at every sitting.Like Marquez with his 'One Hundred Years of Solitude', Rushdie captures a whole continent, a civilisation, as he takes us through the birth of the newly independent India, seen through the eyes of his protagonist, Saleem Sinai. He lays the story before you with a brilliance that dazzles and a style that leaves you wanting more.No indigestion tablets needed here, just a comfy armchair and a footstool to digest the often bizarre plot lines that pepper this feast of fiction. It's funny too, and that's what made it for me - that and the characters (especially Saleem), who are painted with a warmth and sympathy that makes them all the more endearing.I guarantee that as soon as you taste the starter you'll be drooling for the main course, and the dessert will just melt in your mouth. Don't rush it - sit back and enjoy this 'Midnight' feast"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"What a joy. This book is full of life and jokes and history. I frankly expected a chore when I picked this one up but it has been anything but that. I, too, had first heard of Rushdie after Satanic Verses and attempted to read a few pages of the that book at another book store. A few weeks later the Penguin Rep suggested Midnight's Children to me and it has been a wild ride ever since.Read it no less than a chapter at a time to get the full weight of the book"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This book is so beautifully written that I have to put it down afterawhile to take it all in. It's like a giant puzzle incorporatinghistory, politics, religion, and individual lives, and Rushdienever once loses a strand. It's rare that a book ishilarious and moving at the same time. Midnight's Children is a truemasterpiece."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"The first Rushdie I read, I encountered this book when laid up with a knee injury. My only knowledge of Rushdie was the infamous death threat; I assumed he was a serious (read &quot;non-fiction&quot;) academic. To my great surprise and delight, I soon learned that his wicked humor is what must be so upsetting to the overly religious. The incisive humor, the joyful use of language and the strong element of fastasy/magic... all conspire to create a great read. Still my favorite Rushdie. Bob Bingenheimer (design@bingenheimer.com"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This is the first Rushdie book I have read and it was unlike any other reading experience I have ever had. From the beginning, the prose leaps out from the page and smacks you silly until you think this book is more than just a book. Sentences and wordplay that you have to reread and think &quot;WOW&quot;.Every character is interesting and the plot never lets up. It might be beneficial to have some knowledge of Indian custom and language, but I don't think not having any would ruin the read.I love Naipaul for his economic style and realism and I love this book for the opposite reasons: its sheer wildness and fantasy.Absolute magic."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This magical, lyrical book will captivate you from the start. The language, the images and the prose are simply breathless. Though it takes about 150 pages to get into, the investment is worthwhile. I'll read this book in ten years time: again!"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Under a less skilled pen, this book would be a chaotic,jumbled, unreadable mess, with so many characters and subplots floating in and out. However, I am happy to report it works! It does have a consistent theme, mostly about one character's life, the \\"leader\\" of midnight's children, set against the backdrop of one of the most dramatic political real life dramas of the last hundred years. While this story also borders on \\"magical realism\\" at points, it never wanders so far off the map that you get lost, but you will have to pay attention.A classic!"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"If I wasn't completely convinced before that Salman Rushdie has a claim to be the most gifted writer on the planet, I am after reading this book.This novel is a generational saga along the lines of Gabriel Garcia-Marquez's \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" and Jeffrey Eugenides's \\"Middlesex\\". As those two novels reflect the history of their own respective nations, so does \\"Midnight's Children.\\" It is the story of one family, and one person in particular, Saleem, who is born on the stroke of midnight on the exact day and time India achieved its independence from Britain. From that propitious birth onward, Saleem's life becomes a reflection and representation of the young Indian nation itself.The title refers to the 400 odd children who were born at or near this same midnight. Each one of them have magical skills which vary in strength and importance in direct relation to their birth's proximity to midnight. Since Saleem was born exactly at midnight, he has the most valuable skill, the skill to look into people's hearts, minds, and souls, and to commune with the other midnight children mentally. In this vein, he forms the Midnight Children's Conference, a meeting of these 400+ children who communicate through Saleem's telepathic mind and have the stated goal of reforming India. If this sounds unbelievable, it is not. It is the same sort of magical realism fans of Latin American authors will be familiar with, and adds to the strength, beauty, and ultimate brutality of the story without making the reader roll his eyes in incredulity.As is India, so is Saleem. He hears the multitudinous voices of India in his head, a mess of contradictions: peace and violence, forgiveness and revenge, progress and tradition. His family also reflects the indefinable character of India. They are by turns real and fantastical, living and dying, perservering and escaping. The amalgam of these voices and Saleem's family is an India that Rushdie seems to understand no better than anyone else, but his affection for and frustration with India could only come from a native.The reader also follows Saleem's physical life. His face mirrors a map of India, and his enormous nose is gifted at sensing emotions. From the life of a rich boy in Bombay, to a fighter in the India-Pakistan War, to a broken carnival traveller, and finally to an owner of a pickle company, Saleem's journey through life is expansive, human, and always entertaining. The side characters are just as engrossing, and all have a part to play in the tumolt of Indian history.To keep the earlier analogy going, I found this to be a slightly more difficult read than \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" but just as entertaining as \\"Middlesex\\". Rushdie writes with wit, style, anger, and absolute brilliance. He is generous with allusions, but I felt they were also extremely accessible. I recommend this book not only to India-philes, but also to fans of literature in general. This is a master in peak and rare form, and this is one of the finest novels written in a generation. Most highly recommended."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"When I first picked this book up, I really didn't like it. Who writes a novel where there narrator doesn't even get born until page 131? And I found the narrator's style of constantly dropping hints and alluding to what would come later to be irritating and distracting.It wasn't until I finished the first book (of 3), on page 137 or so, that I realized how brilliant the book is. From then on, it wasn't just about plot or style: I found myself hanging on every word the author said, over-analyzing everything (especially colors; blue is for god, red for communists and true feelings, green is for nostalgia) and wishing I had an annotated copy, since I didn't feel capable of keeping up with Rushdie's sprinting mind and style.It got to the point where after every chapter, I had to put the book down and take a deep breath. Every chapter feels laden and interlaced with symbolism that melds with rather than rises above (or sinks below) the plot.Rushdie's style is infectious. I found it obnoxious at first, but his mixing of standard English with Indian-referenced Hindi-tinted 'Babu English' to be completely endearing and fantastically comical. (\\"There was hankying and pankying? In the basement?? Without even chaperones?!\\")And the use of realistic fantasy-- describing unlikely actions in such a way that they seem plausible, with the narrator all the time apologizing for what seems unlikely, and informing you to believe it if you like-- pushes the story forward and makes it gripping. (\\"Purushottam the Saddhu grew tired of his sedentary lifestyle and developed the suicidal hiccups, which assailed him for an entire year, sometimes lifting him bodily off the ground two or three inches and causing his head to crack alarmingly against the garden tap; eventually he died and collapsed to one side, his legs still locked in the lotus position, and leaving my mother's verrucas without any hope of salvation.\\")And as a person who knew nothing about India or Pakistan and was never particularly interested in either, the book was a fantastic introduction to the extremely interesting events following India's independence.Overall, I can't think of a book I'd recommend more highly. It's definitely within my top 5 books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Ok I've re-read this book eight times, since the age of fourteen. I think that's why it took me till the sixth time to realize the book was about India, from Independence upto the 1970s. 'Midnight's Children' refers to that generations of Indians which lived right after independence, i.e. 1947. So-called because it was at midnight, 15th August 1947 that India(and Pakistan + the about-to-be Bangladesh) were born out of British India. It tells the story of Saleem Sinai who was born on Midnight, Independence day, and whose life is tied to that of his country's. Along with Saleem, another son was born almost at the same time: Shiva. These two represent the two different sides of India that are so familiar: Saleem represented the affluent, British-educated cosmopolitan and tolerant India. Shiva, represented the hungry-starving dog-eat-dog India, and how those two grew up together, separated, yet tied together. Plus all the hopes and dreams which were associated with the formation of this new India, the &quot;tryst with Destiny&quot; e.t.c. With the actual history of India as the backdrop. Saleem was one of many 'Midnight's Children', another name for India's democracy, and parliament. The book basically shows what the two estranged siblings - India and Pakistan/Bangladesh or Saleem/Shiva go thru from Independence onwards i.e. the two big Indo-Pak wars, the Pak military coups, how Indira Gandhi neutered them (she declared a National Emergency, martial Law, and institued disabling Socialist policies, the effect of which are still being felt). The book is written very well, but some of the Indian references will go over non-Indian readers' heads. Also, the state of India as Rushdie describes it is correct for the late 70s and early 80s, and has no bearing on the India of the 90s onwards. I think it's time to write a novel on Midnight's Grand-children, to the see the striking changes they are making on their nation. This book is only for people who have a significant interest in India. Not for the casual reader, and not a book to read for anybody who wants the most up-to-date story on India. Unfortunately there isn't a novel on that as of now."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Imagine...... a story that has existed from the beginning, has a life of its own, has its own destiny. Even then, cast a credulous cynicism that its author had only been a poor puppet, and who could impossibly be a writer of a book that is like a dream or an ineffable fable. I had imagined Midnight's Children this way and with Salman Rushdie drudging on this writing - it is quite sacrilegious to think , but pardon me, because indeed &quot;to understand just one life, I cant easily swallow the world&quot;. No, not this one so effortlessly because the reality/history that Rushdie had created is full of flamboyant Indianess, paradox, anachronism, fibs, magic, metaphor, humor, bawdy language, and imagination that are orchestrated in such a lavish way. Rushdie who has proven himself to be a master had so far successfully transmogrified himself to be invisible as the writer (at least for me).Most of the moments that I had spent with this novel were teeming with unsatisfaction with what I really seemed to comprehend, and while I was hovering above an &quot;illusion of understanding&quot;, the story is unheeding and unstoppable in its power to surprise me one instant, then to taunt me at another time and often really makes me laugh in its ludicrous lucidity.In the story, imagine a certain Saleem Sinai living with his life as a microcosm of the history of India. With his birth heralded by prime ministers and prophesied by wizards, and his life to be made as a template for a new beginning of an emerging nation, his life has become a fulcrum of contemplation of why what who how of a nation and its people. Saleems's life is told as a fictional autobiography with its armory of leitmotifs such as perforated sheets, silver spittoons, noses and knees, and pointing fingers. The outrageous and often fecund foreshadowing of paradoxes gyrate around the story's inevitabilities so that the whole work still maintains its serious appeal. A reader has to think beyond Saleem's life, or so to speak, has to go beyond being just kicked out of the story in order to appreciate this work or else this outrageous fiction would just amount to any ordinary melodramatic tale. Any one might be impressed about how the life-story of Saleem is being narrated in front of an ever solicitous Padma- a character-audience who goads and pulls the writery-leash that Saleem inextricably pinioned on himself and who inevitably flavors the story by her moods, and unknowingly also instills suspense and gaping interest to the story. So that what lies between fiction and history? Further, I see a lot of its parallelism to other novels such as 100 Years of Solitude, but its similarity is being put in an elegant copy. I would mostly hail this book among the other of Rushdie's works which I deem too ambitious to be true.And what about this chutnification of history? I really like this idea, and it reminds me of the &quot;gedanken&quot; or thought experiments that scientists use to explain a phenomenon that cant be proven by experiment, and yet can always be arrayed as truth. Midnight's Children's peculiar way of &quot;pickling&quot; events and then adding certain flavors and spices of perspectives had just given me a chance to meet Indian history (not from a textbook, at least) but in a quite sophisticated way."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Reading Midnight's Children is not an easy task. The rich language and elaborate descriptions take hours to ply through and days to appreciate. Your time will, however, be very well spent. Salman Rushdie's classic recently was awarded the &quot;Booker of Bookers&quot; and the award was clearly deserved. Admittedly, the book will probably appeal more to South Asians who will recall their own childhoods when they read phrases such as &quot;cho chweet&quot;, but even for someone from another part of the globe, the novel is a worthwhile piece. Take your time and enjoy as Salman Rushdie takes you through the joys and troubles of Saleem Sinai and the rest of Midnight's Children..."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This is an amazing book - I had thought, when I started, that it may have been a very heady, difficult to read book (as so many Booker Prize winners are), but I found it very easy to read, despite Rushdie's very interesting style. He has a very unpretentious voice, almost young sounding, but Saleem is an ancient soul. He communicates well to those less ancient then himself.It's absolutely crammed with little things to recommend it. I honestly can't fit them into a review. The amount of detail, the little stories all weaving themselves into each other, the colourful characters and events, the meticulous planning Rushdie has obviously done before writing - there is so much foreshadowing, it keeps you turning pages furiously! - and the overall impact of the book is amazing.I can't recommend this enough. Read it!"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Throughout Rushdie's novel the plot is complex and the character's conflicts rapidly producing. Rushdie displays an amazing talent for writing in this way. The numerous subplots told by Saleem Sinai, the narrator, form an overall character that is relatable with the reader. At times it even seems as if the narrator is speaking directly to the reader by describing his own life and mistakes as simply as if in a one on one conversation. It takes a true master to write this way without producing the impression that the narrator is pointing a finger in the readers face, accusingly or all-knowingly. Rushdie's style of writing is what, personally, kept me reading. Although the beginning of the book more of resembles a family tree and history book, the information is needed in the long run. After reading through \\"Book One\\" of Rushdie's novel, the book became immensely more interesting. The plot thickened. Tragedy started to befall the world once filled with magical realism. The wonderful Midnight Child blessing of powers is shown in a new light. The reader in \\"Book Two\\" and \\"Book Three\\" starts to feel the pressure that Saleem feels, as well as even some of the pain. (If the reader decides to commit to the book completely.) All in all, I loved the book. The writing style was fantastic, the characters were relatable, and the plot was complex enough to challenge my own skills. Yes, the book is difficult, but the effort put into reading it is worth every page. However, for any future readers I have some advice: 1) Keep a family tree of the character's relations to each other during \\"Book One\\". The tree would help when Saleem makes allusions to his past to explain a certain point or his own personal reaction to an event. 2) Brush up on the Indian Independence and the British-Colonial Rule. Islam and Hinduism knowledge would aid the reader too, but isn't as in demand as the ruling classes and how they stand in the terms of control over their freedom and way of life. Finally--3) Read the book while sitting in a favorite spot. The book's plot is too complex for reading on the bus or a few pages every few days. The reader needs to be totally invested in the book and be willing to put in the time.For all of Rushdie's future readers, enjoy the novel!"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"It is to be understood that Salman Rushdie's 'Midnight's Children' stands free and clear from national associations, in the way that Hemingway's 'The Sun Also Rises' stands free and clear, and in the same way that Dickens's 'Great Expectations' stands free and clear from such associations. If anything, we should judge them from national, cultural perspectives only sparingly. Such works belong to a rare group which simply defeat cultural bounds.Whether the reader is an Indian, Pakistani, Englishman, American, or otherwise, the novel stands upon its own merit. What Rushdie achieves is stupendous. The language is fascinatingly brilliant, and sparkles at every turn. So, too, is the genius of his plotting; the story is always fresh, never unexpected, despite its basis in historical fact. The Indian who dismisses its plot for its political implications is sorrowfully missing the heart of the book; the Englishman who judges the book on the basis of its faithfulness to real events and actual situations certainly misses the full impact of the novel.What Rushdie does is a re-creation of the novel form; he takes the novel, rooted in English tradition, and re-forms it in the half-light of Indian history. If we are able to judge Rushdie and &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; as literature, and not as political-cultural testimony, we can truly appreciate its achievement. It is one of the greatest novels written in a long, long time.The Booker Prize, whether it be enough to justify the novel or not, is almost an adequate judgement of the book. Fifty years from now, when students of Indian history and politics look back on the late 1900s, they might not think much of &quot;Midnight's Children.&quot; Fifty years from now, when students of literature look back on the late 1900s, they will inevitably think of Salman Rushdie and the achievement of &quot;Midnight's Children.&quot;"},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"The book is too extravagant. The word play is often totally baseless (such as dung-lotus for Padma), although Western readers may not be knowledgable enough about the background to know that, and the racy plot has scenes like in a cartoon book. Very clever but certainly not literature that will stand the test of time. Rushdie's \`Satanic Verses' is a much better novel."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"The hype surrounding Salman Rushdie's death sentence has overshadowed the fact that he is an incredibly talented writer. This novel drips with brilliance. The parallels between the main character and Indian history are so well developed and clever that it is almost impossible not to grin with its genuis. Rusdie's colorful and dramtic descriptions of people, places and events can sent chills through the reader. His witty, philosophical and politcal characters are some of the most original in modern literature. Enough wonderful things cannot be said about this truly incredible work! It's a must read for anyone interested in modern literature."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"I bought this book based on its reputation and, relatedly, on the &quot;Best Book in 25 Years&quot; label on the cover. I started reading with high expectations. I was reasonably impressed, true, but I was skeptical that the label on the book went too far. Then, around page 200, the book went from good to spectacular. Rushdie builds up to his payoffs, with a (foretold) surprise every fifty pages. The book can be appreciated either by reading every word slowly, savoring each one, or by tearing through it to see what happens next. Rare is the book that is not only moving and thought-provoking, but also fun. Believe the hype."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This is one of the finest novels in the past fifty years. Rushdie perform every kind of literary stunt to tell the story of modern India, a nation whose life is eerily paralleled, influenced, and mythologized by the narrator. It took me twenty months to read this book. I would begin, read about half of the book, then put it down. Next month I would start all over, enjoying the prose far too much simply to pick up where I left off. There is an extraordinarily dense minimalism about the piece, as it leaves you with the feeling that the whole story would fill twenty times as many pages, and that the narrator is only briefly sketching the highlights. There are a thousand and one reasons to read this, and at least half of them are good."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Midnight's Children is a long and sometimes arduous exercise in fantastical realism, a would-be folk tale about the history of India since its independence from Britain. The narrator's birth occurs at the exact moment of national independence, and from then on his life is something of an anthropomorphic mirror of the development of his nation.This book is neither a fictional autobiography nor a literary history of modern India. Well, actually it's both, but really it's about the dangers of being ancient in a modern world, and the pitfalls of trying to bring tradition into a rational, contemporary framework.Rushdie is one of the most eloquent writers of his generation, and inherits from Nabakov the role of linguistic perfectionist - every sentence is rolled up in allegory, wordplay, and, most importantly, meaningfullness."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This is a great book. I think Rushdie&#65533;s main charm lies in the way he has mixed all the political events of Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh effectively in the story; more so for the fact, almost all the events are at wrong times in history and yet its difficult to notice it!! Language has always been Rushdie&#65533;s forte. I cannot think of any other writer who can convey a 4-pageful of facts in 4 lines. On a lighter vein, this book could be a good GRE supplement for verbal section! The humour and sarcasm too are very well written and placed in the book.This book rightly deserved the booker for the best book, and even more rightly deserved the booker of bookers i.e the best book in 25 years. Ya, its that GOOD!! and its a must-read for a book-lover. Another book I liked very much is Paul Omeziri's Descent into Illusions and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"I bought the book some 4 years ago but left it in the book shelf until now: and why didn't I read it earlier!

Salman Rushdie has penned an extraordinary hybrid of reality and imagination that is sure to amuse and impress the serious reader."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Should anyone ask why this book is so revered, I would be at a loss to even being rationalizing others' adulation. The Booker Prize? One of the 100 best works of fiction of the 20th century?This book was one of the toughest slogs I have ever undertaken voluntarily. I pushed forward hoping that the end would justify and reward the senselessness of that which preceded the end. Had I not invested so much in a vain quest to find that which others described (allegory, metaphor, mysticism, creativity, use of language), I would have put it down much sooner.The language and flow of the work are distinctive, imaginative, and complex, but these are the few positive characteristics I can ascribe to the work. The remainder I found to be uninteresting and dense. In parts, I felt as if Rushdie had lost energy and focus, inserting filler until he could again jumpstart the storyline by again stretching the life of the central chracter across a historic event.Read instead Gabriel Garcia Marquez or Jorge Luis Borges. You'll find what others have promised within this work and come away with a far more rewarding experience."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"I guess you have to be a historian on India and its culture because if you are not (like myself), the book was confusing.

Unlike many other novels that kept me very much awake during my travels, this was a perfect novel \\"designed for falling asleep\\". The book will NOT make the time seem to flow faster; just the opposite. You will do well skipping less interesting pages. The action is very slow and fragmented, much of the book is a rather immature childhood fantasy; a frequent consultation with an Indian (preferably of Muslim faith) is needed to understand many words. I was actually lucky that my flight companion was an Indian (but not Muslim, so he actually had problems with the meaning of some words!). The most interesting parts of the novel are around page 350, when the action moves to Pakistan. But you simply might choose to give up way before that. I would be curious if other books by this author are of similarly questionable quality but I am afraid to try.....Midnight's Children is a VERY strange choice for a Booker Prize."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"Salman Rushdie may be regarded as a prize winning artist, but not in my book. This novel was truly a tough read, and that is not because it is complex in language or scope. The first 150 pages almost caused me to put it down for good and donate it. However, around this point, the story takes a better turn as it finally focuses on the protagonist of the novel. Aside from the general history of Pakistan and India and the 30 year span this story takes place, there was far too much mysticism involved. Twists and turns here and there make for the story to slog along, but in the end it just doesn't gel. Incestuous thoughts, bawdy feelings and overall sexual feelings of ineptitude are replete thorough out the novel. That in and of itself doesn't bother me, but when it is used as an essential characteristic by and of the narrator, it tends to become trite and useless. Additionally, while the story does take place in India and Pakistan, the use of the local language or Rushdie's attempt and using sounds and local vernacular drowns out an otherwise descriptive passage at times. The conversations are somewhat void of attention to the situation at hand or don't address the overall theme of the novel. Alcoholism, poverty, opulence, and histrionics are used throughout the story as vehicles to paint a full picture of the narrator's life. Unfortunately, they run flat and the overall theme, if one can really discern a deep meaning to this novel, is lost so the book lands with a thud! I am only giving it two stars because it is a decent attempt. I won't attempt to read Salman Rushdie again. Far too many other better books out there."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"My explanation for two- and five- star ratings for the book is just the opposite of what an earlier review surmised. I believe it is 5-star by those people who know India/Pakistan only superficially and so assume that Rushdie is on to something; it also includes the Macaulayites or those Indians/Pakis who have learned about it secondhand from English books. Often the word-play, puns, or etymologies used by Rushdie don't make sense."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"This book is so obviously influenced at parts by Gunter Grass, it could have been called \\"The Silver Spittoon.\\" Actually I think this title would match the book about as well as \\"Midnight's Children\\" does; the midnight's children don't really have parts in this book. They are place-fillers, like so many plot contrivances and characters in the novel. Rushdie likes to tell things more than he likes to show them, at least here. ---So this is also supposed to be like Gabriel Garcia-Marquez. Well let me tell you, take Gabriel Garcia Marquez or even Isabel Allende any day over \\"Midnight's Children.\\" These are gifted authors in the reader-grabbing sector, even through translation. Their stories can contain historical stuff without feeling stuffy and dull.Not that the novel feels too stuffy. Just a little awkward in the historical sections.\\"Midnight's Children\\" feels as if the author wrote down on a piece of paper hundreds of incidents and ideas and then stringed them together.I don't mean to be too mean to Mr. Rushdie, he seems like a horrorshow chelloveck, only he needs to lighten up a little! :-) Some parts of this book are funny, but none gutburstingly so. Perhaps I expect too much. Perhaps I make it a habit. Is that always bad? Perhaps one of the reasons that his book doesn't work is because it tries a balancing act that needs a vibrant and even slightly cruel character (like Gunter Grass's \\"Tin Drum\\" which had a weird, vivacious Oskar in the role). Saleem is appallingly half-minted. And yes some of the other characters do interesting things, but they are not really *people*. They are not even successful oddities.I would have loved some sort of a Hollywoodish (Bollywoodish?) showdown between Saleem and the Widow--- or Saleem and Shiva--- Saleem and *somebody*. Carefully done. Done lively and well. I would have liked one scene that really stood out, at least one scene. Sometimes I get the feeling Rushdie either holds himself back too much or has very little to tell."},{"Title":"Everyman's Library #217: Midnight's Children","review":"I love the way Rushdie plays with language, so this is not at all a predictable, or mundane read. That doesn't make it easy, but for eighty percent of the book I was captivated by both the story and the writing.The use of Indian terms or colloquialisms, endearments was a bit frustrating and meant I was distanced from the culture being depicted not only by non-membership, but through language.But still, there are other places where the Indianness is hilarious and a testament to Rushdie&#65533;s skills at evoking images. There is a description of the \\"actress with a mountain of fruit on her head\\" in the pictures in a peepshow ... \\"Lifafa called her Carmen Verandah\\" Verandah is a word which has found its way into English from India, and this verbal joke about a Latin American actress is lovely.Coming from a country where the verandah was adopted as part of the architectural vernacular, I have an uncommon fondness for verandahs, both the word and the concept!Then I got to within 80 pages of the end, and just couldn't get excited about finishing it. Somehow, I didn&#65533;t really care any more.The best part of the storytelling was when Saleem was a child; somehow events filtred through childhood seemed more compelling.There is loads of symbolism; much of it just washed over me. I think Rushdie is a fine storyteller in his best passages, but other times merely pretentious.Absolutely worth reading, but I think it might encompass too great a time span, and be flawed for that"},{"Title":"Tears Of The Renegade","review":"Why shouldn't he come back? This was his home. He even owned part of the land. He was ready to put down roots and what better place for that than his home. That was the excuse he gave to his Aunt Imogene and cousin, Preston. They were leary of him and rightfully so because his real reason for returning was revenge. He was considered the renegade, the black sheep of the family and he fully expected to exact his revenge on the family who scorned him for so many years. But he hadn't counted on Susan Blackstone, widow of his cousin Vance. Love became the wild card in the battle for control of the family company and Cord Blackstone realized it was too soon to know who held the winning hand.Susan first laid eyes on Cord when he appreared in the open French doors at her party. He looked self-assured, the type of man who was willing to take risks. She thought he looked like a pirate, a man no one would cross. As a hostile silence began to fall over the room, she sensed trouble and decided to diffuse the situation. Slowly she went to him. She didn't know who he was but she would welcome this guest into her home. She would befriend this man everyone seemed to dislike.This story was written by LH in 1985 and published as a Silhouette Intimate Moments series romance. I think Susan Blackstone was Linda's first strong heroine. Susan was faced with the danger that someone wanted to financially ruin her family. She fought back with everything she had to prevent this disaster and in the process showed Cord that he deserved love and there was a place for him with his family.If you are a LH fan, as I am, you won't want to miss this one. An excellent story!!"},{"Title":"Tears Of The Renegade","review":"Black sheep Cord Blackstone has returned to his family for revenge against his cousin, Preston, and Preston's mother.

Susan loves Cord, but she has to help the family who was there for her after her husband's death, even if it tears her from Cord.Howard's books wring your emotions dry, from laughter to tears. TEARS OF THE RENEGADE is no exception. By the end of the book, you feel deep satisfaction by the way every is tied up and the hero and heroine are united. You are also exhausted by the adventure, emotionally and physically. I have rarely seen an author whose every book is a keeper. Linda Howard is one of those rare individuals."},{"Title":"Tears Of The Renegade","review":"You have to remember that this book is one of Linda Howards earlier works and she was just staring out.

This, however is not one of the ones I like.Howard has always written about very Alpha Male heroes. In some of her earlier work, including this one, she takes that portrayal to an extreme. The &quot;hero&quot; in this work seems lacking in emotion and even leaning towards the emotionally abusive.The &quot;heroine,&quot; on the other hand, is written as an emotional wimp. It's written that she's &quot;strong,&quot; but she lets the &quot;hero&quot; walk all over her, making herself totally emotionally available to a man who, quite frankly, seems unworthy of it.I love most of Howard's work, but this is not a book I'm going to keep in my personal collection."},{"Title":"Tears Of The Renegade","review":"OK, this is an OLD story by Linda Howards ( nothing at all like her more recent books), nevertheless, its STILL one of the MOST annoying love stories out there.

Heroine sees the hero, she falls for him, he abuses her constantly, but she cant help falling in love, the MORE abusive and spiteful he gets the MORE she loves him...

Susan wants to protect her Mother and Brother-in-law (she is widowed). Cord is trying to enact a hostile takeover on the family company and destroy his aunt and cousin financially. There are a few good points to this book, I like that Susan was actually very happy with her husband, physically and mentally. It is rare that the widowed wife is completely happy with her husband in romance novels.However, I really had an issue with the way Cord treated Susan throughout the novel, he was dismissive of her as an honest and capable person, inconsiderate, and there was one seen that really freaked me out how she was saying \\"no\\" and he was not listening. I think these issues are somewhat typical of romances from the '80's. SUsan is also stupidly loyal to MIL and BIL, despite evidence of their underhand business dealings, and puts her well being in the line fro two people who don't really deserve it and would likely not do the same for her. I like Howard's newer stuff better, i would recommend sticking with that."},{"Title":"Tears Of The Renegade","review":"Back cover reads:A battle of willsWealthy, powerful, proud and arrogant, the Mississippi Blackstone put family above all else.

I say 12 because I refer to &quot;Son of the Morning&quot; which was written by Ms. Howard in 1997 and was one of best books I have ever read. So don't judge Linda Howard by this book.

The plot is not sophisticated at all, it just glows, goes and leaves no trace at all once you finish reading it."},{"Title":"Tears Of The Renegade","review":"Early Linda Howard Silhouette that didn't wear well for me.I don't think I'd read this one back in the day. Many of LH's old silhouettes actually do hold up well, I can go back and re-read Mackenzie's Mountain, for instance, and enjoy it as much as when I first read it.This one, though, doesn't work as well for me. It actually starts out quite well with dark, brooding anti-hero and black sheep of the family Cord Blackstone (doesn't that name just reek throbbing manliness?) shows up at a party and manages to all but seduce lovely widow Susan Blackstone on the dance floor.The Blackstones are a 'Family to Be Reckoned With' in New Orleans Society. They own a Corporation that, well, I am not exactly sure what the Corporation does but it makes them all rich and they have lots of people with jobs depending on them. But Cord was shunned from the family for having an affair with a married woman. Now he's back, bitter and ready to exact some revenge.Susan and he are really hot for each other. The other Blackstones (the mean ones that ousted him from the family) want Susan to use that attraction to glean whatever information she can about his obviously revenge-laden plans.But Susan is the ultimate good girl. She gets that Cord is just lonely and misunderstood and won't side with the family against him and won't side with him against the family. Even after they get it on and have amazing sex. She is just caught in the middle.I know that it was required for heroes back in the mid 80s to be all Alpha Jerky and stuff, but Cord takes that to the next level and pretty much just gets his sex on with Susan while she's all busy saying how much she loves him. He treats her badly, the family treats her badly and she allows herself to be treated badly. This is what annoyed me the most about this book. Susan was not only a victim, she was worse. She was a martyr. A suffering, noble, losing weight because she is trying to make everyone happy, wan eyed martyr. I wish just once she'd have said \\"Eff-you and kiss my [insert aggressively described skin color here] butt!\\" to both Cord and the rest of the family.Not LH's best effort"},{"Title":"Tears Of The Renegade","review":"This was a good book.

All a bit soft & \\"wishy washy\\", with too many cliched scenes & characters. I felt I wanted to shake the \\"heroine\\" at times! Fortunately I've read many other Linda Howard books, so I know how much better she can write & no doubt I will continue to enjoy other books of hers."},{"Title":"Tears Of The Renegade","review":"This novel was written in 1985, when traditional romance plots were in fashion: the quiet, reserved, grovelling (but strong) heroine falls for a hero who is abusive but sexy. This is the scenario which was acceptable at that time - although the ENDLESS pages of graphic sex wasn't a turn on for me. I can see it would have been a \\"hottie\\" back then! However, the never-ending descriptions of them having sex really over-shadowed the plot. This could have been a novella and done just as well.Cord Blackstone returns to his home after having an affair with a married woman many years previously and running off with her. This is negated by their marriage after her divorce and then her death. He is angry that the family disapproved (surprise surprise) and comes back to get financial revenge on all of them. His cousin-in-law, Susan, who has married his cousin Vance during his absence and been widowed five years previously, takes one look at him and falls in lust, desperate to break her five-year sexual drought.Things go downhill from there.If you take into account the age of this book and remember that it is one of the first Linda Howard wrote, you may enjoy it.

The story was what you expect from Linda Howard, but the wording was so ultra-flowery, over-the-top, and full of cliches that I was wondering at one point if it was somehow intended to be a parody of the romantic genre. --but no. I've noticed that Linda Howard does tend to recycle some of her descriptions from book to book. --Imagine taking all of her cheesiest descriptions from each of her books, concentrating them into one small book and removing the more believable character development. That's this book, a stick figure Linda Howard novel with saccharine descriptions stuffed around it in an attempt to fill it out."},{"Title":"Tears Of The Renegade","review":"Powerfully written as with all Linda Howard's books.

Its a complex and sometimes confusing story of sophie and her younger brother mattie and the events of their childhood. Ending the summer before sophie is to go away to boarding school. Mattie adores sophie and she mattie. They are more like an extention of each other than their own individual person. Sophie is extremely intelligent, and takes very good care of herself and her brother. Their mother is a recluse and their father stays away on business. The way the author remembers being a child, not just how one acted, but thought and felt as well, if profound to me. He definetly has a fascination with childhood innocence and ultimatly its loss. As I got towards the end of the book i read slower and more carefully and i think this truly helped me to understand what was being revealed at such a fast pace. I did have to go back and re-read certain parts for clarity but he does leave unanswered questions. The author leaves you with the limited knowledgs of the characters personalties and lets you decide exactly what happened. How those characters would have acted. I shared this with a friend and it was very helpful having another persons opinions and ideas. It helped me to put more pieces of the puzzle together. I definetly recommend this book. It was a fairly quick read. One i had a really hard time putting down."},{"Title":"Sophie","review":"Burt has a wonderful way of weaving a story and capturing characters in the reader's mind.

I even Googled Sophie to see what other readers gleaned of the ending, and it seems we're all lost. It's unfortunate. But I love Guy's reading style."},{"Title":"Sophie","review":"The author took a WHOLE LONG TIME to get to the point. And then, I wasn't even positive what was going on once we got there.If I really cared about understanding more about Sophie and Mattie, I'd probably reread sections to try and figure out more. But I don't care. Sophie's decision makes NO sense to me. None. Nada. Perhaps I needed to read her quarry books to understand her, but alas, no such luck. Then again, they helped Mattie very little, as he's still TOTALLY CONFUSED BY SOPHIE AS WELL, so I can't say her diaries would help me.I found the dialogue quite strange. I understand that Sophie is highly intelligent, but even the things Andy and Steve said were strange and unlikely.

About 60%-70% of the items listed are from the United States. A large number of photos are provided and the type is very large. The authors clearly focused on the low end of the hobby. That's not bad, just not very helpful for mid level or high-end collectors. The quality of the photos is mediocre at best. They are black and white except for the covers and an eight-page insert. Even in this section, common material dominates, with only 9 of the 61 color photos shown being valued at more than ten dollars. Of those, only two are valued more than one hundred dollars. Many of the photos are fuzzy, taken at angles, or trimmed, giving the appearance that they've been lifted from online auctions. The values given seemed way off in my opinion. The authors note that the values were generally derived by reviewing online auctions and not by reviewing dealer price lists. I have to wonder if this approach makes sense since it doesn't consider shipping charges and the discount the buyers apply for the additional risk of buying an item in an online auction. Comparing my collection with the listed items left me with a feeling of incompleteness. Less than 10% of my collection was listed.

There are plenty of photographs, though most are blabk and white.The book would be improved if they added details on how to adjust pricing for the condition of the document.

A fuzzy photo of an oscilloscope is shown, and then a detailed discussion is presented of how to use various dials, buttons and so on without any diagram showing where these controls are on the oscilloscope. Similar problems of what waveforms should look like without any diagrams, or photos of how they appear.I am particularly concerned about the description of how to build your own waveform generator.

The whole book is in much need of a critical re-editing and corrections.Apart from these problems I did find it a helpful and useful addition to my library of electronics books."},{"Title":"Build Your Own Electronics Workshop: Everything You Need to Design a Work Space, Use Test Equipment, Build and Troubleshoot Circuits (TAB Electronics Technician Library)","review":"The book is more about doing electronics than how to build a work shop. He covers what insruments you need in the order of importance and how to build simple test equipment that you may need. In general there is a chapter about each major piece of test equipment and how to use it. There is a similer chapter on tools. The main concept is how to build new electronics and how to repair electronics. I think the equipment you need depends on what type of work you expect to do, thus some of the recommendations may not not apply to you. For example, you do not need a giga hertz range oscilliscope or signal generator if you are not working in the ultra high frequency range. The complexity of electronic equipment increases with the increased frequency involved. For a person new to electronics, I suggest that you begin with low or audio frequencies, and progress upward to about 5 megahertz first. Your equipment is much less expensive in that range, than much higher up."},{"Title":"Build Your Own Electronics Workshop: Everything You Need to Design a Work Space, Use Test Equipment, Build and Troubleshoot Circuits (TAB Electronics Technician Library)","review":"First, it's a pretty heavy book, hundreds of pages.

Not a great read for me.

I've found this book most useful for diagnosing and treating injuries but what comes to the training sections, it wasn't written with the competetive athlete in mind. Noakes gives all the usual research about VO2max and running economy but I think he unfortunately doesn't take the knowledge to the level of the average runner. In other words, he doesn't give the principles of training plain and simple, put into schedules, like some other books do. I'm not saying that this is a bad book or that you shouldn't buy it, I'm just saying that it's maybe not THE book of running. If you are looking for comprehensive training information get another book but if you just want a comprehensive book about running, you can do well with this book."},{"Title":"Lore of Running","review":"When I started running again after a thirty year hiatus, I knew that a lot about the sport had changed, everything from gear and supplements, to medical practices dealing with running injuries and theories about optimizing speed and distance. So obviously, in seeking out resources that would enlighten me on the latest in running, I hoped to find a book that contained all the information in one place. Tim Noakes' book comes very close to fitting the bill.Lore of Running checks in at just under 1,000 pages, and it would be an exercise in futility to try and list everything it covers. Suffice to say, the author is a researcher, a doctor, and a runner, so there's lots here about how muscles work, what they don't do, why they stop working, how the body supports the effort of the muscles, and plenty of biological and scientific-bent things like that. There's also a good bit about the history of running and running philosophies, bios of famous runners, sample training programs, and personal anecdotes related to running. Some of the things I was hoping to learn about, however, things that I consider more fundamental to running, are surprisingly either not mentioned in this book at all, or else, are mentioned fleetingly and in glancing references. Subjects such as form. I would think that any book on running would, at some point or another, have to address the mechanics of basic running. Noakes nearly skips it completely, making do with a series of grainy photos of a guy running on a treadmill. And while there is some discussion about proteins and carbohydrates and how your body uses that energy during running, there is no mention of quantities, percentage intake of nutrients, sample diets, or timing of meals. To be fair, this is, like mechanics, a very individual thing, but still, I would have thought that some guidelines could have been provided. The sections on shoes are good, but again, due to the idiosyncratic preferences of individual runners, the discussion is very general and would pale in comparison to any monthly running periodical's shoe update column. (And barefoot running merits nothing but the barest (get it?) mention in a short sidebar or two.) He did manage to include a few pages of stretching and strengthening exercises, so there is some practical information here, but the majority of the book is heavily leaning toward just being medical reference material or maybe, useful background information for coaching or writing about running. As for actually using, much less needing, the information to get out and run, I am sure there are other, more practical (shorter) books out there.Don't get me wrong: Noakes' book is fascinating and informative reading. I just think that in order to become a better runner, I probably need to know more about where to hold my hands, how to not strain my knee, and what to eat the day before a race, than I do about how mitochondria generate energy, or whether an iliotibial inflammation is causing my pronation or not."},{"Title":"Lore of Running","review":"This book covers everything from exercise physiology to different coaches' training methods to the history of the sport to injury prevention and treatment. It is a bible of sorts for the serious distance runner and does indeed offer a lot of information that no other running books do. It does not include any training plans or explain things like \\"lactate threshold\\" like others do though, so if that's what you're looking for I suggest buying \\"Better Training for Distance Runners\\" or \\"Daniels' Running Formula.\\" No other work is as exhaustive as Noakes' though, and serious runners and coaches would benefit from owning a copy of \\"Lore of Running.\\""},{"Title":"Lore of Running","review":"What more can I say?

It worth to be read."},{"Title":"Lore of Running","review":"The only downside to this book is that the amount of information is overwhelming! If you have any questions about what makes and keeps a person running, it is in here.That said, everything is explained beautifully. The biggest benefit of this book is how simple Dr. Noakes makes these very complicated topics seem."},{"Title":"Lore of Running","review":"This book is excellent and an absolute necessity for anyone seriously interested in competitive running. Noakes covers all of the basics concerning the physiological and psychological aspects of running and presents them in a clear manner. The discussions about stretching, overtraining, and injury are equally useful as a reference.The best part of the book for me was the analysis, in chronological order, of the careers of the great runners of the past and their varied methods of attaining world class stature.It is hugely beneficial to study the likes of Newton, DeMar, Nurmi, the incomparable Zatopek, etc. The information on the great Bruce Fordyce, a figure not sufficiently known in the US, was of extreme interest; who would ever believe that an ultramarathoner could run a 5k that fast and do those speed workouts? It is particularly useful to study those among the greats who suffered from chronic overtraining and draw the obvious conclusions that are so elusive to many of us.Any person who reads this book and thoughtfully applies its ideas about training (memorize the \\"Laws of Training\\")is bound to improve dramatically. The text will provide the reader with the theoretical concepts necessary to construct a scientific training program that works for you. The extensive bibliography and documentation will point the serious reader to points of particular interest. I have not studied the literature extensively, but this is the best book on running that I ever read and I return to it constantly as a resource."},{"Title":"Lore of Running","review":"This book is one of the best resources for a runner of a coach that I've come across. Noakes details a diverse sampling of current theories in exercise science, and explains them in a readable and comprehensible fashion. Alongside Daniels' Running Formula, this book is at the head of the pack with regard to allowing the non-scientist to understand research-based explanations concerning running performance.Noakes is so rigorous in his standards of proof that he dismisses as unproven much of what is commonly accepted in the running community: the idea of improving VO2Max as a prime training goal, hydration recommendations, carbo loading, etc., unless there have been multiple clinical studies demonstrating their effectiveness, not only in improving a certain beneficial element of the runner's physiology, but in improving actual performance. This is refreshing, in that whatever he describes as beneficial will certainly improve your performance, but it also leads to a lot of question marks concerning what types of training are effective; a lot of practices are dubbed \\"potentially beneficial, but not potentially useless\\".This is probably unsatisfying to the majority of runners, who want an authority to determine which of these potentially-beneficial practices are probable enough candidates to warrant incorporation into a training program, but that isn't Noakes' M.O. However, the book should provide solid shoulders from which current and future athletes--amateur researchers all--can experiment to determine just what works for them. Therefore, I strongly recommend that you purchase this book."},{"Title":"Lore of Running","review":"This book is applicable to beginners as well as pros. Noakes' excellent scientific based descriptions of most aspects of running and endurance sport in general make this book an essential title for anyone who intends to get a little more serious about this sport. The book also contains a lot of useful information about the history of running and ultradistance running. I hope that a new release of this book will incorporate some of the more recent training methods like heart rate monitors and new nutritional supplements."},{"Title":"Lore of Running","review":"The Lore of running is simply the best there is for any serious athlete...The scientific analysis of preparing then pushing the human body to its limits is well documented throughout the evolution of this sport .

Like a steep uphill at the beginning of your run, Noakes starts off with how muscles work, oxygen transport, energy systems. The chapters are lengthy with many charts and graphs. The prose is like a medical textbook.I might have organized the book differently. Chapters on staying injury free and running & your health are near the end of the book. I would have put that near the beginning. But one does not have to read the book in sequence.This is not a good introductory book to running, but as was mentioned by other reviewers, a great reference or read for coaches or anyone else with a more in-depth interest.Like the late great Ed McMahon would say, \\"EVERYTHING you ever wanted to know about running is in this book\\"."},{"Title":"Lore of Running","review":"This book was the reason I got interested in running in the first place, and 4 years later I am about to run my first Comrades Marathon (90km).

The other posts have said it all regarding content, of this superb book, so simply: if you are new to running and are interested in a thorough read on running this is the book for sure. If you are experienced this may also be a welcome review, but it may get into unfamiliar and interesting areas if you are keen to understand more of the physiology and cell biology (assuming some advanced runners may lack this knowledge).

It is also a large enough book that you can probabloy use it for bench pressing."},{"Title":"Lore of Running","review":"I think it is important that readers understand precisely what this 931-page books IS, and what it is not. Dr Noakes is a trained physician, a professor of exercise science, and a highly published researcher in the field of exercise physiology. His meticulously researched book (the online references occupy over 100 pages) offers an authoritative compilation of the latest and best research to guide the intelligent coach or self-coached runner in the structuring of productive and safe training regimens. For those who lack a PhD in physiology but still want to understand WHY they should perform specific types of training, based on current research, this book is simply unsurpassed. If all you want is a &quot;table&quot; of training prescriptions with no grounding in research or explanation of validity, then look elsewhere: this book is not for you.In my opinion, Dr Noakes has done an excellent job of extracting results from current research and translating them from the highly specialized language of sports physiology into language that the intelligent layperson can understand. Indeed, I found the book pitched at a slightly less technical level than the popular competitor by Martin and Coe---a book I hve also found to be invaluable.Perhaps the most interesting feature of the Fourth Edition is Noakes' unapologetic challenge of THE prevailing paradigm in distance running; he questions the widely accepted belief that an individual's VO(2) max, or maximal oxygen uptake figure, is the key limiting factor in distance running performance. In a carefully argued Chapter 2, complete with dozens of references to research of the past decade to support his claims, Dr Noakes argues for an alternative &quot;Central Governor Model&quot; in which exercise capacity is primarily limited by coronary blood flow to supply oxygen to the heart. I cannot even present an outline of this fascinating alternative model in the brief space allocated here, but suffice it to say that Chapter 2 of his book, in which this theory is developed in detail, is alone worth the price of the book.In addition to the physiology of training, there are entire chapters devoted to temperature regulation, ergogencic aids, injury prevention and treatment, apparel (emphasis on shoes), etc: all of the usual topics with which self-coached runners must eventually cope.If I were to offer criticisms of the book for the sake of balance, there would be only two, both relatively minor.(1) Chapter 6, entitled &quot;Learning from the Experts&quot; offers training programs from a number of famous past champions who raced over distances from 1 mile to the ultramarathon. However, as Dr Noakes points out clearly and often, many of these runners, almost inhumanly gifted with natural ability, became champions IN SPITE OF their obsessive, unbalanced training programs, and not because of them. For the person of average gifts, emulating the training programs of, say, Dave Bedford (who occasionally logged as many as 160--200 miles per week!)is a certain prescription for injury (as it ultimately was for Bedford). I would therefore suggest changing the title of this chapter to &quot;Learning from the Champions.&quot; The accomplishments of these highly gifted people all too often had very little to do with &quot;Expertise&quot; in rationale training, as the current title suggests, and far more to do with natural endowment.(2) Since Dr Noakes is willing to challenge the VO(2) max paradigm so openly, I think it is necessary that he offer some guidance on precisely what differences to the training program his alternative Central Governor Model implies. It is not easy for the non-specialist to see what amendments to training are implied by this alternative model; perhaps an addition to be incorporated into the Fifth Edition?In summary, if you are a self-coached runner looking for an intelligent basis on which to construct a training program, then this 931-page book is comprehensive and has no real rival. If, on the other hand, you would prefer a 5-page pamphlet offering some training tables for the beginner, then I advise you to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Lore of Running","review":"If you have a top notch personal coach who tends all your needs, you don't need any book to improve your running. If you are like me who have the passion for serious running, enjoy reading and analytical thinking while having a full-time job + other professional activities, this book is a must-have. I got one for me and two as presents to my friends. Using this book as the major reference to coach and heal myself, I qualified for the Boston Marathon at my marathon debut after about one year's training, took 10 minutes off in another year and I am on my way to beat NYC marathon qualification time for guaranteed number. Running programs are everywhere. \\"Individualizing\\" has become a clich&eacute;. Understanding the fundamental mechanisms and principles behind body and training is essential to derive a healthy and effective training program that adapts to the body's response. Lore of Running distinguishes itself from other running books by offering a large volume of solid evidence to support the principles concluded by the author. The readers have the freedom of utilizing these materials, often presented in interesting ways such as stories about famous runners, to make their own conclusions. I feel like having a very pleasant academic discussion with the author who is convincing, but not dictating while reading the book. The background of the author - ultra-marathon athlete, researcher and practicing sports MD is perfect for writing such comprehensive running book.This book is certainly not a quick recipe. It takes time to digest the material. If you enjoy reading, it is a plus. I have read some section multiple times. Another very good running book that takes much less time to read is Daniels' Running Formula by Jack Daniels that is geared more toward elite runners, but still very helpful for midpack runners like me."},{"Title":"Lore of Running","review":"I have been reading about running for the past couple of years--probably more than I ought to. I came upon this book recently in the library (most of my reading is online!) and upon poring through its pages have realized that a lot of what I've read either came from this book, or this book has a lot of what I've read in it. Noakes has written this tome relying upon the best science we have for running with all of its available studies. He bases his conclusions and statements on journal articles where possible and where not does not go overboard in conjecture.He is an accomplished marathoner and ultra marathoner and in his practice has treated a lot of runners.Go ahead and buy any book on running. It will have a section on nutrition with the basics that we all know. Contrast with the nutrition section in this and it's actually worth reading; he spends many pages on such details as the proper sodium levels in a beverage, the amount of liquid we need to drink while exercising (not the vague catch-all of \\"drink as much as you sweat\\"). His guides on injury and footware are the best researched I've found anywhere.This is not just the best book on running I've seen, it's the best book _by far_.I slight this book in two areas:1) Injury treatment seems to be really slanted substantially toward footwear and orthotics. Now, there may be a reason for that I'm not aware of, and he does give time to exercises and \\"holistic\\" approches for injury prevention, including training the hips for, say, a knee problem and not just the feet, but I would have just preferred a bit more.2) Running technique. He describes in detail the typical heel-strike of most runners but doesn't spend much time that I have found on particulars of technique, such as possibly forefooting or midfooting. Bits and pieces are throughout the book in this, but a subsection on what is now in vogue (pose technique, chirunning, etc.) would have been nice. I don't know that it's reasonable to dismiss these simply because he feels they're useless; I feel like he missed out.That said, I really can't stress enough how much solid, quality stuff is in this book. He's not simply taking what \\"everyone knows\\" about running and making a thousand pages out of it; he does go into meaningful detail."},{"Title":"Lore of Running","review":"This is an absolute must. It is excellent in the exercise physiology department which is the bases of a successful performance.

With a stunning level of historical and scientific research, Noakes reviews the entire global history of running, drawing well-reasoned conclusions about sports medicine, psychology, all aspects of training, injury prevention and acheiving the highest level of performance possible. Then he backs these theories up with irrefutable testimonials from the world's best runners of all time.Noakes does all of this with a measured and humble attitude that presents his views with confidence, while acknowledging that there are always exceptions to any theory. Most importantly, he recognizes the importance of self-discovery and the illusory nature of \\"training secrets.\\"I can't recommend this book more highly, but offer one word of caution: don't try to digest this all in one sitting.

Noakes covers history, physiology, current runners, ethnographic issues, and several other topics. It is very readable and each chapter is well edited, so that it can stand alone.Noakes own views also comes through - over-training did in Bedford and Hill. My only comment is that over-training does in every runner, but perhaps this is the cost of burning brighter rahter than longer.There are several other subjects that can be lumped into all the other various purveyors of training thought - Hadd, Lydiard, Daniels, Canova. They are all directly or indirectly addressed here.This is the ONLY comprehensive text touching on virtually the entire spectrum of issues surrounding running which I have found. Noakes has his opinions, but this in no way detracts from this fine read."},{"Title":"Lore of Running","review":"VERY detailed and explains WHY certain training recommendations are made. I'm a physician and was surprised how technical this book was. If you are not scientifically minded, this is still a great reference, but do not plan to read this cover to cover unless you took a lot of biology in college. I have used this book for help with an injury and the recommendations and explanations seem very sound. If you are merely looking for training schedules, there are other places to find them, but this book has a wide variety of \\"formulas\\" for race preparation. For serious runners, this book is a bargain. Probably cheaper and more useful than any running shoes or other equipment you are putting on your wish list."},{"Title":"Lore of Running","review":"Noakes's book on the \\"Lore of Running\\" covers just about everything, from what happens inside your muscles to training plans for various races, from biographies of great runners to how to stretch. Noakes seems to be writing both for the runner who wants a deeper understanding of the sport, and for the runner's trainer.Despite the specialized nature of some of the subject matter, Noakes's writing is quite readable. If you like endurance reading and endurance running, treat yourself to this book."},{"Title":"Lore of Running","review":"John V. Karavitis Tim Noakes is a South African physician, professor of exercise and sports science, researcher and ultramarathoner. This book (4th edition (c) 2003) represents a veritable bible of information for every runner, from the beginner to the elite champion. Noakes covers a lot of ground, and he does so thoroughly. In fact, in a word, this 921-page book is a STUNNING opus.Noakes shows how the hodgepodge of \\"theories\\" that are still taught in school today are without foundation, and, in their place, offers a \\"Central Governor\\" model of fatigue (aka the Integrated Neuromuscular Recruitment Model). This model posits that the brain monitors one's physical exertion and internal core temperature and signals one to slow down or stop by invoking a sense of fatigue. It does this in order to protect the brain and the body from damage. Noakes also provides the reader with great detail about how muscles work, how the body utilizes oxygen and energy stores (carbs and fat), and, perhaps most importantly, training schedules from both elite runners like Jeff Galloway and researchers like Jack Daniels. That is, you are given actual training schedules that will get you to run anything from a 10K to a marathon or even an ultramarathon in just 26 weeks.My favorite sections are (1) Chapter 5 \\"Developing a Training Foundation\\", where Noakes looks back at the greatest runners and distills their wisdom into the \\"15 Laws of Training\\" (which gives some of the best advice I've ever read for runners), and (2) Chapter 6 \\"Learning from the Experts\\", which gives us a look at the lives and training regimens of some of the greatest runners of all time. Other interesting tidbits include: the apparent fact that marathoners only have a 20-year window of excellent performance, regardless of when they start racing (in fact, only one really elite marathon performance in their career); that one should include walking with any running (to forestall stretch-shortening cycle fatigue in the quadriceps); that speed work/interval training is essential to run faster.Bottom line, this book is THE BIBLE for anyone who wants to run any distance. If you love to run and want to either learn more about it, pick up useful training tips, or read about the \\"lore of running\\", then this is the book that you must have. FIVE STARS! John V. Karavitis, John Karavitis, Karavitis."},{"Title":"Lore of Running","review":"... A book that comprehensively covers the physiology and biochemistry of running. The volume is exceptionally well written, also a first for a book about the science and theory of running. There are some issues with redundancy and some parts of the book that seem a little out of place (training plans to Walk/Run a 5k?). I think if the reader is interested in this level of detail, that they have most likely been running for some time. Some reviewers complain about the long chapter on the history of great runners. The book is, however, called the \\"Lore\\" of running - not the 'science of running.' I found that particular chapter to be especially motivating, personally. As the tagline suggests, this book is a MUST for the serious runner or coach."},{"Title":"Lore of Running","review":"This is the one, if your are a professional.Buy it and you wont regret.Jorge"},{"Title":"Lore of Running","review":"I have really enjoyed this book. If you are tired of scratching the surface of running in other books and want to know more about the different theories of chemical processes, theories on how your muscles work, how fatigue develops, significant figures in running history, and several different theories on training for various distances, this may be the book for you. Very thick read, something for everyone, but maybe too much for the novice. Almost a novel of academics for a college course. Great book.

If you are really into the minutae of the terrain, troop movements, and backgrounds of not only key players but many of the junior officers, then this is the book for you. Otherwise it is a very difficult read. So many soldieres are discussed that it is difficult to keep track who is Union and who is conferderate. Without referring constantly to a small black and white map of the Gettysburg I would have been comletely lost."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"I look for books to provide analysis on the generals and their decisions. While Pfanz's book has great detail on the fighting, it plunges to the other end of the spectrum with no helpful information on Lee's decisions. This is critical to any understanding of the battle because the second day's fighting was the result of what Lee did or did not do.As a result, this reader is of the opinion that one must look to other works to provide much-needed information on such critical questions of &quot;how and why&quot; events unfolded as they did."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"To understand the importance of the second day's battle at Gettysburg, one only has to look at the names of the men and places involved. The men were names like Chamberlain, Hood, Vincent, Zook, O'Rorke and Hancock. The places were The Wheatfield, Peach Orchard, Devil's Den and Little Round Top. Even 140 years later the average person on the street knows what Little Round Top is, even if they don't know much else about Gettysburg.Harry Pfanz's Gettysburg the Second Day is a must have for anyone seriously interested in understand what happen in Gettysburg on July 2nd. It covers Longstreet's assault against the southern flank of the Union army using two of his divisions commanded by Hood and McLaws (Pickett was as yet not on the field with his division). Pfanz does a really nice job with the Xs and Os of the battle. He especially does nice work with the Wheatfield which is perhaps the most confusing section of the entire battle of Gettysburg. No other book I think explains what happened there better than this one.Pfanz without question knows Gettysburg better than anyone around. He spent 20 years as the head NPS historian at the park so he knows from what he speaks.As a side note, this book does not cover the fighting on the Union right flank on the second day but concentrates on Longstreet's assault on the Union left. To learn about the events on the other end you should read Harry Pfanz's book on Culp's Hill and East Cemetery Hill which covers the actions on those hills during the entire 3 day battle."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"This book covers the fighting on the southern edge of the battlefield from 4PM till dark. Now you might look at the size of this work and think overkill, but I wish to assure you that it is not the case. This is and in-depth study of the most crucial (in my opinion) part of the battle. If you want to be an expert on this part of the battle, please read this. One problem might be the constant bio's of each major figure when they are first introduced."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"To understand this work, you must realize that Pfanz was the chief historian at Gettysburg NMP and the Park Service for many years. So he REALLY knows his history regarding Gettysburg! The book primarily covers Longstreet's attack on Day 2. This was intentional, as Pfanz wrote a separate book covering Cemetry Hill and Culp's Hill. The details in the book are amazing, especially if you go on-site to find the places he describes in such vivid detail. Pfanz also challenges some near-sacred beliefs about certain individuals (e.g., he presents evidence that Chamberlain did not order his charge and, in fact, at first tried to stop it). Pfanz presents the evidence, pro and con - then leaves it up to the reader to decide. So, to those with preconceived ideas, this book may &quot;ruffle some feathers&quot;. One shortcoming was the lack of more maps. As one who likes to use a book while actually on-site, I found his maps excellent, but too few in number. If you have not read this book, you have much to learn about Gettysburg. Buy it...it's superb!"},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"Harry Pfanz, former historian at the Gettysburg National Military Park and former Chief Historian of the National Park Service has written what will be the classic account of the pivotal day of the Battle of Gettysburg. Relying heavily on primary sources, many never before used, Pfanz takes the reader through the planning of the day's combat, the climax of the Confederate assault on July 2,1863, and the day's aftermath. While Pfanz's history is flawless, what makes this book so good is his attention to detail and the inclusion of human interest stories which are both relevant and fascinating. While this book will be most appreciated by Civil War buffs, it is sure to interest all looking for a great historical yarn!"},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"I had studied Coddington and walked the battlefield many times for many hours, and I had convinced myself that I knew a little bit about the Second Day at Gettysburg - until I started in on Pfanz's work. If you think that you are acquainted with the events on July 2, 1863 at Gettysburg, and you haven't read Pfanz (former historian at the Gettysburg National Military Park and former Chief Historian of the National Park Service) - get ready for an education. True to the reviews, there does not appear to be anything of significance - from our remote perspective in time - that can be known about this three hours of fighting (on the south end of the battlefield - Pfanz by design does not deal with the fighting at Culp's Hill and Cemetery Hill on this day) that Pfanz has not exhausted in his research. What appears to be a tome at first contact is actually a fast-paced story well told, with excellent maps (the usual complaint, there should be more) and thoughtful analysis, based upon a depth of knowledge and first rate research. Probably not recommended for the casual reader, but for the serious ACW &quot;buff&quot;, it doesn't get any better than this. What Longstreet described as the best three hours of fighting done by any army, anywhere, is given its due by Pfanz. If you have admired some of Don Troiani's works from this battle (&quot;The Men must see us Today&quot;, &quot;Saving the Flag&quot;, &quot;Barksdale's Charge&quot;, &quot;Don't Give an Inch&quot;, &quot;Lions of the Roundtop&quot;, etc.) and would like to know more of the historical behind the artistic - this is your reference. Detailed analysis of strategy is not Pfanz's aim (or possibly his forte). In the end, one wonders whether, in the fog of war, there really was much more to it than &quot;the enemy is there and that is where we will fight him&quot;. Lee certainly understood very well (unlike most of his Federal counterparts - hence his successes) that no grand strategy could survive contact with the enemy. It would be up to the Corps, Division and Regimental commanders to make tactical decisions real time once the Army's orders were issued and troops were put in motion. Where Pfaniz excels is what happened once the soldiers were put in motion."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"If you are curious enough (and backgrounded enough) to want to know exactly what happened in the fighting south of Gettysburg on 2 July 1863, this book is probably as good as it gets. The author cogently and honestly presents the best possible story that emerges from the existing record. When information is missing, the author concedes it, even identifying the gaps. Where the records is dubious, he notes as much and explains why. He offers clearly identified, rational conjecture only to fill in some of the gaps.This is a detailed account that the casual reader may find too detailed. But if you already know the story of the bigger battle, read this this to understand as well as possible what happened on Day 2 in the southern half of the battle. This book represents a powerful and rare combination of long and hard research with well-written narrative.I have been reading about Gettysburg for about thirty years and visiting the battlefield for about 15 years. This book boosted my knowledge of the battle and the nature of the war more than I imagined possible. If you want more mythology, or sweeping critical assessment of the key players, go somewhere else. In this book, thanks to Pfanz, the actual record has its say."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"The Greatest 3 hours of fighting during the Civil WarHarry Pfanz's outstanding Gettysburg-The Second Day is the definitive study of that day's pivotal 3 hours of continuous battle on the Union's tenuous left flank. In 3 bloody hours the Confederates lost 6000 men while the Union had 9000 casualties: 15,000 men or approximately 83 soldiers a minute were killed, wounded, or simply became missing. The din of battle was breathtaking, and the smoke so fierce that at times the men found it hard to breath must less see. As General Longstreet said, his corps's assault of 2 July was the \\"best three hours' fighting ever done by any troops on any battle-field\\". It was simply a field of valor strew with carnage. Those that survived were never forget, and those that died so gloriously would never be forgotten. Death was like a shadow that stalked everyman until the sun went down.Harry Pfanz expertly followed the battle at the regiment level through the eyes and ears of the commanders and basic soldiers of both sides. Like his Gettysburg-The First day, his description of events although superb were a little out of order for ease of understanding how the actual battle flowed. A few more maps would have really helped. I strongly recommend the reader use Bradley Gottfried's The Maps of Gettysburg as an additional aid to help with the Order of Battle. I still don't know why most civil war historians do not include time stamps on their maps. A time stamp on each map would greatly aid in following the flow of battle. I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Pfanz's little vignettes about both the major and minor participants. The strategically placed individual's photographs also made the battle more personal. All in all an extremely well done portrayal of the second day of battle of Gettysburg. Be forewarned that this history ONLY covers the 3 hour battle on the Union's left flank.A must read for Civil War history buffs. Might be a little over the top for the casual Civil War reader but worth the effort. A superb book in all respects."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"Harry Pfanz's Gettysburg, The Second Day is no doubt one of the finest accounts of the second day battle. I am always amazed and exceedingly happy that such individuals have devoted their lifes in writing such history. The book speaks for itself. For those who have not been to Gettysburg this may be more information than you want to process, however, once you've seen the battlefield this book will put all together for you and then some. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"Gettysburg--The Second Day is the first and longest in a series of three volumes written by Harry Pfanz, former Chief historian of the NPS. Quite extensively researched Harry Pfanz takes us step by step through the preparations and fighting on the southern end of the of the battlefield to encompass the areas known as Little Round Top, The Wheatfield, and the Peach Orchard. This work does not deal with events of the second day in the area of Culp's or Cemetery Hill which is dealt with in volume two of the series.The work is not for the casual reader of Gettysburg books, or for those not knowledgeable of terrain features or minor place names. It is written is a formal style and can be and often is a difficult read. The reader will find himself having to read over many passages to fully comprehend the narrative as the writing tends or ramble and thoughts do not always get connected.This book seems not place the emphasis where it should be. Over ninety pages are dedicated to the events of the Peach Orchard and the assault on Cemetery ridge, sixty to the Wheatfield area and only forty to the most critical area of fighting, that being Little Round Top and surrounding areas. This I feel is a major problem in that the Little Round Top fighting is far more key to a Confederate success that those events occurring later on in the fighting and is the area where the least emphasis is placed. The maps are good, not great, but lacking in sufficient number to aid the reader in visualizing events, a problem overcome in volumes two and three of the Gettysburg series.Being the first in the series, Harry Pfanz improves in writing style and clarity in the second and third volumes. These books should be an essential part of any Gettysburg historian's collection. Rating is difficult 3 for style and clarity, and 4 documentation and detail = 3.5 overall."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"Harry W. Pfanz attention to detail is what I love the most about this incredible research. Harry spent 10 year assign as a park historian at Gettysburg and he spent it well. Harry learn and walked over every inch of the terrain. Harry's knowledge of the battle is unsurpassed. Harry knows more about this battle then Lee or Meade ever learned. Harry I salute you and thank you for the detail and amazing research you have preformed for our country's history. AWESOME AND HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.*** WARNING this book is not for someone who is looking for the \\"Cliff Notes\\" for their history class."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"This is the most detailed look at the second day of Gettysburg I have ever seen. He gives very exacting positions of the moves of various regiments in some complex battlefield areas such as the Wheatfield and Devils Den. I did not give it a five star rating simply because the movements got very difficult to follow at times. Still an excellent work and worth trying out."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"By far, this, together with the companion Pfanz book on the Northern battle, gives a thorough view of the battle. From the armies' approach to the battle, to the final union repulse and aftermath, Pfanz gives a blow by blow analysis of the fighting, yet, at a level that reads like a novel. Outstanding!!!!"},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"The immense detail of Phanz is greatly refreshing. If anyone is interested in the detailed movements of each regiment, company, general, etc. of the second day of the battle of Gettysburg, then this is the book to get. This seems to be the best researched book that one could find on the subject. Also, Phanz does not &quot;take sides.&quot; He is generally fair to both sides, not presenting either the North nor the South in unnecessarily bad light.This is the sort of book that we need more of. Phanz's immense scholarship and mastery of the battle enables one to be able to trust his judgement in interpretation and description."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"Harry W. Pfanz did an outstanding job in describing in detail the events of the 2nd day of Battle at Gettysburg. From troop positions of the first day and where they were at the sunrise of the second day, through beginning clashes and large combat encoutners throughout the morning and afternoon Pfanz describes the strengths and weaknesses of each brigade, battalion and regiment of the Union and Confederacy that engaged in battle on the second day. From the fighting at Seminary Ridge to Devil's Den, The Wheatfield, Little and Big Round Top and even Gen. William Barksdale's glorious charge of the Mississsippians that broke through the Union Line, but ultimately withdrew, Pfanz describes in detail all of the mportant clashes of what happened based on eyewitness accounts, official reports of both Union and Confederate resources. This is a must have book for any serious research of the Battle of Gettysburg.This has much detail about troop and artillery positions, but it also has interesting details about the officers and soldiers which were in the 2nd day of battle.This is a book that scholars of the Civil War can benefit from because of the detail, also this book is enjoyable to read for any Civil War enthusiast. Pfanz is to be commended for writing this book because of its detail and also its interesting accounts of the heat of battle that both Union and Confederate soldiers fought on the 2nd day of Gettysburg."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"I have a terminal case of the Civil War bug and have read most of the major works concerning the Battle of Gettysburg. Thus, it was with some anticipation that I began reading this book. In particular, I was looking forward to an exhaustive and detailed discussion of the conflict in the Wheatfield. This book has a lot of detail and participant recollections but is not as well organized and clear as the Trudeau book, Gettysburg: A Testing of Courage. I believe this book also suffers from an insufficient number of maps. However, this book gives the best discussion with regard to the fighting by Andrew Humphrey's division than any other work that I have read. All in all, this is an excellant discussion of this day of the battle but it's not perfect and may not be the first one to buy."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"I cant conceive of a better treatment of the second day at Gettysburg. Eventhough Pfanz deals with the details of regimental movements, it is well blended with vingettes of the participants at the battle as well as brief historical background information of regiments and personalities. The maps are very very good, better than his maps in Day One. Unfortunately, the first map isnt until page 120 and this is after much discussion of the troop movements through the month of June. The seasoned WBTS reader should know to have his own atlas. But, I found myself printing out current maps of southern PA and northern MD. Treatment of the subject matter is great with an acknowledged emphasis on the Union movements. A must have for the Gettysburg student."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"This is for the Kindle Edition. I really enjoyed the hardback edition, enough that I purchased the Kindle version as well. Unfortunately the Kindle version has maps that were so small as to be unreadable. What was worse is that they were scanned at such a low resolution that when I tried to zoom the the Maps on my Ipad, the just blurred out. This has not been a issue with other books. With a battle with numerous units and key place names, readable Maps are a must. I returned the Kindle Edition."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"Mr. Pfanz makes a detailed ananlysis of the positions of the Confederate and Union corps prior to Gettysburg. He details their approach to Gettysburg,their deployment, their actions during the battle,then finally their disengagement. This is a good book for the amateur and professional Civil War buff"},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"Many who read about Gettysburg, probably impressed with the length of this work or the author's time on the job at the park, consider Pfanz as the &quot;dean&quot; of Gettysburg scholars. His knowledge of the battle's details is considerable. However, his wealth of selected details can be found in other works. With so many books out on Gettysburg, one should look to the author's analysis to determine how deep that writer's understanding is of the subject matter. When this reviewer looked carefully at Pfanz's lengthy contribution, precious little VALID analysis was found. Why? Pfanz is at a considerable disadvantage when it comes to understanding the Army of Northern Virginia and Robert E. Lee. For example, the author completely fails to address Lee's crucial decision as to why the Confederates were committed to battle in an echelon attack. Also, Pfanz virtually ignores any formation that did not get into the fighting, and does not address the reasons why they failed to get into action. The entire book left an impression of an author who spent a lot of time putting together many facts about the fighting on the south side of Gettysburg on July 2, but, for some reason, chose not to provide much in the way of trying to understand why things happened the way they did. Almost every one of Pfanz's conclusions---many of those concerning Lee are extraordinary claims which come out of his total failure to understand the concepts that comprise an attack en echelon---completely lack supporting evidence. Pfanz's failure to grasp Lee's attack plans, and the required flexibility that an echelon attack had to entrust to corps and divisional commanders, results in a false portrayal of Lee and the style of command that was necessary for the attack that was ordered. As a result, many of Pfanz's conclusions certainly do not stand up to the historical facts."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"Pfanz's book is notable not only for the information it contains, but also for the information left out. Unlike Martin's &quot;Gettysburg, July 1&quot;, Pfanz has definite opinions about the people and their judgements at Gettysburg. And he is more than willing to add/twist/omit certain facts to make his case. In summary, while Pfanz presented some interesting information, that information can readily be found elsewhere. Further, his &quot;wise cracks&quot; and omissions make his conclusions very suspect. I would NOT recommend this book to any serious student of Gettysburg. I regret I purchased my copy; I think you will feel the same."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"Pfanz is the champion of Day 2 at Gettysburg. Although his First Day treatment was very good, he excels with the focus on the Day 2 action.The action is very detailed and certainly not for a newbie. Definitely read a good one volume account of the entire battle first (maybe even read it twice).Many will claim that the meat and the potatoes of the battle of GB is on the second day, particularly in the area of The Peach Orchard, Wheatfield, and Little Round Top. Longstreet called it \\"the best three hours of fighting\\" and I tend to agree.Pfanz does an excellent job of setting up the different regimental, brigade, divison, and corps leaders who were in charge of these certain subsections of the fight, along with providing some grunt reports to present a complete picture. Of course the book is meticulously footnoted and you will not doubt his knowledge on the subject.Movements and phases of battle tend to overlap. The Wheatfield is probably one of the most complex actiions to understand because of the involvement of 2 different Confederate divisions and at least 3 different Union corps, not to mention the ebb and flow of battle. Pfanz handles this action superbly.Little Round Top, although not as complex a movement, has potential to become magnified in importance and to actual events. However, Pfanz relies of meticulous research and tempers any far flung notions, but simply presents the events as they happen. Well done.Pfanz is not a big Sickle's fan. Most would agree with him. I'd like to have seen a more neutral stance or at least present the counter argument, but that's okay. When it comes to Sickles, you can write a book alone about his decision to move his corps forward.There are several maps. The complex action might require a more thorough set if you really want to break down the details. I'd suggest getting a copy of Imhoff's Day Two A Study in Maps. It's an excellent source of about 50 beautiful maps covering all the Day 2 action. Reading Pfanz and comparing against Imhoff's maps is the perfect one two punch you'll ever come across.Simiply put, if you are student of the battle of gettysburb, your bookshelf is extremely incomplete without a copy of The Second Day, and his other book on the Culp's Hill and Cemetary Hill part of the field. Skip his First Day book and go with Martin there who has written the definitive account."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"I can't add much to what the other reviewers have said, and I certainly don't want to duplicate what there excellent reviews. I do want to recommend Pfanz's Gettysburg: The Second Day to any serious student of the Gettysburg battle. The book is well written, readable, and certainly logical in the order the battle is covered. The maps are more than helpful and well thought out, but as one other reviewer points out are late in their introduction. The book is detailed without getting bogged down is useless facts. The author obviously knows what he's writing about and certainly his passion for the topic shines through. Pfanz managers the minute to minute changes on the battlefield and the often complicated troop/unit movements with ease and without losing the reader. The author manages to introduce personal accounts where he feels they can add to the narrative. This is a superb work and it may never be surpassed."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"Being that I had ancestors that fought for the Union at Gettysburg, I read as much as I can to follow their (and their comrades) footsteps and actions. Harry Pfantz' writing on the Second Day at Gettysburg was very good. It was one of the better books on this topic. I like to read and then go to Gettysburg and re-trace the actions and footsteps myself on the Battlefield. One doesn't truly get a true understanding of what, how and when the different events happened unless you study and then go and see for yourself. This was one of the better publications from my personal perspective. After seeing Civil War re-enactors during the re-enactments and once you throw yourself into following the Battle developments on the Battlefield, it is amazing that anyone even survived the Battle. I would defintiely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"If you want detail on the second day at Gettysburg, this will give it to you! Harry Pfanz provides much information in this volume.The book itself begins with the invasion of the North by Robert E. Lee. Chapters 2 and 3 report on key aspects of the day one fighting, on July 1st. These three chapters set the stage for the discussion of the battle on day two, July 2nd, 1863. The fourth chapter lays out the Union forces assembling at the battlefield and deploying as they arrived. Then, the events and the bloody fighting. . . . General Sickles' questionable movement of this Third Corps forward, based on his fear that Confederates would occupy somewhat higher ground on his front. This put his Corps in an awkward position, in advance of the rest of the Army of the Potomac.Pfanz does a nice job of describing the battle, as Longstreet's troops (finally) got in position ad advanced against the Third Corps. As Sickles' position was unraveled, great numbers of Confederate and Union forces were sucked into the fighting. Then, the battle for Little Round Top. . . .The book closes at the end of the day, with events pointing toward a climax to the battle on July 3rd. In the final analysis, a fine rendering of events on the second day at Gettysburg."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"Mr Pfanz explains the full dynamics of Longstreet's Charge on the second day, from the suppression of the Union artillery in the Peach Orchard to the attacks and counterattacks around the Wheat Field, Devil's Den, and Little Round Top. The tactics are explained on regimental level. The assault by Anderson's Division on Cemetery Ridge are included, but the actions of the Confederate Second Corps on the second day are not, making the title something of a misnomer. These actions are addressed in Mr Pfanz' Culp's Hill and Cemetery Hill in the same fine detail, however."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"Hour by hour you are irresistible drawn into the noise, smoke, confusion and death which was war in the 1860's. The anecdotal detail gives the book a life of its own. Well worth a second reading."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"This book arrived in excellent condition. Great service. This book is a detailed narrative of the events of the second day at the battle at Gettysburg. Great book."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"I have read all three of Pfanz's books and consider them first rate. Anyone wishing to understand the full concept of the Gettysburg campaign should read these books. However I recommand them for serious students of the battle, to fully appriciate them and the detailed analysis you really need to first have more than basic understanding of the subject."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"Considering the author was a former historian at the battlefield, this book offers the most in-depth account of what occurred before, during, and after the three-day battle at Gettysburg. A must-read for anyone interested in the Civil War, but take note that it is very detailed, listing countless names and locations."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"I have heard that Harry Pfanz has probably forgotten more about Gettysburg than many will ever learn about the battle. In my humble opinion, after reading Gettysburg The Second Day, there is much truth to that statement.Pfanz' narrative is full of details about Little Round Top, Devil's Den, the Stony Hill, the Wheatfield, Rose Farm and Woods, and other important landmarks during the July 2 conflict. He weaves terrain features in with descriptions of several units in the conflicts.While some people criticize Pfanz for too much battle narrative and little analysis (saves it for the last chapter), I personally enjoyed the book. If you are the kind of reader who enjoys reading battle narratives and descriptions of the participants, then this is the book for you.The main gripe I have with the book concerns the maps. While excellent (goes down to the regimental level, clear terrain features, and has a unique description of the action portrayed in the map), there are not enough. Unfortunately, this is an all too common weakness in many Civil War titles. While Pfanz' narrative is full of interesting details, not having enough maps is distracting when trying to comprehend the actions of several units during the engagements. While there are 13 maps in the book, there easily could have been at least 20 total to provide more clarity to the action.Complaint aside, I recommend this book as the definitive title on the second day at Gettysburg. I plan to refer to this book often during my next trip to Gettysburg. Read and enjoy! Recommended."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"This book is part of Harry Pfanz's three-volume study of the Battle of Gettysburg, with the other two volumes exploring the first day of the battle and the fighting on the right of the Union line at Cemetery Hill and Culp's Hill.In &quot;Gettysburg: the Second Day&quot; (1987), Dr. Pfanz explores the fighting on the Union left at Gettysburg on July 2, 1863. This was the critical, pivotal aspect of the Battle of Gettysburg and probably has more claim to be denominated the &quot;high-water mark of the Confederacy&quot; than does Pickett's charge on July 3.Pfanz offers a wealth of information and detail in presenting this confusing and complicated day of Battle. His story begins with a brief review of the Confederate invasion of the North and of the Union Army of the Potomac's successful attempt to shadow Lee and follow him into Pennsylvania. He describes General Meade assuming control of the Union Army on June 28, 1863, and his efforts to concentrate the dispersed Union forces to meet the Confederate threat. He spends substantial time, as he must, discussing the placement and movement of the two armies and the strategies adopted by both Meade and Lee following the fighting on July 1. He stresses, properly, how each commander lacked essential information about the activities of the enemy.There is a thorough discussion of the deployment of the troops on July 2, particularly of Union General Sickles near-disastrous placement of his Third Corps in front of the rest of the Union line. He discusses judiciously and well the disagreements between Lee and Longstreet over the course to be pursued on day 2. Following these lengthy preliminaries, most of the book discusses the fierce fighting on the Union left from about 4:00 to 7:00 p.m. on July 2, including the action at Devils' Den, Little Round Top, the Wheatfield, the Peach Orchard, the Union Center, and the ultimate repulse of the Confederate advance.The detail of the book is convincing but sometimes is cluttered. In Dr. Pfanz's account, it is frequently difficult to separate the essential from the detail. Most of the account is given over to discussions of individual actions and individual company and brigade commanders. The is substantial attention to individual soldiers and units which, again, occasionaly interferes with the broad picture. There are biographies of virtually every commander at the level of General as well as of many soldiers of lesser rank.There was a factual omission that struck me: Dr. Pfanz does not mention the mortal wounding of Confederate General Dorsey Pender, a Division commander in Hill's Corps. Pender was preparing to lead his troops in an attack on the Union center in support of the attack by Anderson's troops when he was felled. I have seen many accounts of the fighting on the second day that contend that the mortal wounding of Pender was critical to the ultimate result of the Confederate attack on the Union center on day 2. Perhaps these accounts overstate the case, but I am surprised Dr. Pfanz did not mention it.This is not an account for beginning students of the Battle of Gettysburg, but it is essential for those who are ready to and interested in exploring the Battle in detail. Further, the book is narrowly focused and makes little attempt to integrate the Battle of Gettysburg into the broader military history of the Civil War, much less into the political and social history of the times. Readers wanting to understand the Battle of Gettysburg and its place and meaning in the overall Civil War effort will need to explore detailed studies of the Civil War years in addition to Dr. Pfanz's painstaking treatment of the action at Gettysburg."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"I have to confess to long having been confused by the struggle at Gettysburg for Devil's Den, the Wheatfield, and the Peach Orchard. Pfanz's book does a terrific job at sorting out what happened where, and when. His meticulous attention to detail will pay handsome dividends to the careful reader. The emphasis is decidedly tactical, focusing on the actions of individual units at the brigade and regimental level, with scant attention paid to corps or even divisions. Thus, readers who complain about Pfanz's analysis at these higher levels miss the point of the book. The stories and individual anecdotes are fascinating. I can hardly wait for the snow to clear so I can walk the battlefield again, this time with Pfanz's terrific book in hand."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"Decidedly for the Civil War buff, this meticulous book discusses the components of the attack on the Union left in the late afternoon of July 2. There is little or nothing about any engagements at Culps Hill on the right the same day. However, the waves of attack on the left are fully documented. This is slow but thorough reading, and one is unlikely to find any other exposition in greater detail. One drawback, there are only a few photos of the battlefield, and relatively few maps to help keep track of the complex action. But, there are many vignettes and interesting backgrounds of key leaders on both sides. The relative time frames are not distinguished clearly, but the key components (Round Tops, Wheatfield, battery duels, etc.) are well expounded in considerable detail. A must for one fascinated by the penultimate battle of the War."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"Fantastic book!! Not only does Mr Pfanz describe individuals associated with the second day of fighting at Gettysburg, but he also gives excellent summaries of the units fighting as well. The definitive book for the 2nd day of battle at Gettysburg. A MUST for Civil War historians and enthusiasts alike"},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"Very detailed fighting of the 2nd day. A suggestion is to bring the book when visiting the battlefield. You can use the maps in the book to get a better understanding of the troop movements."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"I wanted to learn about the second day of battle at Gettysburg. I found it all here plus much more of the days up to Gettysburg."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"I cant conceive of a better treatment of the second day at Gettysburg. Eventhough Pfanz deals with the details of regimental movements, it is well blended with vingettes of the participants at the battle as well as brief historical background information of regiments and personalities. The maps are very very good, better than his maps in Day One. Unfortunately, the first map isnt until page 120 and this is after much discussion of the troop movements through the month of June. The seasoned WBTS reader should know to have his own atlas. But, I found myself printing out current maps of southern PA and northern MD. Treatment of the subject matter is great with an acknowledged emphasis on the Union movements. A must have for the Gettysburg student."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"Few people can do an in-depth study of July 2, 1863 that is both readable and detailed. This day saw what James Longstreet later called \\"the best four hours of fighting ever\\". The I Corps came very close to breaking the Union line but in the end was broken in some of the hardest fighting the war had seen.The author takes 149 pages for Longstreet's attack to step-off. These well-spent pages build a full picture of the battle. In addition to establishing a firm foundation on how this plan came into being. This is essential to any understanding of July Second the arguments, attacks and rebuttals that followed these men into their graves. Thirteen maps, at critical points, keep the action clear and provide the need visual reference. The Wheat Field, The Peach Orchard, Devil's Den and Little Round Top names written large in our history and the author tells us why. The stories are all here. The storied regiments, gallant brigades that gave their all each refusing to give way or stop pushing. Barksdale's charge late in the day that almost but not quite breaks the line.Gettysburg is an American legend. The second day's battle is the heart of the legend and this book makes it a white-knuckle page-turner. This is the best book on the market for July Second at Gettysburg."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"Harry W. Pfanz has written down the most information about the Gettsburg battle in the Civil War then anyother author. The facts just surprise you. I knew alot about Gettsburg before this book but I learned so much more by reading this. I want the world to know that Gettsburg was worse then what people believe it was."},{"Title":"Gettysburg--The Second Day","review":"Pfanz's contribution to telling the story of Day #2 is incredible. The amount of facts,details and personal stories of individuals caught in the fray of battle is superior to other books on the subject. While Pfanz captures the horrors of chaos in battle it is backed by descriptive narration which allows the reader to feel the impact. It is hard not to feel or imagine being a witness on the various fields and skirmishes taking place due to Pfanz's absolute detail of the action. This book covers the entire events of Day #2 from start to finish. On another note, the book seems to have a pro-northern flavor as more is covered from the Northern perspective. As Union troops come to the field or organize for battle, more is covered from their vantage point than from view or thought structure of Lee's second day attacks. I would have liked to see the material more balanced when it came to the content, but overall this book is a must have for anyone interested in knowing more detail on the Battle of Gettysburg!"},{"Title":"Quadrille;: A romantic comedy in three acts","review":"The lovers aren't young, but their romantic dilemmas prove stageworthy, and I can only imagine that with the Lunts in the case, the original productions of QUADRILLE must have been splendid fun, if no great shakes dramatically. Actually I give Coward more credit than he usually gets in the postwar years. He wasn't just repeating his great successes of the 20s over and over again, he was changing his game continuously throughout his life. Pity that so many of his shows were unsuccessful for one reason or another. Changing public taste? Or maybe the public's taste hadn't changed enough to keep up with the new, humanist, heart on his sleeve Coward. Seems almost as if the freak success of BRIEF ENCOUNTER in midcareer made Coward think that audiences wanted authenticity (or, at any rate, tears and lots of them) instead of his trademark irony. Here, Axel Diensen, a US railroad magnate (lots of heroic speeches about \\"the Iron Horse\\" conquering the plains and the deserts and mountains of the American West) has lost his wife Charlotte to Hubert, the Marquis of Heronden, also a married man with a lovely, ignored wife who has for too long ignored Hubert's infidelities in the name of sophistication.Today all of that stops as Axel persuades Serena to chase down Charlotte and Hubert from London to the Riviera, to prevent scandal by bringing home their errant partners. Along the way, they fall in love themselves. Thus the tables are turned in a predictable, but ultimately satisfying way. The play is set in Victorian England for some reason, presumably to allow Lynn Fontanne to wear bustles and parasols, and to give Cecil Beaton free rein designing every single visual element of the piece, including the program you hold in your hands.It's sort of cute and can boast at least one first rate theatrical surprise. This was the sort of play that JD Salinger had Holden Caulfield sneer at in the opening pages of CATCHER IN THE RYE, but if you, like I, have a higher tolerance for the \\"phony\\" than Holden, you might enjoy this piece as much as I."},{"Title":"Imagery of Lynching: Black Men, White Women, and the Mob","review":"I read this book both in college and as a teacher, I used excerpts for my high school classroom. This book is great b/c it uses images not only to show the horrors of lynching but also to show how art and images were used in anti-lynching campaigns. The book gives an overview of how lynching imagery has been used throughout history and I find there to be enough pictures. The text itself provides many speicifc examples which is why it has a lot of text. Each image is carefully analyzed and then background for the time period is given. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about lynching in a greater historical context rather than just a simplisitic view. If you are interested in more than just how terrible lynching was, this book as a lot of chapters on the impact and what it means today."},{"Title":"Imagery of Lynching: Black Men, White Women, and the Mob","review":"This is not the book I was expecting. For that, go toWithout Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America, which I rate at five stars and which so sickened me that I thought of Ike Eisenhower ordering that all those living near the death camps be ordered to march past slowly to see what they tolerated in their midst.This is without question a very respected academic work, an one line jumps out from the first chapter \\"On Looking.\\" It captures the essence of this book perfectly:\\"The power and seduction of specatacle lynching, and its social and moral legitimacy as the embodiment of communal values of law and order, white masculine affirmation, family honor, and white supremacy, depended on the crowd's act of looking.\\" (page 15).My mind swirled around this, thinking of other books (listed below), of genocide, of eugenics (Henry Kissinger's favorite word), of injustice, of moral perversion and cowardliness, of those who allowed the Jews to be persecuted by the Nazis.I am reminded of at least one other author, it may have been Francis Lappe Moore inDemocracy's Edge: Choosing to Save Our Country by Bringing Democracy to Life, who noted that \\"white supremacy\\" has been the death of democracy in America. To that I would add the perversion of the corporation, which stole a legacy intended for freed people of color, and turned into a lifetime license to steal from all.Where this book lost me was in its emphasis in the remainder of the book on how lynching are depicted in art--the wood cuttings and other art images outnumber the actual photographs. All very worthy, to be sure, but at this point the book moves into the realm of the academic rather than the visceral, which is why if you buy only one book, I recommendWithout Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in Americainstead.I won;'t even try to get into today's continued injustice, including red lining black districts to turn them into ghettos, then buying up the real estate at a fraction of its true value, before gentryfing it for resale and much higher prices.My bottom line: we need two Truth and Reconciliation Commissions in America, the first to bring out in the open all of the evils that the white race has inflicted on people of color from the Native Americans to the black slaves to the Chinese slaves to the current dispossessed that now include a heavy leavening of poor whites. The second, with Nelson Mandela and Lee Kuan Yew as co-chairs, can examine the history of the UK and US as colonial powers, unilateral militarists, and predatory capitalists looting the commonwealths of all other lesser developed nations, with the consequence that we have five billion poor instead of seven billion billionaires.See alsoBuried in the Bitter Waters: The Hidden History of Racial Cleansing in AmericaDark Alliance: The CIA, the Contras, and the Crack Cocaine ExplosionThe Big White Lie: The CIA and the Cocaine/Crack EpidemicThe Manufacture of Evil: Ethics, Evolution and the Industrial SystemLost History: Contras, Cocaine, the Press & 'Project Truth'Fog Facts: Searching for Truth in the Land of SpinThe Corporation"},{"Title":"Severed At The Cord","review":"The author exposes an accurate and often painful incite to the injustices evidenced and experienced by every black boy in society regardless of complexion, station, or class. His thoughts and writings are what most men have internalized out of fear of personal or societal persucution. I recommend this novel for any reader that is not afraid of knowing truth as depicted from this obvious strong, confident writer and black man. I also caution the reader to examine oneself and the societal impact of the subjects discussed before developing an opinion of this work. I am continually encouraged, from the knowledge gained from this novel, as a professional black man in today's society to continue to bear my cross and &quot;fight on.&quot; For those of you that are a part of the &quot;struggle,&quot; be it black, white, green, or purple, I encourage reading this book to understand the plight of/against America's Black Boys from the womb to adulthood. It is actually more than a brief, it is LIFE."},{"Title":"RARE SPACE: POEMS.","review":"This book of poems is the best I've read. It's cynical and taut at the same time."},{"Title":"THE GIANT SNAKES","review":"This is written by a first class herpetologist in a very readable and sometimes humerus writing style.It is a fascinating book on a fascinating group of snakes.I read it cover to cover.If you own a so called Giant Snake as I do you will love this book and learn a lot at the same time."},{"Title":"Beatrice's Spell: The Enduring Legacy of Beatrice Cenci","review":"Not really about Beatrice Cenci, this book is a study of the sinister, and maybe fatal, fascination her story has had on a group of writers and artists.The sad story of Beatrice Cenci is simply told. In 16th Century Rome, she was abused by her rich and powerful father. Her many appeals for justice and relief fell on the deaf ears of people afraid to intercede. Unable to escape or get help, she plots with her brother, her step mother and two servants to kill her father, end the abuse, and disguise the death as an accident. When the death is ruled a murder, they are tortured into confessions and then brutally executed for their crime. Almost 200 years later a painting by Guido Reni is found that many believe is a portrait of Beatrice painted on the eve of her death.Her father's abuse of Beatrice is never specified, but he was a known sadist and a sodomite. In Rome, Beatrice, although convicted by the law, was popular both at the time of her death and for hundreds of years after. Reni's painting did much to extend her legend to the many foreign visitors to Rome.But what Belinda Jack does is to look at how the story of the Cenci deeply affected the life and work of a group of authors and artists. This is a work of literary biography. The main focus is on the authors Percy Shelley, Herman Melville, and Nathaniel Hawthorne, the sculptor Harriet Hosmer, and the playright and actor Antonin Artaud.The weakest part of this book is that Ms. Jack searches for the unspeakable in the lives of these people. What proof is there of the most secret of crimes? So while she is \\"grimly\\" engrossed in her study, all that she can truly point to is that these people \\"share various common traits and preoccupations.\\"These include a need to expose taboos, significant relationships with fathers or father figures, an interest in violence or even sadism, extreme responses to guilt, and bouts of severe depression or madness. In each case, learning the story of Beatrice Cenci exacerbates their imbalances, while compelling them to relate the story in their work.This is a deeply disturbing book that hints at the profound impact of paternal sexual and physical abuse on people. Yet it is a book that brings to literary criticism itself an exposure of a hidden and unspoken tradition. For that reason, I feel this is an important work that will have lasting influence."},{"Title":"Beatrice's Spell: The Enduring Legacy of Beatrice Cenci","review":"There's an interesting book to be written about Beatrice Cenci & the arts, but this isn't quite it. There's remarkably little time spent thinking about her story and its reception: a good chunk of the book is potted histories of the lives of the authors, which don't bring much new to the table - although it is nice to hear about Harriet Hosmer, who always appears in marginal figures. There's at least one glaring error: Pierre (1852) was not Melville's last novel, as he published Israel Potter (1855) and The Confidence Man (1857) after it, to say nothing of the unpublished Billy Budd. Her reading of Pierre, for what it's worth, leaves a great deal to be desired: it's an extremely tangled novel which she doesn't do enough to untangle, even though the portrait of Beatrice Cenci plays a major role - instead, she concentrates on Melville's life. I would have liked to see more on Moravia's play - or other Italian treatments of the story, which must exist - his play remains one of the most sustained treatments of the Cenci theme and deserves scrutiny, even if nobody reads Moravia any more. Would also liked to have learned more about the reception of Guido Reni's painting - though it was evidently accorded the same respect as the Mona Lisa in the 19th century, now it hangs neglected in the Galleria Barberini. Why? This painting does make an appearance in David Lynch's Mulholland Drive just as it does in Pierre - but alas, Belinda Jack doesn't mention this."},{"Title":"Beatrice's Spell: The Enduring Legacy of Beatrice Cenci","review":"Belinda Jack's poignantly erudite discourse on the life and subsequent artistic response to the events surrounding Beatrice Cenci who was executed in 1599 for the murder of her father, Francesco Cenci, a man portrayed by history as sadistically brutal to all he encountered and whose sexual perversions extended to his own family is a work that doesn't quite end up delivering the richness of artistic and literary impact to the discussed artists/writers that is implied in the introduction.Drawing first, in the introduction, on the similarities to enduring incest myths, then to Corrado Ricci's attempt to truly define the face behind the painting commonly held to be that of Beatrice Jack's states her intention to examine the reality behind the accusations and the subsequent literary impact Beatrice had on personages such as Shelley, Hawthorne and Artaud.The first two chapters deal with, firstly, the trial and execution of Beatrice, her mother Lucrezia and brother Giacomo, going into particular detail on the nature of the \`day' and her younger brother Bernardo's prison sentence. Secondly, with the crime itself, the half-hearted attempts to cover it up and the subsequent trial plus a brief history of the Cenci family, stressing the nature of the personality of Beatrice's father and his repeated jailing over his life for various personal crimes against people.Come chapter Three, Jack moves to deal with Shelley. Immediately opening with Shelley's own words on seeing the Guido Reni portrait Jack then goes to briefly outline the concept that Shelley was a poet looking for an audience and his fascination with Beatrice can be seen in the posthumously published \`Julian and Maddalo'. After a history of Shelley's short life over 27 or so pages, the link to Cenci finally comes with Shelley's only completed play, \`The Cenci' and Jack draws the conclusion that \\"his discovery of Francesco Cenci, whose character vindicated Shelley's deep suspicions about the motivation of fathers in relation to their daughters.\\"Chapter Four moves to Herman Melville. Jack again just gives us an account of his life and personality, draws attention to \`Pierre', his last novel and its reference to the Cenci portrait and concludes by moving to Nathaniel Hawthorne. Again, we are subjected to a biography of a man who was affected by firstly the antinomist, Ann Hutchinson and later the events surrounding Salem before he eventually came across Beatrice. He produced his final novel directly about the Cenci portrait and two differing reactions to it in the novel \`The Marble Faun'. The chapter on Hosmer gives us a markedly different character to the previous writers. Harriet was a woman fighting against the artistic male prejudice of the Victorian world yet retained her sense of liveliness, sculpting her Beatrice Cenci out of pure interest. The following chapter on the Voyeurs best explains the concentrated artistic interest in Cenci with Jack's opening: \\"The Cenci fever that took hold of the Florence set affected Robert Browning too, but somewhat indirectly\\". This is probably the best chapter of the novel as it dispenses with the somewhat over lengthy biographies that dominate the chapters about individuals and concentrates solely on Cenci impact on Browning, Dickens, Stendahl, Dumas, and Cameron. Finally we come to Antonin Artaud, a somewhat Shelley-esque character whose personal torments mixed with theatrical genius led to a play called Cenci.This is a slender text and I came away feeling that Jack's exploration of her opening gambit is quickly exhausted and there is a good deal of biographical information against the five main artists/writers she has explored, which, though interesting seems more to be \`fill'. Jack's opening sentence is:\\"I am setting out to explore a disturbing subject: the response of writers and artists over the centuries to a young woman's life of extraordinary suffering, and the revenge which led to her own violent death\\".Whilst Jack has identified those writers and artists, all we really have is a mini-biography and -psychoanalysis of them. The analysis of artistic response tends to give way to biography for each and I would have preferred to see more detail on the natures of the responses to Cenci's tragedy rather than their lives before encountering her. The saving grace is that we do get this in Chapter Seven and, for this reader, it saved the book as I confess I found myself skipping large tracts of the biographical sections to find where Jack has dealt with the \\"the response of writers and artists over the centuries to a young woman's life of extraordinary suffering, and the revenge which led to her own violent death\\".As a result I came impressed with the discussion on the collection of personalities for whom the story of Cenci had interested their artistic personalities but feeling that I had to search amongst a lot of \`fill' for those erudite analyses. Jack's book has also stirred (for this reader, at least) interest in the historical story behind Beatrice Cenci and it is to that that I will turn for more information rather than the artists/writers that Jack has detailed."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Adobe Photoshop CS2 in 24 Hours","review":"Title: Sams Teach Yourself Adobe Photoshop CS2 in 24 HoursAuthor: Carla RosePublisher: Sams; 3rd edition (May 13, 2005)ISBN: 0672327554Pages: 528Reviewer: Dorothy FreemanRating: 5 out of 5 starsIntrigued by the title's promise, I recently checked out a book called \\"Sam's Teach Yourself Adobe Photoshop CS2 in 24 Hours\\" written by Carla Rose. I design newspaper and magazine ads, brochures, fliers, posters, web pages and newsletters for an art museum. I've learned to use most of my software programs by the seat of my pants with only a handful of one-day workshop training programs. The trouble with 8 hour workshops is they are only effective, for me, if I can return to work and immediately apply the new knowledge to my daily tasks.I've been using Adobe Photoshop for about two years, to crop and resize photos and to change them from color to grey scale. Most of the other skills I brought back from my workshops were quickly forgotten. Trying to retrieve this information, months later, for a special application was extremely frustrating and usually resulted in me altering my designs to accommodate my limited skills.I don't know how long it would actually take for me to find twenty-four free hours in my busy job. But, what I did find in this book is a very clear and concise primer on \\"How to do just about anything you'd ever need to do with Adobe Photoshop.\\" Even if you don't have time to actually \\"do\\" the chapter lessons, this format makes it easy to access information and directions on how to do anything you want to do in Adobe Photoshop CS2.The book is divided into 24 \\"hour\\" chapters that start with a bulleted list of what you'll learn in the hour along with \\"Did You Know\\" and \\"By the Way\\" tips presented as sidebars which are easy to ignore or access depending on your skill level. The chapters end with a summary along with a short Q&A; workshop, a quiz and applicable exercises. Again, making it easy to skip information if you don't need it or don't have the desire, or time to become an expert. The lessons are loaded with illustrations, conveniently placed near the explanatory text, making it unnecessary to flip through pages. It also includes a \\"Color Gallery\\", a group of plates that clearly illustrate some of the important color applications.The book starts with the basics of learning how to create a new image, finding out what's in your toolbox, along with an excellent shortcut chart, and what all the menu options are. The book ends with an appendix of illustrations for each of the 17 program palettes.I would recommend \\"Sam's Teach Yourself Adobe Photoshop CS2 in 24 Hours\\" to anyone who uses Adobe Photoshop. Even if you don't have the latest version of Photoshop, you can still find clear directions for how to select areas, transform images, adjust colors, use layers, create paths, work with text, apply masks and filters, repair and enhance photographs and prepare your documents for printing or the web. For serious Photoshop users there are 2 chapters devoted to special effects, plug-ins and add-ons.Compared to my New Rider's thousand page tome, \\"Adobe Photoshop: Limited Edition\\" written by Gary and Barbara Bouton, accessing information in this book felt like a walk in the park. I especially appreciated the author's straight forward style with none of the cutesy, made-up characters and scenarios that I find so tedious in the popular \\"for dummies\\" books."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Adobe Photoshop CS2 in 24 Hours","review":"Photoshop is a complex program. Theres no doubt about it, if you're a total PS newb it can be very daunting prospect indeed. There are literally hundreds of books about Photoshop but most are aimed at the experianced, or at the very least someone who has some knowledge already of at some graphics software or other.So then landed in my lap this book. After struggling with \\"Photoshop for Dummies\\" and others of it's ilk this book was a godsend. Whats the point of talking about text masking techniques and CMYK versus RGB when all you really want to know is what is this brush and what does it do exactly? And this book is aimed squarely at this hapless audience, i.e. me. It has a series of logical steps that lead you steadily and carefully by the arm through all PS's set of labyrinthine and amazing (and you will be amazed) menus, tools, and functions. And it does it all very well apart from the occasional hiccup when something doesn't quite make sense, which leads me on the final chapters, or hours, of the lessons in this book, which is where it starts to come apart unfortunately.The problem comes when it finally comes to the knotty task of original composition, and here it's as clear as mud. For instance in hour 18 it asks you to create a background using the gradient tool.. but it hasn't taught you about how to use that yet, that doesn't come until later in hour 20. Oops. Whats worse is the rest of the task is simply too advanced for the reader at this level of tuition to be able to grasp. Later in hour 20 it asks again for a original composition and reason goes completely awol, totally out the window here too. For instance: \\"Make a selection of the upper third of the sky... add clouds... and then do the same with the lower half\\". Right, so is that half the remaining two thirds of the sky or half the rest of the picture or what?!? Then: \\"I just create a brush that looks like a boat and add them to the picture...\\" uh, how do I do that then? Nowhere does it explain in the book how to do this. Theres some poor editing in the in the final chapters and it's a shame because it really lets the side down and it drops my review from a 5 to a 4 star.However if you can ignore the hapless attempts at tuition at original art and when it sticks to what it's good at, namely teaching you the basics of what the various tools are and how they work, and fortunately thats 95% of this book, then it's very good indeed. This is simply the only Photoshop book thats aimed at newbies that I've come across that actually does what it says on the label. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Adobe Photoshop CS2 in 24 Hours","review":"Well, maybe this is not the worst PS CS2 book, since I haven't read all books available on this subject. But I have to say it is a pretty boring one. The authors throw out lots of conceptual stuff before really going into each topic covered, maybe good for pros, but definitely a disaster for beginners. I am not sure what kind of readers the authors had in their minds when wrote the book. Beginners? then the book is sometimes very confusing for a novice without much experience on PS; pros? the whole book talks about very basic stuff not interesting to anyone who has used PS for a while.Overall, the book is very boring and somewhat difficult to follow. If you check out the earlier editions in this series (teach yourself PS in 24 hrs), you'll find out they didn't get a decent feedback except for some comments from the so called Adobe Certified Experts saying 'this is really good'. Well, being Certified Experts only means you have good skills in using PS. When it comes to judging a book, I'd rather trust readers like myself. Actually, I have gone through reviews of most PS (7, CS and CS2) books I could find on Amazon. You know what? This series is probably the only one which got bad reviews consistently. So, think again before you pull out your credit card.By the way, I give the bad rating not because I spent money on the book. Fortunately I borrowed it after I got the software. Instead, I bought books by Martin Evening, Deke McClelland (the Bible) and Jack Davis (wow book). I am also waiting for the Real World PS CS2 coming out.

This book attempts to educated the reader in a \\"standard Tibetan language\\". They mention the three main dialects of U-tsang, Amdo, and Kham and claim that great interaction between them is leading to this standardization. It has not be my experience nor have I seen other scholars even mention the existence of such a standardization. From what I have learned the three dialects are quite different to the point of mutual misunderstanding. I do not feel that this book prepared me to speak Amdo, nor would it prepare anyone else to speak either Amdo or Kham. If that is your goal, good luck finding any book that can do that. But, for most people this is irrelevant. Most interaction with Tibetans by Westerners is with central U-tsang Tibetans. I never thoought about it before, but most of the Tibetan exiles are central/U-tsang.Upon further consultation with some Tibetans I have come to the conclusion that some mishmash of the dialects does exist in the Tibetan diaspora in India. So this book would be more useful there. Keep in mind though that the original exodus into India consisted mostly of Central Tibetans and so this new amalgamation likely favors that dialects sensibilities."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Tibetan Phrasebook (Tibetan Phrasebook, 2nd ed)","review":"My main objective was learning to speak some Tibetan on a conversational level, and not just a traveler's level. The book teaches the writitng system and enough grammar to be able to correctly speak Tibetan as we speak everyday English. Nothing too deep and technical, but nothing too brief. The small book is absolutely jam-packed with words and phrases. It suits the need of both the traveler and one who wants a basic conversational ability in Tibetan. It's value exceeds the price greatly!"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Tibetan Phrasebook (Tibetan Phrasebook, 2nd ed)","review":"I've been to Tibet five times now, and each time I have carried my now well worn copy of this phrasebook with me. Without it, I'd be at a real loss. It is has proven wonderful for communicating with locals - not only in Lhasa, but also in far more remote parts of the country. It is safe to say that using this phrasebook has enhanced my experiences in Tibet many times over.If I did have one criticism of it, it would be that while it does have a brief English to Tibetan Dictionary in back, it would greatly benefit from a Tibetan to English Dictionary as well. So many times Tibetans have picked up the phrasebook from me and searched in vain for a word that they are trying to find.But that criticism is minor. If you're traveling in Tibet on your own, this phrasebooks is a must. Depending on how long you're going to be in the country, you may want to consider the LP Mandarin Phrasebook as well....."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Tibetan Phrasebook (Tibetan Phrasebook, 2nd ed)","review":"I bought this book to get a little understanding of the Tibetan language. I got more than I expected. The phrasebook not only contains the most common phrases, but also a quick overview of the grammar and the alphabet.

I haven't got to travel to tibet as of yet, but I do attend teachings at a Drikung Kagyu monastery where I interact with a few native tibetans. I must admit, I usually chicken out when it comes to trying to really speak. But it is soooo fun to be able to find words and phrases that I already know from practices and be able to see them in other usage.A terrific book! Ok, one thing, the print, especially the tibetan script is tiny, but then there is so much info crammed in this pocket-sized book, who can really complain. if you have a hard time with little print, throw a little reading magnifier strip in your pocket with it :)"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Tibetan Phrasebook (Tibetan Phrasebook, 2nd ed)","review":"I've recently returned from a few weeks in Tibet. One of my group had this phrase book and we tried to use it to speak with our driver. A few things: First, a pronunciation guide would have helped. Second, we found some common words missing, or at least were not able to find them the way the book is laid out. We ended up drawing pictures on Post-Its to communicate with our driver and learn words from him in this way."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Tibetan Phrasebook (Tibetan Phrasebook, 2nd ed)","review":"This is a great book to take when you travel as it fits easily in any bag. There are phrases for pretty much any topic you would need to discuss and the layout makes it easy to find what you need.

I also love having the English-Tibetan dictionary in the back."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Tibetan Phrasebook (Tibetan Phrasebook, 2nd ed)","review":"Like most of the books in this series, Lonely Planet attempts to offer the best of all worlds and does a fairly consistent job of it. This phrasebook provides some basic background information on the language and its grammar but I have never found their transliteration schemes to be very accurate for the average American English speaker.Within its covers, you will find just about every essential phrase the average traveler could ever hope for. Its compact size and price make it the cheapest foray available into the Tibetan language. The Tibetan script is included throughout for those who are interested in seeing the written word or just want to point out phrases instead of attempting to pronounce them correctly.At less than $6 USD on average, every Tibetan language enthusiast should have a copy of this phrasebook."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Tibetan Phrasebook (Tibetan Phrasebook, 2nd ed)","review":"MY PROBLEM IS THAT I HAVE STILL NOT RECEIVED THE TIBETAN PHRASE BOOK.

All of these things are positive changes.However, this \\"Deluxe\\" laminated edition does not function well as a field edition because it is a black star on white background edition. Such editions are not favored by deep sky observers because the reflection of one's reading light off of the predominantly white page has adverse effect on one's dark adapation. Also, the galaxies are represented as red ovals and practially disappear under red light. (A similar problem occurs with Tirion's Cambridge Sky Atas which is similarly usless for field work). If this is the case, why offer a laminated editon of the \\"Deluxe\\" (white paper, black stars) in the first place?I was unable to find a copy of the Lamiated \\"Field\\" edition on Amazon, and, asuming that the reason for this was that the company would not manufacture a lamiated edition that was not suitable for field work, I bought it.It is a handsome desk reference, but if you're looking for something to use out under the stars, I'd search around for the \\"white stars on black paper\\" edition."},{"Title":"Sky Atlas 2000.0, 2nd Deluxe Laminated Version","review":"For years the Sky Atlas 2000.0 has been the most popular atlas step up from a 6th magnitude atlas. The 8th magnitude limit is deep enough to enable users to find Neptune and the brighter asteroids. The large charts, while they can be a bit awkward to handle, are great to view, as they show wide swaths of sky.The Second Edition brought some significant improvements: a useful step up to magnitude 8.5, galaxy shapes which show size and orientation, better representation of star magnitude, detailed charts of the Orion region and Virgo Galaxy Cluster. If you are debating between a used First Edition and a new Second Edition, get the Second; it's worth the extra money.A few shortcomings remain. The charts are arranged in ascending order of right ascension. This presents problems with editions which are bound on the left side. When users reach the right edge of the chart, they have to stifle the instinct to continue right to the next page, force themselves to reverse direction, and turn--of all places--to the previous page instead. The same with the left edge. Charts should be ordered in descending RA like Uranometria or Millennium. Ordering by ascending RA is a pointless tradition.Some of the versions are bound at the top, which solves the problem of the chart sequence--and makes the book less floppy to handle--but makes it harder to search for charts. Since the chart number is at the top right, the user cannot see what page they have their fingers on until the book is completely open.The pages of the laminated versions are very sturdy for field use but hard to grasp and separate, especially when moist with dew. This and the previous problem could be solved by adding numbered, graspable tabs to the bottom of each chart.A badly-needed improvement to the atlas came in a subsequent printing of the second edition: around the edges of each chart are noted the numbers of the charts which adjoin it. This greatly simplifies navigation through the atlas. It would be good to take this measure a step further and, on each chart, mark adjacent chart borders as well to save guesswork as to where each one ends and the next begins.The many virtues of this atlas have been amply documented by other reviewers. The space I have spent on the shortcomings is simply an attempt to round out the picture. The many improvements already made to this work speak well of the publisher's commitment to an excellent atlas. The Sky 2000.0 is now only a couple steps short.So which atlas to choose for your observations? I would completely ignore the 6th magnitude atlases on the market. For a beginning to intermediate observer, the magnitude 7.6 Pocket Sky Atlas is very well designed and affordable. For intermediate observing, the Sky Atlas 2000.0 is an excellent choice. For advanced observers who frequently go deep, I would suggest skipping the Sky Atlas and bringing both the Pocket and the Millennium along on outings."},{"Title":"Sky Atlas 2000.0, 2nd Deluxe Laminated Version","review":"It's good to have every aspect of stars & galaxyBut it's not plotted for normal star observants."},{"Title":"Sky Atlas 2000.0, 2nd Deluxe Laminated Version","review":"Perfect for the serious amateur astronomer.

Just watching them handle the HEAVY trays of hot food and always being so pleasant with customers is an art in itself. Debra Ginsberg revealed so much more about the \\"behind the scenes\\" which is the most underrated profession and the working conditions in restaurants with humor, empathy, and an understanding of what a waitress must endure when encountering with all sorts of customers, mainly the cheap people who refuses to leave a tip - if you can't leave a tip, don't eat at restaurants!! Remember, all workers, no matter what their profession is, have to make a living and everyone has bills to pay. Everyone who frequents into a restaurant SHOULD READ this book because they will have a better understanding why NO WAITRESS should get a lousy tip. Debra shared the most insightful and SURPRISING revelation on which holidays was the most or least rewarding to be on call. A wonderful read and I appreciate this profession so much more and it deserves minimum of 20% tip!!"},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"This is a must read for anyone who has ever worked in food service of any kind.

After the first 50 pages, the novelty of my newly-aquired knowledge of restaurant drama wore off.From the very beginning, I found Debra Ginsburg's writing sophomoric. I was irritated by her overuse of adverbs (especially \\"truly\\").I also didn't find much in the way of character development. She never gave the reader so much as a hint of other interests.I was expecting something amazing like \\"Kitchen Confidential\\". I agree with the reviewer who stated that this author bit off more than she can chew."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book because the premise looked good -- a book by a woman who's been waiting tables for 20 years. I thought it could be an interesting insight into her character or insight into the restaurant biz. Unfortunately, the book fails on both counts. As to her character, she comes across as whiney and passive. All her life decisions are made for her. She graduates from college and becomes a waitress in order to write. Does she write? Very little. She just drifts around from one dreadful restaurant to another. Even when she turns up pregnant by a long-gone boyfriend, there's not a even a moment of introspection. No thoughts as to how being a single mom might affect her life, or the baby's life. Just a &quot;oh I'm pregnant...going to be a mommy.&quot;Only one of her many sisters is identified by name. Other weird things are dropped into the text without explanation. When her father ran the pizza parlor in Portland, she says her mother would come in after work (no mention of what sort of work) and sit in a booth until closing time. Just sit and stare off into space, apparently. Why? What was going on? Most of her family remain shadowy background figures. (And she herself is pretty much a cypher so interesting people are scarce in the text.)Instead, chapter after chapter are filled with horror stories of terrible restaurants with even more terrible patrons. (I have worked as a food server and it's astounding how many awful co-workers and customers she encounters.) These stories are told as &quot;here's a typical day at retaurant X.&quot; So even these descriptions are pastiches and &quot;not real.&quot; In fact, that's what was missing in this book, a sense of truth being told. It feels dishonest. (And loads and loads of filler -- a whole chapter analyzing movies with waitress characters, for example. A dumb idea and executed without insight.) After reading &quot;Kitchen Confidential,&quot; this book was a real letdown."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"The book arrived quickly and in excellent condition. Can't wait to read it and pass it along to my daughter who is a server in a very nice establishment in Florida and probably can identify wigh many of the situations presented in the book."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I hate to give this book 3 stars simply because I related to it so much. That is because I have worked in the restaurant industry for over 20 years myself.

I believe anyone who has never worked in a restaurant would definately find this book entertaining."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I thought Bruce's book of the same title was much better, and truer to my own experiences as a server.

My father made me keep my truck stop waitress job the summer before I left for college; it took me a while to understand why he did that.

Ginsberg keeps a fine balance between love and hate, details and sensationalism."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Easy to read and understand with situations that will have all of those in the service industry nodding their heads. Kudos to the author on her publication. On a down side, I felt the book was too personal to the author's life and tended to read like her autobiography (biography?). I was looking for more generalized situations and funny stories and less about her life."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I was totally surprised by this book. I first had no intentions to buy any book about waitresses or waiter. I am not a big fan of tipping and I am from somewhere tipping is not customary, rather an unusual situation (tips are already included in checks). However, I could not drop the book since the moment I started reading it.Ginsberg does not try to make &quot;big-wise&quot; statements about world, yet she does not try to criticize her life or justify it in front of readers. She just loves to write and she is incredibly good at it.I loved the way she tells the little, ordinary stories behind her customers, descriptions and observations. Her peace with herself and her talent for writing are two things make this novel special.I definitely recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I am a 7th grader from Markham Place School.

I thought this one would have some good stories and was impressed with reader reviews. Unfortunately I was disappointed. I rarely stop reading a book before the end but at about 75% I couldn't take it anymore. Just a long life story about someone who happens to be a waitress. No juicy stories to speak of and much much longer than necessary. Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Oddly enough, I recieved a copy of this book, as a gift, three years ago. After rushing my education, recieving a Master's degree at 21, I found myself still employed as a server. Needless to say, I related to the story, which some may argue, is why I rated it a five. Most people take for granted, how many educated servers there are and how annoyed we get when you treat us like a \\"dumb server.\\" If I have any hopes for this book, it's that some non-service industry types read it and get a better understanding of \\"the other side.\\"I found this book to be a quick and easy read, but very enjoyable.

Definately a must read for anyone that has waited tables and a should read for anyone that has or will ever eat out."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Fun read - I have waitressed for 17 years and Debra Ginsberg tells it like it is. I think anyone who has waitressed will find it full of humor. The feint of heart will even find the comedy in the tales of a waitress. And yes these things really do happen. I especially was fond of the tales of romance within the restaurant settings, it's so true. Pick it up and read it. It's a book you can read through while riding on the train, commuting or just sitting around the house on a lazy day. The burnout is true. . ."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"An enjoyable bit of escapism for anyone who has ever &quot;waited&quot; themselves. Just don't expect the gritty brilliance of &quot;Kitchen Confidential.&quot; This book is a far rosier and less interesting look at the restaurant biz, but it's likeable. I do think Ginsberg spends a lot of time justifying why she's college-educated and waitressing. In my book, it's okay, and it gets a little tiresome that she goes on about it."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"In the face of reality, how many of us actually turned out the way we had hoped for?The way I see this book, it is the writer's self-reflection under the guise of \`memoirs of a waitress'. The writer sometimes found herself deviating from the subject of waiting and instead concentrating on her life-experience, which I find interesting and quite well written.It is difficult to strike a balance and yet keep the two areas well integrated. Her life experience flows according to chronological order throughout the book, but the flow of the waiting part kind of degenerated towards the later chapters.Perhaps it would sell more copies if it is more commercialised, such as the inclusion of more sensational and exaggerated stories.However, I like this book, because it is about life, as is, nothing more and nothing less."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"There are few jobs as unrewarding, financially and spiritually, as waiting on other people. However, this book really puts the process into a great perspective.Like so many things in life, you get out of waiting on others what you put into it.

I mean, we all visit restaurants and, probably have worked in food service at one point or another. I think it's a situation that many people can see themselves in. A great book, with a funny and witty take on life.

I wish everyone that ate in restuarants would read this book. I am a slow reader and sped thru this book. I couldn't put it down. I too,am a waitress and have chosen it as my career for the same reasons as Debra,my children.I can so relate to everything she saids in her book. Everything in the book is so true to life about working in a restuarant,the people, coworkers, managers,what goes on behind in small, closed places........When I finished the book I told my managers and coworkers that I believed Debra was a Writer/Waitress that worked in our restuarant under another name and that one of the stories in the book was about me and she gave me another name!!I wish we could sell this book at the door of my resturant to educate guests. I'm passing the book around to my coworkers because they are in it also and my server at a mexican restuarant that we are regulars at.

It also reinforced my belief in overtipping.....They do work hard for the money."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Though hesitant to purchase it at first, I really enjoyed this book. I've never been a waitress, but it made me feel as though I had. Admittedly, it's a bit self absorbed. You might think, Who is this woman? and Why should I care about her life story? But Ginsberg is a natural storyteller who drew me right in. This slice-of-life book illustrates the warm relationships the author shares with her family and (mostly transient) friends, as well as the sometimes bizarre, funny, and horrifying interactions she has with her patrons. I found myself eagerly turning the pages, and yet not wanting it to end. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"All I can say is that if ever I questioned the universality of the &quot;waiting life&quot;, I don't anymore. I have waited tables now for years as an easy way to get myself through school and everything Ginsberg talks about has happened to me and the various coworkers I have had over the years.Not only is it a way to laugh at your own follies in the business but also a guide to unskilled diners who think &quot;tipping is a city in china&quot; and that their servers are merely uneducated peons there to accept their personal abuses.I highly recommend this book as it is the only memoir I have ever seen that deals strictly with the trials of being a waitress. In short, it is a quick read and all around good fun. If I could afford it, I would buy a copy for every single person I work with. If you've ever waited tables to make ends meet, this book is a must!!!"},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"*This review is for the hardcover edition*I bought this book for my wife a couple of years ago and forgot about it until I recently saw it on my bookshelf. I'm certainly glad I read it. I've been in the restaurant business for over 25 years, except during an 8 year stint in the Navy. I identified with the lifestyle that she lead and also was amused by her stories, many of which I lived myself, only the names and places changing.I loved the chapters on \\"tipping,\\" \\"the back of the house,\\" and \\"food and sex.\\" They really hit home with me and I found myself nodding and laughing through most of it. The only chapter I didn't care for was the chapter entitled, \\"hello, I'll be your postfeminist icon this evening.\\" Personally, I thought it was out-of-place in the context of the rest of the book, but as I see in other reviews, many liked it. It could be because I'm a man, and only a woman might really understand what she is saying.If you've ever been in the restaurant business, this book is a must read. I'm sure that you will be reminded of good times and bad, but will finish this fasting-reading book with a smile on your face - even if you're still in the business.If you've never had the pleasure of waiting tables, read it to become informed. That person who is waiting on you is not some heartless android, but a real person who deserves respect.

Her book, \\"Waiting,\\" tells how your server views your dining experience. She cleverly juxtaposes the Bureau of Labor Statistics \\"Occupational Outlook Handbook\\" descriptions of the \\"nature of the work\\" with the way it is performed and perceived in the Real World.\\"Waiting\\" is a much better perspective, and much better book, that Dr. Barbara Ehrenriech's snobby study \\"Nickel and Dimed\\" in which the reader gets the impression that the elitist Ehrenriech views her co-workers as mere animals in the zoo through which the author is day-tripping.If, like me, you've \\"been there, done that\\" in the food service industry, you'll relate to Ginsberg's sometimes humorous, sometimes poignant memoir.

One I started reading, I found it hard to put the book down.Several times I laughed out loud as one of her recollections prompted me to recall an experience of my own, be it a colorful co-worker, or a guest that either made my night, or made my night an unbelievable problem.She has shown that waiting tables is not just a job, it's an adventure."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"&quot;Waiting&quot; contains some interesting behind-the-scenes anecdotes about the restaurant business.

The author did a wonderful job of taking the reader on her life's journey. Although I thought this book would be only about waiters and waitresses, I found it to be much more. As a memoir and a coming of age story I found it first rate. Ginsberg's prose wss easy to read and she is at her best when she details the incredibly humourous experiences she had as a waitress. I especially enjoyed her accounts of the sexual exploits in one of the restaurants in which she worked. I laughed out loud many times throughtout this book. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I'd leave Ginsberg an average tip for this non-fiction book about the waiting profession. When it was good- it was very good. At times, Ginsberg was very witty and the stories she tells of her customers over the years were marvelous. But when it wasn't so good, it was a tedious read. I found myself slugging through some of the book in search of (possibly) another good part. Put it this way,it wasn't so bad that you won't want to finish it, but it wasn't the kind of read you'd find that keeps you up 'til 2 a.m. to finish it. Some of the characters or scenes she describes- I found disjointed- why is this in here?- kind of feeling. I liked it and I didn't like it. So I think I'd give this waitress between a 12-15% tip. (My tip to you is- get it at the library but don't buy it)."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"While the author claims to like her work as a waitress, enjoys the flexibility and money, the book is full of complaints about restaurant managers, cooks and customers. And the story wanders in many places; she may be telling a story about a current and yet again unsatisfactory job and start talking about something unrelated and then come back to the present. My head was swimming. There is an undertone of indignation through out the story. I did develop a great appreciation of wait staff, however and do realize how hard they work."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Ultimately, I found this book to be less satisfying and funny than I would have liked. Having read all of the professional reviews, I got the impression that I would be giggling my way through the book. I found myself somewhat resenting the lecturing tone of many passages about the wait staff's lot. Having worked in many different aspects of the service profession at different times, I'm sure there are many more horror stories that could have been included that would be more entertaining than many different blow-by-blow accounts on why it's so hard to be a waitress. I found this book to be a little whiney. It read quickly, and frankly I found myself glad to be done with it, rather than wishing there was more."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I was disappointed in this book. As a former waitress myself, I found this book devoid of the true essence and excitement of working in the restaurant industry. There are missed opportunities to go into detail about colleagues or customers and pull the reader deeper into her tale. Instead, the book is a mishmash of people and places that never build a connection compelling enough to want to read on. The book's only &quot;true confession&quot; is that Ms. Ginsberg does not have a very high opinion of her profession or her customers."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I would highly recommend this book, not only for people who have graced the waiting profession, but also for anyone who eats out. Debra gives great insight into the food service industry with honesty and the sarcasm needed to survive as a waitperson. Through reading this book I gained a deeper appreciation of food service, and also a connection with Debra's personal struggles: working in a family business, single parenthood, love in the workplace, Italian men, and forever waiting... &quot;Well done&quot;, Debra!"},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I have read it over and over again. Ms. Ginsberg is a truly talented writer. She takes an everyday, ordinary life and makes it fascinating to read about. I've never been a waitress but I love her stories."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Excellent book! It gave me an insider's view of a job that is much more difficult than I had ever imagined. I've alwayed believed in tipping well, but now I appreciate the service I recieved even more.I also enjoyed reading about the small, but satisfying, slices of life that Debra shared; not only about herself, but the soap oprahs behind the swinging doors!"},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I really found the premise of this book interesting. And the author has really paid her dues in the food service department. She has that great cynical waitresses humour which can be the best on the planet but is also a little impersonal. Her experience is varied and she portrays it all with a very knowledgable voice. But it is the voice of a toughened heart who has learned to keep a functional, friendly yet guarded smile on her face.Having been a waitress myself, I know there are a lot of mixed feelings to being a part of this family. It feels like she just doesn't trust you enough to tell you how she really feels about her place in the 'food chain'.But, it is really a fun read and you'll really appreciate it if you have ever served a dinner to anyone ever in your life."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Debra Ginsberg wrote my story! Having waited tables for many years in Oregon and in New Jersey I felt so in touch with what her book had to say. I wish everyone would read this book to see how tough waitressing really can be. It also shows that you can do this job and still hold your head up at the end of the night. I loved the intricate love story descriptions in every place she worked. It is such a life consuming job that you are never out in the &quot;real world&quot;. The only way to meet people is in your workplace. Debra Ginsberg captures how it becomes Soap opera city in many restaurants. If you have never waited a table, or bartended in your life, this book will be either an eye opener or a snoozer. It is your choice. I loved this book. Good Job, Debra!"},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"So funny and truly telling that I was amazed. Most of us at one time or another have waited or served coffee or just done the grunt work that never seems appreciated. Well this book just recounts all of that. I wish I had the will and patience to write a book also, but Debra does a great job of telling all of our stories. This book is the gift to give for those people who you have no idea what to get for them. Anyone can appreciate it and it could be especially helpfull to those who have never waited. Maybe, just maybe they'll finally get a clue and realize you may just be getting more than you bargained for in your dinner. ..."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Forget the guy who learned everything he needed to know in kindergarten. Debra Ginsberg got her education in restaurants, and she doles it out just right in this entertaining account. In 20 years of taking orders for everything from popovers to pi&ntilde;a coladas, she gathered a trove of stories she justly terms &quot;passionate, absurd and intimately human.&quot;Between shifts Ginsberg provides us with endearing glimpses of her large and colorful family -- as a waiter, her dad supported his wife and five kids on tips alone. There are also sporadic helpings of her checkered love life.But Ginsberg recalls her romantic failures with nary a hint of bitterness, including the one with the ex-waiter who fathered her son. Best of all is the inside look at staff romances and the truth about whether a server or cook, if pushed too far by a customer, will spit -- or worse -- in your soup. (Don't ask.)A fun, slightly cracked, fluffy omelet of a book. Hold the cheese please!"},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"As a server myself, I often think that EVERYONE should wait tables at least once in their lives. And, they should NEED the money because that makes all of the difference in the world. On the same note, I think that EVERYONE should read this book; make it required reading in the schools! Ms. Ginsberg touched so humorously on all of the aspects of the restaurant industry; the affairs, the money, the customers...I enjoyed this book tremendously. Get it! You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I was a waitress for 3 years and 2 months, and I would quite happily never go back to it again. I was browsing with boredom through Amazon, when I discovered this book, and instantly had to buy it. For me, Debra Ginsberg brings the rubbish world of waitressing to life in this book, and I ended up reading it within a couple of hours, I literally could not put it down. It's so easy to read! Some bits I'd never experienced (I've never worked in a big fancy restaurant for example, just small cafes), and I've never been that attracted to a member of staff to go for it on \\"table 50\\".But some bits did ring true: the lack of tips, the abusive customers, and especially, the cutlery going missing! I experienced that in my second waitressing job, and I still don't know what happened to it, whether the customers were actually stealing the cutlery (and I've heard of STAFF stealing cutlery, to have in their drawers at home, just not where I worked), or whether the dishwasher was eating our cutlery. And yes, if anyone reads this book, and sees the bit where staff actually hurridly washed cutlery, and put it straight back out - we did that. We got so many complaints about that! (Some people are never happy.)This is an excellent book, well-written, very easy to read, and makes you feel sick at the thought of ever eating in a restaurant again. Just be nice to the staff when you're next in one. You don't know what really goes on behind the scenes. If you're a fellow waitress, prepare to laugh in horror at the stuff that you WILL recognise."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Of course, I'm a waitress, so I can relate to Ginsberg's feelings from dealing with bad tippers and rude guests, to that one table that smiles at you and makes your night go by so much easier. It's a tricky job because every guests wants personalized service, but everyone is different! It's just unfortunate that those who really should read the book are those who will probably see Ginsberg as a complainer! Not many people realize how difficult being a foodserver really is - but anyone lucky enough to serve someone who has read this book will be thankful - it really gets under the surface and explains what goes on in our heads during every shift! Since not everyone has to put in their time wearing the apron, everyone should have to read this book, just to get a taste..."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I find it amusing that most of the reviews I've read for this book follow a similar pattern. Former and/or current servers love it. Readers who have never served hate it and even seem angry at Ginsberg for writing it.\\"Waiting\\" is hilarious. It's full of fun tales from behind the scenes in the food service business. Better yet, it's an honest glimpse into the writer's life. Not heavy, but meaty enough make the book more than a collection of amusing anecdotes--which wouldn't be so bad, either.So why do so many non-servers dislike it? Perhaps they don't like knowing that the person overseeing their dining experience is a real person. Maybe they don't appreciate learning how their servers probabaly feel about them. Or maybe they just don't like looking into the mirror Ginsberg places squarely before them in this book.My advice? Why don't you all find a manager to complain to. Maybe you can get a free desert out of it."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I,also, have been &quot;waiting&quot; for many, many years. This is the first book I have ever seen that humanizes a server. We are out there and will stay out there but Debra Ginsberg is the first person who has made the server into a real person.People assume that you are a waitress because you are not educated for anything better. Like the author I am college educated but chose &quot;waiting&quot; because of the hours I could work and the great pay.This is &quot;THE&quot; book to read for people who are currently serving and feel doubtful about their occupation ... also for frequnt diners ... see what the &quot;wait&quot; staff really thinks about youIf this review is not published please send this to the author: thank you Debra. Your book has validated my feelings on being a server. I relate to your feelings on society's perception of a waitress, on your analysis of restaurant managers, how people who work in this profession tend to bond ... EVERYTHING .. thanks for a GREAT book"},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I began this book with the expectation that it was going to be vicariously entertaining by being riddled with war stories from a veteran waitress. It is entertaining, but in an understated and often ironic fashion. Ginsberg's \\"True Confessions\\" is largely an introspective memoir and reads like a sociological study. Frequently, I found myself reminded of Bourdain's \\"Kitchen Confidential\\", perhaps because the territory both covered overlaps, though this hardly an expose.The book has more than its fair share of humorous recollections presented in an unvarnished fashion -- but none will make you laugh out loud. \\"True Confessions\\" is largely a defense of the reasons to endorse working as a \\"server\\" and observations on the behaviors and personalities of restaurant patrons. Throughout the book Ginsberg takes offense over the proletarian pigeonholeing people do of waiters and waitresses. Ironically, however, she doesn't do much to bolster the image with her passages about disfunctional personalities, commonplace alcoholism, and the prevalence sex literally in the work place among employees and patrons. Her descriptions depict a profession that draws more than a fair share of bottom feeders, and the accounts of intimate relationships rather than being titillating instead make you want to take a shower.From the perspective of learning more about a segment of society with whom we all personally interact on a daily basis, yet one most perceive as a lower caste and keep at a distance, this is an interesting read. Ginsberg makes many apt observations, but her writing is some what stilted and wooden, perhaps as a subconscious protest that being educated and a \\"server\\" aren't necessarily mutually exclusive. Rather in than the category of humor, I'd shelve this book with Ehrenreich's \\"Nickel and Dimed\\"; something thought provoking and engaging that will hopefully heighten your sensitivity toward the working class."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Overall good book. Wish she would have written a little more about actual waiting situations but, it was still worth it for the couple situations she did write about."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Dreadful and quite disappointing. What could have been very engaging material suffers from the author's deadly boring style and tendency to overexplain and preach. This woman claims to be a professional writer, yet she has no ability to draw the reader in or to tell a compelling story--and there are many, many compelling stories to be told in the restaurant business."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"One of the basic axioms of a writer is &quot;Don't tell me, show me.&quot; Don't say you're funny. Don't say you can write well. And don't say you have an insight to the basic human experience. Especially when you don't.There was an opportunity for some good stories in this book, and Ginsburg may be a good observor of human nature, but her writing is not particularly compelling and the stories don't grab you."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"The book's introduction explains that it is a true story. Nothing in the book is made up.With that said, it starts with a girl who grows up in upstate New York in a family of two parents and one sister. She works as a waitress in the family diner. I should reiterate that this is all true! It really happened! Then she went to college, graduated, and became a waiter. She moved from job to job, waiting tables. Again, this is not made up! Nothing in this story was fabricated! At one point she had an affair with a man and got pregnant. She raised her son as a single parent while she waited tables. I swear! This is all a true story! It really happened!In other words, this book is a predictable, often mundane, story about a regular person who lives a regular life with regular events and regular people around her. The fact that she stopped waiting tables and wrote a book does not make it any more interesting. I agree with an editor who rejected her manuscript: her story has very little substance. She fills up a lot of pages with commentary - her interpretation of the events and her feelings about what happened... but the events themselves leave much to be desired and her thoughts are not insightful or surprising in any way.There was one gem in the book. At one point a couple is dining at a table while the woman is doing something to her male companion with her hand under the tablecloth. The author asks if she can get them anything else, but she knows he's already getting all he wants, and much more! That was a funny line, the only memorable line in the book. The rest of the book is very, very boring. While I'm sure her life experiences appeal to the author herself, they were not interesting to me as a reader.I read the book from start to finish, but finishing this book was like finishing a chore. I was relieved when it was over so that I didn't have to think about it any more. I will donate my copy of the book; it is not worth keeping. For a dynamic and amusing story, try Fine Dining Madness. It has a lot more material, and the commentary is colorful and entertaining."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"About: Ginsberg describes her long career as a waitress in restaurants ranging from her family's luncheonette to a country club. Plenty of vignettes about ill-behaved restaurant staff and customers here.Pros: The tales and interpersonal relationships she describes on the job can be amusingCons: I read this book after reading Waiter Rant: Thanks for the Tip--Confessions of a Cynical Waiter and found that Ginsberg's work paled in comparison. The chapter on waitressing in the media seemed like a tacked on writing class assignment, and her style lacked any \\"oomph\\" to hold my interest."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"This is a very informative, detailed and sometimes humorous look at the world of waiting. It's just too bad that the telling of this potentially rich and textured tale doesn't sparkle a bit more. Ginsberg's prose is competent, but ultimately flat-footed. It's a pleasant enough read, and very educational to those not familiar with the world of waiting, but don't expect an abundance fresh or probing insights."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I must disagree with summerfield2 in a major way. I feel the author did a good job of telling her story though I skipped the last 20 pages as I wasn't interested in the subject matter of comparing the job of waiting in various movies.The author did not complain about her job, but detailed the raunchy &quot;goings on&quot; in most restaurants among the help and then again the strange &quot;goings on&quot; of certain patrons while at the same time getting out the orders and trying to please the customers.Actually the rate of pay for waiting is quite good compared to the hours worked, but, of course, depending on the restaurant of choice. The hours can be most flexible and the job, though taxing physically, can be very interesting and satisfying. A good read!"},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"If you liked Waiting you'll love this new book out that I just discovered - More Bread, Please by Markus Roberts who was a server in NYC. It goes into more depth and covers some different aspects of the restaurant industry. LOVED IT!"},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Excellent descriptions. Waiters are so under-appreciated. She proves to the general public that waiters are human. My perspective was challeneged. She writes from acccounts that have changed her.

Fun gift for anyone who has ever waited tables."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"... I found the book quite boring. I was hoping for some funny stories and perhaps some perspective on what we can do to make a servers life a little more pleasant and avoid some of those nasty misunderstandings that can lead to mutual unhappiness on both sides. Instead I found myself suffering through a life story that did not interest me in the slightest. Avoid this book if you were hoping she would just stick to talking about the job."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I can't understand why this book was published. There are so many good books in this genre (try &quot;Tender at the Bone&quot; or the restaurant chapter of &quot;Saturday Night,&quot; for example), why publish one that has nothing going for it? The author has no mastery over the use of description, there's no detail about the places, the characters, the work, even her experiences. it's a quick, easy read, but like fast-food, you aren;t so happy when you're finished."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I have been a waitress for twenty years plus, often questioned by friends and family why, I would recomend this book to anyonewondering why thier bright and talented friend or family memberwaiting tables doesn't have a &quot;real&quot; job."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I thought this book was interesting because it swept past the curtain that is the front of the house so that we see the food industry from behind its many facets-&quot;the back of the house&quot; is an entire social/political system of waitressing trying to please their customers while staying on the good sides of their fellow staff. As a waitress that worked in many different food venues, it was entertaing the author's perspective...I think it's amazing that the writer wasn't entirely negative about her waitressing job. True, she was a waitress the better part of twenty years; that kind of longevity does give her an authority of the subject of waiting, from all her experiences. The book isn't a chronological journal of waitressing; with the title &quot;true confessions&quot; I didn't expect this book to be so all-encompassing, but it is both personal and objective. Maybe more objective than expected, still, I hope the book brings waitresses more of the respect, and gratuity, that they deserve!"},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"A very interesting read. Although this story is more of a personal journal there are still pertinant observations about the waiting industry. I learned a tremendous amount about the hardships these people have to endure and I am most certainly more understanding and sympathetic."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"This was a very funny book. It answered all my questions: Yes waiters can sometimes be pushed so hard that they punish an obnoxious guest by spitting the food. Yes, it possible that your flatware isn't clean and it's likely that the chef is insane. After the gross out aspects the book gets complicated. The author tells a bit more about herself than she probably intended. She doesn't come off as being the easiest person in the world to deal with and some of her career and personal choices are hard to understand but luckily just when things start getting grim she tells another funny story. The moral of the tale: Stop looking down and waiters and waitresses and remember that the person who brings you your food better be in a good mood or you may be eating more or less than what you paid for!"},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"As a long time server, I can understand and agree with everything that Ms. Ginsberg has to say about the restuarant business. I'll be recomending this book to all of my server friends. Thank you for such a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"The job of waiter or waitress has been around nearly as long as another form of work I can think of, yet you rarely see anything written about. If you should stumble onto the subject in written form, it rarely, if ever, raises it to the level of profession, yet that is what Debra Ginsberg has done.She gives us a look at a job that is usually frowned upon as a career in a way that will make you realize that maybe it is a career, and a good one at that.I found the stories about the activities at the estableshments where she worked funny, interesting and at times, disgusting. But, whatever the story of the moment, it is told in a well written and enjoyable fashion.In addition to the waitressing stories, we are treated to a look inside her world growing up from mid teens to late thiries. This is intertwined with the stories about the restaurant business and makes for a wonderful read.Anyone who has ever eaten in a restaurant should read this book....it will give you a whole new way of looking at your surroundings."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"What a fantastic book! I read it in just under 2 days, not able to put it down. Most of the time I was laughing out loud, as I found Ms. Ginsberg's storytelling to be smart and witty, but mostly RIGHT ON! Kudos to Ms. Ginsberg for writing a wonderful memoir, and giving the world a glimpse of what it's really like on the other side of the table."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"...you've written a delightful tale of what its like to earn a living in a job that everyone has encountered as a customer many times but probably never knew the pitfalls therein. Thanks for reminding readers that waiters are there to support themselves while helping customers to have a better day &amp; enjoy a meal - and if they get a charge out of people they serve, more power to them - its a more colorful existence than many other fields of endeavor. Thanks so much for sharing your story with us. I hope to see more books from you in the future. My message to those interested in buying the book - get it - you'll feel like you've made a new friend."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"As a former waitress myself (I &quot;got out&quot; a few months ago), I can say that this book is a dead-on accurate account of the business, the life, and the people one finds in a restaurant. I could relate to every scene in this book, even though I have not had the exact same life as Ms. Ginsberg. As a fellow human being, I felt I could relate to everything the author said about the little behaviors and tics that every person has. You don't have to work in a restaurant to appreciate this one -- this is real life! I loved it and will recommend it to everyone I know."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I was never much of a waitress, but I did it enough to respect the job and remember to leave a nice tip. Ms. Ginsberg has a nice writing style. I hope she writes more!"},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I was truly suprised by this book. Working in the customer relations industry now, I can truly relate to Debra Ginsberg's incredibly accurate depictions of the the public customer.This book was an incredibly fast read, as Ginsberg's candidly witty writing style jumps out at you and brings you right into the stories with her. Sometimes, I could clearly see myself sitting at one of the tables in her restaurant, just taking in the scene (I hope I wasn't at &quot;Table 50&quot;).The book chronologically takes you through her career as a waitress. Through her wonderful stories, you get to see her develop as a waitress, and more importantly, mature as a person. Over her twenty-year span of waitressing, you get to live through her struggles, financial woes, and life awakenings. It is one truly remarkable ride.In essence, Waiting is a nice readable memior that hits close to home to everybody on a certain level. It is extremely well written, and the humorous, colorful tones make the flow incredibly smooth. This book is worth reading for the mere fact that it will open your eyes and make you reflect upon your own attitudes when it comes to dining out. Ginsberg wrote a cogent book about a life story that was a real pleasure to read. Waiting will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Debra Ginsberg's book should give pause not only to the most inveterately rude diner but it should remind us of the importance of civility toward others, including our restaurant servers. This is not a behind-the-scenes, tell-all book about what goes on in the 'back of the house' or the 'front of the house' in a restaurant. It is instead, a highly readable life story that rings true on many levels. Ginsberg can be subtlely understated in her wit or down-right off-color funny in describing the escapades of her customers and colleagues. You also share in her evolving self-awareness through the stages of her life.Moreover, Ginsberg has a facile, accessible writing style that pleases so much so that I read the book over two days. Often, I felt as though I were having a conversation with a friend not reading a book. You share in her struggles, life events, and epiphanies. Merely categorizing this book as yet another 'coming of age' memoir seems too trite for what it signifies to the reader.&quot;Waiting&quot; is funny, poignant, acerbic, and most of all puts an important perspective on what is truly meaningful - - - life should be lived with, as a philosopher once said, with an &quot;absolute quality.&quot; Ginsberg's realization of this truth, at the end of her story, resonates. I hope we have more of Ginsberg in the future."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Debra Ginsberg's &quot;Waiting...&quot; perfectly complements Anthony Boudrain's &quot;Kitchen Confidential.&quot; As a former &quot;food service professional&quot; myself, I laughed, I howled, I wet my pants at her spot-on tale of life in the restaurant business.At the heart of Ms. Ginsberg's book runs the theme of working at a profession that she enjoys, even loves (well, mostly), while questioning whether to continue or get a &quot;real job&quot; that takes advantage of her college degree - a job that's more &quot;respectable&quot; but pays less. (I remember the withering looks I'd get from people when I told them I was a waitress --- I could see my reflection in their eyes instantly morphing into Flo from Mel's Diner.) I had a hard time making the transition from waiting myself --- it was years before I was making more money at my &quot;respectable real job&quot; than I did as a waitress working a 25-hour week --- and I've never enjoyed another job as much.Her descriptions of the hellhole waitress jobs are vividly painted and absolutely hilarious (been there...), as are the portrayals of the restaurant guests. Ms. Ginsberg's breezy prose makes for a quick and engaging read, and if nothing else, serves to clue the restaurant patron in on how to behave (or perhaps, how not to misbehave) when dining out. Although the book is a &quot;must-read&quot; for anyone who's ever &quot;waited,&quot; I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to take a peek at life on the other side of the order pad."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"&quot;Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress&quot; is a highly entertaining, fast-paced book about Debra Ginsberg's real-life experiences as a food server. She tells wonderful heartfelt stories about waiting tables in places ranging from a dining room/country club environment, to a cocktail lounge setting, to a upscale Italian eatery while keeping me laughing out loud and cringing simultaneously. I never thought that working as a waitress was an easy job (I've never actually done it) but after reading this book I can say for sure that it's definitely not a field I'll be tackling any time soon.Ginsberg delves even deeper than just your run-of-the-mill waitressing antics (E.G.: hair in soup, rude customers, bad tips, etc.) She actually takes a look at waitressing from a sociological perspective and she does so with both intelligence and charm. For Ginsberg, waiting tables was a career, one which she struggled with because she constantly felt like she should &quot;do something with her life&quot; and &quot;get a real job.&quot; So she did. But the money from waitressing was just too good. Her tips were essential in the raising of her son as a single parent. And waitressing also allowed her to spend quality time with her son when her &quot;real job&quot; kept them apart more than both of them were comfortable. I was proud of her for coming to that realization and going back to waitressing after giving the real job a shot.Unfortunately, there is such a negative stigma attached to waiting tables while it really shouldn't be anything to be ashamed of. The physical and psychological aspects of the job are grueling and make for a tough job even in the best of conditions. I applaud anyone who can work like that at night and then manage to wake up, raise a child and stay focused on writing the next day. That sounds like three full-time jobs to me and I personally couldn't wing it. Three cheers for Debra! I eagerly await her next book."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"WAITING: THE TRUE CONFESSIONS OF A WAITRESS is a selection of Debra Ginsberg's recollections and stories based on twenty year's worth of waiting tables. The results are fairly mixed. While the two decades have given her more than her fair share of horror stories and anecdotes, not all of the tales recounted here come across well. The style of the book is very off-putting, as many of the accounts could just as easily been compiled by somebody else. The lack of anything personal really hurts the book, which is quite odd when one considers how much space the author attempts to devote to her own life outside of the apron.While the waitressing stories can oftentimes be quite funny, there is a curious lack of the personal touch among them. Strangely, I had to continually remind myself that these stories were not being told second-hand. The stories are not told about a friend of a friend, or nor are they manufactured, but are actually experiences from the author herself. Yet the viewpoint of the author makes them feel as though they happened to somebody else -- a somebody else who isn't particularly close to the author. The consequence of this is that the stories feel remote and cold. Rather than drawing us into her confidence, Ginsberg keeps us at arm's length. Even more telling is that the author seems trapped between wanting to share some of her personal life with the reader and not wanting to go into any significant detail. The result is that the memoir seems like neither one thing nor the other, with minor and random facts about herself and her family being thrown into the general whitewash of the rest of the story.I did enjoy reading the first hundred or so pages. However, after a certain point, I realized that the book wasn't going to get any more introspective and that the faintly hollow feeling that I experienced from the beginning was going to be present throughout the entire book. For a three hundred page memoir, this is not something that is going to work well. Had the book been about half its current length, the lack of depth might not have been as significant a flaw, but to maintain reader interest for that entire length, we really need more interesting material to read about. The message of this book seems to be that waiters and waitresses are real people with real problems, and sometimes whether or not a customer's lasagna is the optimal temperature isn't the most important thing on his or her mind. This is indeed an important message, but hardly an Earth-shattering one. If you are among the few people on the planet who hasn't already realized this fairly simple fact, then not only should you educate yourself with this book, but you must go out immediately, track down every waiter you've ever been rude to, get down on your knees, and apologize profusely. Everyone else can continue to tip well, but can probably skip this book, as apparently they innately understand what Ginsberg goes to a lot of trouble to explain.Now I don't want to be wholly negative in this review, as there were several anecdotes and stories that I found to be quite amusing. Yes, funny things can happen in restaurants and there are a number of entertaining stories to be read. Some of the accounts here, while occasionally repetitive, are sufficiently distracting enough to be enjoyable. Many of them will have you cringing at the amount of human stupidity displayed by numerous customers of restaurants all across America. A handful of Ginsberg's fellow co-workers occasionally stand out, and it's a pity that we never get to know more than a scattering of details about any of them. I get the impression that there were a lot of great stories concerning these people that we never really got the chance to read about.Unfortunately, I can't say that WAITING is a fantastic memoir. If your reaction to the revelation of waiters and waitresses being actual (and overworked) human beings is to say, \\"Yeah, I knew that already,\\" then this book will most likely be a rethread of what you understand to be true anyway. Maybe it's an inherent property of waitressing that most of the things one learns about people are done so within a short amount of time, leaving little room for deeper thoughts or meaningful reflections. But these short musings aren't enough to sustain the entire book. WAITING is only recommended if you genuinely have no idea that waiters are people."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I heard a passage from Waiting on NPR's All Things Considered, and decided I had to have this book. I bought it on my way home, began reading it on the way out of the bookstore, became disgruntled if anything interrupted my reading, and finished the book by the next afternoon. It was good.Most of us, as Ginsburg points out, have waited tables at one time or another, but even if you've never worked in a restaurant, you've probably held some sort of menial service job, and that's close enough. You know how demanding and particular people can be; how otherwise egalitarian folks turn into elitists when seated at a table; the impossible demands of the management and tensions/liaisons among the waitstaff. It's all in there.Several times, in the middle of a chapter, I would shout an exalted &quot;Yes! That's it!&quot; to no one in particular. I read many passages aloud. Ginsburg's voice is a reliable and witty one, with a skilled dry humor that leaves an appropriate amount of verbiage to the imagination. She chronicles her 20-year waiting career; the various restaurants she's worked at, the managers, her co-workers and, of course, the customers. The book moves along chronologically, starting at Ginsburg's first restaurant job: waiting tables at a diner during her sixteenth summer. During that summer, she learns how to carry several plates at once, handle finicky customers, and she meets her first - fleeting -- love. This stint sets the tone for Ginsburg's further waiting endeavors.At first, through Ginsburg's high school and college years, the book moves slowly, documenting each restaurant, extrapolating each detail. After her graduation, however, Ginsburg's jobs begin to flow and mesh together, with only a few notable customers, friends and restaurants showing through the fray. I believe this was intentional; not only does this make what might have been a mundane list of restaurants - &quot;And next, I worked at Hoover's...&quot; - interesting, but it also illustrates the blur Ginsburg's life became at that time, a muddle of shocking sameness and the mark of a life of waiting tables: a search for something better.Still, some customers - or types of customers - always stick out, and Ginsburg's depictions of them are dead on.It's so true; people turn into different creatures in a restaurant.Ginsburg's account is well-written, and often brutally honest with personal details that are tied inextricably to her work as a waitress. She includes excellent chapters on tipping and the sexual tension (and acts) that a restaurant inspires among the staff. The only low point, if one can call it that, is a chapter on society's perceptions of waitresses, and, more specifically, a list of movies and television shows that feature and, often, typecast waitresses. The list - and the synopses - don't make for very interesting reading. But this is not important. The important thing is: read this book. It is hilarious, insightful, and well written. And, if you've ever worked in a restaurant, it will make you feel sooo vindicated."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"What a wonderful book,for all who have ever had the good fortune to play the glamourous role of a food server.Funny,charming,and at times shocking(particularly Miss Ginsberg's description of Mother's Day in a restaurant)this is telepathic diamond for every waitress and waiter.Read this!"},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"As a waitress, I found this story to be not only a true perspective of the business, but also an inspirational tale. The one thing I would have to say is that not every waitress will do something to your food before it gets to the table, regardless of how someone acts!I liked this book because it reveals stories that I can relate to, such as cheap tippers and relationships in the restaurant, but it also examines the culture and icon of waitressing. Everyone should read this book, whether they work in the industry or not."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"...then you'll totally &quot;get&quot; this book! I love Ms. Ginsberg's upbeat attitude and the fact that she loves her job. She's so right that most people talk about waitresses like they're lower on the job chain than prostitutes when nothing could be further from the truth. As eating out seems to be a national past time, you'd think waitresses would be revered right up there with football heros! Just try to imagine life without them. I like the way she integrated statistics about the job and interwove threads of her life story into it; it was very interesting and enlightening. To those of you who gave bad reviews, this is not a novel, for heaven's sake, it's a memoir and a very well written one at that!"},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I have worked in the restaurant industry for eleven years and have often penned my own stories of my experiences there, but Debra Ginsberg wrote the book I could only dream of. She does a remarkable job of describing the challenges of the job, the atmosphere behind the scenes of a restaurant and the physical demands of the job. Anyone who has spent time in the arena of foodservice will enjoy Debra's book, and I wish it were required reading for everyone who patronizes restaurants. My favorite aspect of this book is the way that Debra is able to address the public's rather simple perception of waitresses and compare that with a much more realistic portrait of the intelligent, independent women (and men) who are able to do well in the industry. This was an amazing book and I will be recommending it to many friends and members of my family who have not worked in restaurants, but have lived vicariously (and are much better tippers because of it) through my stories over the years."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Not bad, but overall a slow read."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Quite simply, the extent to which this book reeks is astonishing. Debra Ginsberg, should be slapped in the face with leather gloves for ever thinking she was entitled to put pen to paper. Not until the last chapter does she realize that her life has been without consequence. I could have told her that after reading the first couple of pages. Do yourself a favor: If you're in need of some good waitress stories, go get yourself a job at a local restaurant. You have my guarantee that your experiences will be better than the slop Ginsberg slings. Her writing, full of clich&eacute; and nothingness, is unforgivable. Even the most casual reader can play a remarkably crowded game of connect-the-dots with her use of the word \\"singularly.\\" Well, Debra Ginsberg has written history's singularly most unimportant book."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"An utterly disappointing read. Overall, this book was a total waste of time. I'd read the other reviews looking forward to a delightful read giving me some insight into the food industry and the entire waitstaff experience and was totally let down. It was like expecting the Palm for a delicious steak and getting to dine at Goober's Dew Drop Inn. Need I say more."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I have worked in restaurants for more than 10 years. This book is a big pile of steaming monkey poo. A fairy tale book complete with a happy ending. This is not at all what waiting tables is. I appreciated some of her clever quips, but for the most part I felt cheated as a waiter. For a true confessions of a waiter go to clamchowder.biz and buy Clam Chowder: the Server's Field Manual. You'll laugh, crym and feel relieved that finally someone has done an honest job."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I published a book entitled &quot;Waiting&quot; in 1996 with Viking/Penguin. It is an oral history about waiting tables and it did moderately well. Alas, the first one to the market never wins. I am happy to see that someone is making some money from my idea. Kudos!-Bruce Henderson"},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I stopped reading the book when the subject of tipping came about and Mrs. Debra's started her litany about the fact that 100% of any received tip should go integrally to her pocket.When we in Europe go to Restaurants, it is the complete experience that interests us, the atmosphere, the food served, the reputation of the restaurant. Waiters should be invisible and are part of that experience. If and when we tip, the tip is for all of those who contributed to the experience.Everytime I am in America, I am frustrated by waiters asking how I am doing and comment on my tie.I thought the book was going to give me an insight of a certain part of the industry. It does not achieve that goal unfortunately."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"This book exeplifies two personality traits that I despise. One of these is that it is written from the perspective of a supposedly normal, hardworking person. This person typically believes that they form somewhat the neutral center of a workplace around which all erratic behaviour, incompetence, and negativity seems to coalesce. That is to say, they are the narrator. They are seldom the ones who majorly screw-up, annoy others, or make the workplace less enjoyable overall. If you listen to most people talk about their workplace, this is the impression that you get. All problems are the result of others actions. If everybody were like them, then the workplace would run smoothly. I guess if you are sick of hearing people complain about their jobs, then don't read this book.Another annoyance of mine that this book exemplifies is a trend, typified by Seinfeld, (which I must admit is entertaining at times) whereby the minutiae of an individual's daily grind is eligible fodder for an extended narrative. She basically attempts to cloak rather unremarbable events in a somewhat literary language. It's like listening to sophmore geek college students with no lives sitting up at a late night coffee shop swapping stories for hours on end because they don't want to go home to loneliness but they don't know what else to do. Unfortunately, her third use of the adjective \\"singulary\\" by the 100th page was enough evidence for me that there are no literary merits to this book. It is basically a poorly told story of events which will have very little interest to the average reader but will cause waitresses and waiters to chuckle at inside jokes, and also make them believe that their jobs are more difficult and dramatic (and thus literature worthy) than they really are."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I'd recommend a book by author Matt Lehman called &quot;Clam Chowder: A Server's Field Manual&quot;. This book is much more realistic, funny, clever and insightful. I couldn't put it down. I'm not sure if it's available on Amazon, but it is online at www.clamchowder.bizI haven't worked in the restaurant for years, but Clam Chowder brought back a flood of memories for me. I have read it twice since I first got it. My book has now been passed on to at least 7 other people. They all agree, Clam Chowder is the best restaurant book ever - told from a server's perspective."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Ginsberg writes down to her audience; bad tipper, bad managers, grumpy cooks. Men who grope her, coworkers that cheat her. In her life's journey, detailed sometimes in confession-style honesty (but without the contrition), she wants us to know that the waitress we ignore is an important part of our restaurant experience and should be handled with care.She doesn't get it.In a service industry like food service, we don't want to know the details of our servers bad day, single motherhood, or wacky friends. While Ginsberg tells us continuously of her love of writing, including several unpublished attempts before this memoir, perhaps the best confession she could have offered is an admission that she's just not that good at it. Anyone can write down her work stories, the fun, the funny, and the tragic. Repeating them does not make a writer.If her life's journey was to get material for a good book, waiting didn't get it done."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"The item was just as described and shipped on time. Recommended seller would buy from again without hesitation. Thank you!"},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I have never been a waitress personally but this book's gives great insight into what being a waitress is really all about. It tells some great horror stories but also shows how it can be a fun and even exciting at times. All in all a great book."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I thought it was well written and I could identify with some of her experiences. The humor made it even more entertaining.I have told many of my friends about this book and they have taken my advice and purchased the book and they tooalso liked the book."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I really wanted to love this book and forced myself to finish it. Its slow and some chapters are long and drawn out. Debra the author is a likeable person and seems to have had a hard life of finding real love. I had no idea what the book was about when i bought it. I have never waited tables or gotten to know anyone that served me in a resturant. I did learn quite a bit about the work in general and how hard it really is behind the scenes. Also learned how we take people for granted that wait on us...So I will keep that in mind from now on. Thanks Debra"},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Liked most of this book. A little too philosophical in parts. Dragged a bit in places but great fun when she describes personalities of customers, staff and chefs."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I don't regret paying for it. She went way too deep with her emotions and feelings, which was terribly boring. The rest of the book was entertaining. If you're into restaurant gossip and drauma you'll like it."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"After reading Waiting, unable to put it down, I loved it! I have been waiting and bartending for 10 years now at multiple establishments over the years and this book is ridiculously spot on in every way. It gives me someone else prospective and assures me that waiting tables really isn't such a bad job and I make far more money in less time then a \\"real job\\". Thank you so much Debra for such a fantastic read and uplifting view on something I have always thought was so inadequate!!"},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Great writer - gave me a completely new view of waiting as a career. Humerous but she manages to make serious points. Looking forward to reading more of her work."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I found this a light, fun read especially for anyone who has waited tables. It's all here, from the exhileration of a good tip to dealing with cooks, to the relationships that go on in a restaurant. Ginsberg's story rings true in a well written, easy to read book. I looked forward to each chapter. I will read her other books."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"An interesting insight into being a server in a restaurant. Gives insider's perspective so nice to hear 'rest of the story'. Really a series of short vignettes occasionally fleshed out with stats about the restaurant biz that seemed more like filler then aught else. Still an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I love this book. It has only taken me a few days to complete the whole thing. I think the author did a great job making this a funny, but also life story. Not to sound corny, but it has made me be a better waitress and look at things a lot different."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I love this book and am currently enjoying it again after first reading it several years ago. Not only does Waiting deliver a strong sense of what it is like to be a waitress, it's also a strong story about what it is like to be Debra Ginsberg and to some degree what it was like to be in Portland, Oregon in the 70's and 80's.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Waiting, the true confessions of a waitress, goes next to my favorite all time book The Thornbirds. I wish everyone that ate in restuarants would read this book. I am a slow reader and sped thru this book. I couldn't put it down. I too,am a waitress and have chosen it as my career for the same reasons as Debra,my children.I can so relate to everything she saids in her book. Everything in the book is so true to life about working in a restuarant,the people, coworkers, managers,what goes on behind in small, closed places........When I finished the book I told my managers and coworkers that I believed Debra was a Writer/Waitress that worked in our restuarant under another name and that one of the stories in the book was about me and she gave me another name!!I wish we could sell this book at the door of my resturant to educate guests. I'm passing the book around to my coworkers because they are in it also and my server at a mexican restuarant that we are regulars at. Hats off to Debra for such a great book.I really can't say enough about how much I enjoyed this book.My baby is in college now and I am still waiting!!"},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I was quite entertained with Ginsberg's &quot;Waiting&quot;. Not especially intrigued, but I was entertained. Personally, I'm a fan of sarcastic and witty writers, and I was relatively pleased with Ginsberg's descriptions of the waiting industry. At times I felt the book was bordering on non-stop complaining, but eventually the good parts of the book make it worth the read."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I read it over the weekend! Why? I just couldn't put it down. Great writer! Was so absorbing that, when the phone rang I was startled back to real life! Debra Ginsbergs' true life store is well worth reading. Very informative on a profession I knew little about; however, I have long ago tipped big thinking that the people who serve deserve! This is an excellent book!"},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I bought this book for research and ended up reading it for fun. And loving it. Debra Ginsberg's voice is deadpan and funny at the same time, but mostly it's honest. This is a frank, kindhearted expose of a very, very weird business, told by a woman you imagine has her arms folded, shaking her head slowly, not quite believing her eyes sometimes, but determined to tell you what she saw anyway. I hope we hear more from this talented writer--if only so she won't have to go back to WAITING."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Miss Ginsberg has written a wonderful read. I very much enjoyed her stories of her twenty years as a waitress. Written with a clear insight from the other side of the table, she has put togeather a story that is seemless in her delivery. I await her next title."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Sort of ok, sort of boring, sort of repetitive...too much energy put into too little substance. She never seems to have worked in a really upscale restaurant, either."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Debra Ginsberg writes well and is admirable for her independence and pluck. I also enjoyed her depiction of her family, most of who also work in the restaurant business.With that much to like, I'm sorry that I did not enjoy Waiting. And I suspect that if you enjoy good restaurants and good food, that you won't either. Most of the restaurants in which Ginsberg \\"waits\\" appear to have food quality that ranges from indifferent to wretched. Waiting is spiked with uninspired chefs, unimaginative menus, uncaring busboys and greedy managers and owners. No, that's not decaf in your cup-- especially if you asked for it-- and a disgruntled server might have spit in your plate.Waiting left me thoroughly dispirited-- I had to push myself to finish it. Any good advice for restaurant goers? I agree with Ginsberg's advice to avoid holidays on which restaurants are flooded with patrons-- Mothers' Day and Valentine's Day are two. And I also agree with Ginsberg's perspective that waiting on tables is a difficult job, so do reward your server for a job well done.And unless you want a horrid look backstage, avoid Waiting."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Seemingly the only negative review of this book, I am dissapointed with Ginsberg for promising a \\"lively and insightful look into restaurants\\" and delivering quite the opposite. Claiming to be part social commentary, part ettiquette guide, and part memoir, this book bit of more than it can chew and ends up to be a rambling no-direction three hundred pages. From a literary point of view, the writing is simple and there is an abundance of cliches and kitchy, 'witty' comments with the use of the word 'waiting'. Ginsberg does provide some positive, and occasionally laughable perspectives of waitressing, but Waiting is simply a good concept with poor execution."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"An engaging debut from someone who made her dream a reality. Debra Ginsberg is a waitress. She is also a writer. And by combining the two, she has turned out a winning memoir of life behind the kitchen door. Snippets of her life are woven together as she explores being a waitress, friend, mother and woman. There are some genuinely funny moments where she describes incidents that take place in the kitchens and at restaraunt tables. Ginsberg teaches us many things, not the least of which is to tip well and be ware the waitpersons. They see more than you think. If you eat out, ever, you should read this book."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I thought this book gave food for thought. A littl pun there. Nevertheless, I found this book to be very entertaining, and I don't think I will be sending any food back."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I've only held two waitressing jobs and I got canned from both of them. I by no means think I could ever wait on tables: I'm not built for it. That doesn't mean I'm not intelligent or agile, it just takes a special kind of person.This book is easy-to-read, very enjoyable and informative. Ginsberg's got some powerful insights on life, too, which hit me in the gut.For anyone who has ever waited on tables, or not."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I dine out a lot.. Needless to say this is a must have for me. This is a great read and very fun and informative..

Hard working and conscientious she forces you to pay attention to those who serve you."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I read this book in bits and pieces; it's the kind of book that you want to savor and enjoy instead of just reading it through. I especially enjoyed her tales of waitressing. The only reason I gave it four stars is because at times it became bogged down with her personal life. All in all, it's well written and a good read."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I have been a server for almost 20 years now and couldnt agree or relate to the writer more! We are definetly a different breed!"},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Some interesting restaurant stories, but while she spends a lot of time saying that she has no problem being a waitress, she spends even more time saying she's really a writer. I wanted some funny/awful/sweet stories of things that happened in the restaurant, not a psychosocial treatise on the lot of the single working mother. For that we have Barbara Ehrenreich."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"A perspective of dining out I'd never considered before and really enjoyed reading about. Also enjoyed the writing voice and life story of the author."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Interesting to read about restaurants from a waitress' point of view. She had many good stories to tell. I don't think I could do that job."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Let me start by saying I heard about this book through \\"Waiter Rant\\". I was probably expecting tales as bizarre and deranged as some from that, but it didn't deliver. Instead the book focused more on her career as a waitress at several locations and her life outside of work. She does have the added advantage of having worked in several different states, which allows for a better comparison of guests in my mind.Issues with the book:The word \\"reckon\\" seemed to be her favorite word. I rarely have read it in a novel of any kind, but it seems like she used it as a crutch in several sections. I dare say I read that word more in this book than I have read it in all other books combined. Yes, she uses it that much!There were quite a few spelling or grammatical errors. The copy I had was borrowed from the library, and someone had so kindly went through and added letters or corrected sentences for her. I might not have noticed otherwise, but these additional markings made them stick out.Her writing style is very relaxed and friendly, making it a breeze to read through. She does a good job guiding the reader through her scenarios, even those of us inexperienced in the waiting world. I found it odd that she mentions her breasts in a few passages. I'm not sure if she's particularly proud of them or if they did indeed help her land jobs, but it seemed out of place.All and all, a decent read good for anecdotal evidence of how strange and weird patrons can really be. Not to mention what goes on behind the scenes, such as the events at table 50 or the doggy bag one of her fellow waiters received at a diner."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"One of my all-time faves! Everyone should read this-if you're in the service industry, then you can relate and if you're not, then you'll get an idea of what its like to be in the service industry!"},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I would highly recommend this book for anyone who's worked in a restaurant, particularly as a waitress. The level to which you can relate to Ginsberg's stories is unbelievable comical. Love it!"},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Debra Ginsburg's book is nothing less than an updated version of Melville's Moby Dick: an ode to the humanity of the ordinary working man and woman. The restaurant staffs (many throughout her life-long career waiting) are Ginsburg's shipmates. The great whale was for Melville a mirror by which we can look into the souls of ordinary working people, and this is what the working men and woman of her restaurants are for Ginsburg's great work of Genius. Ginsburg plays on the word \\"waiting\\" in a way that would have made Samuel Beckett (Waiting for Godot) proud (although Ginsburg is never heavy-handed with the pun), as True Confessions of a Waitress is also about people who are waiting for salvation from the miserable existence where they are forced to eke out a humble living while their dreams lie just out of reach. I read the book as part of a writers' seminar and fell in love with the book and with its author."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"This is a wonderful, fast-paced read that will take you into the life of Debra Ginsberg, a woman who worked as a waitress for twenty years.If you've ever worked with the public in any capacity, this book is for you! And, if you patronize restaurants, you'd best read this book so you can see yourself as a customer through the eyes of those invisible people who serve you.Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress by Debra Ginsberg is a hilarious eye-opener. You'll never see waiters in the same way again."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Excellent book. Enjoyed reading the way life is to Ms. Ginsberg as she relives her days as a waitress. She includes the family life also - her style is very warm, amusing and true to life."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Memoirs are one of my favorite forms of prose. Debra Ginsberg wrote one of the very best I have ever read---full of fascinating stories of all the various experiences she had during her lifetime as a waitress. She has an uncanny way of writing each chapter as if you were right there, watching, waiting and hoping she has a good night. Will this party of six leave a sufficient tip ? Will this chef be cooperative ? Are her co-workers helpful and friendly or do they make her work more difficult ? Each group of diners really creates a story of its own. The book reads easily--Debra Ginsberg is an excellent writer. You will not want to put this book down, that is for sure."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Waiting tells wonderful tales of one woman's life as a server and she is proud of it. Most people deny that the serve people for a living and it's only a part-time job. But Ginsberg holds her head high and the whole truth about the resturant. She tells in detail who it showed who to accept and judge people and how it showed her real responsbility when she become a single parent."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I actually bought three copies of this book so its author can hopefully go on with her writing and never have to return to waiting tables again. I'm certainly glad she's not my waitress. After convincing us that waitpersons can't survive unless we tip them generously (which is to say, at least 20% of the tab), she warns us that they really often do spit in our food, pick slices of pepperoni off our pizzas and pop them into their mouths before serving us, and insult us in languages we might not understand, occasionally just because we've been \\"sized up\\" as demanding diners. Far from making me laugh, or even smile, the book made me wary of ever dining out again. Her descriptions of what goes on behind the scenes at even top-notch restaurants is nothing less than horrifying. I gather that she wants her readers to feel her pain. I know I did. The trouble is, Ginsberg seems to have no genuine respect for the people who ultimately pay her wages. Her descriptions of restaurant work and its \\"vagaries\\" -- a word she uses again and again -- are detailed, and certainly accurate from the perspective of a server, but the biographical narrative woven around it keeps coming unraveled amid fuzzy flashbacks and flash-forwards. We learn little about why her relationships with men regularly fail, for instance, or how she could write off the father of her child so casually. I also think she has a lot of nerve characterizing so many of her co-workers as recklessly lustful, especially after her baby is born. The burnout that presumably led to the writing of the book comes suddenly, almost inexplicably, and then just as quickly subsides, leaving little time for the reader to adjust to the transition. Ginsberg's style is studied but promising; she simply doesn't inspire our trust in her judgment before she launches into her sometimes poignant, but more often scathing, expos&eacute; of the foodservice industry, in which many people clearly feel trapped..."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"The comparison with KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL is not favorable to WAITING. The Bourdain book is funny and stylish. You may not like Bourdain personally (although I did) but you come away knowing the most entertaining parts of his business, his cohorts, his life. And you will receive a thorough education on the restaurant business without even knowing it, as this is woven into the stories and characters. WAITING is boring. The book has no laughs, and no memorable characters. You can infer the sort of \\"wry humor\\" that some reviewers have mentioned by Ginsburg's chapter title: \\"Tipping (It's Not a City in China)\\". That was a hopelessly bland cliche twenty years ago (I was a bartender for twelve years) and I am embarrassed for Ginsburg that she thinks this is a witticism. This book is a motherlode of honest, earnest reflections from an unworldly working server. I'm sure the duller sort of waitress I used to work with will find this book validates her experiences. Great. The main problem is the author's main stance is that she is a working class hero and that her profession deserves more respect. As such, it is sort of a complaint. I can imagine many people reading it and saying \\"Yes, that's true. Yes, that happened to me.\\" I can't imagine any smart person reading it and being delighted by some unexpected insight or story. There's nothing complex, strange, or unexpected here, which makes for a bad confessional. I mean, to tell us that our next server might very well be an intelligent, talented person who just happens to carry trays for the money is to provide a condescending lecture. Ginsburg is not a bad person. She doesn't have the sleazy often sinistar qualities of an Anthony Bourdain. And that's a real problem with her book!"},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Anyone who has ever worked in any part of the restaurant industry, be they a server, bartender, cook or dishwasher will appreciate the years Debra Ginsberg spent in the trenches. Many of her tales from work will leave you nodding in agreement, and remembering stories of your own. Some of her stories will make you realize that you really don't have it as bad as it could be. This book reads like a soldier's-eye view of life on the food service battlefield, and from the first page you will not be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I have waited tables for 13 years and could relate to the author's plight from page one. I laughed and nodded my head in agreement thru the whole thing. The poor reviews of this book are written by people who have never waited tables before......another testament to the fact that everyone should, at some point in their lives. It is an occupation that breeds both compassion and hatred for the human race. This book paints a clear picture of the hell I put myself thru every night.....and why I keep going back for more. :)"},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"In Waiting, The true confessions of a waitress, Debra Ginsberg talks about 20 years working as a waitress. She takes you through the journey and adventures of dining. Throughout this book, she has a range of waitressing jobs; she works in Italian restaurants, dingy diners, and a five-star dining clubs. She has trouble with keeping a job, but every waitressing job she gets is a new experience for her. One particular restaurant that Debra was a waitress at was Molto's. Debra especially loved Molto's, she enjoyed the pleasant atmosphere of this restaurant, and she loved her co-workers. Her co-workers all worked together as a team and that is what she enjoyed so much. Also, throughout her experiences with many different restaurants, she has had various relationships with men, but she only has one problem, commitment. She can't commit to anyone because every time she begins to fall for someone they break her heart. Debra takes you on a ride through many of her bumpiest relationships. She then comes to the conclusion that she has accomplished nothing in her life and she is a failure because waitresisng isn't considered a \\"real\\" job. She decides to move to California where she begins life over again for herself and her son Blaze. Her new life in California unravels before her eyes and she is now able to put the most important things in her life first.Debra Ginsberg was very creative when writing this book. She was able to explain in full detail about her experiences at the diners she worked in. It seemed like every diner that she waitressed at was a new adventure with new people. Sometimes the diners that Debra worked at were very soap-opera like. It was very interesting when she kind of psychoanalyzed the customers that she served. She writes, \\"His date is pouting smugly. She is really enjoying this. He is a bit of a parody wearing a gold pinkie ring, a heavy bracelet, and enough gold neck chains to choke a horse.\\" Her explanations made me think of what waiters and waitresses think of me when I go out to a restaurant. By reading this book, I have a new respect for servers.I thought this was an interesting a different book that I usually read. The title of the book immediately caught my eye because I had never heard of a book about a waitress's life. I had wondered how interesting of a book it was going to be. It was not what I expected it to be, her life was intriguing to read about and made it easy to relate to. When she explained that waitressing wasn't a \\"real\\" job and that she needed a \\"real\\" career I kind of felt sorry for her. She felt that in her whole life nothing had been accomplished, but she was too busy thinking about the things she hasn't accomplished then to look at her success over her lifetime. This book was a good example of realizing what is important to you and what decisions have to be made in order to get there."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"THIS is a good book. You've just got to trust me on this one. Part memoir, part guide on how to treat your waitress, this book rocks!Based on the author's life, Ginsberg's book follows her from when it was cool to be a waitress to when it was necessary. From &quot;low end&quot; waitressing to raking in the dough at fancy restaurants and exclusive country clubs, Ginsberg has been there, done that, and now she's going to sit you down and tell you about it. Her writing is very accessible and you won't be able to put it down. For most of the book you will think that she is foolish to continue working as a (gasp) waitress while she has a college degree and a natural talent for writing, but by the end you'll realize that if she hadn't, you wouldn't have been able to go through it with her."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I just finished Ms. Ginsberg's second book, Raising Blaze, and couldn't wait to read this one. It was an easy and enjoyable read. What I got out of it was more than just the &quot;dirt&quot; on the food service industry. She is showing that she and so many of her co-workers weren't just waiting on tables, they were &quot;waiting&quot; on life. They considered their jobs just a stopping point until they got to their &quot;real&quot; lives - the relationship that would rescue them, the career they were destined for, whatever the dream was. She looked at waitressing as a temporary job on her way to becoming a writer, then realized that she had been waiting for twenty years. In the meantime, she had not been waiting for her life to start, she had been living it. So many people are waiting for their lives to start; when they finish college, after the baby is born, once the kids are in school, once they get that promotion, etc. Meanwhile, while they are waiting for life to start, it is going full swing. I always remember a quote by Cher (not someone I would usually quote), and she said that life is not a dress rehearsal. We should be living it to the fullest, no matter what stage we are in."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"I worked as a waitress in the past and shared some of my &quot;days of slinging hash&quot; stories with my husband. I picked up this book after reading an excerpt from the center. I figure if a book gets my interest in the middle - it will have it from beginning to end. This book did not disappoint me as it lived up to my expectations.I laughed through personal collection of stories and events beyond her control - shared with tips of insight to why some of these occur and just how out of control of the &quot;front floor&quot; a waitress can be. I nodded my head in understanding at the same time.My husband read the book and said he could now understand better my personal horror stories of those days - so even an outsider to the &quot;biz&quot; can benefit and gain some insight to the serving life. He laughed at her recounts as well, so one does not need to have had a past as a server to enjoy the humor in this book."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Debra Ginsberg is a writer, and obviously a good one. But, for most of her life, she's also earned the bulk of her income from being a waitress. In WAITING: THE TRUE CONFESSIONS OF A WAITRESS, she describes what it's been like serving demanding, hungry humans, and possibly you or me, since her first job at 16 in her father's luncheonette.Debra's table-waiting odyssey takes her from upstate New York to Yellowstone to Portland, Oregon to Southern California. In various chapters, she educates the reader on the theory and practice of tipping, the waitress's definition of \\"personal service\\", the hierarchy of restaurant employees, the relation between food and sex, the screen image of the waitress as portrayed since 1970, the highs and lows of the various dine-out holidays (Mother's Day, Valentine's Day, Christmas Eve, New Years Eve, etc.), the uniqueness of the cocktail waitress, the reality of choosing wines, the perils of the \\"split shift\\", and the art of triaging multiple food orders from several tables. And, because she was, and is, a single mother, the image of the pregnant waitress as perceived by customers and restaurant management.WAITING could be considered a companion piece to KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL (also reviewed by me on this website), an \\"expos&eacute;\\" of the restaurant business as seen from the perspective of a professional chef. However, there is one big difference between Ginsberg and the author of the other, Anthony Bourdain. I like the personality of the former, while that of the latter I found truly obnoxious and annoying. My only disappointment with Ginsberg's style was its relative lack of humor compared to what it might have been. Her chapter on the relation between food and sex was funny, not because of the way she made the connection, but because humans naturally seem to put themselves in comedic sexual situations.Now that the desert is consumed and the tab is waiting to be paid, I'll gratefully leave Debra much more than the standard 15%. Nice job!"},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"WAITING is more than the chronicle some other reviewers make it out to be; more than a mere narrative of twenty years spent waiting tables. It's a coming-of-age story set against the backdrop of the restaurant business, from the perspective of the floor, of the people who come into direct contact with restaurant patrons.In keeping with the backdrop, it does contain anecdotes about the business, insights into the personalities who bring food to the table, and even tips on how to be a better customer (and avoid possible retribution). I worked as a chef for several years and enjoyed reading Ginsberg's perspective from the other side of the pick-up window. I particularly liked her character descriptions.But WAITING is a memoir in every sense of the word. Ginsberg talks of early loves, motherhood, and career ambitions. Although waiting tables is viewed by most people, waitresses included, as a temporary job rather than a career, as interim work when nothing better is available, Ginsberg views the activity as fulfilling in its own right. The title of the book is intentionally ambiguous.As other reviewers have suggested, WAITING is a great complement to Anthony Bourdain's KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL. True, their writing styles are different; Ginsberg's is clean and comfortable. She's a natural story teller.I couldn't put the book down. It reveals a slice of American life and culture that should interest everyone."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Like the title says, this is solid effort. Ginsberg is much more polished than Anthony Bourdain. Not so shock value-oriented, either.For me, FINE DINING MADNESS (by J. Galloway) is the champ as far as restaurant books go. Very funny, and gutsy. \\"Heat\\"is a three star book, but comes off a little phony."},{"Title":"Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress","review":"Having worked as a dishwasher, I believe most of what she has written without question. The cooks (I never worked anywhere that had actual \\"chefs\\") had attitude for sure. Two waitresses feuding? Get OUT of the line-of-fire ASAP! I wish she'd addressed my pet peeve of servers who say \\"I have (a special chianti, prime filet mignon, etc.) tonight ...\\" It's \\"we\\" not \\"I\\" but anyway ... I recommend this one. It's as entertaining, and informative, as others have posted. The earring trick was neat to know."},{"Title":"Western Horsemanship: The Complete Guide to Riding the Western Horse (A Western Horseman Book)","review":"For any rider who wants to improve their skills, this book is a must.

I found the book very interesting and informative, helping me with my decisions in purchasing saddle, bridle etc. The one thing that I didn't get from the book was tips on the actual riding aids etc. which is something as a newbie that I was looking for. The book is more geared towards getting owner and horse ready for showing, rather than training advice. Other than that, I would recommend the book to anyone interested in preparing themselves for showing Western style."},{"Title":"Western Horsemanship: The Complete Guide to Riding the Western Horse (A Western Horseman Book)","review":"There are a lot of so-called horse trainers and &quot;horse whisperers&quot; out there today.

With tongue-in-cheek humor, Quinn/Kennedy reveals how his writing career began and how he came to know the main characters of this trio of books set in Depression-era Albany, New York.Legs, set in 1930 - 1931, is a fictional biography of Jack \\"Legs\\" Diamond, thief/bootlegger/murderer, a man who lived the high life and who double-crossed and cheated his way to success, controlling speakeasies, illegal alcohol, real estate, and gambling, a man who survived eleven bullets in three separate assassination attempts before finally being brought down. An uncomplicated but well-written and often violent novel, Legs sets the scene for Billy Phelan's Greatest Game and Ironweed, both set in 1938. (4 stars)Billy Phelan's Greatest Game is far more sophisticated, with more fully drawn characters, well-developed suspense, and themes dealing with fathers and sons and their values--intergenerational problems which reveal the changing morality of Depression-era Albany. Billy Phelan, part-time bookie and small-time card player and gambler is asked to monitor the activities of one of his fellow-card players, suspected of involvement in the kidnapping of Charlie MacCall, son and nephew of the two men running the political machine of Albany. Remaining true to his own values, Billy is surprised when his father Francis Phelan, who has just reappeared after abandoning the family twenty-two years before, suggests cooperating. (5 stars)Ironweed is the Pulitzer-Prize-winning culmination of the trio, the story of Francis Phelan, an emotionally gripping novel about down-and-out \\"bums\\" and the people with whom they come into contact, which tears at the heart without being sentimental. Hard-edged and sometimes violent, this novel is a fully developed, moving, and insightful look at those who live apart from society because their dreams have died. (5 BIG stars)Fully absorbing, whether you are just looking for good reading or are a student of writing, these three novels include many overlapping characters and a clear sense of time, place, and society. They are exciting and filled with important observations about life without being moralistic, and the dialogue and level of detail are often breath-taking. They are also an opportunity to see in successive novels, the development of one of the great writing talents of the twentieth century, with each novel more complex and fully developed than the previous one. Outstanding! Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Bartending in one day","review":"I don't think there exists a better manual to teach you bartending than this one. I am a bar manager now.

It still stresses memorization and is filled with good recipes. The practice tests are pretty much a joke. I can't see how you can expect to land a job by using this book only. Becoming an accomplished bartender after using this book is at best, a pipe dream. I am not at all satisfied with it's promises.

I do have an understanding of some processes, but this book is a great guide to covering general city processes; nicely illustrated and presented very well."},{"Title":"The Works: Anatomy of a City","review":"I found this book in a bargain bin, and thought it seemed so interesting I had to buy it. It didn't disappoint. I've always been interested in how everyday, overlooked stuff works, and what's more common and overlooked than city infrastructure? The book was presented in a clear and visually interesting way, with plenty of detail, but not an overwhelming amount. There were only a few things I would improve on it. As someone who works in emergency services, I would have been interested in more on how that works in New York (police, fire, ems). The thought occured to me that a really facinating spread could have been done on a cross section of a typical street, from street level to 100ft down. Most every utility, the subway, etc runs under the street, and there is so much going on underfoot, it's almost hard to figure how it all fits. Overall, a great read for the layman. An entertaining approach to a potentially dry subject."},{"Title":"The Works: Anatomy of a City","review":"Great book, very interesting with lots of visuals about all the inner workings of New York city from trash collection to plumbing.

The book is great as it disects and explains all the different systems and components that makes NYC function without being overly detailed or hard to digest: subways, railroads, ships, power supply, water supply, electricity generation and supply, sewage, recycling, manholes, and much much more...Each page has sharp and enjoyable illustrations that break down the systems, map out how everything works from beginning to end, and leave you with a better understanding of what it takes to make any city run. Although this book focuses on what makes NYC run, you can easily apply the civil engineering components to just about any other modern city.You can pick up and pick any page in the middle of the book as it can be read as an encyclopedia, or you can read it from beginning to end (like I did) without being overwhelmed with the details.Bottom line: fun in a very geeky way, easy to pick up and read for a few minutes or a couple of hours, great illustrations that will get any reader hooked and a terrific compliment for anyone to enjoy the cities on a different level. A"},{"Title":"The Works: Anatomy of a City","review":"The work that goes into designing, developing, and maintaining an infrastructure for a city like New York is perhaps one of the greatest feats on mankind. The amazing part of it all is that the detail, the science, the engineering genius, and the reliability of all things that keep a city running go relatively unnoticed to the uncurious. But if you are the type that has often wondered how a city really works, how power is supplied, how water is brought in and sewage brought out, how communication and transportation systems are organized, then this is the book for you. The great thing about this book is that it is readable for ages 9 and up.

Great attention and care has been paid to presentation. Even the manhole cover on the dust jacket is beautiful. The illustrations and graphics inside are colourful, detailed and helpful. This book, without going into great detail, provides a wonderful introduction to the infrastructure of New York City. It includes many interesting and obscure facts about New York and its history. (e.g. Two Irish families have dominated the tugboat business in New York harbour since the late 1800's. Also, in the early 19th century, rival firefighting companies used to disguise the location of fire hydrants to keep their competition from getting to them first in the event of a fire, and sometimes would hire gangs of toughs, called plug uglies, to keep their rivals away.) So much of New York's infrastructure is underground, some of it for over a century -the subway, the steam system, underground rail and road tunnels, electrical wiring, water aqueducts and pipes, natural gas lines, and, of course, the sewer system. There was even a pneumatic tube mail system that had miles and miles of tubing that operated until 1953. I found this all fascinating.I would have liked to have seen something about vermin control (Robert Sullivan's book, Rats, is good for this) and at least a nod to the capacities and workings of the police and fire departments. There is a good index in this book, but it is missing a bibliography and, more importantly, a list of further reading suggestions for people who might want to go into further depth in the areas they are most interested in.

This book shows how each of these moving parts works and ties them all together with brilliant illustrations."},{"Title":"The Works: Anatomy of a City","review":"This is a wonderful resource that explains the nuisances of what it takes to keep New York City operating. It was excellently illustrated and diagrammed so may can see how things work. It is also a valuable resource of statistics concerning New York City. For instance, New York has 11,000 miles of local streets, 7,300 miles of secondary roads, and 1,250 miles of highways. The Grid Plan adopted in 1811 set the basis for Manhattan streets. Roads were clogged so more northbound streets were created.The number of roads increased 45% from 1983 to 2002 while the population increased 10%. Yet, rush hour traffic increased from occurring an average of 3.4 hours to 7 to 8 hours a day.There are 11,400 traffic lights in intersections. There are 40,000 total intersections. Traffic lights mostly run on 60, 90, or 120 second intervals. For many Manhattan streets, the 60 second intervals make traveling at 30 MPH, which is the speed limit, the best cruising speed. Traffic lights are controlled at fifteen computers, handling 720 intersections a piece, at the Traffic Management Center. Traffic is monitored there with 230 cameras.There are 1.1 million cars and trucks entering New York City daily.There are 3,250 pedestrian push buttons. Less than 25% of them work. The city is avoiding the $400 cost per unit it takes to remove the inoperable boxes.There are 50 red light cameras photographing license plates of traffic offenders. 1.4 million summonses have results since this program began in 1993. There has been a 40% decrease in violations where cameras exist. There are 200 locations with inoperable dummy cameras.The average auto speed in Midtown Manhattan is 4.8 MPH eastbound and 4.2 MPH westbound.There are 130,000 priority regulation signs, such as \\"stop\\" and \\"do not enter\\" signs. There are 333,670 street lights, costing$50 million annually in electric costs.There are 66,000 parking meters. Most parking meters run 1 to 9 minutes per hour longer in time. This is done to minimize charges against their accuracy. A parking meters holds from $30 to $60 in coins.The subway has 4.5 million riders daily. It is the fifth busiest subway, behind Tokyo, Moscow, Seoul, and Mexico City. The system has about 6,200 cars, which is the most in the world. There are 842 track miles, with 660 miles for passenger service and the rest for shops and storage. Two third of the tracks are underground. During rush hour, trains run from a minimum of every three minutes on four lines to a maximum of every nine minutes on four other lines. There are nine abandoned stations.Trains approach stations at 25 MPH.. The doors are open for at least ten seconds.The subway uses 1.8 billion kilowatt hours of electricity annually, making them the city's largest user of electricity.748 pumps from 309 pump plants pump 13 million gallons or less of water in one day from the subways.There are 30,000 pay phones from 63 phone companies in New York City. 20% of city residents do not have their own phone service.New York has 6,600 miles of sewer pipes and mains and 14 wastewater treatment plants, handling 1.3 billion gallons of sewage daily. There are 145,000 storm water catch basins and 5,000 seepage basins that place water into the ground. Sewage was dumped at one ocean site 12 miles away from the coast and second 106 miles away from the coast until 1992. Sludge was then taken by train to Sierra Blanca, Texas until 2001.New York combines storm water with waste water which is then sent to treatment plants. Rain causes overflow about half the time, meaning untreated water, about one fifth of which is raw sewage, goes into waterways. New York has 450 outflows into the harbor. 23 locations have booms or floating barriers capturing floatable, which are paper, plastics, and Styrofoam, and preventing them from going into the waer. A city owned vessel, the Cormorant, captures more floatables with nets and is able to handle 24 tons of floatables.There are 14 sewage treatment plants and about 100 pumping stations handling wastewater. Digesters heat sludge encouraging anaerobic bacteria to grow and then remove the sludge's organic material over 15 to 20 days. Half the bio-solids are formed into pellets at Hunt Point Plant in the Bronx. Most of these pellets are used for Florida citrus fertilizer. Others go to Virginia cornfields and grazing land as well as to Colorado and wheat fields. Some is pelletized in Arkansas for use as fertilizer, composted in Pennsylvania for topsoil blending, and lime treating in New Jersey for corn and hay fertilizer.The Sanitation Department employs 10,000 handling 12,000 tons of resident and municipal waste daily. It is collected two to four days a week. Recyclables are collected once a week. Commercial waste is handled by private companies.235 street sweepers operate daily. Each covers from 6 to 20 miles in one day. Their maximum speed is 37 MPH. They control 240 gallons of water. They refill at hydrants.410 of salt spreading trucks are used at one inch of snow. At 2 to 4 inches of snow, all spreaders are used and 380 plows are used. At 4 to 6 inches, over 700 trucks are used. At over 6 inches of snow, all 1,335 plowing trucks are used."},{"Title":"The Works: Anatomy of a City","review":"If you ever wondered how a city functions then this is the book you need to read.

Every section is well organized without being too basic or too boring.The Bad:You will find yourself starved if you want references, links, or further detail.

The information and illustrations are skillfully presented and elegantly planned. The writing is lucid and direct. Still and all, a grown-up reader will yearn for more detail. For instance, the book offers details about the newest subway cars, but ignores the scores of older stock still on the rails. It's worth noting, too, the information is based almost entirely on New York. True, it's a large and fascinating place (my home), but a more cosmopolitan approach would have made the book more valuable."},{"Title":"The Works: Anatomy of a City","review":"Fun, interesting and well illustrated book.Alas, all measurements (and there are a lot of them!) are reported in some obscure units, so one has to do mental arithmetics all the time to convert them to SI (metric)."},{"Title":"The Works: Anatomy of a City","review":"The book is what I needed and the price was fairly reasonable.

As the former Vice-chair of Manhattan Community Board 5 (greater midtown Manhattan), chair of its parks committee, and member of its land use and zoning committee, I can attest to the great value of Kate Ascher's remarkable accomplishment, \\"The Works.\\" New York City's infrastructure--from garbage collection to traffic control; subway signaling to cable TV distribution among franchise-controlled territories--is one of the world's most multifaceted, and at times a curious mix of the high-tech and the antiquated.Reviews suggesting that the text is for teenagers may be accidentally misleading. \\"The Works\\" by no means is for teenagers either *primarily* or *at the exclusion of* adults. Yes, the book--especially its more heavily-illustrated sections--will no doubt fire the imagination of many teens who have engineering, design, line drawing, architectural, historical analysis, or problem-solving aptitudes. (Have a teenager who loved Legos as a kid but has outgrown them? This book will probably make a good gift.) Just because the book is broad in scope and doesn't examine each urban work it covers with the detail of a textbook for electrical engineering students at M.I.T. doesn't make it merely for adolescents.If you enjoy TV shows on The Science Channel or Discovery, shows like \\"Building the Ultimate,\\" if you are a history trivia buff, if you just like looking at diagrams or line drawings of machinery and equipment, of you're fascinated by cities, or if it is simply the cast that you love New York City, this is a great book, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Works: Anatomy of a City","review":"This book has not left the coffee table. Everyone who has come over picks it up and inevitably remarks, \\"Oh, so that's how it works! I always wondered how they timed the traffic lights\\" or some such comment. This is a book you can return to again and again--one day it's telecommunications, the next, sewage. It contains so many answers to questions you never knew you had.After reading \\"The Works,\\" I now walk around New York with a completely different awareness of the incredible infrastructure that quietly undergirds the city: I constantly notice the design of fire hydrants, street signs, and man holes; I know what a \\"sidewalk neckdown\\" is; I understand how my water gets to me from the Ashokan Reservoir in the Catskills through those crazy aqueducts (and they ARE crazy! they have a submersible submarine that perouses that thing for leaks!).This book is a perfect gift for any man/boy/girl/hippo who likes to know how things work and likes to see them diagrammed in beautiful, scrumptious illustrations. I am one of these people.But perhaps most importantly, this book made me forgive those terrible yellow trash trains that pull into subway stations late at night and immediately mean you will be waiting twenty more minutes for your train.

Or why water actually comes out of the tap when I turn on the sink faucet. It's these myriads of questions that we take for granted that this book answers. Imagine these questions in reference to a city - New York City - and you've got a fascinating book..The book covers every phase of public works including transit, power, communications, and clean-up. While the focus is on massive public works it's not just a book about technology but it personalizes the people who do all these jobs such as the engineers who climb the antennas on the Empire State Building for maintenance. The graphics are excellent and are a real aid in understanding how the systems work. The writing is clear and concise and very readable.

Good reading."},{"Title":"The Works: Anatomy of a City","review":"As a designer in the New York metropolitan area, I thoroughly appreciate the effort that must have gone into making this book, and in particular its illustrations. They are detailed, accurate (as far as I can tell), and above all informative in a way that infrastructure diagrams from other books are not. It is noted that TW:AOAC's lead designer found inspiration in a chance encounter with famed statistician/graphic artist Edward Tufte - a credible claim, if this book is any indicator. Conveying so much about the city yet basking in white space, these spreads are consistently excellent. Ascher's writing, too, is impeccable, and while a free-market standpoint is appropriately engaged in her commentary, the invaluabity of New York's public bureaus is not given short shrift. Indeed, where politics have clouded issues of development for the city, Ms. Ascher has deftly surmised the issue and given it full and fair treatment. As a major in economics and a professional graphic designer, I am happily forced to recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Works: Anatomy of a City","review":"This book is a rare treat - both enlightening and visually appealing. To borrow a term from Tufte, every page contains a \\"visual confection.\\" The book explains the workings of all the significant support sytems that keep New York City humming.

There are plenty of intersting sidebars on how the systems have changed over time (the pneumatic mail system comes to mind.)"},{"Title":"The Works: Anatomy of a City","review":"This book describes the infrastructure of New York City in a very structured and visually stimulating manner.

A couple times a week I go to this book to look up something that I've always wondered about New York City.Recent questions this book has answered for me:Why do some buildings have old water towers on top and not others? What is that clanging noise in my radiator? Does somebody personally read the name and address every time I send a first class letter or is there a machine that does it? Where does my market buy their food from? Does anybody manage harbor traffic to make sure all those tankers don't crash, or do they just obey the rules of the road and hope for the best? How do they clean the ceiling of tunnels from all the car exhaust and how often do they have to do it? How many \\"no parking\\" signs are there in NYC?

(With honorable mention to \\"Eric Meyer on CSS.\\" I was there quite a while checking books out, and I hope somebody finds this opinion useful.)I had some experience with CSS which is why I had questions. Chapter 4 is twenty-odd pages that I assimilated in 15 minutes --it answered ALL of my questions and had me itching to try things out! I immediately re-factored my site's pages and it ALL worked on the first crack! Chap. 4 alone justifies purchasing the book. If you're still using the FONT tag or positioning images with TABLEs, kiss that goodbye forever! CSS is so much more professional and controllable, and this is a killer introduction.There isn't much to know on CGI so it's \\"all\\" here: it's just an additional line of code for Perl hacks, assuming one is at least clinically sane about security, i.e., doesn't pass a form field to system(\\"$form{1}\\"). Doesn't cover PHP. Has a good chapter on essential JavaScript (how to check form fields to make sure they were filled in, etc.). The book is aimed at beginners, yet I (a career techie) did not find it annoying. It is to-the-point and I quickly found what I wanted --and more! Lots of cool tricks + good \\"under the hood\\" info (such as: the HEAD section loads entirely before the BODY, which is why it's a good place to put JavaScript functions so that they're all ready by the time the user sees anything)."},{"Title":"Creating Cool Web Sites With HTML, XHTML, and CSS","review":"I'm glad I didn't open the enclosed CD.

The book is divided into three parts:Part 1 - Building A Wicked Cool Web Page - So What's All This Web Jazz?; Building Your First Web Page: HTML Basics; Presenting Text Attractively; Moving Into The 21st Century With Cascading Style Sheets; Lists And Special Characters; Putting The Web In World Wide Web: Adding Pointers And Links; From Dull To Cool By Adding GraphicsPart 2 - Rockin' Page Design Strategies - Tables And Frames; Forms, User Input, and the Common Gateway Interface; Advanced Form Design; Activating Your Pages With JavaScript; Advanced Cascading Style Sheets; Site Development With WeblogsPart 3 - Expanding Your Pages Into A Web Site - Web Sites versus Web Pages; Thinking About Your Visitors And Your Site's Usability; Validating Your Pages And Style Sheets; Building Traffic And Being Found; Closing Thoughts; Appendix A: Step-by-step Web Site Planning Guide; Appendix B: Finding A Home For Your Web Site; IndexReviewIf you're just starting out with learning how to build Web pages or sites, you no doubt have a wide number of books to choose from to help you learn those skills. But you can easily get bogged down in the minutiae of every little HTML tag and still not know what CSS means. You need a readable book that gives you solid coverage of essential information. With that in mind, you should check out Creating Cool Web Sites With HTML, XHTML, and CSS by Dave Taylor.To position this properly, let's make sure you're the right audience. This isn't a book that will teach new tricks to an experienced web designer who earns their living developing corporate web sites. This book does an excellent job in covering a lot of ground without needing 1000+ pages to do so. Taylor takes you through the basics of HTML and XHTML, as well as how to use CSS to add formatting and presentation to your page. There's even some coverage of JavaScript as well. As you continue to gain expertise in each of these areas, you will probably want a hard-core reference manual to continue your education, but Creating Cool Web Sites will give you the necessary foundation to get started.While targeted more towards beginners, the information in part 3 is a worthy read for a larger audience. To properly build a web site, you have to think of it as a cohesive whole, not just a collection of separate pages. The author helps the reader think through site issues, such as traffic, accessibility, and so on. Once again, any one of these topics could be a book on its own, but this is a nice level of coverage for initial exposure and to get started.ConclusionBeginners will find this to be an approachable coverage of web technologies, while intermediate designers will probably gravitate to the Web site design and CSS information."},{"Title":"Creating Cool Web Sites With HTML, XHTML, and CSS","review":"It's not about learning keys strokes, or commands with HTML. It's about learning the syntax of the language. It's about having an idea about what you want your site to convey, and how you want it to look and expressing it through HTML. So a book that teaches HTML must acts as language primer and select a subset of the language to introduce.This is exactly what this book does. It doesn't provide in-depth coverage of every detail of every tag. It provides an overall look at HTML, then page design, then site design. As such, this is a good book to take you from zero to beginner with HTML. To advance beyond there you will want a book like O'Reilly's \\"HTML: The Definitive Guide\\", or moving beyond that O'Reilly's massive \\"Dynamic HTML: The Definitive Reference\\".I recommend this book for absolute beginners who know nothing about the web and who want to build sites. There is enough there to get you up the ramp of basic knowledge and to get you pointed in the right direction. Sure there are problems, some of the topics (Java, XSLT) could be stripped altogether, but in generally it's a consistently high quality book that covers the three fundamentals; HTML, Page Design and Site Design."},{"Title":"Creating Cool Web Sites With HTML, XHTML, and CSS","review":"If you want a Web site with more than the cookie-cutter templates offered by Front Page, read this book!

For the advanced designer, while there may not be anything that is new to you, it will likely teach you a better way to do something, or refresh your memory on the correct way to do something.For someone not experienced in CSS, start with this book, you may not have to look anywhere else.

He didn't even mention using Word, other than as a cautionary &quot;Don't&quot;. No, he suggests Notepad, Mac TextEdit, or vi, pico etc. That alone is so refreshing.But there's a lot more to like. This is a complete, soup to nuts, &quot;getting started with web pages&quot; guide that brings you from simple HTML right through Javascript, Cascading Style Sheets, basic forms, and even validation tools. The style is practical, with useful examples that don't get bogged down trying to cover every single aspect of every single tag. Yes, you'll want other, more comprehensive references later in your learning, but this really is a fast on-ramp to that Information Superhighway we used to hear so much about.I didn't honestly expect to learn a lot from this, but I was pleasantly surprised to pick up a few pointers on things I missed in more detailed documentation. There were a few things here and there I took some exception to - things that aren't &quot;wrong&quot;, but aren't entirely &quot;right&quot; either, but really these were just expository opinon: I would have explained them differently.

Each of the four segments making up CTR is a cry from the soul, which poignantly if not bitterly captures the essence of the cultural dislocation suffered by those sold to foreign lands. Some, like Nash in &quot;Pagan Coast&quot;, imbibe the Christian values of their colonial masters but experience the pull of their native calling when they are set free and returned as missionaries. Others like Martha, from &quot;West&quot;, suffer the misery, indignity and hopelessness that only chattels should know. Phillips isn't out to demonise the white man. He leaves it to us to judge. How do we doubt do-gooder Edward's sincerity in making Nash into a new man ? But then there is also skipper James Hamilton's indifference to the cruelty meted out to slaves in the title segment. The final segment &quot;Somewhere in England&quot; doesn't seem to belong but it does. The strong emotional resonance that these stories evoke is what binds them together. Phillips also displays his literary genius and stylistic versatility in using different styles for the different segments. His Conrad-influenced prose in &quot;Pagan Coast&quot; boasts some of the most beautiful and fluent writing ever. On &quot;Somewhere in England&quot;, he comes across like a contemporary novelist using prose punctuated by thought fragments. &quot;CTR&quot; brings four separate but all desperately heartrending stories together. The names of the three children - 2 boys and a girl - sold to slavery by their father in an act of desperate foolishness and named Nash, Martha and Taylor, all make their appearances. They are the countless nameless who consititute the African diaspora today. CTR is a brilliantly constructed and devastatingly powerful piece of work. Nobody interested in serious literature should miss it !"},{"Title":"Crossing The River","review":"This is without a doubt one of the best books that I have ever read.

In fact, the prologue begins the story with the guilty voice of the father who sells his children to a white slaver out of \\"a desperate foolishness\\" when his crops fail. The reader follows the sin and suffering of all of the participants in the slave trade, black and white, and the virtuosity of Caryl Phillips use of language makes the journey both emotional and memorable."},{"Title":"Crossing The River","review":"Eventhough the book is composed by four different unrelated stories, of a black evaegelist in Liberia, a black woman heading for a new life in California during the pilgrimage of the XIX century, the Captain of a slaves trading vessel, and a G.I in England during the II World War; for me there is a phrase that encompass most of the sadness and despair that goes with a life that other persons have damaged and limited due to the shade of your skin and not because of your actions and omissions.&quot;The young evangelist preached with all his might, but Marta could not find solace in religion, and was unable to sympathize with the sufferings of the sun of God when set against her own private misery&quot;."},{"Title":"Crossing The River","review":"though it was my original impulse to do so, i felt bad giving this book 2 stars because i was able to read it pretty well all the way through, and i was kept somewhat interested in what was going to happen next, and i liked the overall idea of the book - to explore some of the less obvious aspects of the impact of slavery. however, when considering the 4 topics chosen for this book, there seems no obvious reason as to why they were chosen. they are not connected in any way other than they involve descendents of slaves, and they dont seem to be of any other objective importance. within that, there are some innovative storytelling techniques, such as the story of the ship being told through the daily log, but then there are the parts where the captain is writing love letters, which seems to have nothing to do with the story other than to show him as having two different aspects to his personality, and to explore the way in which the writer is able to emulate an 18th century writing style. however, there is nothing dramatically important about those letters. we dont get to know the captain in enough contexts in order to care much about his love life - especially one so mushy. similarly, there is no real reason that the former slave master visits liberia, and there are no real character traits explored. after reading the book, im left thinking: \\"liberia was interesting.\\" \\"there were black pioneers?\\" \\"slave ships sucked.\\" \\"it must have been hard to have an interracial relationship in the 40s.\\" and not much else. not much else is given, other than a writing style that is true to the time periods it discusses."},{"Title":"Crossing The River","review":"This book was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1993, Britain's equivalent to the Pulitzer.

In this story, the English failed to turn back the Spanish Armada in 1588 and consequently became a satellite nation to the Spanish empire. The story is centered on an obscure playwright named William Shakespeare. Already you know Turtledove is going to have fun. But wait, a secondary protagonist is Lope de Vega, the greatest Spanish playwright of that time. And maybe the greatest Spanish philanderer as well.Turtledove gets to write portions of two Shakespearean plays and various poetry. That's got to be hard work, right? And if you think his intentions are serious, just remember that the play's the thing.This story has all the minor historical details that you expect from him and probably taught me more about Shakespeare than any English teacher. I wish he would write history books for high school and college classrooms. It's got to be easier than making up an alternate timeline and it would still be interesting. After all, it would be by Harry Turtledove!Ain't it a shame how much fun Turtledove had with this novel. If I hadn't had almost as much fun, I would wonder why they pay the man for writing; obviously it isn't a real chore for him. However, if you really want to keep Turtledove writing novels like this, go out and buy two, one for you and one for a friend. You won't regret it.This is a fun book, but historically thought provoking. Read it or you will be sorry later!-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"I just finished reading \\"Ruled Brittania\\" by Harry Turtledove. This is his best work yet. Unlike much of his work it's not science fiction, it's just alternate history. The central character is William Shakespeare (which I thought took a lot of guts, writing a fictional story about the English language's most famous author).If you like Shakespeare, you'll love this book. If you're not into Shakespeare, you will be after reading this book. This is the 12th Turtledove book I've read, in my opinion it's the best of the dozen.A brief outline: The Spanish Armada conquered England and has ruled the island for 9 years now. We get a unique look at the writings of Master Shakespeare, as they never occured. The poet gets caught up in a conspiracy to rebel against the Spaniards. Naturally, they want him to write a creme de la creme play that will incite the populace to rise up.It moved me, caught me up in the lives of the characters, and, at times, had me roaring with laughter. Definitely recommended to one and all."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"_Ruled Britannia_ (hey, Amazon, correct your spelling!) is Turtledove's best stand-alone book in the last few years. In fact, it's an absolute delight, not least because of the gorgeous amount of Shakespearean language (much of it directly adapted from the Bard's own works, indeed - trying to guess which plays or poems a certain line came from is a big part of the fun) and because of the depth and affection with which Turtledove depicts his alt-hist Shakespeare and his Spanish opposite number Lope de Vega (a famous real-life playwright who, in the novel, is a junior officer in the Spanish occupation force who much prefers to spend his time hanging with Master Will and his cronies, or else in pursuing and bedding English beauties). Turtledove might have been accused in some instances recently of padding his work, or phoning it in, but not this time around. Along with _Guns of the South_, I can hardly think of a better introduction to the good Professor's work."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"I agree with another reviewer that this is the book for which to remember Turtledove. Though I haven't read every one of his books, this is by far the best. This is yet another historical &quot;what if&quot; book: What if the Spanish King Philip II and his Armada had defeated the English in 1588 and occupied England? And what if, after 9 years of occupation, the English insurgency had chosen none other than William Shakespeare to be the tool of their revolution?This book has so much going for it: conflict between England and Spain, plotting on both sides as the Englishman Cecil outsmarts the Spanish commanders, a look into daily life in London through the eyes of Shakespeare (the home, the theater, the ordinary tavern, and contemporary speech), Lope de Vega the Spanish poet and resident &quot;Don Juan,&quot; and plenty of comedy (the clown Will Kemp and the &quot;keytone cop&quot; Constable Walter Strawberry).It is true that certain notions had to be stretched a bit (e.g., Philip II keeping the defeated Elizabeth so close to home and allowing William Cecil to stay in power), but most of the &quot;what ifs&quot; were believable.The characters wre well-developed, but most were not too lovable to me. I did like both Shakespeare and de Vega. It was neat seeing Shakespeare transform from &quot;relative coward&quot; into a true hero. I am glad that de Vega ended up OK, too (though his &quot;Don Juan&quot; act got a bit old). My favorite characters were the funny ones, especially Constable Strawberry. I didn't see why Shakespeare disliked him so; Strawberry was only doing his job. I am glad that the Constable both showed himself smarter than expected and finally &quot;got his man.&quot; I so couldn't stand Ingram Frizer; I am glad he got his just desserts. I also liked Will Kemp, Richard Burbage, and Kit Marlowe (in spite of his reputation).It is true that Catholics may not like the story, because of their treatment by the victorious English. I don't think the author did it to discredit Catholics; Turtledove did it, because that's what the historical English may have done (and vice verse with the Spanish inquisition). Even Shakespeare's quarrel was less about religion and more about politics (he admits that he might have been Catholic were it his own choice). Still I was sorry about the player Quinn (even if he was a jerk) and the editor who were killed only because they were the wrong religion. Neither side came off very well (even Shakespeare laments at what his own people will do after the revolution), but, I guess, that was how many people behaved then.I think that this book gives a good acoount the late 16th Century England from both English and Spanish views. Shakespeare was an excellent choice as the main character, and his interactions with his colleagues (Marlowe, Burbage, Kemp, de Vega, Phelippes, Kate, Sellis, etc.) were well written - so full of wit and poetic pieces. I like the way the author put together other plays to write King Philip and Boudicca, too.All in all, this is a wonderful mixture of history, literary wit, and comedy. I recommend it highly as the best of Turltedove's works."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"To draw no envy, Tur'l'dove to thy name,Am I thus ample to thy book and fame;And do confess thy writing to be suchAs neither man nor muse could praise too much."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"The Armada was victorious the Spanish came ashore and began proving to the heretic Protestants how much God loved them despite their differences. Well they burned them at the stake but its basically the same thing.Into this maelstrom steps William Shakespeare and he really doesn't care one way or another he just wants to keep his head on his shoulders and write plays. But he is faced with a difficult task how can he inspire his countrymen to revolt and still keep his head?I really liked this book a lot better then most of the stuff Doctor Turteldove has come out with in a long while. It is intense and full of intrigue and revenge(plus Shakespeare). Harry also has a few good rebellions scenes thrown in to keep the simple guys(namely me) interested. There is also an almost total lack of something that has become all to common in Turtledove's work VIRTUALLY NO STUPID SEX SCEANS. Not that I mind sex in books its just sometimes with this author adds on sex scenes whenever there is a lull in the plot. Lulls in the plot don't happen in this book it never lets up so this is not an issue."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"Harry Turtledove writes convincing William Shakespeare.Need one say more?"},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"Although Harry Turtledove is noted as being a \\"master of alternate history,\\" many of his books cannot be called alternate history in any realistic sense of the term. His Guns of the South imagines the Cofederacy being supplied with AK-47's by time-travelling racists. Uh-huh. And his two Worldwar series assume aliens (real, honest-to-goodness outer space baddies) invade Earth in the middle of WWII. Ooooo-kaaaayyyy..... But here we have a plausible alternate reality world - imagine England 10 years after the Spanish Armada. Assume the Spanish navy won and managed to land the Duke of Parma's troops in Britain. Turtledove starts with this premise and paints a convincing picture - forced conversion to Catholicism and death to Protestant heretics, an English Inquisition to hunt said heretics down, and occupation by Spanish and Irish troops, the latter brought in to bolster the Catholic ranks to hold London.In this world works one William Shakepeare. He has still written a number of his works we are familiar with - Hamlet, Love's Labour's Lost - in the presence of the Spanish occupation. Then an underground agent approaches Will with a plan: write a play so incindiary that the crowds watching the play will rise up agaist their oppressors.From this setup, the story arc of the entire book should be obvious to anyone, if not the ultimate outcome - does Will's play and the insurgents' plot succeed? I don't mean to denigrate the book at all - just because the plot is obvious doesn't mean that the story isn't enjoyable. And it is enjoyable. London in 1600 was full of colourful characters that Turtledove borrows from real life, not least of which is Shakespeare himself and his contemporary playwrite, the homosexual (at a time when it was a capital offense) Christopher Marlowe. London and its sister communities (Westminster, Southwark, etc.) are beautifully rendered, invoking the bustle and squalor that was everyday life in Elizabethan times.This book has nowhere near the scope or depth of his serial books. That's inevitable in a one-off, but the number of major characters in Ruled Britannia is low even so. Similarly the action is linear and completely centred on Shakespeare. But it is well-written and engaging. If Turtledove's verse is not original, but borrowed from a variety of sources (including Marlowe), we must remember that Shakespeare himself did the same thing, and the book is richer for it. The characters speak in what reads as 17th-century English, but it's easily followed, and the authenticy such language lends to the story is invaluable."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"This book is excellent. It combines good alternate history, with a taut plot and deep characters. But above all else this homage to Shakespeare-good homage to Shakespeare. If you love his works buy this book, and if you never learned to appreciate the bard, you will after reading this."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"I'm hesitant to really call this science fiction. It is set entirely in the time of Shakespeare and Elizabeth, and the &quot;What If&quot; premise is that the Spanish Armada successfully reached England. All the dialog is in psuedo Elizabethan English, so if you had any trouble reading Shakespeare in high school, you will be completely lost here. Turtledove cribs large pieces of period free-verse from several authors, which just adds to the opacity of the work.Scholars might find hidden references and interesting constructs, but most readers will miss any and all historical notes.The writing itself is decent, and for a relief Turtledove only alternates between two characters (Shakespeare and a spanish military officeer/playwright), unlike much of his reecent work which seem to all include huge casts. But the plot is lame, and the ending implausible."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"Harry Turtledove's newest book is a straight alternative history; no fantasy, no science fiction. The turning point is a victorious Spanish Armada, whose superior forces overwhelmed the British and have returned England to Catholic rule. Elizabeth I is now a prisoner in the Tower of London, while King Phillip II's daughter Isabella and her husband are the Queen and King.Nine years later, the book begins with a vivid description of the English Inquisition (no one expects...) and heretics paraded and then burned at the stake. The population has been whipsawed between Catholic and Protestant rule, and now the Catholics are back with a vengeance. William Shakespeare is one of Turtledove's viewpoint characters, and like most, he is willing to go along with whatever religion the rulers want, as long as he can continue his day-to-day living. If that means observing Lent a month earlier than the Protestants would have, then he'll eat fish where others can see him. Alas, events do not allow a peaceful existance for him.Shakespeare is asked to help overthrow the Spanish-Catholic overlords by writing a play about Queen Boudicca and her revolt against the invading Romans. Meanwhile, the Spanish ask him to write a master work commerating the about-to-drop-dead-any-day-now King of Spain, Phillip II. And the other viewpoint character, the Spanish lieutenant Lope de Vega, is there to watch Shakespeare and ensure nothing treasonous is going on. And de Vega enjoys his job, in fact he writes plays in Spanish and loves talking shop. So how is Shakespeare ever going to rehearse Boudicca, assuming he can figure out which of his troupe is willing to do so without running to the Inquisition?Unlike most of Turtledove's other books, there are ONLY two viewpoint characters, and that helped move the plot along as well as let the background seep in. Turtledove's typical work has anywhere between eight and twenty viewpoints, giving a channel-surfing feel to some of them. Here we get to know the two protagonists, their fears, triumphs, and demons. Many here have said this is Turtledove's best book yet. While I'd reserve that for _How Few Remain_ (his fantastic alternate history of a victorious Confederate States of America 20 years later), this is certainly one of his best. If you love Shakespeare, you will love the use of his quotes throughout the book, as well as discovering how his plays take different form in this universe. If you don't, you will want to read more Shakespeare when you're through. Don't miss this one."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"Ten years after the successful invasion of the Spanish Armada overthrew Elizabeth, England has quietly simmered under the repression of the dons. All it needs is the right motivation to rise up. As King Phillip II lies on his death-bed, England's remaining loyalists decide now is the time to strike. But how to stir the people to rebellion? A play's the thing, and who better to write it but William Shakespeare of course.It's not that easy, of course. Spain wants to make sure England stays loyal, and what better way to commemorate their king than with a play, written by William Shakespeare.Poor Master William. Not made for intrigue, nor gifted with great physical courage, he finds himself in the burden of his nation's sovereignty on his shoulders. Worse, he is forced to contend with the attentions of Senior Lieutenant Lope de Vega, who is made for intrigue and is a formidible playwright of his own.\\"Ruled Britannia\\" is the book that Harry Turtledove should be remembered for. Even more than \\"Guns of the South\\", even more than \\"Worldwar\\" or \\"Great War\\". Turtledove writes with a richness of setting and depth of character only hinted at in previous works. He imbues Shakespeare and de Vega with complexity and depth as both play unwitting games of cat and mouse, leading from back alley murder and conspiracy, through the threat of the Inquisition, plays, romance, swashbuckling action, onward to the inevitable question: which play will be performed?"},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"Groaning under Spanish rule for ten years, ever since England failed to defeat the Spanish Armada in 1588, London citizens have endured the Inquisition, the continued imprisonment of Elizabeth in the Tower of London, the use of Irish barbarians as thugs and enforcers by the Spanish occupiers, and a constant sense of uncertainty born of religious and political turmoil. The pageantry and spectacle of an auto-da-fe, both awe-inspiring and terrifying, open this novel of alternate history, its horrors made real by the cry of a condemned man, begging for help from an acquaintance in the mob, William Shakespeare, who can do nothing to help, and whose own life is endangered by the man's pitiful appeals.Shakespeare here is a hero at the height of his powers as an actor and playwright. Sharing one-third of a room in a boarding house, eating and writing by firelight in a pub, dealing with the egos of his acting company, and associating with people from all walks of society--from mysterious characters like Nick Skeres and the \\"witch\\" Cicely Sellis, to Francis Bacon and Lord Burghley (Sir William Cecil)--Shakespeare is the pivot around whom all the action revolves. In counterpoint to him is Lt. Lope de Vega, an unpublished Spanish playwright, sent to infiltrate Shakespeare's theater and its productions and unmask any traitors to Spanish rule. When Lord Burghley secretly hires Shakespeare to write a play called Boudicca, planned as a call to the populace to throw off their Spanish yoke and avenge themselves, Shakespeare finds himself in mortal danger--he has also been hired by the Spanish to write a play in honor of Philip II, the dying Spanish king, a play to be produced as soon as Philip dies. Writing and rehearsing both plays simultaneously with a less than reliable troupe, Shakespeare must walk a fine line to avoid discovery as the mood in London becomes increasingly threatening.Writing in the language and style of the period, author Turtledove casually (and very skillfully) incorporates innumerable Shakespearean quotations into his text, often with humorous intent. Puns, the off-color wordplay which so often provides comic relief in Shakespeare's plays, dialogue in which characters talk at cross-purposes, and a character who constantly misuses \\"big words,\\" are a delight for any language-lover and admirer of the Bard. Quotations from Shakespeare&#65533;s Boudicca, which feel like quotations from a new and undiscovered authentic work, are brilliantly crafted from works of the period by Shakespeare and several contemporaries, and the opening night of that play is a stunning literary coup by Turtledove. All the talk and intrigue do lead to a plot which is a bit thin and short on action--until the bang-up conclusion, filled with arquebuses, rapiers, poleaxes, pikes, and even chamberpots. Lovers of language will thrill at Turtledove's achievement here, even while wishing, perhaps, that the book were a hundred pages shorter. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"For a writer to portray the life of another writer, one for whom daily living details are in short supply, is a difficult job. When it is not a work of biography, but rather an alternate history, and the writer being portrayed is Shakespeare, this act takes courage and more than a bit of chutzpah. Happily, Turtledove is (mostly) equal to this task.Imagining a world where the Spanish Armada won, and England conquered and placed under the nominal rule of Queen Isabella, subsidiary to King Philip II of Spain, in many ways this is an intriguing look at the both the time and place - and its overlap with another SF writer's look at this time, Neal Stephenson's Baroque Cycle, provides an interesting comparison. Instead of Stephenson's incredibly broad look at the times, people, and politics, Turtledove chooses to limit the scope of this book to the theater and its environs, with Shakespeare becoming the focal point of an attempted rebellion, as William Cecil commissions him to write a play designed to inflame the audience. Almost simultaneously, he is commissioned to write a play praising the life and deeds of King Philip, due to be performed upon Philip's death.The tension in this book derives from these two opposing objectives, of how Shakespeare can write and get rehearsals performed of a subversive play while being closely watched by the Spanish for his progress on the King Philip play. Many of the characters presented are familiar ones: Kit Marlowe, Francis Bacon, Richard Burbage; and in general they are well fleshed out, and conform in the main to what is actually known about these people.But more than plot or character, this book is driven by style and place. The dialogue is done in the Elizabethan English of the time, what Shakespeare basically wrote in. At times this is a little unnerving, as the syntax, word order, and vocabulary is such that you need to read a sentence two or three times to make sense of it. But it certainly provides a definitive ambience, which coupled with the descriptions of living, working, hygienic, and religious conditions, the typical fashions in dress and social customs, gives one a very good sense of the era. Turtledove has also inserted some wry jokes: changes in the names of Shakespeare's plays (such a \\"Love's Labour Won\\" instead of \\"Love's Labour Lost\\") and at various appropriate places in the dialogue he has stolen some of Shakespeare's most famous lines, given them perhaps a slightly shifted meaning. You don't need to be a Shakespearian scholar to recognize these, as most of these lines are so famous they have almost become part of the English language, though trying to match the lines to what play they belong in (and if that play had been written by the time of this book) is a more difficult but fun exercise.The major failing I found with this book was that the basic idea behind the plot, that those planning a major rebellion would try to use a play as one of its major lynch-pins, does not come across as very believable. The play could obviously only be performed once, and would an audience of a couple hundred or so really make that much difference to the outcome of an uprising? But as a fun, light read that provides an interesting perspective on the times and the writer, this work does quite well.--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"Turtledove, the master of alternative history, turns his gaze to the Elizabethan era and asks, what if it were the Isabellian era instead? As &quot;Ruled Britannia&quot; opens, England has been occupied for ten years by the Spanish forces of Phillip II, who holds it in the name of his daughter Isabella. Elizabeth is held in the Tower of London, most of the nobles of the realm have either been exiled or executed, and the weary populace shows little signs of resisting. But as Philip lies on his deathbed, a coup is planned by Elizabeth's faithful councilor William Cecil, who enlists the aid of the popular playwright William Shakespeare in a plot to inspire the English to rise against the occupation.As with most alternate history, you need to have a good grasp of how things actually went in order for the changes to make much sense. Many characters are familiar: Cecil, Shakespeare, Kit Marlowe, and Francis Bacon among them. Others may not be, such as Lieutenant Lope de Vega, Shakespeare's Spanish counterpart whose interest in his rival's latest work may unravel the whole plot.Shakespearean gems are scattered throughout, some in contexts guaranteed to elicit a chuckle. And, to Turtledove's credit, all the English dialogue is cast in an Elizabethan dialect. Depending on your familiarity with it, this can either be one of the book's greatest charms or its worst annoyance.Unfortunately, this is not an action-oriented book, and at almost 600 pages, that can be a real killer. There are scenes where characters are writing, where they are reading, and where they are talking, and scenes where they talk about reading what someone has written. Any actual action is jammed into a somewhat unsatisfying chapter at the end. This is a book about words and ideas, which may not appeal to everybody. Still, it is an original, witty, rich novel that makes for enjoyable, if not always easy, reading."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"In a world where the Spanish Armada was not defeated, William Shakespeare and the other citizens of London live under the Spanish flag in Harry Turtledove's 'Ruled Britannia.'Shakespeare, as portrayed by Turtledove--quite accurately as many would suggest, is a well respected but struggling playwright. He writes and acts to put coins in his pocket and to create art. He quibles with the theater over any change they deem necessary to make to his plays. In the meantime, he attends Catholic Mass and attempts to live according to the conventions as prescribed by the Catholic Spanish conquerors. His greatest fear is to be labelled as a heretic and face the bonfires of the Spanish Inquisition.In order to enjoy this novel, it is important to keep in mind that this is not a statement by Turtledove on Catholicisim or Prodestants. It is merely a 'what if' story of what might have happened had Kind Phillip and the Spaniards been successful in their plans to invade England.That being said, Shakespeare is no hero. He minds his own business until he is approached by Queen Elizabeth's loyal subjects with a request that he create a play that will inflame the passions of the English, inciting them to overthrow their oppressive conquerors. If not for the gold presented him, it is entirely likely Shakespeare would have had nothing to do with the plot.In a strange twist of fate, the Spaniards also approach Shakespeare to write a play. King Phillip is nearing death, and they desire that a play be written in his honor, in the hope that it will help foster good will between the British and their Spanish Rulers.All along, Shakespeare has to avoid his plans being discovered by the adoring yet suspicious Lope de Vega. As intriguing as Shakespeare, de Vega came to London with the Armada. He is a playwright as well, and has a weakness for falling in love. His seductions eventually get him into trouble, and provide some amusement along the way.'Ruled Britannia' is a fascinating novel. Turtledove steps away from the Civil War and the World Wars to write in a different era. He has proven himself to be a first rate alternative history author. I highly recommend this novel to any Turtledove fan, British history buff, those with a love for Shakespeare, and alternative history fans in general."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"William Shakespeare is well considered to be the greatest English writer in history. Though his English is now archaic, the intricate cleverness of his plot lines and their timeless insights into human nature have made him acclaimed. Which presents a serious problem for any author attempting to have him as a major character in a novel. Can you better his prose? Well Turtledove lacks any temerity! He makes Shakespeare the central character of this novel.Both Shakespeare's spoken dialogue, and the invented writings in his play Boudicca are well done. More to the point, and the harder of it, read carefully the few stanzas of the latter that are presented in the text. Turtledove seems to have captured the cadences of authentic Shakespeare. As another reviewer said, it feels like an undiscovered Shakespeare play!Having said all this, I should add that the story is a little sparse on action. It's a lighthearted romp through England of that time. Certainly, it does not compare in action or grimness of subject with Turtledove's WorldWar series, with its subtext of Nazi genocide, or his Civil War series.The forced admixture of Spanish and English cultures is amusing. Turtledove lives in Los Angeles, as do I. Here there is a melange of both, with the Anglo influence being dominant. I think he used this experience and inverted it, to get some of the everyday depictions of London under the Spaniards. The casual use of a few Spanish phrases in English is unremarkable in 21-st century LA, but would certainly have been rare in 16-th century London, but for the Occupation.This book may appeal more to the fans of Shakespearean and Middle English literature than your dyed-in-the-wool science fiction fans. In this, it resembles Turtledove's early short stories set in an alternate Byzantium Empire. As you may know, he has a PhD in Byzantine history from UCLA. He parlayed this expertise into various stories. Someone asked him about this once: How do people in that field feel about what he did. He said about half thought it was just weird. But the other half thought it was cool that he could put such arcana to use. He has done similarly here."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"On an earth that never was but could have been, The Spanish Armada was triumphant and landed in England.

Will rises to the occasion and begins writing a drama while knowing that one mistake will mean his and the troupe's death by the flames.RULED BRITANNIA is a fascinating stand-alone work of alternate history as Harry Turtledove departs from his American opus to provide a compelling work that is believable and shows what might have been if the storm and Drake had not caused havoc on the Armada.

As a history student married to a history student, I LOVE playing the \\"What If\\" game with various historical scenarios.Most of Turtledove's recent work, however, has not been very inspiring. Once, I would rush to the bookstore to pick up the latest installment of whatever series I was in the middle of. Now I'm content to getting the newest books from the library. Flat characterization, little plot advancement, and dull repetition have tarnished what would otherwise be very good books.I wish they could all be like Ruled Britannia. This stand-alone novel shows that Turtledove can still write engaging dialog with memorable characters-even if the characters are largely historical figures. Maybe the idea of a successful Spanish invasion of Britain is far-fetched for some (I personally think that the invasion would have been a bit more \\"multinational\\" as more Catholic powers piled onto England), but the reactions of British citizens to the invasion is, I feel, quite accurate. I particularly like the portrayal of religion in the daily lives of Britons-for many, it didn't matter whether Protestants or Catholics were in power, or what ceremonies they had to follow or avoid; they were going to worship God, however they were allowed to.I was particularly pleased to see one of my favorite Spanish playwrites, Lope de Vega, portrayed in the book. Lope was born only two years before Shakespeare, so they certainly were contemporaries. The depiction of de Vega's womanizing is very accurate, historically speaking, as are other aspects of his life-it was really only the failure of the Spanish effort against England that allowed him to leave the army and begin his writing career in earnest (Lope's ship was among the few who returned from the bitter defeat of the Armada at the hands of the British fleet).The plot is particularly interesting, especially when contrasted with modern times. Imagine an era in which political propaganda is released NOT in 15 second soundbites, but in the text of plays. The depiction of the contemporary drama scene in the book is quite accurate, showing exactly how much research Turtledove does to ensure his books are as authentic as possible.There is something for everyone in this book-literature snobs will even enjoy trying to figure out which of Shakespeare's actual plays the \\"alternate\\" titles represent. The book is a refreshing reminder of why I started reading Turtledove to begin with. I can only hope that the good doctor will continue to release these \\"single shot\\" alternate histories in addition (or perhaps in place of) the extended sagas that he has been writing recently."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"Since its inception, Science Fiction has speculated about time travel and the possibility of changing the present by meddling in the past. Harry Turtledove writes about radically altered pasts without resort to time machine through a device called &quot;alternate history&quot;. Blurbs on his books proclaim him the master of this genre. In support of his title Turtledove has published two hefty tomes in as many months. Advance and Retreat is the fourth book in his &quot;war between the provinces&quot; series which projects events in the US Civil War through a very convoluted looking glass. Ruled Brtiannia is more conventional, working from a single &quot;what if...&quot; premise, i.e. that the Spanish armada had succeeded in subjugating England in 1588.Elizabeth is locked up in the Tower and Phillip II's daughter sits on the throne of England. Turtledove's story begins a decade later when William Shakespeare becomes embroiled in a plot to throw off the Spanish yoke. He proves a reluctant and timid revolutionary. Turtledove creates a persona for Shakespeare that is entirely believable and consistent with the known facts of his life. Many of the other characters in the book are important historical figures, though playing somewhat different roles in an England under Spanish rule. William Cecil is the prime conspirator rather than Elizabeth's prime minister. He commissions Shakespeare to write and perform a play that will arouse the patriotic fervor of the English. Lope de Vega, the great Spanish playwright (who really did sail with the armada) is a captain in the London garrison and a fan of Shakespeare's plays. His commander has him commission Shakespeare to write a play extolling the virtues of Phillip II. Faced with these competing and contradictory demands, Shakespeare comes up with a solution worthy of... well... of Shakespeare. Burbage, Kemp and Christopher Marlowe naturally figure in the story.Turtledove sprinkles lines from Shakespeare and Marlowe, or approximations thereof, liberally through his dialogue. He plays a trifle loose with the sequence of the plays for no apparent reason, having the Falstaff of the Merry Wives of Widsor precede the Falstaff of Henry IV -- rather than the the other way round.A witty and entertaining book."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"Turtledove is one of the most accomplished writers I have ever enjoyed.

He makes the characters come alive: you feel that you are actually in there with them.\\"Ruled Britannia\\" is unlike his other alternate histories (ie. those based on the War Between the States) in that it is easier reading and loaded with wonderful plays on words - puns and other subtle (and not so subtle) jokes. The story is complex: the strong plot(s) thicken (and occasionally thin) but you are never very far away from a good laugh.The basic premise is that the Spanish Armada was not destroyed by thestorm and that Spain did, in fact, conquer England. A Spanish King andQueen sit on the British throne, the English Inquisition runs rampant,and Queen Elizabeth in locked in the English Tower, and revolt is in the air. The central character is none other than William (Will) Shakespeare. His character, those of the players in his troupe, and of others throughout the story, are wonderfully well developed: some you love (most of the time), some you hate (most of the time), and some just stumble through.

This was another great story and puts the reader in the period, with period speech and dialects. I haven't felt more in-the-place since I read Chaucer in the original Middle English in college! Just like then, and just like reading a Shakespeare play, once you get into the flow of the language, it becomes easy to understand [my opinion, at least]. Maybe some will still find it off-putting, but I think it is a great aspect of the story and the whole premise: that you are in a world that is familiar yet different from what we knew in our own timeline. This is great fiction, in any case."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"I've only read a few of Turtledove's other novels; he seems to have so many series going on that I have a hard time keeping them all straight and so don't bother with any of them. I ended up with _Ruled Britannia_ by mistake (via a book club) and had it sitting around for some months before I picked it up the other day.What a hoot! This was a very, very hard novel to pull off, and Turtledove did in very, very well. I found it funny, engrossing, fascinating, and, at times, moving. I chuckled at the various 'cribs from Shakespeare' that Turtledove scattered throughout the novel. And while others here--and Turtledove himself, in the afterword--note the unlikely nature of the Spanish Armada conquering England, world history has turned on other events equally unlikely--such as the US victory in the Battle of Midway.Rating this novel '4 stars' is not a criticism, just a recognition that it's a fun (and brilliant) romp, but not one I'm likely to read repeatedly (as compared, say, to _Riddle-Master_ by Patricia McKillip).As always, your mileage may vary. ..bruce.."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"I found &quot;Ruled Britannia&quot; to be a very fascinating read, with well-detailed characters, a plausible setting, and certainly enough tension and drama to keep me turning pages when my body was crying out for sleep. This is a good read for anyone interested in Shakespeare, Elizabethan England, or alternate history; even more so for those of us fascinated by all three!"},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"First, this IS science fiction at its best. Science fiction deals with subjects of a speculative nature, i.e., extrapolating a new reality from an existing reality. That means stories set in the future or alternative universes. This fits either category since it is an alternate universe in the past or set in a future that never was beyond an existing point of time in our own universe.Second, you needn't be a Shakespearean scholar to read, understand, enjoy, and love this book. What Turtledove does best is transport you to a new time and reality, bringing that reality to life. The word that the other reviews lack is &quot;culture.&quot; Whether it is early American, Rome, Byzantium, or mid 20th century Chinese peasants, Turtledove makes it real because he brings fine details of culture to life. The thread that runs through all Turteldove's works is that people are basically the same everywhere--they only vary in culture. He makes me feel glad to live in the 21st century, but makes earlier times much less alien. It is no different here with Elizabethan England. Turtledove's alternate history is brought to life with characters who are fun to be with; whom you wish you could sit in an English pub, knock back a few warm ales, and make some puns.Finally, this book has a GREAT plot. The suspense as to whether Shakespear will put on Phillip or Baudicca, whether they will be discovered or betrayed by any number of interesting and enigmatic characters, and a whole host of other things besides. In the process of writing the plays, which we get to see glimpses of, a great deal of maneuvering must take place for the play to be put on. There are tremendous obstacles in their path to preparing for a show in complete secrecy, not least of which is ensuring the loyalty of those involved -- and each are dealt with in varing ways. I don't want to give any more away than I have (I think other reviewers gave too much away already.)"},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"I'm sure that Harry Turtledove, an academically trained historian, is reviled in the academic community, because he is such a good writer of descriptive prose and such an excellent developer of plots and characters that his reading public will take for granted that his descriptions, characters, and plots are the &quot;true&quot; story of so many actual historical places, persons, and events. The reading public, which is so much larger than the group of professional historians and students of history does not know how little has come down to us from the past in terms of records of any kind and that therefore students of the past must interpret what little remains of the past to create their hypotheses. Hollywood and television have contributed more to historical perception than all of the historians who have ever lived.Having said all that as a preface I will now say that &quot;Ruled Britannia&quot; is a great story. It is seamless 16th century adventure, and I only hope that William Shakespere was as fabulous an adventurer and rogue as this author makes out, but I don't care. The story is great. It's NOT a way to learn history; it's the ultimate way to enjoy the history you've learned."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"he Spanish Armada, unhampered by the storm and fire ships that saved England in our history, landed and England lies conquered beneath the Spanish (and Irish) boot. Protestantism is persecuted, Elizabeth languishes in the Tower of London, and spies are everywhere, searching out any remaining supporters of the old English order. Yet London remains restive, even after ten years of Spanish rule, looking for a spark to sent it into revolt. English nobleman Lord Burghley decides that Philip's death and a new play by Shakespeare are just the sparks needed to ignite the flames of freedom. Of course, for Shakespeare, any flames might just come from the Inquisition rather than from freedom.Alternate History master Harry Turtledove combines historical research with an abundance of Shakespearian paraphrases to deliver an entertaining and plausible tale. Certainly England's survival from the Spanish Armada was viewed as a miracle at the time, and certainly a Spanish victory would have changed the world. Setting a story in the world of Shakespeare and Marlowe gives the story instant appeal and the author a challenge to depict the Bard as a witty and human man. Turtledove lives up to the challenge. I especially enjoyed his depictions of the exploits of Spanish soldier and playwright Lupe de Vega.For me, at least, the magic of alternate history is seeing how the world is changed by a slightly different turn of fate (hence the success of the Spanish Armada). The point of RULED BRITANNIA, however, is the English resistance to Spanish rule. The end result, should the revolt succeed, is a return to history much as we knew it. Whether a revolutionary play could set off London is certainly debatable but at least tenable. Less so, to me, is the foolishness of Philip leaving Elizabeth in the tower rather than in the Spanish equivalent. Would Elizabeth have dared put Mary Queen of Scots in Edinburgh?The power of RULED BRITANNIA comes from Turtledove's obvious enjoyment of Shakespeare's dialogue, characters such as the word-mangling Constable Strawberry, and Shakespeare's fellow dramatists Kemp and Burbage."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"I had trouble putting this engaging book down. Obviously Turtledove had great fun writing it, and it shows. Sometimes Turtledove sacrifices character development for the plot (such as in his series about aliens invading Earth during WW2). This book, however, does a great job portraying an all-too-human William Shakespeare, warts and all. I strongly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"Readers who appreciate a very good, solidly written, alternate history will relish Turtledove's Ruled Britania, set in 1597 Britain which has been under the rule of a Spanish king. Writer Will Shakespeare has no interest in politics, but when he has an opportunity to produce a revolutionary drama which will fire the spirits of the oppressed British, he can't help changing his word with his pen!"},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"This is one of Harry Turtledove's best books. Although I considered the plot and story mediocre as alternative histories goes - the superb job he did making Shakespeare as a main character into the story was great - showing outstanding research and implementation. I am not sure it will fly with the majority of alternative history buffs, but if you enjoyed Shakespearen stories, the Shakespearen time, or even the movie &quot;Shakespeare In Love&quot;, I think you would really enjoy the story.The differing history is based on the Spanish Armada having won and Spain having ruled England for about 10 years with both the Spanish and English getting a little complacent with the way thing are. The story then revolves around Lieutenant Lope de Vega (former Spanish playwrite assigned to watch for treason in the theater) and Shakespeare who is hired by loyal English rebels to write a play to incite rebellion in the populace and who is also hired by the Spanish to write a play honoring their King Phillip II."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"I am stunned. This is a magnificent work of alternative history. The collaboration between the two greatest playwrights of the Renaissance is truly a wonderful touch.I was struck not only by the use of Shakespeare's work, and that of other Elizabethan playwrights, but by Turtledove's use of Elizabeth Tudor's speeches. This is history I know well, and the alternative is rendered as near to perfection as possible."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"&quot;Ruled Brittania&quot; is typical of Harry Turtledove's work. He has obvious love of history and takes care to place the reader in the time he's describing - albeit a slighlty skewed view.In an Elizabethan London, conquered by the Spanish armada, William Shakespeare is asked to write a play to incite the English to overthrow their occupiers. He must do this while under the vigilant eyes of the Spanish. A most usual story of spies and resistance.I have often been frustrated that the author leaves the reader hanging with a sequel coming in a few months. Alternate history readers will be pleased to know that &quot;Ruled Brittannia&quot; is a complete book and wraps up all loose ends before Turtledove's handy historical notes at the end.It's a long, fairly pendantic, book but it offers a tantalizing glimpse at an Elizabethan England that never was.

God save Queen Bess! Turtledove brings Shakespeare to life as well, it would be interesting to find out what happened to him in Turtledoves Timeline, did he retire back to Stratford or remain in London writing more plays?Hopefully Turtledove will revisit English history at some stage - an alternative 1066 maybe, Harold beating William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings (William would presumably become William the Vanquished!).Ruled Britannia is Turtledove and Alternative history at its best.Alan J.

To read or not to read is not the question !"},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"I used to be a fan of Turtledove's work -- that is, until I began this startlingly anti-Catholic screed. One needs only consider the historical facts that (1) England was the most Catholic of European nations before the Protestant revolt and (2) that the English people strongly resisted the imposition of the Protestant religion. The fairy tale that Turtledove concocts (based on revisionist notions that were outdated two centuries ago) amounts to a fantasy palatable only to the bas-bourgeois. A true waste of time.In the end, at least, Turtledove captures the machination-prone personality of the breathtakingly evil Burleigh (whose descendants recently acquired ownership of Biltmore House -- somehow). Yes, that same Lord Burleigh who dragged about a six-foot-long Rosary under the Mary I, then burned Catholics with gusto under Edward VI and Elizabeth. What Turtledove completely misses (and what I suppose amateur historians typically miss when they simply restate the ideas of former times) is that Burleigh was Elizabeth's puppet-master -- not her puppet."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"I was once a Turtledove fan, but not after starting this revolting anti-Catholic screed. Turtledove has lost the mark."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"Harry Turtledove's Ruled Britannia considers a fairly common Alternate History point of departure -- the Spanish Armada was successful in conquering England in 1588. (As in, for example, Keith Roberts's Pavane and Kingsley Amis's The Alteration -- two of the very greatest Alternate History novels.) But Turtledove sets his story much earlier -- not in roughly our present day, as with the two examples I mentioned, but rather in 1597, less than a decade into the Spanish occupation of England, with King Philip's daughter Isabella installed on the throne. (As Turtledove points out, Isabella actually did have at least a tenuous claim to the English crown -- no surprise, perhaps, given how tangled European dynasties became.) England has been forcefully restored to Catholicism, and a homebred English Inquisition is killing people for such crimes as witchcraft and sodomy. But in general the populace seems resigned to the changes, if not precisely happy about them.The protagonists of the book are the greatest playwrights of that time: England's William Shakespeare, and Spain's Lope de Vega. Shakespeare is presented as a vaguely apolitical man, working away as his company, Lord Westmoreland's Men, presents such of his plays as Prince of Denmark and If You Like It. He is almost simultaneously given two commissions. A faction of English resisters wants him to write a play about Boudicca, the English queen who resisted the Romans, in order to help stir up passions against the Spanish occupiers. And the Spanish authorities want him to write a play about King Philip, to be presented in his memory on the occasion of his death, which is soon expected. Lope de Vega is a lieutenant in the occupying force, and it is his job to keep an eye on Shakespeare and his fellow players. He is also charged with tracking down suspected criminals such as Christopher Marlowe, and he spends the rest of his time juggling a variety of lovers, both English and Spanish.The novel moves rather slowly to its fairly predictable conclusion. It's generally enjoyable -- it must be said that it's fun to daydream about additional plays from the pens of Shakespeare and Marlowe. And Turtledove raids Shakespeare's works (as well as Marlowe's and Dekker's and Fletcher's and others) for much of the dialogue, as well as for the invented snatches he presents of the new plays. But I couldn't quite believe in the presented characters of Shakespeare and de Vega: much attention is paid to putting period sentiments in their mouths, but their general actions and attitudes still struck me as too modern. And the plot is a bit too slowly paced, not really twisty enough, and rather implausible in basic outline. It's a pleasant way to pass a few hours, but not a fully successful book."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"RULED BRITANNIA by Harry Turtledove. Set in 1597, Spaniards have invaded England and imprisoned Queen Elizabeth in the Tower of London ten years before. Under King Phillip of Spain, Queen Isabella and King Albert rule in Elizabeth's stead and England groans beneath the terrible yoke of the English Inquisition. Set in London England, William Shakespeare is a successful playwright who writes and performs with his company of players. At long last King Phillip is dying and the time is ripe for a revolt. Aided by his contemporaries, Lord Burghley, Phillip Marlowe, Will Kemp and Richard Burbage, he daringly writes a play that will set the stage for the final English uprising that restores their beloved Elizabeth to her crown!Interesting story, and good premise for a plot. The Characters seem real and there is a bit of history behind each one that allows the premise and events to be believable. Plus it's a nice introduction to Middle English sentence forms, etc. In comparison with the whole of the tale, I thought it was a bit weak on the climax and plot conclusion, but don't let that get in the way of what is a fascinating and absorbing read."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"Ok, well no real reason to feel guilty about this book - its a heck of a read! Its nice and big and a SINGLE book from an author who usually writes 5-10 books series. This, to me, is a great relief to not have to read 5 books that really should have been 1-2 books.Simple premise, the spanish armada from the anglo-spanish war did NOT run afoul of the storm that so devastated them. As a result, the Spanish have conquered England! The book opens about 9 years after this so the story moves quick. Isabella sits on the english throne while Elizabeth is jailed in the tower of london.The story is told from only 2 POVs, thankfully. One of a spanish lieutenant / part time playwright and the other - William Shakespeare! Shakespeare is essentially the same as we've seen in films such as Shakespeare in Love, etc... he is a hard working actor / poet / writer who is becoming very recognized but yet trying to stay out of the english versus spanish conflict that surrounds him. If you have seen the film Shakespeare in Love, then many of the same \\"true to life\\" characters are here also: Burbage, Kemp, Marlowe!The general plot is that both the english rebels and also the spanish want Shakespeare to write a play that serves each sides' cause. Shakespeare really only wants to write and prosper but he is a loyal englishman and so agrees to help. The spanish also want a play (this is all kept secret of course from the spanish) glorifying the soon departed Spanish king. Of course if the spanish found out about his secret play - it would be the Inquisition for Shakespeare!The book is very well told, the detail is astonishing and the \\"what if\\" factor is simply amazing. We see the Inquisition come to England, burning & hanging heretics. A few points could be better tho: the language is at times.. needlessly convoluted. Yes I know its shakespeare, but people didn't ask for a cup of wine with half a page of shakespearean verse. At times the dialogue seems over done - but on the whole its forgivable. Its like Turtledove is showing off.There is no sci fi element here, its pure alternative historical fiction. But its very very well told."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"Over the last few weeks I've given you a review of TL-191, which started out strong but forced me to take an increasingly critical stance as it progressed; The Man with the Iron Heart, which makes a game effort but falls flat; the boring and pointless Hitler's War; and The Golden Shrine, which is so bad I don't have the words to summarize it.If you've read these reviews you might wonder why I keep reading Turtledove. The answer is, I really do like him! He earned my loyalty with a barrage of highly entertaining novels in the late 90s and early to mid 00s, a glimmer of which can still be seen today.And none of those novels stands out like Ruled Britannia.This is a full-length alternate history novel that involves neither World War II nor the American Civil War, one of just a handful published by any author. The PoD here is that England is conquered by Spain in 1588. That's not the story the book tells, however; it tells us of a year in the life of two people living in London after a decade of rule by the King of Spain's daughter, who has some family connection to Henry VII and is propped up by an international garrison consisting of Spanish, English, and Irish forces--under overall Spanish command, of course. Catholicism is the state-sponsored religion and Protestants of all stripes are persecuted. (It would be easier to feel sympathetic had not the Protestants persecuted Catholics prior to the fall of Elizabeth; Turtledove reminds us of the moral ambiguities of the situation even as he paints the anti-Hapsburg English as the protagonists. A very mature technique.) England's Protestant aristocracy are all dead or exiled, all except William Cecil, whom Philip II allowed to continue hanging out in London (he had planned to do so upon the conquest of England in real history) and Elizabeth herself, who is imprisoned in the Tower. Says Philip, \\"Though she herself murdered a queen [Mary Queen of Scots], I will not stoop to her level.\\" England's Catholic aristocracy, which had been either exiled or intimidated to within an inch of its life under Elizabeth, provides a ruling class to support the foreign-born monarch. One such Catholic nobleman is Lord Westmoreland, who sponsors a theater company that includes a sensation on London's literary scene, William Shakespeare.Shakespeare wants nothing to do with the political and religious questions swirling around the throne. He just wants to be left alone to write plays, act, and have an affair with a tavern wench. He lives an ordinary sixteenth century London life which feels very believable in Turtledove's hands. The only problem I found--and I didn't realize this till long after the fact--is that Shakespeare wrote in the morning, to save money on candles; Turtledove always has him write after dark. (Granted, Turtledove has him write some sensitive material. . . . ) He mourns his son, who died the year before, and ignores his wife and daughters, back in Stratford-Upon-Avon, in favor of the tavern wench. (Gratuitous sex scenes? Maybe; but, while the Sonnets have a decided first-the-ring-then-the-thing motif, comparing Shakespeare's wedding date with the birthdate of his first daughter makes it crystal clear he did not practice what he preached.)Unfortunately politics won't leave Shakespeare alone. Through his celebrity, he keeps attracting the attention of people whose lives are less ordinary than he'd like his to be. He's friends with Christopher Marlowe, London's next greatest playwright. (In this timeline Marlowe lived longer than the historical version did. We'll soon learn that the people who killed him were otherwise engaged in this version of history.) While Shakespeare is a thoroughly ordinary person swept up by circumstances, as is the book's other POV character, Marlowe sates our appetite for a larger-than-life hero. His intrigues, his scandals, the extent to which he's at home in the cloak and dagger world of Elizabethan politics make him utterly fascinating.Marlowe introduces Shakespeare to Edward Kelley, an alchemist. On All Saints' Day 1597, Kelley is being led off by the Inquisition to burn at the stake for his crimes. In desperation he scans the crowd looking for a familiar face. On seeing Shakespeare's, he calls out. Shakespeare is anything but grateful for the attention that's been called to him.This doesn't save Kelley, but Robert Cardinal Parsons, the Jesuit Archbishop of Canterbury, grows suspicious of Shakespeare's ties with a man the Inquisition executed. He orders the Spaniards to keep an eye on Shakespeare. The Spaniard who draws this task is Lope de Vega, the book's other POV. de Vega is a historical figure, a Spanish poet and playwright whose place in the canon of Spanish literature is comparable in the English canon, if not to that of Shakespeare himself, then to Marlowe or Ben Johnson or Edmund Spenser or one of the other great Elizabethan writers. (Fun fact, by the way: Though she's credited with reigning over a creative renaissance--and she did--Elizabeth actually imposed the strictest censorship laws in English history.) de Vega speaks English fluently and views the assignment of hanging out with fellow wordsmiths, and picking Shakespeare's brain, as utter delight.Perhaps seeking another way to keep the Hapsburgist eye on Shakespeare, the commander of London's garrison commissions Shakespeare to write a play in honor of Philip II, who is near death, to be given upon that lion's demise. Since the Armada won this fight, Philip does not have the loss of naval hegemony to the English to blight his record, and he also defeated the Dutch, who did not enjoy English help once the Tudors fell. So his record is all good: beating the Turks at Lepanto, colonizing the Americas and the eponymous Philipines, extending the Spanish Empire throughout most of Western Europe and encircling Spain's hereditary enemy, France. His death will be cause for wailing and gnashing of teeth throughout the empire, and who better than England's greatest bard to ensure that the English are properly mournful.A very short while later Shakespeare is summoned by William Cecil, who reveals to him that he, Cecil, is planning a coup to restore Elizabeth to the throne. Cecil fears Philip II but knows that his son, who will be Philip III, is far less formidable; so he is laying in place elements of a plot to be launched upon the elder Philip's death, though Cecil fears he will not live to see it himself. Shakespeare's role is this: Rather than give a play that convinces a full English house how wonderful Philip was, he should give them a play convincing them how wonderful Elizabeth is, by telling the story of the first-century Briton queen Boudicca, whose gutsy but doomed uprising against the Roman imperial governor is the stuff of British lore. Shakespeare must make sure that Boudicca invokes Elizabeth in as many particulars as possible.Shakespeare accepts a great deal of gold from both patrons and begins writing the two plays simultaneously--King Philip when other people are watching, Boudicca when he's alone. His entire theater company needs must be on board to do King Philip, but, since politics cannot be discussed openly, he needs to feel out each member of the company subtly to learn who will be on board. He finds ways of pushing out a few actors who cannot support the plot, but then Geoff Martin, his prompter, reveals himself to be a sincere Catholic who will not act against the Hapsburgs, since they allow him to practice his faith openly; under Tudor rule, he'd been persecuted. Shakespeare names Martin to Cecil's agent, Nick Skeres, who in turn names him to Ingram Frizer, who murders Martin. (Skeres and Frizer are best known to history as the men who killed Marlowe in 1593.) Shakespeare feels guilty (hmm, I guess he was a Catholic himself after all) about the role he played in Martin's death, but he's seen enough stake-burnings to know the Hapsburgs aren't the nicest people in the world, either. And of course the moment he accepted gold from two rival camps, he grabbed a tiger by the tail.de Vega spends a great deal of time buzzing around Shakespeare's company, which makes it quite difficult for them to rehearse Boudicca (which fact leads to a second member of the company being murdered by Frizer). de Vega also spends a great deal of time in a wide variety of beds--this is in keeping with the historical figure, and helps develop the character, putting him in a number of entertaining predicaments. A real friendship develops between Shakespeare and de Vega, which gives Shakespeare pause, as he knows that, by performing Boudicca, he would have to betray his amigo. (de Vega's English is good enough to perform on the stage, and he has been promised a role in King Philip.) The complex moral conundrum in which Shakespeare finds himself leaves him quite unsure which play he will perform.Other goings-on. We get a wonderful performance of Hamlet as Shakespeare and his contemporaries themselves gave it (or at least as Turtledove assumes they would have given it). This scene is so delightful that I'm not even going to call foul on the characters performing in 1597 a play that was written in 1600. There's exploration of the practices of the Counterreformation-era Church which are enlightening to students of church history. And Shakespeare befriends a woman who, though we're never clear beyond a doubt, certainly seems to be a witch--a real witch, with magical powers and everything. Her friendship with Shakespeare is purely platonic; she does eventually let de Vega take her to bed, for her own purposes.Marlowe gets in trouble for sodomy. He had so many vices it's a wonder no one tried to run a pool on which one would come back to bite him in the end. He goes on the lam but returns to London late in 1598 as the time for the zero hour draws near. (Turtledove does a very good job of making the narrative gradually pick up suspense as it approaches climax. Toward the end I'd read sixty or seventy pages in a sitting; it was too exciting to put down.) de Vega recognizes him disguised as a Puritan (because what better way to keep a low profile in a city governed by Philip II's agents and subject to an Inquisition than to disguise oneself as a militant Protestant) and they fight a duel in the street. de Vega deals Marlowe a fatal wound above the eye--the same place as the improbable wound which killed him in our history. The man who dealt the historical wound, Ingram Frizer (whom de Vega does not recognize, of course) thanks de Vega for saving him the trouble and walks off. From this we assume that Cecil (the younger Cecil, now; Robert Cecil, who took over for his father once the old lion died a short while earlier) also wanted Marlowe dead. Poor Kit--so many enemies, in any timeline, all seeking to shut down literary genius before its time. In this book, Turtledove takes a crack at hypothesizing what Marlowe would have written in the extra five years of life. He mentions a play about Tristan and Isolde which he wrote in response to Hamlet, which he felt eclipsed anything he'd written before that.Anyway, while Marlowe's still lying there and before de Vega has even cleaned his sword, news of Philip's death reaches London. The Spaniards tell Shakespeare to give King Philip on such-and-such a date, and Cecil's man tells him to give Boudicca instead; so now he has a decision to make. He pretty much goes right up to the end going back and forth between the two, and ultimately decides to give Boudicca.This means he needs to neutralize de Vega--if he can find him! de Vega still suspects nothing after a year of watching Shakespeare. (This point might be a little weak: Unlike a certain English constable who shows up from time to time, de Vega is not stupid, and Shakespeare is not a particularly sophisticated plotter.) He's en route to the theater to play his role in King Philip, but along the way decides to bone Shakespeare's witch-friend, who apparently sets a spell to make him lose track of the time. His absense makes Shakespeare thing de Vega has figured him out and is en route with a regiment of soldiers to put an end to this intrigue and turn the Bard over to the Inquisitors.Nonetheless, Boudicca goes off without a hitch. It's an extremely effective, powerful, and moving scene in the book--I believe it's the best single scene Turtledove has ever written. The play ends with Boudicca (whose costume makes her look like Elizabeth) about to be killed by a Roman governor, but prophesying that \\"a thousand years hence, and more\\" another queen will rule the isle and make it great. The Roman is bewildered by the prophecy but kills her anyway. The crowd weeps. Shakespeare comes out and says \\"No epilogue here, unless you make it/If you want your freedom, go and take it!\\"The English audience takes him up on the invitation and storms the Tower, where they liberate Elizabeth. Along the way they're joined by other mobs which Cecil had incited, and Shakespeare realizes that, had he given King Philip, there'd have been an excellent chance the Tudor government would have been reestablished anyway, and he'd be facing its own crude justice. (Along the way Shakespeare sees mutilated corpses of Catholic priests and those who stood accused of being too chummy with the Spaniards.)So the Hapsburgs abdicate and the Spaniards leave, and everyone knows the new Philip III won't be able to retake England. Elizabeth is set back on the throne and comes to the theater to see a special encore performance of Boudicca. (Umm, both Elizabeth and James VI and I were fond of the theater, but neither ever attended it; they summoned theater companies to their palaces to give private performances.) The Queen declares that she herself will replace the fallen Lord Westmoreland as now SIR William Shakespeare's sponsor. Then she summons Shakespeare for a private audience and gives him some money and invites him to ask for favors. He asks to divorce his wife and marry the tavern wench; to be allowed to perform King Philip, which he'd poured a great deal of creative energy into (Elizabeth is quite angry, but Robert Cecil talks her down.); and for the release of de Vega, who's been languishing in a POW camp since the uprising. We see clear signs that Elizabeth will deal harshly with those who were friends of the Hapsburgs and that Catholics can expect an orgy of violent persecution of their own. But de Vega gets to go back to Spain (he always had found England tiresome) and Shakespeare gets to go back to being a simple actor and playwright, so all's well on those scores.The book feels much like a Shakespearean drama itself, as compelling characters read into plot developments--which are epic in their own right--timeless, universal themes that resonate throughout the human condition. Turtledove sprinkles quotes taken from throughout Shakespeare's body of work, as well as some from his contemporaries (lots of Marlowe, of course, much of it quoted by the man himself) throughout the novel. The most obvious lines are clunky and awkward (The witch walks in on Shakespeare and asks him what he's writing and he says \\"Words, words, words!\\"--which might work if Shakespeare disliked her, as Hamlet did Polonius, but is out of place since he's talking to a friend). Tracking down the subtler cribs, however, will be a bardolater's delight. The characters are well-rounded: Shakespeare and de Vega are flawed enough to be human but not so much so that we can't relate to them as protagonists. They're eminently believable as ordinary men caught up in extraordinary circumstances. Most of the supporting characters are also fully developed. The story itself intrigues, excites, and entertains at the same time. It's alternate history set in a pivotal point in history that is not often explored (not by AH, anyway; there's plenty of straight historical fiction set in this era, especially romance novels). While telling a great story, Turtledove deals intelligently with the implications of a Spanish victory in 1588. Though the promotional material spoke of poor oppressed Englishmen heroically battling the evil Spaniards (the biggest gun in the arsenal of those who don't believe Turtledove is an anglophobe) the book itself, while taking the Tudor side, shows that both parties to this conflict have their moral strengths and weaknesses. The orgy of violence which attends Elizabeth's return to the throne prohibits any illusions that we can quite simply say \\"The good guys won.\\"This is Turtledove at his absolute best. He did everything right here, and so I'm giving him as many stars as possible."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"Harry Turtledove has written one of his better books. Set in 1597, he uses William Shakespeare as his main protagonist. Spain has defeated and occupies Britain affter after defeating the English Navy with it's Armada. Shakespeare is asked to write a play that will incite the English to revolt and overcome the Spanish and gain England's freedom once again.Though the book moves slow at times, its plot and premise is worth the effort. It is one of his better efforts. It seems that his stand alone alternative histories always seems to be more concise and and pointed than his alternative history series of the USA and CSA.Turtledove's research and use of dialogue are well done. While his writing may be a little simple at times, this is one time that he has created a book well worth reading for fun and imagination."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"Harry Turtledove poses an interesting question: what would have happend in 1588 had the Spanish Armada succeeded in its conquest of Britain? _Ruled Britania_ weaves real people (William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe, Lope de Vega, Francis Bacon among others) with his &quot;alternative history&quot; to create a unique and entertaining read.Set ten years after the Spanish Armada arrived, the plot of the story revolves around a conspiracy to foment a revolt in Britain, casting out the Spanish and returning Elizabeth I to the throne. William Shakespeare reluctantly is drawn into the intrigue. While the book moves at a lesiurely pace, the attention to historical detail (in terms of dress, customs, sanitation and social class) are remarkable which I enjoyed immensely. The story improves as the plot thickens and the action increases, but as another reader pointed out, it takes a while to get there.Taken at face value, it would be a great airplane read. Historical purists may balk, and those looking for something with &quot;swashbuckling&quot; will be disappointed. A light, if entertaining, read."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"Well, this book isn't exactly for those who do not understand or care for anything Shakespeare, as the author writes in similar ways and words throughout most of the book. And since the book deals with history, then those not acquainted with the general information of that time may be lost. Not a whole lot of action, but some suspense. I feel it was a good read, but I am glad I've finished it. I read this book because of the author recognition and feel that the books about the ramifications of the North losing the Civil War are much better. But anyway, read this if there is nothing else to read or are interested in either Shakespeare, history, or both."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"Two playwrights, both alike in dignity, in fair London where we lay our scene...If you like Historical Fiction and Shakespeare, then you may well consider this to be one of the best books you have ever read. A brilliantly done alternative history: England is under the Spanish Thumb and Master William S is a subversive playwright.Wonderful writing, great plot: Beg, borrow, buy or steal a copy, but read it!"},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"Ruled Britannia is not for everyone. It almost wasn't for me. No matter how great Shakespear's plays are I have a hard time translating the old English prose. Turtledove uses the prose when the book's characters speak and sometimes it disrupts the flow of the book. Fortunatly his narration is in modern english and I could keep interested in the plot. Engrossing it is. If you like historical novels you will love this book. Who gives a hoot if it is alternative history, Kenneth Roberts please make room for Harry to join you as one the elite historical novelists."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"Thank Heavens. Harry Turtledove has gotten away from his slump of two very bad novels, Marching Through Peachtree (I may read the sequel when I need a nap) and American Empire: The Center Cannot Hold (That sequel can wait until I have an operation and need to be put under). It goes to prove you can milk an idea and chracters to death. At last the authoir has switched to a new topic, another one I am familiar with due to my familiarity with Shakespeare, Madrid, and London. It is a brilliant alternate history in which the Spanish Armada wins in 1588 and occupies England, primarily London. Thankfully The Immortal Bard with a host of supporting chracters are on hand. Equally brilliant is how Turtledove has all conversations and private thoughts put into the language of Shakespeare. It is like reading an undiscovered play by Master Will. Thank you Harry, and God Bless you for coming back to the style and story telling ability we were afraid you had lost. We fellow teachers of history salute you."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"See other reviews for synopsis. But like &quot;Lamb's Tales From Shakespeare&quot;, a mere plot summary misses the point; the plot of the work is in the form of a Shakespearean play, and the work a play on the Shakespearean form.Read the works of the Immortal Bard before reading this book, the Historical Plays most especially.Without at least a nodding acquaintance with Shakespeare's works, this would be a drab and unprofitable feast, which pleaseth neither the eye nor wit. Three stars perhaps. But read in context, the reason the stars are only five is because they cannot be six.I'm sure Harry Turtledove had even more fun writing this than I did reading it - but my word, it must have been difficult! Worth every penny though."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"This is only my second Turtledove book. I decided to give him a second chance after Gundpowder Empire, which had a good premise and interesting ideas but a lousy plot. I stand by my initial assessment of Turtledove's strengths after this novel.Ruled Britannia is on one level a fascinating book- very well researched. Turtledove pays close attention to language and events, but in the end this is also what brings book down. The basic plot is that the Spanish are occupying England after throwing Elizabeth off the throne. If you have some background in English history (and it helps to know alittle bit since things are not spelled out) you would know that around this time in the novel England had defeated the Spanish Armada, securing England's place as a world power. Elizabeth had also come to the throne and undone her step-sister Mary's religious reforms. Mary had aimed to bring England back into the Roman Catholic fold after her father, Henry VIII embraced Protestantism. (yes, it's a little confusing, which is maybe why Turtledove does not go into it too much).Shakespeare has been hired to write a radical subversive play which English revolutionaries hope will bring down Spanish rule. Far fetched? Yes, but this is fiction so that's ok. It works a premise to hang a snapshot of Elizabethan England on. But instead of an interesting plot and actual event, we get endless, and I mean endless, pages of dialogue in which Turtledove shows off his ability to write witty banner in Elizabethan English. He admits he borrows a lot from the works of Marlowe, Shakespeare and more, but still doesn't lessen the groan inducing \\"quotes\\" from famous Shakespeare plays. To make things seem more \\"real\\" in this alternative world Turtledove also has an annoying habit of changing play titles and quotes juuuust enough to make them \\"alternate.\\" \\"Prince of Denmark\\" instead of \\"Hamlet.\\" \\"Love Labour's Won\\" instead of \\"Love's Labour Lost.\\" I would say it was all just a bit precocious except that Turtledove is a grown man. Instead I'll say it is a bit twee, almost sophomoric. [it has been pointed out to me that these are titles used on some copies of the plays or also \\"lost\\" plays. So perhaps I am being abit harsh here...]Once one gets past the pages of witty banner there is not much left. Like Gunpowder Empire little seems to happen plot wise. Even when things do happen, an exciting swordfight for instance- the actual fight is over in a couple of paragraphs, but then we get several pages of people talking about the fight, using snatches of grade school Spanish (another annoying device meant to convey that the Spaniards in the story speak Spanish not English).Is this a good beach read- maybe (some people might find the Elizabethan word play a little taxing) - but really not much more. It is clear that Mr. Turtledove is a man of many exceptional talents, novelists just does not seem to be one of them. Check it out at your library and read during lunch or on the subway/carpool ride."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"Apparently Harry Turtledove went to the movies, saw \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" and became inspired to write a novel. One and not a series.You can see that he had fun researching and writing it and it is a joy reading it. Late 16th century London comes alive and quite often this alternative history and the real one become compared by the protagonists. The sad conclusion, that to survive you have to adapt to the changing times and fight for your life is all too real.Nevertheless it is a funny book, like a movie with swordfights, a happy-end, knighthood and girl for one hero, freedom for the other. The story of the two main characters, Shakespeare and Lope de Vega, is a gripping read. Like almost all his single-volume work must read and buy for all Turtledove fans."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"I have read several of Harry Turtledove's series. This book is a one off story that posits what life would have been like in sixteenth century England had the Spanish Armada successfully invaded (and taken control of) the country. William Shakespeare is the unwitting hero at the center of the story and I like the way that Turtledove weaves his plays and poetry into the alternative set of historical events.In summary, an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"I would like to thank this merchant for offering me a great deal on an excellent product, just as described. After my purchase, I recently saw the same exact edition for sale at a much higher price in one of the major stores! What a deal! Thanks again."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"Turtledove's alternative history, based on the premise that the Spanish Armada managed to conquer England in 15888, is a treat for anyone who loves Shakespeare. His grasp of historical minutiae, of Elizabethan language, of Shakespeare's (and Lope de Vega's) work, and of human nature makes this novel entertaining beyond even my dreams. Unlike some of Turtledove's novels, in which his characters are chatty to the point of becoming trivial, Ruled Brittania has a driving discipline that keeps a remarkably complex plot and cast of characters in constant forward motion to a climax that is not a foregone conclusion. This is the best of his books that I've read so far."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"From my Summer reading comes Ruled Britannia by Harry Turtledove, one of my favorite authors. Turtledove tends to write alternate history books. The plot of this book revolves around the question \\"what if the Spanish Armada had conquered England during the reign of Elizabeth I\\"? The main character in this book is the playwright William Shakespeare who gets caught up in a web of intrigue trying to restore Elizabeth to the throne."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"This is one of the better alternative history books I've seen. It certainly gets the atmosphere of Elizabethan England right, based on other books from the period that I've read. And it only requires one historical twist, which is that the Spanish Armada succeeded instead of failed. That results in an occupation of Britain by the Spanish, and a \\"resistance\\" into which William Shakespeare is drawn.From that starting point, good research by Turtledove is evident in the characters and their roles. I was particularly taken by Lope de Vega, who in the real world was a prolific Spanish playright almost as well known as Cervantes. Lope de Vega really was in the Spanish Armada, so his presence in occupied Britain makes complete sense. Based on biographical notes I checked on the web, his character in the book is extremely well drawn, particularly regarding his penchant for the ladies.The book has pretty good pacing, and a very satisfying ending. The only thing you might struggle with is decoding Elizabethan dialects. Turtledove really works at getting those right, but as a result I needed to re-read several to parse out the meaning. But I'd say that's all just part of the experience."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"It took me quite a while after this book was published for me to get around to reading it. Now that I have, I'm glad I did!Other reviewers have described the plot in detail; my own contribution to that is to say that there was considerable tension in the story. It kept me wondering what was going to happen next.The characterization is above average for Turtledove's work. This one feels to me like a labor of love (and it isn't lost!); I'm certain that he took more time on this novel than he customarily does. Characters such as Cicely Sellis and Constable Strawberry don't generally show up in most of Turtledove's work. I incidentally liked the \\"cunning woman\\" a lot; I think she is my favorite character in the book.Another strong point of this story is the accurate-seeming portrayal of life at the end of the 16th century, right down to the commonly-held attitudes of the populace.I give this review the title of \\"Tour de Force\\" mainly because most of the dialogue is written in Shakespearean English (the dialogue between Spaniards that's supposed to be in Spanish looks more like modern English). I myself play at writing, and have to say that I couldn't write one scene with convincing dialogue in that idiom -- though maybe I could if I took time out to read all of Shakespeare's extant work, as Turtledove mentions he did, in the Afterword (I think he actually re-read it). At any rate, the truly remarkable dialogue is a huge delight, and could have carried the book along even if the rest of it wasn't as strong as it is.Then, of course, there are the unexplained references, a practice I suspect that Turtledove picked up from Heinlein. The one I caught in this book is the character Will Adams. When that one was revealed (at the end of the book), my jaw almost dropped in surprise (I must admit that I can't stand James Clavell's writing habits, though).I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes alternate history, and to anyone who likes historical fiction. You're not likely to be disappointed."},{"Title":"Ruled Britannia","review":"I'm quickly learning that the mark of a good alternate history novel is that it tells a plausible story in an interesting way. The mark of a great alternate history novel, though, is that it tells a story so plausible that you sometimes have to remind yourself that history didn't really happen this way. If that's the test, then Harry Turtledove's Ruled Britannia definitely qualifies as one of the greats.The point-of-departure for the book is 1588, the year that the British Navy defeated the Spanish Armada sent by Philip II and Pope Sixtus to convert England back to the Catholic faith by force of arms. In Turtledove's world, however, the Armada defeats the British and the Spanish Army, with apparent assistance from the Irish, conquers England, dethrones Elizabeth I (who is imprisoned in the Tower of London) and installs Philip's daughter Isabella and her husband Albert as the ruling monarchs of England.The book is set nine years after the Spanish victory and as it opens we meet our hero, a guy you may have heard of named William Shakespeare. In this world as in ours, Shakespeare is a playwright and actor and reference is made to some of his greatest plays such as Hamlet (called Prince of Denmark here), Romeo & Juliet, and The Taming of the Shrew. Not mentioned at all are Shakespeare's historical plays which chronicle the lives of English monarchs from Richard II to Henry IV. Presumably, the censors never allowed those plays to be staged.The other main character in the book is Don Lope de Vega, a Spanish Lieutenant but also a real historical figure, a Spanish playwright. De Vega keeps himself close to Shakespeare and the players both because of his love of theater, and because it's his job -- his commander orders him to spy on Shakespeare, who he suspects of treason.Early in the book, Shakespeare is recruited by Sir William Cecil, the last living member of Elizabeth's Privy Council to write a play that -- staged at the right time -- would inspire the English masses to rise up and overthrow the Spanish. That right time would be after the death of Philip II (and lets just say its a good thing that it takes Philip a long time to die in this book, the Bard needed every minute). Ironically, Shakespeare is also recruited by the Spanish occupying Commander to write a play, this one a eulogy to Philip II to be put on after his death.Much of the plot of the book involves Shakespeare struggling to write both plays, keeping on of them a secret, while at the same time living a normal life. And here is where Turtledove starts to shine. He paints a picture of a post-conquest England that is entirely plausible. The Spanish and their English-Catholic allies rule with an iron fist and any display of heresy is punished severly. Everyone pretends to follow the rules of the Catholic faith, but with an unspoken acceptance that they really don't believe it and are waiting for the day that they can return to the England they knew.Turtledove obviously did alot of research to pull this book together. He had to characterize forms of speech from 400 years ago and, he had to know his hero. Turtledove said in his afterword that one of the best things abut writing the book was that he ended up reading every available writing that Shakespeare wrote. And it shows. When it comes time to put on the treasonous play, Turtledove adapts lines from other Shakepeare plays so well that one wishes that Boudicca, the story of a British Queen who rose up against the Romans 2000 years ago, really existed in the Shakespeare cannon.I won't give away how the book ends, except to say that it certainly puts a different spin on English history. One wonders what England would've been like had the events in this book actually happened.I will say that the Elizabethian dialogue and frequent quotations from plays of that era can be difficult to get through at times, but its worth it. This one is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Catfantastic 4","review":"Belden, Wilanne Schneider: &quot;The Last Answer&quot; - Perielle is the precocious child in this one (look for one, generally a very interesting character, in almost every Belden story).

Each tale has plenty of fantastic elements (this is a scifi/fantasy anthology, after all!), but its feline hero remains delightfully ordinary in the midst of extraordinary happenings.

The one that I stopped reading after a few pages had almost no dialog, with the writer spending most of her prose providing backstory - which indicates to me that this particular tale would have been better as a novella, at least (or maybe even as a novel).

It would be difficult to capture the profundity of this book in a single review. A well written essay would be more appropriate, but a summary review will have to suffice.The book is divided into two sections. Part one is on Weber's theory and critique of rationalization. Part two entails detailed discussion of Weber and postmodern theory in the writings of Lyotard, Foucault and Baudrillard. The author's exceptional language is gratifying, so I draw heavily from the book. The following summary covers part one.Part one of this book explores rationalization and disenchantment of the modern world as central tenants of Weber's work. Like Nietzsche, Weber views nihilism as the defining challenge of our times, as \\"something to be overcome\\". Gane writes in his introduction, \\"This theory [of rationalization] remains of great contemporary significance for it views the development and trajectory of Western rationalism with a degree of pessimism, and connects the process of rationalization (the 'secularization, intellectualization, and the systematization of the everyday world' (Holton and Turner, 1989, 68)) to the loss of authentic meaning in modern life. The work of Weber, like that of Nietzsche, identifies in the general process of enlightenment a movement towards nihilism (the devaluation of ultimate values) in the West, and holds scientific rationalization to be not a cure but a key contributory factor to this process. For with the onset of the rationalization of culture, ultimate meanings or values are disenchanted, or, in Nietzschean terms, which Weber adopts, devalued, and are replaced increasingly by the means-ends pursuit of material interests (see Chapter 2). This process, affecting the entire structure of Western culture, involves the subordination of value-rationality (Wertrationalit&auml;t) to instrumental rationality (Zweckrationalit&auml;t), and the reduction of religious ethics and ultimate beliefs to rational calculation and routinized this-worldly action.\\" (2)With the onset of modernity arises a conflict between rationality and religion, bringing about the \\"death of God\\". Following Nietzsche, Weber understands this to mean the loss of any universal perspective or \\"God's eye view\\" of the world. The great irony is that Protestantism itself is responsible for the developments that bring about the death of God. Initially, the means-based existence of the vocational calling advanced rationalism as an affirmation of Protestantism itself. The pursuit of wealth was an ascetic pursuit, done for other-worldy ends. But over time it \\"breaks free from the constraints of religious narrative.\\" (21) Thus the Puritan ethic devolves into the spirit of capitalism, defined as the pursuit of wealth as an end in itself, constrained only by secular values. Weber feared these secular constraints would also fall off in time, leaving the unconstrained pursuit of wealth and a new generation of \\"specialists without spirit, hedonists without a heart\\".Science is involved in a parallel process. Whereas science initially affirms God's divinity, it ultimately undermines religious values. Gane writes: \\"Just as advanced capitalism no longer requires the spiritual support of Protestantism, rational thought (science) too breaks free from the constraints of religious narrative, and, like capitalism, turns against and attacks the very basis of all forms of religious legitimation. With this, science becomes a secular end in itself (see Chapter 4), and proceeds to denude all religious beliefs (including those of Protestantism), denigrating them as irrational forms of superstition or myth regardless of their intrinsic rationality or value.\\" (21) Consequently, the basis for absolute morality and ultimate meaning becomes subverted.\\"And this rationalization of societal organization, has a tragic outcome, for it not only strips the world of its ultimate values, but subordinates creative action to the rational consideration of means and ends, in the process draining social life of its vitality and 'humanness' (Menschentum). Weber summarizes this process as follows: 'Bureaucracy develops the more perfectly, the more it is \\"dehumanized\\", the more completely it succeeds in eliminating from official business love, hatred, and all purely personal, irrational, and emotional elements which escape calculation' (ibid., 975).\\" (25)\\"For Weber, this process accompanies the general movement of nihilism in the West (see Chapter 2), for with the 'death' of God worldly values proliferate, separate out and are drawn into endless conflict with one another. This process leads to the formation of a world torn by an infinite number of value-conflicts, for 'rational' (scientific) knowledge, which, for Weber, is limited to questions of fact rather than value, is unable to resolve the crisis of values that it itself inaugurated.\\" / \\"Culture becomes ever more senseless as a locus of imperfection, of injustice, of suffering, of sin, of futility. For it is necessarily burdened with guilt, and its deployment and differentiation thus necessarily become ever more meaningless. Viewed from a purely ethical point of view, the world has to appear fragmentary and devalued in all those instances when judged in the light of the religious postulate of a divine 'meaning' of existence.\\" (22)Differentiation of culture results in disorientation of the individual. The \\"bearing of man has been disenchanted and denuded of its mystical but inwardly genuine plasticity.\\" (28) The loss of intrinsic meaning to instrumental reason engenders a condition characterized by the exhaustion of passive nihilism or the hedonistic tendencies of active nihilism. This condition can be understood as an aggressive confrontation with the meaninglessness of life--hopeless despair on the one hand and a futile grasping on the other.\\"The key point here is that questions of value cannot be answered through scientific means for there exist no objective criteria upon which values may be ranked or judged, and on this basis, Weber, unlike Durkheim, argues that it is not the task of science to rank values or produce binding norms (see ibid., p. 52). The irony of this is that consequently science is unable to resolve the crisis of values it helped initiate (see Chapter 3), for it can neither answer questions of ultimate value nor resolve conflicts between values which are formally irreconcilable. The legitimacy of values is thus left to the subjective preference of the individual, and calls for a judgement of faith ('taking a stand') rather than the detached use of scientific reason.\\" (58-59) / \\"And this means, by consequence, that modern life places an enormous burden on the individual, for it calls upon one to select and uphold ultimate values ('to take a stand'), but at the same time renders this a possibility only in the face of constant, and often fierce, opposition from others.\\" (30)At the same time, the possibility of \\"a return, of reunifying the differentiated life-orders through reference to a religious narrative (thereby reversing the process of Eigengeseztlichkeit), rests on the re-enchantment of the world and with this a 'sacrifice of the intellect', a possibility which remains open but which Weber rejects as nothing more than a fantastical form of worldflight (Weltucht).\\" (41) / \\"There is then, in Weber's theory, no clear solution to the conflict between the value-spheres of the modern world, for with the decline of religious legitimation there no longer exists a transcendental standpoint from which it is possible to resolve value-conflicts and thus restore unity to the world.\\" (41)This does not mean there is no solution to the confusion induced by nihilism, only that the solution does not take a universal form. Instead, re-enchantment is particular to the individual. Gane writes, \\"[I]n the struggle between opposing value-positions new values and alternatives are likely to be born.\\" (156) Thus Weber, like Nietzsche, believes the solution to nihilism--the key to re-enchantment--lies in the transvaluation of values. This requires the individual to take a stand and make a judgement of faith, but without sacrificing the intellect. \\"For Weber...there are only two choices: withdrawal into the 'acosmic brotherliness' of Christian mysticism,\\" which Weber viewed as untenable, \\"or devotion to the inner-worldly asceticism of the Protestant ethic of vocation. Weber chooses the latter of these two options, committing himself to work within this world....[a] 'this-worldly' form of resistance to the rationalization of the world....\\" (44) Therefore, the solution to nihilism, the locus of re-enchantment, the outcome of transvaluation, the reconstructed world-view, may \\"be seen to lie in the seemingly impossible terrain between modern and postmodern thought.\\" (156)"},{"Title":"The bears' vacation,","review":"I remember reading this book as a child over and over.

When the Bears arrive at their vacation house, Papa Bear points out all of the dangers and things to avoid. But he promptly ignores his own advice, with fearful consequences. The book has some tension, but it's not too scary. Some children may pick up on the message that when a parent advises against doing something, there is usually a good reason and that those who ignore the advice may get hurt.

Well, as Papa Bear 'keeps a look out' for Small Bear, a huge ocean liner comes up from the opposite direction than the way Papa Bear looks. All in all, I found this a fairly humoring story.

Not only are they not mentioned, the Bears are never shown wearing them. We spend lots of time around water, and I don't appreciate having to explain to my kids why they have to wear life preservers when the Berenstain Bears don't."},{"Title":"The bears' vacation,","review":"Many youngsters will take their first trip to the beach this summer. The Berenstain have this wonderful book for your child to learn the basics of safety at the ocean (or even a lake).The family drives to the cottage they will be staying in. Gentle waves lap near the cottage. Mama Bear says to Little Bear, &quot;Stay where I can see you.&quot; Papa Bear responds by taking Little Bear by the paw to show him where the danger is.Here are the rules that Papa bear teaches: (1) Obey all warning signs. (2) Look first. Then dive into the water if it is clear. (3) While surfing, beware of all rocks. (4) Watch your step (there are many sharp shells and objects at the shore). (5) Watch what you touch! It may be alive! (6) In a boat, keep a sharp look out. (7) While exploring underwater, stay out of caves.Now, create a beginning reader that simply relates these rules, and no child will ever finish it or pay any attention. The Berenstains have created a wonderful Vaudeville act by Papa Bear to exemplify why these are good rules. First, he hangs his towel on a sign, so doesn't see the warning that there is strong undertow until it pulls him out and he has to be saved with a life bouy thrown by Little Bear. Then, he ignores a twig that Little Bear points out in the water. The twig ends up being attached to a sunken log, and Papa Bear is banged up by the collision during his dive. Next, Papa Bear ignores the rocks that Little Bear points out on the beach. Sure enough, a big wave comes along and crashes them and their surfboard into those rocks. Papa Bear ends up walking on large turtles. He goes on to take the sail boat into the path of a large liner, and barely escapes. They end up swimming into the mouth of a rather large toothed fish which at first appeared to be a cave.Then they return to Mama Bear, and Little Bear explains that he now knows all the rules. Unfortunately, the boat is a wreck so Mama Bear can guess they have had problems. Why Mothers get grey!The psychology is very subtle for waterproofing the child. Ignoring these rules can get you into trouble, and adults may ignore them (even though they insist that you follow them). I recommend introducing your children to this book well before their first trip to the shore so that the humorous lessons will be well entrenched before you arrive.The examples and the wonderful color drawings complement the simple rhyming scheme that will reinforce the story for your children. It's also a great way for your new reader to expand her/his reading skills. I heartily endorse this book!Good luck in helping your children overcome the immortality stall (I can't be hurt, because I'm a kid) and the hypocritical stall (I don't have to follow my own rules, because I'm a parent).Have a nice time at the beach, while you're at it."},{"Title":"The bears' vacation,","review":"Before Little Bear can enjoy the beach, he must learn some safety rules. Little bear plays the straight man, er, bear, to Papa Bear.For example, when surfing, Papa Bear tells Little Bear to look out for rocks. Little Bear points out rocks, but Papa Bear says they're the surf's &quot;too far away&quot; as a wave comes and sweeps them onto .. the rocks. Papa bear then says &quot;On the other hand...&quot;I think this is a great book for a toddler because they can pick up the sense of ironic contradiction.

I grew up in a situation pretty much like the Brothers from F.A.P in this book and I can tell you that this story right here is the real legit deal. It completely blew me away. The author truly captured not only the life of K, but the whole world of the innercity and just how factors in people's environment shape and mold them. It touches on the bonds of friendship that all people seek whether they are considered &quot;legit&quot; or &quot;non-legit&quot; by society. It also touches on the subject of how one man's culture can positively effect another man's world. I'm a Brother who loves reading those wild street tales but I'm also of age to understand Big K was a whole person and not just &quot;ghetto superstar&quot;. One of the most beautiful aspects of the book was the meeting of people from different culture's, from the author meeting K at a rap freestyle and then developing a friendship, to the F.A.P. Brothers letting him into their circle. Also, I appreciated the way Bros. in Brooklyn were integrating different aspects of Caribbean and Spanish culture into their style. Instead of that b.s. where everybody disrespects the next man's culture. This book was deep. Check it out."},{"Title":"Street Kingdom: Five Years Inside the Franklin Avenue Posse","review":"Douglas Century's personal failings aside, I did enjoy the book. I don't believe, however, that there is enough sociological context to make the book valuable enough to recommend it. I think that the urban life fascinated Century in a way that caused him to glorify it. It isn't pretty, but it's powerful - and that is what is at the heart of this country's recent obsession with gangster rap and movies. K, the main character of this book, had been wary of the project for this reason, and although he thought that Century did a good job of not glorifying it, I believe that by the omission of a discussion of the power relations involved in the conditions of the streets of Brooklyn, he did. Despite the tragedies discussed in this book, the story is still glamorous. The people that died were heroes. The people who killed them were tough, virile, and respected. I believe that Century failed to create a true portrait of the scene, and that had a lot to do with his place within it...Douglas Century may have been along for the ride for five years, but I don't believe that he ever became a part of the culture, and I don't feel as though he ever even began to understand it."},{"Title":"Street Kingdom: Five Years Inside the Franklin Avenue Posse","review":"I have a very distinct habit of looking at the \\"about the author\\" section of books before reading them. When I first read about Douglas Century, a white Jewish man who is a native Canadian, I thought there was no way that the book could accurately portray the streets. I was correct. However, this in no way was an indication of how well the book was written.When opening the book, the way that Douglas meets \\"K\\" (his real name appears nowhere in the book) seems highly unlikely. Coming up to an MC in a club known for showcasing underground rappers and this journalist being comfortable enough to introduce himself and leave his number just doesn't seem likely. However, after getting into the story and learning about K's life, his story becomes a page turner.I struggled between feeling pity for K, while also finding myself busting out laughing at his reactions and judgement calls. I would say by far one of the highlights of the book for me is when K asks the author to teach him to speak Yiddish. Just the image of these rather large, burly, rough looking men speaking a language that they are not expected to speak just seemed ridiculous.For a well thought out, intriguing read, go no further in your search. This book is the real deal."},{"Title":"Street Kingdom: Five Years Inside the Franklin Avenue Posse","review":"I have to admitt as an African American who read this book I can understand why some people would get offended by this book.

But that is not what the book is about, in my opinion this book is about a failed system-to inlude a dysfunctional family. These thing happen and the Author did a very good job in showing this. I hope schools read this book and students of sociology and criminal justice majors read this book.Black men wanting to make a difference should read the book. It demonstrates the places in these kids lives where a differnce could be made. It also demonstrates the need for capitol punishment. Some pople will not get rehabilitated. Some people need death.

If you read it it appears that he did not decide to write such a book and then set out to use people to do so, rather that the book wrote itself through him having had interesting experiences through his involvement in Hip Hop, that he rightly put down on paper to share with others. It is a true life gripping account of the runnings of a Brooklyn street crew called The Franklin Avenue Posse, loosley associated with rap group Black Moon. It is full of great anecdotes and is well written. It will be of interest to readers of such magazines as Felon, Feds and Don Diva.

He seems to have been arrested innumerable times, but somehow seems, until the end of the book, to have avoided lengthy incarceration. Upstate institutions have been his schools.

I heard Century read in New York and was fascinated by the world he describes in &quot;Street Kingdom.&quot; I have to confess, I generally dislike rap music -- it's always seemed like so much empty, angry boasting -- but having read Century's account, I now see the valid self-expression and creativity coming from guys like Big K. I would highly recommend this book to anyone for its insights into race relations and contemporary New York street culture."},{"Title":"Street Kingdom: Five Years Inside the Franklin Avenue Posse","review":"&quot;Street Kingdom&quot; is a wild, page-turning ride throug the streets of Crown Heights, Brooklyn; the juvenile jails of New York state; and the nightclubs of Manhattan.

Kudos!"},{"Title":"Street Kingdom: Five Years Inside the Franklin Avenue Posse","review":"With all these &quot;glowing&quot; reviews, I thought this book might be a good read. Instead, I came away with a sneaky feeling that the author's friends wrote the reviews. The writing is sorely lacking, and his &quot;sensitivity&quot; is more of a poor stab at sensationalism. Simply not believable. There is a more recent book, MUCH BETTER written (by a white guy who spent a long time living among Bloods and Crips out in the L.A. ghettos)--an amazing, well-written story that leaves you simply stunned at that writer's insight, and his ability to make pathetic characters into sympathetic ones who jump off the page and grab you by the throat!"},{"Title":"Street Kingdom: Five Years Inside the Franklin Avenue Posse","review":"I really do believe that Douglas Century means well in this account of black ghetto life. Yet, the book sounds like most attempts to &quot;humanize&quot; blackness; it unwittingly feeds on stereotypes. It also reverberates with Century's own pride at being welcomed into this &quot;exotic&quot; environment. This is just the kind of book that most liberal white Americans believe helps to promote racial tolerance; instead, it really sets the race movement back. Instead of fixating, sometimes with pecular intensity, on the up-and-down lives of his black subjects, Century--like most naive white liberals--should fixate first on his own racial sensitivities, expectations, and attitudes. It's too bad that it is this kind of book that white America often thinks is examplary and helpful."},{"Title":"The 10 Secrets to Great Sex","review":"I found this to be an excellent book, but the constant plugs for the Sinclare Institute videos annoyed me while I was reading.

My partner and I are both physicians and pretty altruistic compared to most MDs. We have no financial interest in these products.I am menopausal and can't use certain hormones due to breast cancer history. My partner has chronic pain and is on lots of narcotics which wipe out testosterone production. We had given up on resuming our prior very satisfying sex life. . .until we tried these pills.First, post-menopausal need an estrogen vaginal cream (with breast cancer history, these are OK if you have no breast tissue left, or if your cancer had no estrogen or progesterone receptors--check with your oncologist as I did). Then testosterone (yes, for menopausal women)- at about 1/10th the dose for men. He and I use the gel, Testim (no financial interest again). Second,while there are lots of products for men, including herbs,Cialis and Viagra, these are rarely marketed to females. We have tried many brands, and the following work quite well: Cialis for women (plumps everything up; penises like this), and Fematril and Sentia to increase sensitivity and libido.My partner goes a bit overboard: Enlarge Power, Viastat, and Steel Libido. Check labels for multiple doses of herbs which can interact with some prescription drugs, such as ginko biloba.Herbal products in general are not approved by the FDA, and some of these companies get away with murder (literally). Check the Encyclopedia of Natual Medicine if you are concerned. We have taken these products for months without unwanted side effects, including blood pressure problems.We do plan to read the book.

Knowing how J. Edgar Hoover was, it is more than reasonable that he was passing for white.. Her account of her family history as told her by her Grandfather was beautifully portrayed as her travels to her past came about.

Edgar Hoover- Passing for White?","review":"The author of this fascinating book grew up listening to stories of her slave ancestor and her white master named Hoover, with whom she had seven children. Convinced that her ancestors were in a loving relationship, she feels impelled to write their story. As she writes, she remembers being told of a possible relationship to J. Edgar Hoover. She delves into her ancestors' past and comes up with intriguing facts and speculations. The author's family story is warm and wonderful as well as somewhat spicy, and provides a different view of slave times than we usually read about. It is her hope that recognizing common backgrounds can help people of various racial backgrounds to minimize their differences and get along. I loved this book."},{"Title":"Secrets Uncovered: J. Edgar Hoover- Passing for White?","review":"The author of this book is truly an excellent writer and I enjoyed her writing skills a great deal. In fact, I think she has a classic writing style that reminds me of \\"required reading\\" novels at school. As she writes additional books, I'm sure she'll gain a great following. As a caucasian, I can also say how especially enjoyable it was to be introduced into some of the cultural aspects of her upbringing. I felt as if I was invited into her family for a bit. I actually wished that the book was more about her own personal heritage, and I would encourage her to write such a book. In this story, the author claims to have traveled back in time and discusses alleged extra marital affairs in great detail. Regardless of the parties who may or may not be involved in any such activities, I couldn't help being bothered by my concern over obeying the commandment \\"Thou shall not bear false witness\\", especially when the author has stated her Christian beliefs. I realize that the story may contain truth, but since no concrete proof currently exists, I don't believe it is appropriate to insinuate such allegations to be factual. Also, it was claimed that J. Edgar Hoover's spirit tried to prevent the author from writing this book. Once again, the commandment comes into play. Also disturbing to me personally is that I don't believe that you \\"learn who you really are\\" by finding out who you are related to. Who you are as a person has nothing to do with who your relatives are. Each of us is our own unique person and one's race shouldn't matter to one's self-concept. Although the story is an interesting blend of facts and fantasy, I'd personally be most convinced with DNA evidence. But, on the other hand, it doesn't matter to me who the author is related to or not. I met her personally and she struck me as a nice and giving person. That's far more important to me than who you may or may not have some blood in common with. Finally, the reader should be warned that there is a good deal of lustful encounters in this book. Overall, I was left with the impression that the author is very gifted, but I think I'll enjoy her next book more."},{"Title":"Secrets Uncovered: J. Edgar Hoover- Passing for White?","review":"Of course the writer has a flowery style and seems to be best suited for oral traditions but that does not take away from THE FACTS she alone uncovered:1. J. Edgar Hoover did not file a birth certificate until he was 43 years old! That was the year his mother died. the only witness being his brother (15 years older) who claimed he was at the home birth!2. J Edgar Hoover's Baptismal records are off by a decade appearing fabricated.3. All his birth records and public records have smudges eg: June changed to Jan and other odd irregularities.4. Fellow FBI members all wondered if he was part Black, even checking his records on the sly and finding all of the above. Hoover claimed no Southern European (only \\"Swiss and German\\") heritage that would have explained his kinky curly hair and dark olive skin. Early picture of JEdgar show he could have easily been part Black.5. While he was alive, two fires destroyed conveniently two separate courthouses where more Hoover records were re-posited. Documents were destroyed which may have answered questions.6. There are direct ancestors of JE Hoover found in Mississippi graves buried with the Black deceased. Odd as most cemeteries were segregated. As the author maintains, JEdgar Hoover's mother was the child of a biracial slave who's mother (J Edgar's Grandmother) had inter-bred with her white half brother. Even more complex is that J Edgar's Great-Grandmother was impregnated by her own slave master father. After reading the book and seeing her meticulous research, I have no doubt that this is true. Many in America may not want to know but that was actually common pre-20th century.7. J Edgar Hoover successfully destroyed many well known Black Americans. The list is endless. Almost any Black man, woman or organization who attained success was destroyed or hounded nearly or often to death. His hatred was clearly latent and pathological.May he continue to rot in hell while the truth continues to emerge."},{"Title":"Secrets Uncovered: J.

The problem I had with this was McGhee's credibility problems. She says she forgot her childhood, then she says the oral history is what she remembers from childhood. Which is it? I was not impressed with a) her claim that she discovered this through an outer body experience or b) her wandering explanation of why Hoover was black. One part says his father was a man named Ivy (not a smidgeon of proof and doesn't match the records) and another part says his great grandmother was a mulatto (but we're not sure).

It is a little hard cover book that has a padded feel and a ribbon marker. It's just a little \\"gifty\\" thing. There is a place in the beginning for inscriptions.But... the book may be one of the most important in my book shelf.I keep going to it when I face adversity. The little book works like a little pocket topical index for the Bible.Topics covered include: Anger, Commitment, Failure, Success, Money, Decisions, Fatherhood etc. etc.Each entry has its own little chapter. Each chapter is made up of Bible verses that correspond to the entry. Want to read Bible passages relevant when you feel like you have failed at something? Look up failure and read. The same with any topic.I end up going to this book almost as often as I go to my pocket edition of The Imitation of Christ (Dover Thrift Editions) or Saintly Solutions to Life's Common Problems: From Anger, Boredom, and Temptation to Gluttony, Gossip, and Greed Both these books are excellent, and certainly there is much to learn from the lives of the saints, but this little book is just Bible passages with a short reflection, and is an EXCELLENT place to go to for sustenance and wisdom in facing life's common challenges.I really think this little book is an underestimated and ignored TREASURE that should be in every father's bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Fascinating King's Gambit","review":"I started reading through the material. I think my money was worth it. Though some things can be improved further. For example, I find it annoying to follow through major lines.

It's a good book to get you started with the King's Bishop Gambit. To date, it is still very rare to find reference books on this one.I give it only four stars because I think that improvement is still possible. Maybe the third book will be excellent.Good luck to king gambiters!"},{"Title":"The Fascinating King's Gambit","review":"This book is more advanced than my present level, but it is comprehensive and I believe it will help the advanced players."},{"Title":"The Fascinating King's Gambit","review":"Needing to learn an opening against e5 as white, I muddled through several openings like the Scotch, but found that advantages were hard to come by and the openings were well known by opponents. Inspired by Bronstein, I started to learn the King's Gambit (first, I tried 3. Nf3), but still ran into trouble. The Bishop's Gambit begins 1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Bc4. The beauty of the Bishop's Gambit is that the best and most well known defenses to 3. Nf3 are the worst defense to 3. Bc4. Due to the fact that the opening isn't often played, even more advanced players are caught offguard.The soundness of an opening can be verified by looking at whether top GMs are playing it. In the last couple years, it has been played by Ivanchuk, Morozevich, Short, and Adams. Although Bobby Fischer had distain for the King's Knight Gambit, he played the Bishop's Gambit multiple times.Easily the most complete work ever done on the Bishop's Gambit, Johansson examines it great detail using recent Grandmaster and correspondence games. He also has a section on piece placement where he explains what squares are best for your pieces and which squares you should prevent certain black pieces from going. Besides learning lines, it's important to learn opening themes, common to many lines. He also tackles the various Declined and Countergambit variations of the King's Gambit, making this the only work you will need to fully learn the opening. Overall, it is very complete and Johansson writes in a style that is enjoyable and easy to read.I must disagree with the last post which criticizes the ability of a non-Grandmaster to write an opening book. Some GMs with 2500 FIDE ratings make their living by churning out books quickly, but without care or attention to detail. They also could have the knowledge but be poor writers. A master, who is strongly devoted to the opening, is no slouch. The reason why he is not even higher rated could be attributed to something other than his ability to analyze an opening position (i.e., he might stink at endgames or he gets into time trouble).A note of (constructive) criticism, I must agree that it is difficult to follow the main line if you are skipping the notes. It is hard to tell where the notes end and the main line continues. (So don't skip then, right?) I would have deducted a 1/2 star, but it still rounds up to 5 stars. Nonetheless, the notes are various lines are important in making a comphrensive analysis.As I side note, I am rated 1950. I recommend this book if you are interested in a sharp continuation to 1. e4 e5."},{"Title":"The Fascinating King's Gambit","review":"My original purpose in buying this book was to get prepared as BLACK against the King's Gambit (KG) since I play e5. I surmised that this is going to be another bible for the King's gambiteers (prior to this book, the author wrote a book about the KG that became popular for the many KG fans)and that I'll encounter the lines suggested in this book.The book's paper is top quality (ply is thicker than normal), the binding outstanding, and the cover design is pretty. The book dimension is wider than most opening books.This book is mainly about the Bishop's gambit variation (3 Bc4) of the KG. The author confessed that computer programs today find several ways to beat the Knight's gambit (3 Nf3) variation of the KG, especially when using the Kieseritsky against it. This was why he started playing the Bishop's gambit and came out with this book.The other main part of the book deals with variations declining the gambit. If you play KG, the chapter about the classical defense is a must read for you because Nigel Davies' latest book suggests this defense against KG and because of that you'll encounter this defense a many times.I immediately felt the author's love and dedication for the KG when I started reading the introduction and some of the first pages. He is the kind of author you will trust to give you lines that he himself examined and not just variations dumped from chess databases. Just to convince myself, I run some of the most tactical variations in Fritz to check the accuracies It didn't fail. Reading further, I found myself liking to play KG. This book made me want to play the KG! And so I decided to study it from White's point of view.The only problem is that this is a very tactical opening and needs more memorisation than other openings. If you play the lines on your chess set, you'll easily get lost. What I suggest is to play the lines in a chess software (like Fritz) so that you can easily get back to the main variation after playing the side lines. For me, I used the Chess Opening Trainer of http://www.chesstechno.com. It not only helps in playing the lines and sub-variations but also aids you in memorising the lines. The lines are saved while play so you can play them later for review even without the book. Whatever you use, it makes more sense to play the lines in the chess software rather than on your chess sets."},{"Title":"The Fascinating King's Gambit","review":"In two other reviews of this book it has been pointed out that the main line is very difficult to follow because of poor editing choices. I have to strongly agree. There are often pages of variations (and sub variations) given that because of poor usage of bold, indents and numbering, camouflage the main line. Instead of first presenting a main line with a branching list of move alternatives and the corresponding page numbers where these variations could examined in isolation, the reader is presented with a line that immediately runs off down a side variation (or two) before backtracking to the main line paragraphs or pages later. If this difficulty was not the case I think I would have given this book four stars. Even with this serious problem I recommend the book (As far as I know this is the only book available on the KBG so options are limited) and have purchased the author's other book \\"The Fascinating Reti Gambit\\" editing and format concerns aside.If you are considering playing the KBG as opposed to the more common King's knight gambit, I encourage you to buy the book and give it a try. I played the KNG for several years before becoming dissatisfied with the amount of memorization and difficult positions that I often found myself in. Playing the KBG has several advantages: First it is less common and your opponent will be thrown off guard. Second it seems to be more sound (Fisher, Short, Polgar, and other very strong GM's have played it) Finally, the KBG requires less memorization because the natural and intuitive responses to the KBG (at least on the lower levels where I feed &lt;1800) are poor defenses. The immediate queen check 3...Qh4+ is not to be feared and often ends up quite nice for white. The Fischer defense (one of the strongest to the KNG) is one of the weakest to the KBG. Since these natural black responses are weak there is less theory you will need to know."},{"Title":"The Fascinating King's Gambit","review":"Another labour of love chess book, by a gentleman who can't stop gushing about his favorite opening. Fortunately, he's done us a major service by covering the Bishop's Gambit (e4 e5 f4 ef bc4) which is an excellent alternative to the 3. Nf3 line covered in virtually every book or opening primer that talks about the KG. Interestingly, about 20% of GM KG games follow this line, but even the specialist books often skip it.The book has a nice index of variations and also covers the usual Declined lines, though only in a fraction of the detail of the Bishop's Gambit. If you are looking for hints on how to play against the KG as black, you should know this book does not cover the usual Kf3 lines at all, though the author gives you a hint that he switched to the Bishop's gambit to avoid the lines following from 3 ... g5.Why is the Bishop's Gambit not better known? Probably because of the very scary Qh4+ moves, which start as early as move 3 and require White's Kf1, losing the right to castle and seemingly entombing the King's Rook. Johansson covers these Queen checks in a series of short chapters, but summarizes it as \\"not really that scary\\". I can attest myself that though the lines are sharp, it does turn out that they are not that bad. After Kf1, Nf3 White just loses some tempos in retreat and finds the white king has found a safe shelter behind black's own e pawn, now sitting on f4. Or, as happened recently to me, tries for more with Qg4 which loses to Bxf7+ KxB Ne5+ forking king and queen."},{"Title":"The Fascinating King's Gambit","review":"A respectable effort on the King's Bishop Gambit is marred by a very poor production along with questionable editing decisions. The book is physically much too large, aprroximately12x9. This is a nice size for a kid's coloring book, but a terrible size for a chess book. The practical effect is to make it extremely awkward to use to play through the lines on a chessboard with the book in front of you.The format also means that there is a very large amount of material on each page. The reader could have been greatly assisted by the judicious use of bold and italic styles, with nomal font, but bold is used rarely, italics not at all. That coupled with far fewer diagrams than were really needed makes for a book that requires a lot of effort just to work through. One wonders if the publisher (Trafford) has any meaningful experience bringing out chess books.If the content had not been as good as it is, this would have been a \\"two-star\\" effort, no more.Parker R."},{"Title":"The Fascinating King's Gambit","review":"I returned this the next day for refund. This was my reason:\\" The text in this book is almost illegible. It looks like something printed from dot matrix printer with the ink running out. Completely unprofessional publishing. \\"The content might be great, but I don't want to go blind trying to find out. Utterly unusable."},{"Title":"The Fascinating King's Gambit","review":"This is one of the best chess books I own because it goes through just about every line you will see black play. Since buying this book I have had great success with the King's Bishop Gambit. I used to play the King's Knight Gambit because I feared Qh4+ - not any more, there are many tactics on the misplaced Queen that white can play.If you are a person who likes opening books that go through illustrative games, then this book is not for you, it goes through lines, and that is the kind of opening book I love.At first I found the lines hard to follow becuase the I thought the book was not set out that well. It does take more time to go through for this reason but do not let this put you off. With time I became to get used to the set out of the lines and after a bit of work it has paid off. In fact, once you understand it the set out is excellent. If you love gambits then buy this book!"},{"Title":"The Fascinating King's Gambit","review":"The author has taken great efforts to collect more or less everything that there is on the 3.Bc4 line, both for white and for black. So, for the very serious player this book is a goldmine and also a great source for post mortem analysis: whatever ones opponent has played, it is probably in the book!However, as a tutorial or for quick preparation, the book is very difficult to use. For two reasons: First, the almost encyclopedic approach means that there is little guidance given by the author (don't be misled by the subtitle of the book:\\"A repertoire for the 21st century\\" - this doesn't mean that the content is anything like a repertoire). Secondly, the organisation of the material is absolutely horrible! It is simply impossible to follow the lines. I haven't yet found a single page where I could follow the material from the beginning to the end without getting lost. Apart from that, there also are plain errors in this organisation.If the author could find someone to reorganize the book for him, I am sure I'll be able to give 5 stars for the next edition."},{"Title":"The Fascinating King's Gambit","review":"Great book which recommends the Bishop's version of the King's Gambit. Unique suggestion abound and this book revived in me the desire to play e4."},{"Title":"The Fascinating King's Gambit","review":"First, the topic of the book: The King's Bishop Gambit (1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Bc4). Playing 3. Bc4 does seem to be more \\"solid\\" than the more classical 3. Nf3, but also a lot less fun. White delays Nf3 precisely to avoid ideas with an early ... g5 by Black and thus make it easier to reclaim the f4 pawn. But really it was that weakening of Black's kingside with ... g5, and the aggressive development of the White knight from f3 to e5 or g5, that made all of those variations so complex and interesting to play. With 3. Bc4, instead of clinging to the pawn, Black can safely castle before you, play c6 and d5 to block your bishop, and maybe give check with ... Qh4+, or bust up your kingside with f3. So, 3. Bc4 makes it easier to regain the pawn than 3. Nf3, but sacrifices a fair bit of initiative in return.The format of the book is essentially a lightly annotated variation tree from a database dump and computer analysis. Each chapter begins with a few paragraphs on the variation being discussed, and after that each page will typically have one diagram, maybe 5-10 lines of text, and the rest is just variations and game fragments. It's tough to follow, and while I don't question the effort the author put into this product, I do question the benefit of this approach, particularly to the club player.The current Kindle version is just a scan of the book. Each page is an IMAGE, so you can't resize the text and I couldn't zoom in. The text was pretty blurry as a result. I owned the hard copy of this book previously, and sold it (along with much of my book collection) when I decided I didn't want to lug it around the world with me. When I saw the Kindle version available for a few bucks I thought why not. The low quality of the Kindle version doesn't bother me since the price is also very low.Summary: If you are rated at least 1800+, like memorizing variations, and have decided to add the Bishop's Gambit to your repertoire, or you already play the King's Gambit and want book up on the declined and countergambit variations, I can recommend this book to you as probably the most thorough available. If you're a typical club player looking to learn the King's Gambit, my advice would be to avoid trying to memorize variations and avoid studying this opening academically. I'd advise instead gathering inspiration from the games of creative players like Morphy, Bronstein, Keres, Spassky and Fedorov, and over the board, just trying to be as creative and pose your opponents as difficult practical problems as you can. I think you will have more fun this way and that, regardless of the computer evaluation of the King's Gambit, it can be quite difficult to play as Black!Have fun."},{"Title":"Munich Signature (Zion Covenant, Book 3)","review":"Bodie and Brock Thoene have written a moving description of the pain and terror of the Nazi occupation of Vienna and their impending blitz of Prague. The characters have been fleshed out so well in the first two novels in the series, that I felt as if I was standing on the street watching it happen. For me that is the best. It does get a little slow in places. Mostly because you want to get to the next page and see what happened. They pull in characters from the past novels that you had forgotten about and continue their story and if you had never left them. Otto, a seemingly bitter Tyrolean, has joined the Nazi movement and has risen in the ranks. When his path crosses Elisa's again, the results are surprising. There are stories about Christians helping Jews, Jews escaping on a decrepit old ship and their courage in the face of ridicule and rejection from the human race. Then there is Murphy a journalist, who has seen it all, on a lone crusade. Fiction blends with life and reality with total disbelief at what the world knew and refused to deal with. Brock is a digger of facts and it is obvious in his wife's writing. I come away from every book in the series hungry for more and even more knowledgeable about our past and the possibility of our future. The team takes you to places you've heard about and wanted to visit. They turn you upside down and forever change how you see out world. I would suggest this book to anyone who wants to know the real of what our country, as well as the rest of the world did or didn't do for the people being massacred in Hitler's Reich."},{"Title":"Munich Signature (Zion Covenant, Book 3)","review":"German-born violinist Elisa Linder (or Lindheim) and American journalist John Murphy have turned their marriage of convenience into a real union, at last. Elisa's family has found safe haven in Prague. Her close friend Leah Feldstein is on the way to Italy, via the dangerous passes from Austria, while Shimon Feldstein - Leah's husband - suffers as a slave laborer in a Nazi steel mill. Leah shepherds one of the five-year-old twin boys rescued from the Nazis in an earlier volume of this series. The other twin, Charles, travels with Elisa and her husband. The boys' parents have been murdered, and little Charles marked as a \\"mutant\\" unfit to live because of his harelip. Which a Jewish physician who has already fled Germany for New York City waits to repair, as soon as Elisa and Murphy bring the child to him. That's where this third installment of the Zion Covenant series begins. It ends with Britain's Prime Minister Chamberlain and other, like-minded government officials turning the Sudetenland over to Hitler without a fight, in order to achieve \\"peace in our time.\\"Munich Signature introduces a new and powerful character in Trudence \\"Bubbe\\" (Grandmother) Rosenfelt, a 78-year-old widow who married a Hamburg man and raised her family there. Her family in Hamburg now consists of a married granddaughter, that granddaughter's husband, and their five small daughters. Bubbe Rosenfelt will not use her U.S. citizenship to return home to Brooklyn, New York until she finds a way to get her loved ones out of Germany, and the roadblocks she encounters are only partly of German construction. American unwillingness to bend rigid quotas and other immigration rules proves far harder to overcome than Nazi unwillingness (real though it is) to let the Jews escape Hitler's plans for a final solution. There may be a way, though, Mrs. Rosenfelt learns when she persists in troubling a U.S. Embassy official. If she has enough money to pay outrageous fees for their passage, and if her family is willing to board a rusting, incredibly overcrowded freighter. Meanwhile, both the Gestapo and British Intelligence stalk Elisa, because the latter organization recognizes how useful this woman can be if compelled to serve as an operative.Once again Bodie and Brock Thoene produce a fast-paced, emotionally stirring tale based solidly on real events. Their characters, while fictitious, feel just as real. I was particularly impressed in this book by John Murphy's gradual inner journey from cheerful disregard for the religion of his childhood to actively seeking God's help. While the book's text sometimes does lapse into preaching (which will please some readers while annoying others), there is nothing \\"preachy\\" about Murphy's transformation by God's grace. It happens naturally, in a fine example of how character development ought to be handled in any novel.--Reviewed by Nina M.

I enjoyed the book so much that i have continued to read the rest of the series. This is one of those books that you really put your heart into, the authors did a very good job of getting the research, and then adding into the book their own insight. You come to love the characters, and when one is hurt, you feel the pain. In fact, on several occasions it has moved me to tears. You want to keep reading to find out what happens to the little coffin ship, The Darien, with all the Jewish refugees on it and nowhere to go. And all the other charecters you have came to love, you read further into, several of them surprising you with their actions. In a few places it does seem to get a little slow, but for the most part it is a deeply touching book."},{"Title":"Munich Signature (Zion Covenant, Book 3)","review":"In the first two books in the Zion Covenant series, the melodrama and improbable events were a bit much for my tastes, but I enjoyed the storyline enough to continue on. But now, with this third book, the melodrama has gone through the roof. It's a Christian soap opera with Elisa playing the main role. She goes through one improbable event after another with everything life could possibly throw at her occurring, along with quite a few things that you really doubt could. Another annoying note is that the characters are injected into major historical events, and the authors don't have a note at the end to help you separate fact from fiction.I'm willing to suspend a bit of disbelief, but this is just too much for me. I'm not going to finish out the series and will be getting rid of the books that I do have. The authors are talented enough writers that I may try another of their series at some point, but it's obvious that this one is of no further interest to me. Soap operas, Christian or otherwise, are not my thing. Examples of melodrama (i.e. spoilers) follow:**SPOILERS**Elisa ends up being kidnapped from by her husband's side and forced to work as a spy for the British. Her husband thinks she just fainted in the crowd when they were separated and missed their ship to America. During Elisa's time spying, her liason is her former love interest, who still has feelings for her. The woman pretending to be Elisa in Paris is tortured to death in an effort to learn where Elisa is. There's a whole lot more, especially when you involve other characters, but this is just what's going on with Elisa."},{"Title":"Munich Signature (Zion Covenant, Book 3)","review":"Reading this book was like reading a history book.

To take just one example: as a synopsis of all the previous Saint books &mdash; vital, if new readers are to understand the story &mdash; the prologue (which takes the form of a letter to the NYPD from Simon's old adversary Chief Inspector Teal of Scotland Yard) is one of the most original ideas I've seen.Charteris knew New York well, along with its denizens and their culture and language. The characters are drawn with great verve, especially Inspector John Fernack, the various members of the gangland hierarchy, and the mysterious Fay Edwards, who falls in love with Simon at the same time as she is helping him to kill just about everyone she knows.Above all, Charteris shows himself once again a first-rate story-teller. Gripping from start to finish.P.S. For a list of &mdash; and discussion of &mdash; all Charteris's Saint books, see my So You'd Like To...

He does give the proper names for muscles and bones, but he doesn't bore us with overly scientific discussion.The few photographs don't illustrate much, but they serve as fair examples for differing body types and positions. Peck puts uncommon effort into facial features and expressions: he doesn't just draw the muscles on the face, but he indicates the directions they pull and how they work to express temperament.A previous reviewer expressed dislike for the racial comparisons - but I liked them. I don't think Peck means to say &quot;all white people look like this, all black people look like this, etc.&quot; but he gives the artist characteristics to watch for when drawing from life (to base your own drawings off of his descriptions, well, yes, that would be silly).He also describes proportions and motion in good detail.

John ivanjs@dnaco.net"},{"Title":"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist","review":"This book surprised me. I already have several dozen books on art anatomy, but Peck's book has more. He goes into expressions, cultural and age distinctions, and locomotion. Is this the only book you'll need in studying anatomy, probably not. But each book you get on the subject, and study (NOT JUST COLLECT) will hone your visual memory until drawing the figure becomes second nature. Note: Study means putting time and effort on that drawing pad!!! Also, nothing beats drawing from life or imagination! These books are to supplement these areas."},{"Title":"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist","review":"I feel that this book is very practical for any person who is interested in anatomy for human body. It is a rather complete and well illustrated guide. I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist","review":"As a teenager, I bought this book to help me draw people better. Learning body and head proportions is key to drawing more realistic-looking people, and this book can help you along. Peck's illustrations show you different ways to look at the human body, sometimes using blocks, spheres, and other objects to represent how a certain muscle group works or looks to help you better understand how it should be drawn. He covers everything from musculoskeletal structure to facial expressions, emotions, and photos of faces from around the world. And for those who like to warm up their skills by sketching people but have no model to use, there are several human model pictures towards the back of the book to help you out. Before I took college courses and had real models to work with, I used these photos to do my many quick pencil or charcoal sketches as a warm-up for drawing. Having this book before those courses definitely helped me draw better and faster than some of the others who were learning to draw people for the first time. I have referenced it several times since then when drawing or painting people to make sure I'm getting the right idea of the muscle structure. I have used other books for learning to draw people that was more step-by-step, but this book has a lot of different detail other books don't have.And I was surprised to find out it was from the 50's when I looked it up here on Amazon, since it doesn't really appear that way at all."},{"Title":"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist","review":"I am an art student who wanted a guide to the human body. I could not be happier with \\"Atlas of Human Anatomy\\" because of the detailed illustrations combined with easy to grasp sketches. The written sections are not extremely long, and while they do delve into technical language that can be difficult, it is overall all well balanced with the illustrated elements. I find both sides important, and as a comprehensive resource on the human body for the artist, I highly recommend \\"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist\\".I can only say that it has helped me tremendously."},{"Title":"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist","review":"I refer to the book constantly. The illustrations are clear and have just enough detail without getting you queezy. There are photos demonstrating different poses, facial expressions, age, and racial differences in thier facial features. Together with Bridgeman's Constructive Anatomy, you understand form and content under the skin. How can you learn how to dipict the skin if you don't know what is underneath it or how it works?"},{"Title":"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist","review":"Had this book for years, somehow lost it and was thrilled to find it and pleased with the value. Thank you I literally have over 3,000 art books, but felt incomplete without this particular book."},{"Title":"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist","review":"I have been drawing for years now, as a hobby. And i have to say this is one of my most beloved books.i bought it 2 years ago, and it is AMAZING. As other stated it covers everything from knees to ankles, from eyes to noses. Whenever i have questions regarding anatomy i use this book. personally, I wish it covered female anatomy a little more, but it's still superb. I also have Bourne Hogarth's dynamic anatomy, which I wouldn't choose over this book, why? It feels a little more natural.I'ts a good buy, that you wont regret."},{"Title":"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist","review":"Not too dense, easy to carry in your bag. Just a wealth of good stuff I am always using to practice and expand my anatomy knowledge. It's really good about breaking down the construction of anatomy (similar to Constructive Anatomy which is also great) and uses great examples to help you understand anatomical structure. It also has plenty of detailed visuals when you want to get a very in depth understanding of bone/muscle groups. Of the half a dozen anatomy books I own, this one would be the best to sum up the subject."},{"Title":"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist","review":"good well rounded book for human anatomy , giving scientific terms to the corresponding body parts and detailed orthographic views for their overall structure. skeleton ,muscles and and flesh are covered as well as proportion of figure of both genders from child to elders. each body part is shown accurately and extensively with nice drawings by the artist. for the price i would recommend this book to help break down the structure more clearly."},{"Title":"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist","review":"This is the book that I have been looking for. This book shows how the artist needs to understand the shape of things under the skin to best display the outer body. How muscles, bones, fat, the way they move and are connected all come into play when representing the outer body. The only book that I have bought that shows the veins too. Many great examples point out that a part resembles something else, like the shape of a shovel, triangle or ball. Great book for Artist that draw, or sculpt."},{"Title":"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist","review":"This is an excellent resource for artists, ranging from figure drawing to expression. There are many hidden gems of information in these pages."},{"Title":"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist","review":"This book is definitely a classic when it comes to anatomy books. Its very detailed, with lots and lots of information and text to read. It goes through everything including body shapes and weight, including the aging of the body. The photos are a bit dated from the 1950's, but still usable as a source of reference. If there's one drawback to this book (the reason I only gave 4 stars) is that its very boring, not really very inspiring, sometimes I find myself making an effort to get into it. Its also good for the beginner if they can get past those facts. Though for the low price its a really good value.PROS:-lots of diagrams and information-very complete anatomy manual-very detailed-can be used by beginner and advanced-really good value for the moneyCONS:-old and dated-boring and uninspiring"},{"Title":"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist","review":"I've learned so much from this book and the only thing I wished from it were more of the hand drawings. The combinations of photos, hand sketches and detailed black and white illustrations give an immense look at each part of the body. From the first section of the book on bones, to the next on muscles, and finally to other details some books over-look like body structure by ethnics, emaciation and obesity, as well as superficial elements like veins and wrinkles, this book covers so much all at once. Also I admit I haven't 'read' much of the content in this book but really the pictures speak for them selves and are clearly labeled. It isn't one of those books that bombards you with needless text but it does have a more precise description in what text is there that serves to enhance rather then overwhelm. Out of the countless art books I have bought seeking answers to my proportion problems or to find out in best detail the actual structure beneath the skin (as well as a better understanding of how the skin layers over it) this book has been the best and most comprehensive thus far."},{"Title":"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist","review":"Atlas of Human Anatomy For the Artist is an excellent book. I found it in a college library and after borrowing it for two weeks, I knew I had to buy my own copy. It is very thorough on the subject of human anatomy and goes into specifics regarding the differences in gender,age, and body mass. I read alot of anatomy books and have not come across too many willing to go beyond the ideal body type. I found it especially helpful that this book provides detailed drawings and photographs of the figure; some books only have rough sketches which are not very helpful. This book is not just for those who want to draw the figure; those who model the figure in 3D applications will also find it useful. Atlas of Human Anatomy For the Artist is not the only anatomy book an artist or animator will need, but it is an excellent addition to their personal library."},{"Title":"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist","review":"I have just started my Life Drawing class and this first week's reading assignment for this book was very easy to understand and very clear."},{"Title":"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist","review":"This book was purchased for class.

Thank you!"},{"Title":"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist","review":"I guess I shouldn't admit to this, but I use this as the textbook for my figure drawing class. The book is pretty inexpensive, and it's pretty clear, and I haven't found something better that doesn't cost a whole lot more. It was published in the 50s, and it hasn't been changed one bit, so the usual number of cornball drawings are included (they look VERY 50s). And the racial and gender characterizations are incredibly goofy and/or offensive. I'm a woman, and believe me, I've seen worse characterizations, but still.... The racial characterizations are truly amazing: really booga booga (oddly, no women are included in the photographs of the races). Lest white men think they're off the hook, they're not. Many of them get the Ken-doll treatment (blurred-out genitalia: at least I hope they've just been blurred out).Still, the price of the book is right and has lots of good basic information (I like the descriptions of joints and how they work: very 50s and very easy to understand.It SURE would be nice if somebody would publish lots of pictures of skeletons next to muscle overlays next to photos of real people in natural poses (all kinds of normal people, and skeleton, muscle, and humans side by side). So far, everything I find is so stupid. Barcsay is still probably the best book, but lacking in some cohesiveness.Just reviewed what I wrote: I switched to a much more expensive textbook, which was worth it (Nathan Goldstein's \\"Figure Drawing\\"). I just couldn't justify having the Peck book in a classroom any longer -- at some point someone's going to complain about racial and sexist stereotypes, and they'd be right."},{"Title":"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist","review":"This book has everything and more as far as anatomy for artists goes.

While not without merit, there are better references out there."},{"Title":"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist","review":"As an artist looking to enhance my skill set I was looking for a book that would bridge the gap. This book however, fell pretty flat. For one the majority (over 60%) of the diagrams are very lack luster and rudimentary pencil sketches that will not help anyone with even a remote drawing ability. It doesn't help anyone who wishes to see how the muscle groups and joint actually move either. I would suggest you pay a little more money and get the professional anatomy books that are available."},{"Title":"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist","review":"Great Product a very informative, must have book. Wonderful Seller, Fast Delivery, What more could you ask for? Seller is highly reccomended. I will be sure to do business with again thanks."},{"Title":"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist","review":"Originaly published in 1951, the Complete Atlas, while probably the best and most comprehensive anatomy book available for artists, betrays its age with what is now clearly objectionable racist and sexist content. Illustrations and photographs of male models and body structure outnumber those of women by at least ten to one. Incidentally, sexist prioritization places the female form in a small section toward the back of the book.This sexist bias extends to the text, which describes the female body in less than glowing terms while lauding the ideal nature of the male form. An example from page 175 on the navel: &quot;In the female a large deposit of fat, especially below the navel, causes the pit to be deep and obscure in detail. The navel of a lean, muscular male is distinct and firmly rimmed.&quot;The short section on racial features contains perhaps even more offensive language, describing dark-skinned people as having a &quot;muzzle&quot;! I assumed that this must be a technical anatomical term applicable to all human beings but the only other reference to it in the book occurs in a note on genetic defects. As might be expected, illustration of racial types also starts with the Nordic male and whiter peoples first, in tacit hierarchy.While the racism and sexism of Peck's book may be mild for its time, it seems that our enlightened sensibilites demand an updating of the text. I am not an individual who supports political correctness but I believe these issues need to be addressed in their own right and before giving the book a perfect five stars."},{"Title":"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist","review":"Copyright 1951? Wow, what a stimulating discovery, and what fun! Besides the skeletal and musculature illustrations, \\"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist\\" is full of Peck's own drawings of basic anatomical features. These are not just the \\"final\\" drawings, like the master prints in Hale, but the beginning \\"rough sketches\\". I find this delightful because every beginner needs some inspirational guidance in drawing's first steps. A simple rough sketch of a nose, with shading; or bones drawn as a simple hinge joint, an arm or leg.... Peck's general reduction of the human figure to basic shapes is of inestimable help. The reader may just find himself saying, \\"Hey, I can do THAT!!!\\" And that is the wonderful thing about PECK's book.Peck has impeccable credentials and must be compared to Robert Beverly Hale. Peck's is not merely an alternate duplication of the same material Hale covers. There is a 'personal' touch in Peck; but the problem with any/all anatomy books, for beginners, is that they are simply intimidating, in their detail, their precision, their absolute realism. PECK overcomes this anatomical intimidation. I would venture that PECK ought to be included in at least the first several \\"drawing\\" books that one acquires. Sometimes it seems that several pages offer more practical instruction to a new student than entire chapters in the books coming out in recent years with gimmicky titles.\\"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist,\\" in combination with any beginning book on figure drawing is a must. With Famous Artist's School, Willy Pogany, Walt Reed, Jack Hamm, Viktor Perard and similar instruction, any ...................book-buyer / beginning artist will find themselves advancing steadily. I rate this in the top 4 of figure drawing books for the beginner.The chapter on \\"Distinctions of Age, Sex, And Race\\" is highly useful. PECK may be in danger of getting shoved aside with time and the publication of new pablum texts containing nothing new or vital; but PECK has written a timeless text that commands respect. CARPE DIEM [Seize the day!] I rate this book a very deserved 5 stars*"},{"Title":"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist","review":"This anatomy book covers areas of the body which other books of its type overlook. If you need to draw a knee, this book tells you how. It contains some photographs of models to give a visual reference from where the drawings were derived. If you are looking for photographs for reference, this may not be your book. The poses are straight forward and simple, giving a basic view at the human figure.

I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist","review":"This atlas of human anatomy is unlike any other 'anatomy for artists' I've ever seen; it is by far the best. It is a wealth of information about the human body. Pecks book unpacks the human body as the three dimensional and dynamic structure that it is. He covers the physics of how the body is built how it moves, grows, ages, gains weight and the distinctions of race.

There are some photos for reference as well. The writeup is descriptive and simple to understand. The examples are well illustrated and clearly labeled. It's pretty comprehensive.While it also has some figure drawing tips and instructions, it certainly is not as comprehensive as dedicated figure drawing books. Here, it's on the approach to drawing certain parts. There's not much on posing the figure.I see this book get mentioned a lot on art forums online, for good reasons. It's useful and very affordable.This book's recommended to beginner and intermediate artists.(More pictures are available on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)"},{"Title":"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist","review":"This book is fantastic. I have not seen (ever) a better description of human anatomy, bodily motion and the methodology for capturing both in artistic media. This book describes every detail of the human anatomy from multiple angles.In the section describing the bones, it shows you how the bones look for all ages and each sex. It shows you how the bones move, and work together. It shows you what the bones look like from the underside.In the sections covering muscles, it shows you how fat is stored in the muscle, how the the muscles move, how blood vessles show through the muscle and how the muscles layer.There are detailed portrayals of proportion, motion, emotion and prospective, all in photos and drawn graphics - not just in words.As I said, I've never seen a better book for describing the human body to an artist, and I've been on the look-out for more than 20 years."},{"Title":"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist","review":"Mostly focusing on bone, and muscle structure this guide is excellent for finding what you need quickly.

A part of me regrets buying this book because I expected a figure drawing book. It isn't. It's a reference to human anatomy and I guess half if not most of the book is useful. I just can't give it 4 or 5 stars because Mr. Peck uses more words than visual diagrams to explain how the body moves and where fat develops. The section about fat is purely textual. It would have been better if there's a diagram of an average person overlaid with outlines where fat develops.I still use it to supplement Joseph Sheppard's Drawing the Living Figure though.I ordered Anatomy of Movement by Blandine Calais-Germain and I hope the high reviews of that book reflect its actual quality.I guess it's true that there is no one-stop shop book on anatomy and figure drawing. An artist must have access to a library - personal or otherwise - to learn from.Again, Mr. Peck's book in my opinion doesn't deserve 4 or 5 stars but if you do buy it, you won't regret it as much as let's say buying an anatomy book authored by Christopher Hart (blech)."},{"Title":"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist","review":"By far the best book on human anatomy for artists.

It's a name one simultaneously makes fun of and feels sorry for as the image of its synonym, Waddles, sticks in the mind:See the penguin, rocking side to side, struggling to move forward?See the young woman, placating Mama, Boyfriend-wanna-be and Boss, struggling to move forward?Mama's in bed, nursing supposed injuries sustained when two strangers threw her from a truck she had not-so-innocently stepped into. (&quot;She gave a detailed description of those drivers -- too detailed, in fact, for family consumption -- in the Wattles Daily Optic,&quot; says Dahlia.)Boyfriend-wanna-be, fond of watching drive-in movies and grabbing Dahlia's knee, drives a &quot;glued-together truck&quot; and has a &quot;lump in his britches...early in the morning.&quot;Boss owns the diner where Dahlia took over Mama's waitress job. He lusts after alcohol and Dahlia, but loves the wife who left him for another man.The day of September 21, 1961appears to be more of the same: &quot;Someone had run over a guinea hen at the entrance of the square, and somehow I identified,&quot; says Dahlia. &quot;The poor thing lay in the road and twitched, not quite dead.&quot;To make the dreary days bearable, Dahlia dreams about Jesse James robbing her town bank. As he turns to leave, she shouts &quot;Take me, too!&quot;&quot;He plucked me off my feet and plopped me behind him in the saddle. We rode west, past Knoxville, Nashville, Memphis, over the Mississippi, through the Ozarks and onto the plains. I wrapped my arms about his waist and held on. As I dozed and dreamed of freedom, the blood sang in my veins.&quot;Then suddenly Dahlia's daydream turns dark: A figure appears in the distance and strides toward her and her bandit.He has a gun.The make-believe foreshadows the heroine's fate and the book's over-the-top encounters.As night has fallen on Sept. 21, Dahlia and her boss are robbed by two men driving a pink Cadillac convertible. Twitch, the senior of the two and the father of the younger, Cole, spent time in jail with the boss' former business partner. He's been told the boss has hoarded big money for years, and he's come looking for it. If no one's going to tell him where to find it, he'll just have to shoot Dahlia.Suddenly Dahlia is like Nancy Drew. She figures out her boss' hiding place, gets the money (after a good fight), and convinces Cole to leave with her instead of Twitch.The chase is on: Twitch, with Mama and Boyfriend-wanna-be in tow, goes after Dahlia and Cole, and the police go after Dahlia -- thinking she's a robber and murderer.Dahlia and Cole quickly become lovers, and while they don't always manage to stay one step ahead of their pursuers, they do slip through their fingers time and time again.Along the way the two assist a wife who fears for her life, but do more harm than good. They join the Freedom Riders, but again do more harm than good. They're thrown in jail, washed away in a flood, photographed for a newspaper and, later, on her own, Runaway Dahlia reluctantly offers tutelage to a junior runaway.Plus more.In the meantime, Twitch, who alternates with Dahlia in narrating the story, robs a bank, coaches a chicken in a cockfight, joins the Ku Klux Kan and falls for Dahlia's mother.Plus more.Late in the book, Twitch finally discovers the girl's destination: Key West, where her father is rumored to be. He left years ago, the day after he told Dahlia, &quot;I'll never leave you, Princess.&quot;Dahlia recounts the day in a half-page in chapter one. It's a touching scene with father and daughter fishing near a dam.&quot;The spray rolled over us like a blessing,&quot; she remembers. The father is concerned when the young girl asks if he's thinking of leaving.&quot;All adults had troubles, he said: Ours just happened to be a chronic lack of dough. Trouble was a normal part of life and the best course was to swim with it. He bent forward and looked in my face. 'What're these, tears?'&quot;'No Daddy, only spray.'&quot;Jackson, a five-time Pulitzer Prize-nominated writer from Virginia Beach, is at his best here and when writing about love in all its forms.Twitch moves beyond caricature when he longs for Dahlia's mother: &quot;I watched in horror as my hand reached up on its own to brush back her hair. I caught the traitor thing before it did much else...&quot;And when he reflects on parenthood: &quot;The job is fairly easy at first -- you keep the brat in food and diapers, maybe a warm blanket, and most dads can handle this since there's not a lot of room for confusion. But when the kid grows up, it gets harder. You gotta teach him right from wrong. But how to do that, if you're not so sure yourself?&quot;Dahlia's mother becomes real as well when she shows her loving heart during her reunion with the man who left her:&quot;We really loved each other, didn't we, Burma,&quot; he says.&quot;She smiled, real sad. 'We did at first, that's true.''You think...maybe...Dahlia remembers?''I don't think she's ever forgotten,' Burma replied.&quot;The characters of How I Left the Great State...want love, not adventure.But Jackson largely suppresses their feelings with activity, and because of this, the book is best read as an extended screenplay -- perfect for a Memorial Day movie release and destined to become a summer blockbuster. Movie fans who shun emotions and soak up action would cheer on both hero and heroine and eagerly await the sequel."},{"Title":"How I Left the Great State of Tennessee and Went on to Better Things","review":"What a fun read!

Blessed with an exceptional memory for details, buttressed by frequent reunions with the men with whom he served during WWII, he has had many chances to refresh his memory of the events he describes, as well as learn facts about the people of whom he writes that he did not know when the events were taking place. I am also a published author, I wrote OKIE BOY - The Great Depression and World War II, published in 2009 by Trafford Publishing. This experience helps me appreciate Mr. King's work more than I would have had I not written for publication. I highly recommend that anyone with military experience, or an interest in military stories, buy it and read it. This one is a winner!"},{"Title":"Hellcats Don't Leak Oil, They Mark Their Territory!","review":"The author may have served on Hellcats but there is little fact in this book. Much of the book involves detailed conversations between soldiers that no one could possibly remember and for which the author was, for the most part, not present. It is also clear that the author knows little about tanks. On the one hand, he ridicules the Sherman tank then praises the M-5 Stuart light tank as being \\"deadly\\". His description of German tanks is also absurd. He suggests that the mediocre Pz IV had 4 inches of armor and could only be taken out from the flank or by ricocheting shot off a hard surface into its under belly; that the light Pz II had dominated the battlefield during the initial stages of Barbarossa (he further claims that when attacked by 25 Pz II's, the Hellcats and Shermans had to rely upon flanking fire to stop these obsolete, thinly armored tanks); etc. I never finished the book. When I reached the point at which the author claims that the Hellcats dueled with a German Maus super heavy tank, which they only defeated by having a bulldozer bury the tank with dirt, I could take it no longer. This book is mostly fiction...bad fiction at that."},{"Title":"Braided Lives: An Anthology of Multicultural American Writing","review":"I was forced to buy this book for a culture awareness class in college.

Most just call it \\"Soothill's\\" (the main author's name) or \\"Soothill-Hodous\\" (the names of both men who spent a decade of their lives compiling the data for this dictionary).Some suggest that this dictionary is out of date. Work was finished in 1934, so maybe that is their point. However Buddhism stretches back some 2500 years. How much can change in just 75 years?The more valid argument is that the dictionary may have some inaccuracies, omissions, or mistranslations. It's probably true that such issues exist, and the author warns of this possibility in his preface. If you ask seven different Buddhists from seven different sects of Buddhism, you will get seven different answers for what a certain title means. Therefore, it's impossible to create a completely accurate dictionary of such terms.While some criticize the minor shortcomings of this dictionary, you'll find a copy of Soothill-Hodous on the bookshelf of almost every professor of Easter Philosophy, Eastern Religion, or who teaches anything about Buddhism.This dictionary is worth having for anyone who is serious about the study of Chinese Buddhism (most of these terms also apply to sects of Japanese and Korean Buddhism as well).

The author seems to be intent on proving his own prejudices rather than exploring the topic and in many cases, his opinions have largely been disproven.However, I did give the work three stars because the sections on druidic survivals contained information about comparatively late survivals I was unable to find anywhere else. For this reason the serious student of Celtic and Indo-European studies would do well to read this work but only after solid grounding in the topic has been established.Recommended only to a few, and not for beginners on the topic."},{"Title":"The History and Origins of Druidism","review":"It's a nice book that I need to finish reading...

It was a time when automobiles shared the road with horses and buggies, a time before every home was wired with electricity, and a time before the success of manufacturing made everything disposable.Tovatt manages to tell this unnerving tale about the KKK's effort to cleanse the country of people it felt was unAmerican in simple language, and he tells it without using a single curse word.It is a book anyone from age 10 to 90 can enjoy, and one that every school from grade 7 on should have on its required reading list."},{"Title":"FLANNERY O'CONNOR: THE WOMAN (Flannery O'Connor Series)","review":"Spivey describes meeting Flannery O'Connor in 1958 and offers impressions and details of their correspondence.

Whether brilliant or simple, rich or poor, actions great or discreet, each of the people written about contributed to society in a meaningful (and often surprising) way. Equally outstanding are the authors of these obituaries, whose writing talents manage to entertain, educate and move the reader deeply without being maudlin. Even more importantly, this book forces us to examine our own lives: what will people say about us when we've faced our Maker? For those of us who come up pitifully short, this book inspires even the common man to contribute to society, and strive for -- and hopefully, attain -- spiritual immortality."},{"Title":"The Last Word: The New York Times Book of Obituaries and Farewells","review":"You wouldn't think a book of obituaries would be entertaining, but it is when the obits are well-written and celebrate the lives and characters of the 100+ people found in this collection. The subjects are most often unknown to the majority of us, but the various authors (including well-known NYT obituary author Robert McG. Thomas, Jr.) humanize each subject and inspire you to contemplate your own life. Most essays are a couple of pages long, and there is an introduction by Russell Baker."},{"Title":"The Last Word: The New York Times Book of Obituaries and Farewells","review":"In our celebrity-obsessed culture, in which bland, no-talent know-nothing windbags like &quot;Dharma and Greg's&quot; Jenna Elfman are considered national treasures and given lengthy pseudo-important profiles in glossy magazines, it is refreshing to read about lives that actually have meaning; about people who commit their lives to doing interesting things for others and for themselves; people whose lives take amazing twists of fate, people who find themselves in extraordinary circumstances and react in ways that no one could predict. The genius of this book is that it covers not the obvious obits of international icons like, say, John Lennon or Richard Nixon, but people whom you may have never heard of, such as the inventor of kiddy litter or the great bluesman Willie Dixon. And they are written not as morbid reflections on death, but as the book's subtitle says &quot;celebrations of life.&quot; The Last Word also holds the important distinction of being the greatest bathroom book I have ever read. Why not put it in your own john?"},{"Title":"France in the age of Louis XIII and Richelieu","review":"For anyone mildly interested in the France during this period of Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu, this book will probably be first on your list to read. The book not only informed the reader about the policies and works of the two great leaders of France during this period but how their actions affected the people of France, her cultures, her friends and enemies abroad. Book of monumental study, it proves to be highly readable and while I have no knowledge of the French language, I can't complaint about the writing or the translation. This book clearly showed that when Richelieu became the Chief Minister of France, that nation was on a verge of becoming another Holy Roman Empire, weak, divided and a non-factor. But in partnership with his King, who realized a good thing when he saw it, by the time both men were dead, France was on a verge of becoming a next European superpower, replacing her old rivial Spain. But the cost of such move, was heavy on the French people. The book wonderfully explains the cause and effects of such policies. I would considered it as a mandatory reading material for anyone interested in French history."},{"Title":"France in the age of Louis XIII and Richelieu","review":"Good blend of what happened, why (gven the available evidence) and not at all dry.

As a person who travels a lot for business, I often find myself &quot;checked out&quot; emotionally and spiritually when I am on the road.

I am also going to give these as Christmas gifts to my traveling friends this year!"},{"Title":"The Way of the Traveler: Making Every Trip a Journey of Self-Discovery","review":"There's something both comforting and unsettling in Mr. Dispenza's book and I think that's the point. When we take a journey we learn about the world and we learn about ourselves. We leave the comfortable and we enter the unknown. What we do with this experience, what we come home with emotionally, determines who we are not just as writers, but as people. The Way of the Traveler helps you explore how you experience locations.Mr. Dispenza's explores the traveler's changes by bringing in the classics through quotes and observations, exploring how writers have used travel and travelers in their texts. And, he creates some possibilities for travelers by offering suggestions and exercises to try during all the stages of planning a trip, taking your trip, and returning home. This mix of history and self-help discovery is a fun combination.This is one of the reasons I recommend this book. As writers explore travel writing, which comes in handy when creating fictional settings and bringing physical locations to life in nonfiction, the true key to hooking a reader is creating an experience that makes them feel like they're in the place. We're able to bring readers a deeper experience by understanding how we experience a location. Ask yourself, which of your senses are stimulated and why, which of your emotions are stimulated and how. The Way of the Traveler helps writers think in these terms.The text is written from a perspective that embraces armchair travel as well as physical travel. Self-discovery through exploration of both the outer world and our own inner world is the underlying theme. Mr. Dispenza writes: \\"Every time we leave home and go to another place, we open up the possibility of having something wonderful happen to us. When we move out of the familiar here and now, we set in motion a series of events that, taken together, bring about changes at the very root of our being.\\""},{"Title":"The Way of the Traveler: Making Every Trip a Journey of Self-Discovery","review":"Although it's small, this book really made me think.

I've decided I'm going to try building an altar in my hotel room and really try to celebrate the joy that comes from connecting with family. I said &quot;try.&quot; I thought the book was well written and I'm going to give them as gifts."},{"Title":"The Way of the Traveler: Making Every Trip a Journey of Self-Discovery","review":"I guess, based on one reader's comments, that some think that travel is just about the photos you bring home or a big adventures to boast about.

The kind of person that can't go to the bathroom without making some sort of journal entry of the new vistas they discovered? Well that is the kind of mentality you get with this book. You can't simply look at a sunset and be in awe of nature or God. No you need to relate to it and make it a part of you.I am avery spiritual person and love traveling. I have traveled all over the world and feel complete when I do so. Reading this book did the one thing I never thought was possible, it put me off of traveling.Fortunately, the feeling passed quickly. I will not make little travel shrines. I will not take little spiritual trips across my living room. I will not follow this persons advice. And this book is going nowhere near my rucksack. Sorry, I am too stoic for this book.I would recommend people read books about the places they want to go. Learn their culture and a little bit of their language.

I met someone in Santa Fe from my hometown in Upstate New York whose family was also from that very region in Italy, people I meet in business are constantly mentioning their travels there, and two good friends asked me to join them on their trip to Italy next year.

Dispenza attempts to put travel into context (&quot;life is a journey...&quot;) and make better travelers of us all. But something doesn't click. As an example, he uses Hernan Cortes who burned his ships on the coast of Mexico to force his soldiers to forge ahead in the conquest of Mexico. &quot;We are like those bold explorers,&quot; Dispenza writes.

The Way of the Traveler shows inspiring ways to open your mind and spirit to either think or just &quot;be.&quot;One of the epiphanies in this book for me was how I defined a &quot;journey.&quot; After reading The Way, I have reframed even my gridlocked commute during rush hour into a more relaxing experience.

I totally encourage everyone to buy and read this book. I am so grateful I bought it and did not leave it on my bookshelf to read &quot;later&quot;. Thank you Mr. Joseph Dispenza for such insight into how to handle our lives on this planet......"},{"Title":"The Way of the Traveler: Making Every Trip a Journey of Self-Discovery","review":"Dispenza's book is a work of art. He takes an experience that has become common place, commercialized, functional and often sterile, and returns it to us in sacred context. Even though this book is about travel it is so much more. It is filled with joy, excitement and love. In his book Joseph miraculously turns travel into a soul journey, an odyssey. He makes one feel like an adventurer. He reminds us that the world is still full of new and wondrous experiences - and he's right; it is. In his book he shows us how to recognize and claim these experiences.This book is full of delightful ideas that will make your travel easier and far more rewarding. Joseph has shown us a way to easily turn travel into an unforgettable journey. It will positively change the way you approach travel, whether you're an anthropologist headed to the Amazon Basin or businessperson headed to Cincinnati, Ohio.

For me, The Way of the Traveler is such a book. I have no travel plans; I am not preparing for a trip to Macchu Pichu or any other lovely and remote destination. Instead, my journeys are inward, to places I have never been. For example, who knows how to travel the road with a dying friend? And then comes The Way of Traveler with its comforting advice and wonderful ideas for letting go of fear, and making each journey one of awareness. I could struggle, or I could make these encounters healing and strengthening. After reading The Way of the Traveler, I like to think I have chosen the latter. This is a beautiful little book: to look at, to hold, and above all, to take heart from. I sincerely recommend it."},{"Title":"The Way of the Traveler: Making Every Trip a Journey of Self-Discovery","review":"Though &quot;The Way of the Traveller&quot; is geared to rituals to center one's mind on the beauty and illumination available in every aspect of the journey, from planning to packing to flying/driving/training (as in choo-choo)to returning home and unpacking, it's really speaking to the Life Journey as well...for, from desk to kitchen to the hardware store, life is a journey that deserves constant awareness.

What I most loved about this book is that I could turn to any page randomly and receive a marvelous message. The true message of this book, in my opinion, it gives us the wisdom of the ages. A book everyone should read. They should make it mandatory to read in high school. This is a book to help one become a winner. Again I applaud Mr. Dispenza for writing valuable information for the masses."},{"Title":"The Way of the Traveler: Making Every Trip a Journey of Self-Discovery","review":"This extraordinary book is a guide for the thoughtful traveler, but I found it a guide for life, as well. I have read it through now three times, and I still am finding remarkable insights in the writing. The arc of the book is the structure of 'the hero's journey,' a beautifully conceived way of looking at not only traveling out into the world, but also within, as the author continually reminds us. This is highly-charged spiritual material, exquisitely written and lyrically set out. I recommend it for travelers who are truly interested in enriching their spiritual lives as they travel either 'out there' or 'in here' -- or both.The book is stunning."},{"Title":"The Way of the Traveler: Making Every Trip a Journey of Self-Discovery","review":"The Way of the Traveler - Making Every Trip a Journey of Self-DiscoveryBy Joseph DispenzaPublished by: John Muir PublicationsSanta Fe, New MexicoReviewed by: Carole HerdegenEditor of www.travelSITE.comIn his stimulating book on the spiritual aspects of travel, Joseph Dispenza has given the reader a new look at the reasons on not necessarily why we travel but how we should travel. His is a not the typical travel book advising on where to travel and what to see or what to do once we reached our destination but a book of insight into the goals, rewards and preparations of travel from an intellectual if not a spiritual point of view. As far back as 500 BC, philosopher/travelers like Herodotus and Hieronymus of Rhodes traveled great distances recording not only what they saw but what they emotionally experienced. Generations of travelers ever since have proceeded to record their own traveling experiences.This then is but the first example of a book devoted especially to the change in the way we travel from a spiritual perspective to the rewards in the concept of self-transformation. The very first sentence of his book, Joseph Dispenza writes, \\"All travel is inner travel.\\" He asks the traveler to keep a journal, but not ordinary journal. The journal he has in mind is a written record of how we feel about the various things we encounter in our travels. In reality, it's a \\"journal of feelings\\" and not simply a photographic record of people and places visited.Joseph Dispenza concludes that travel becomes so much more meaningful when a common trip of superficial discovery is elevated into a journey of \\"self-discovery\\". We should be challenged and changed by travel and this is a good thing. And, by doing so, we will discover a new way of looking at the world and everything it offers.This sharing of feelings about certain places or encounters with particular individuals is something I frequently do by orally telling my travel stories. I diligently try to record events and places in a diary and then rely on my memory and recall to share with my audiences my own personal feelings and emotions that I experienced on my journeys. However, these feelings and emotions will diminish if not completely disappear in time unless they are duly recorded. This was the strong message I got from Mr. Dispenza.I strongly recommend this book for everyone from the armchair traveler to the seasoned adventurer."},{"Title":"The Way of the Traveler: Making Every Trip a Journey of Self-Discovery","review":"I was given this book for Christmas and did not read it until after the holidays.

The pictures and lyrical text create a dreamlike voyage that captures the moment when fall turns into winter. As a child on the Little Eagle Reserve near Fort Frances in northern Ontario, Yerxa spent a lot of time hunting and fishing with his father; certainly these experiences have informed \\"Last Leaf First Snowflake to Fall.\\" Readers of any age will be enthralled by these collages, but be warned that younger readers are going to want to try their hand at this particular art form.

It trys to cram way to much imformation into way too small a space, and the way it covers the topics is very hard to understand. It uses way to many words i don't understand and does not put them in the glossary. I have to use a dictionary to even understand the glossary. For example-\\"Mutation- A change in the nucleotide sequence of DNA; the ultimate source of genetic diversity.\\"I get, \\"a change in...\\" and then it loses me. I do not just hate science, or reading. Our school has a different book for class work and i understand that book perfectly. I like science and have enjoyed other books in the past, but this book is just plain dull and confusing. I would not recommend this book to people at my age."},{"Title":"Biology: Concepts & Connections","review":"I love this Biology book. I first studied biology nearly twenty-five years ago with a huge and lovely biology book written by an author whose name unfortunately escapes me. I loved that book, and have always judged future biology texts against that one; this one measures up well against my memory of that text.The fourth edition of \`Biology: Concepts &amp; Connections' is an excellent, thorough introduction to the science of biology. It is used at the community college where I tutor (biology and other sciences) for general education and nursing students. The book is divided into seven major sections: The Life of a Cell; Cellular Reproduction and Genetics; Concepts of Evolution; Biological Diversity; Animals; Plants; and finally, general Ecology.After an interesting introduction, which talks about discovery-based science in addition to theoretical/hypothesis science with interesting examples (the Australian Flying Fox, flies that mimic spiders), the first unit on the Life of the Cell looks at basic structure and chemistry of cells. Even though this text deals with chemistry, a chemistry background is not required. Care is taken from the outset to relate the biology tasks to \`everyday life', things that people know and care about - there is a look at athletic performance with slow-twitch and fast-twitch muscles, light in the lives of plants, and even look at the possibility of extraterrestrial life.The unit on Cellular Reproduction and Genetics introduces a hot topic in general conversation today, including discussions of medicine and law in addition to the basic theory, with some of the latest information included. The units on Concepts of Evolution and Biological Diversity include new features such as discussion on mitochondrial DNA comparison and the use of molecular clocks to date divergence in evolutionary paths. Topics such as increasing resistance of bacteria to antibiotics are discussed, and the interesting evolutionary situation of Australia, separated from the major landmasses of the rest of the world, shows an interesting side-show on biological diversity.The unit on Animals will be the most interesting for many, and the diversity here includes discussions from geckos to bears to human traits shared with and different from other animals. Particularly for our nursing students, the sections on respiration (anaerobic and aerobic), broken bones, immune systems, blood-cell diseases and the like really drive home the need for a basic understanding of biology.The units on Plants and Ecology draw in the larger mass of living things sharing our planet, work to show how the environment operates from the standpoint of individual plants to entire ecosystems. Interesting current topics such as organic farming, population ecology, endangered species and global warming drive home the importance of biology.The book is very colourful, both in text copy and in pictures. Headers reinforce the broader topics while modules give key concepts within each broad topic. Diagrams are arranged with numbered steps to help understanding, and there are frequent references to website and CD-ROM additions. Key questions are asked at each conceptual point. The \`behind the scenes' information helps reinforce the concepts both with the hot topics involved in biological issues today, as well as the personalities driving the science in key areas. Each chapter has a summary of key points, concept questions and multiple-choice questions for test preparation. There are well over 100 \`Connection' Modules and \`Talking about Science' Modules. Each of the 38 chapters has an interesting, inviting essay as introduction. There are probably 200 CD-ROM and website activities to engage the students, everything from the cloning of genes in bacteria to steroid hormone action to the Honeybee waggle dance.This is a very good book, with lots of information - it is also a flexible book, and certain portions can be omitted in a syllabus without diminishing the overall text. I find myself constantly glancing through the chapters and reading the interesting essays and connection modules between my tutoring appointments. That's the mark of a good textbook."},{"Title":"Biology: Concepts & Connections","review":"This new Fifth Edition of an old standby. The book retains it's aim of engaging students from a wide variety of majors in the wonders of the living world. It relates the basic concepts of biology to concepts in every day life, to evolution, and to the process of science.The basic upgrades in this edition include:Greater emphasis on cells as the structural and functional units of life.Incorporates recent advances in the field of cellular reproduction, genetics and cloning.the concepts of evolution have been extensively reorganized and updated. This includes a major upgrading in the area of the evolution of biological diversity.the sections on animals and plants has been redone with a greater emphasis on those forms that the student sees in their everyday life.the ecology area has been updted with current ecological data and fresh photos.The text has been extensively reviewed to ensure that the new edition retains the reputation for accuracy that has become a hallmark of this book."},{"Title":"Biology: Concepts & Connections","review":"This is a college biology textbook intended for use by introductory-level non-majors and mixed-majors college biology students. It was not intended for use by high school freshman introductory biology classes, and should not be used for that purpose. I am using it for my H.S. junior/senior level Biology II classes. I and my students love this book! Each well-illustrated and well-organized section begins with a clear and succinctly-worded concept statement that drives home the most important idea in the section. There is an outstanding amount of superb ancillary material available for use by both instructors and students -- including a CD-ROM interactive study guide, a printed study guide that complements the CD (but is not redundant with it,) two differently-focused course-companion web sites, an instructor's guide to web-based research activities, really great lab activities, and all sorts of other good stuff. The student reviewer from Troy, NY is right about the test questions, though. Most of them would be a challenge even for very sharp college biology students. But even so, I enthusiastically recommend this book for any advanced-level high school or introductory college-level biology program!"},{"Title":"Biology: Concepts & Connections","review":"Biology Concepts and Connections, is an excellent text on life science. This book presents information in a clear and logical way. At the end of each section, there is a question box, which allows the reader to check their understanding of the information presented. It is also very helpful that answers are included for all the questions in the book. The book is broken into thirty-eight sections, which cover a wide variety of topics, such as cell biology, evolution, plant biology/botany, animal anatomy/life function, and much more. The CD-Rom which comes with this book is great for reviewing the material presented. I used this book in my honor's biology class and received an A. I highly recommend this text to anyone wishing to gain a better understanding of life science!"},{"Title":"Biology: Concepts & Connections","review":"I used this for high school freshman introductory biology, and boy! The writing is dense and excessively formal, and some concepts weren't explained very well. It's a gorgeous book, though, with beautiful color photos and computer diagrams, and it's chock-full of bios and anecdotes. Buy it was a coffee-table book, not as a simple biology text for regular high school kids. (The test questions, which my teacher used from the cd test bank, were devastating. You wouldn't believe the nitpicky details they asked you)"},{"Title":"Biology: Concepts & Connections","review":"I own the International Edition of this book, ISBN 0-321-10679-2.I would NOT recommend this book to secondary school students, unless they were of exceptional ability, and nor would I suggest it for students seeking very detailed explanations of any particular topic.Rather, I found this book (apart from being the set text for one of my papers) to be very good at presenting a good overview of the many areas encompassed by the term 'Biology.' The \\"Concepts and Connections\\" theme is really very good, providing insights into real life scenarios. Excellent graphics and superb photographs help to give life and depth to the subject matter.Initial preparatory sections on chemistry for biologists proved very helpful, with indispensible glossary and thorough index at the back.If you're studying Diploma level Biology, or a more general undergraduate Biology paper, then this book could be for you."},{"Title":"Biology: Concepts & Connections","review":"This is a fabulous textbook. The descriptions are clear and there is always a picture following in case you are a visual learner. The greatest thing about this book is that it provides so many ways to study. The book has a website and a CD rom, where you can read the book, do very helpful activities, hear MP3 tutor sessions with the author and more. If you don't understand something, there are so many ways to study it, that it won't take long before you will."},{"Title":"Biology: Concepts & Connections","review":"I used this book during my freshman year in college. It was an excellent book with top-notch descriptions, well-placed layouts, and easy to understand content. The topics range from biochemistry to genetics to histology and all sorts of tangents into zoology, anatomy, and pharmacology. I have kept this book for 4 years and now that I will be starting medical school, I am taking the book with me. Many others in classes ahead of me have said that this book helps to clarify some of the complex topics that are presented in 1st year medical school. I firmly believe that and recommend this book to anyone with an interested in biology, medicine, and related fields."},{"Title":"Biology: Concepts & Connections","review":"It is overall a fairly good book, but contains much to much detail for the typical non-major collegfe student. I am a teacher for the Intro Biology class ar a well known university, and I was admittedly called in at the last minute to teach this course, so I couldn't choose the text. This one I would not have chosen, as it has too much info for students who have never taken a biology class in their lives before. I find I have to &quot;dumb down&quot; a lot of the material, which is unfortunate, because it really is a well written and well thought out textbook."},{"Title":"Biology: Concepts & Connections","review":"This books does an excellent job of giving overviews and then details about the topics it covers. This text was used for a Bio 101 class at my university. I would NOT use this text in a high school, because the wording and just the detail it goes into gets very complex. Even as a junior in college taking the class (haven't taken bio since 10th grade), I was overwhelmed by the information because my professor expected us to know almost every word the chapter. If she had stepped back and tried to get the general idea from each unit, the book does a great job in emphasizing those ideas. The connections modules and multiple choice questions at the end of each chapter are useful. All in all, if you're looking into medicine, I would keep the book to refer back to later, but I plan on selling mine back."},{"Title":"The Mapmakers' Quest: Depicting New Worlds in Renaissance Europe","review":"It's easy to look at the history of maps as a sort of progression from the \\"primitive\\" to the \\"sophisticated\\", in which the creation of the modern scientific survey in the eighteenth century marks the biggest turning point. As much of the scholarship over the last 20 years points out though, the history of maps is a tangled web, just as maps are a tangled combination art and science, politics and nature, selectivity and objectivity. David Buisseret does an admirable job of sorting out the strands that came together in the modern survey, and traces them back into the late middle ages, so we can see them emerging not miraculously from the forehead of superstition, but organicallay as the way people saw, governed, and thought changed in the Renaissance and the century or so following. A thought provoking read."},{"Title":"The Jewelry Repair Manual","review":"I wanted to understand the basics of what goes intojewelry repair and creation. Can I resize my ownrings?

Let others tend to farflung Kathmandu and the INTO THIN ICE phantasmagoria of Everest and its legends. For the Spring boys, America was more than enough, and boasts some of the more beautiful ranges, peaks and vistas. The quality of the photos varies from page to page but in general, Globe Pequot does a remarkable job in treading the fine line between &quot;vintage&quot; and &quot;contemporary.&quot;The Spring Brothers never pretended to be working in a fine art context, they are no Ansel Adams, but they were good photojournalists and in their own way, good naturalists too. One day a grateful nation will honor them with a two-sided medal. In the meantime, I advise all who read this message to grab your jar of peanut butter in one hand, this book in the other, and keep your rope in your teeth while you sail through the gleaming images of the North Cascades and other Western &quot;peaks of God.&quot;"},{"Title":"High Rocks and Ice: The Classic Mountain Photographs of Bob and Ira Spring (Falcon Guide)","review":"I'd never fully appreciated the photographic talents of Bob and Ira Spring until I saw this complilation.

Boycotted by most, if not all, proponents of natural selection, the main thrust of the legislative testimony was in favor of a concept called \\"intelligent design.\\" Once again, as in the famous Scopes \\"monkey trial\\" of 1921, the writings of Charles Darwin, particularly on his \\"The Origin of Species\\" are inspiring a political firestorm. (Nearly forgotten is the work of Alfred Russell Wallace, from whom Darwin lifted most, if not all, of his world-wrenching work).Intelligent design may be a hot item in Topeka, but it won't get you far on the SAT II. The Hatches approach the whole study of evolution and natural selection with an intelligent, clear focus. To quote their work: \\"It seems weird to think that all life on earth evolved from the same basic, simple cells so long ago. Darwin made an amazing claim when he said that all life on earth is fundamentally related, so scientists have needed some strong evidence to be convinced.\\" From there they go into a step-by-step explanation of evolutionary thought, including an easy-to-understand comparison of Lamarck's theory of acquired characteristics, and the contrasting Darwin-Wallace work on natural selection.The treatment of evolution is typical of the clear and journalistic style of the Hatches' approach to scientific thought. The book in question is a review text called \\"SAT II Biology for Dummies\\". In contrast to the catchy title, the book is really designed for the intelligent high school student who is undertaking a systematic preparation for the Biology examination of the Scholastic Achievement Test (SATII)The reason for this volume is the emergence of a new test program, which actually is two tests based on high school biology. The two tests, named E and M, have different emphases The E test includes evolution and ecology, dealing with the environment in which organisms live and function. The M test is concerned with cells, genetics, and heredity. There is also a key biological core common to both tests. That information is helpful whichever version of the test the student picks.Part I of the book deals with test-taking strategies, how to avoid wild guesses, and how to get yourself in a good positive psyche for facing this ordeal. Part II deals with the fundamentals of biology, starting, as nature does, with the individual cell. The book then proceeds to biochemistry and molecular biology. How organisms eat and breathe is covered in the chapter entitled \\"Getting Energized: Respiration and Photosynthesis.\\" From there we move to DNA and proteins, and finally the continuation of the organism through sexual and asexual reproduction.Part III, the most complex section, deals with the above-mentioned concepts of evolution, the classification of plants and animals (taxonomy--supposedly Adam's first job was to name the animals) . The cycle of life and interaction with the environment are described in the chapter on Ecology.Part IV is all about organism biology, the structures of plants and animals (botany and zoology). Chapter 14 deals with the complex systems that make up the physiology of animal bodies, including our own, and the final chapter is whimsically named, \\"Dating and Behaving: Animal Behavior and Reproduction.\\"WHEW! Between two covers the Hatches have managed to cover the explosive, expanding world of biology and do it in an interesting, informative, and entertaining manner. Their pedagogical method is the same as in their other SAT II books: they present the information, explain how it works, and then show possible questions immediately after explaining the material. In that way, students learn the test design as they learn the substantive material.Oh, yes...the last section of the book is practice tests, enough to satisfy curiosity and build confidence at the same time. It also gives instructions for reproducing test-taking conditions when performing these practice books.Scott and Lisa Hatch are experienced teachers (he in law, she in English) who have for over 20 years, through the Center for Legal Studies in Golden, Colorado, excelled in preparing students for standardized tests, including bar examinations, graduate and professional school admissions, and, of course SAT. They bring this experience to the SAT II volumes they have authored (including biology) with the humor that comes with interaction with students of the MTV and post-MTV generations. Studying biology, after all, is the study of life, and life is nothing if not humorous. You will find that this book takes what could be an odious chore and makes it an entertaining romp through the science of life on this earth."},{"Title":"SAT II Biology For Dummies (For Dummies (Career/Education))","review":"Thanks for writing this book.

I have complains about the lack of details and mistakes. In page 42, the author shows a diagram of a phospholipid and labels the head hydrophobic, when the head is actually hydrophillic. A student who did not know this to begin w/ will be confused. Also, the lack of details make it hard for me to absorb the process. Even if its not on the test, how am i suppose to undersatnd DNA Replication if theres no detail on it! \\"Cells take advantange of [complimentary] rule when copying DNA--a process called replication, which is just a scientist's fancy name for copying. During DNA replcation, the two strands come apart and new nucleotides are matched up with each old strand according to the matching rules.\\" What? The author fails to define old + new DNA as semiconservative replication or what unwinds DNA (helicase) or the enzyme that replcates DNA (DNA Polymerase). I'm taking the SAT in June and currently I'm using Biology Cliffs AP, which is easy to understand and comprehensive. I will use the Dummiesbook only for the practice test, which I think are adequate.

Originally published in 13 volumes, Parkman's magnum opus is here distilled to a mere 800 pages.Beginning with Cartier's forays into the Canadian wilderness, Parkman recounts the gradual European settlement of the continent. Along the way, the giants of pre-1776 North America -- Champlain, Brebeuf, La Salle, Amherst, Montcalm, Wolfe and the powerful nations of the Iroquois -- are presented in all their humanity, by turns heroic and flawed. Throughout, Parkman's style is highly readable and entertaining.Especially wonderful are his occasional lapses into the high-toned style of the late 19th century. The reader is invited to &quot;embark in the canoe of some Montagnais Indian&quot; and cross the St Lawrence to Quebec, to climb the cliffs and, &quot;pausing for breath,&quot; behold the tenants of this wilderness outpost in 1635: &quot;a soldier of the fort; an officer in slouched hat and plume; a party of indians; a trader from the upper country, one of the precursors of that hardy race of coureurs de bois;&quot; -- and of course, a Black Robed Jesuit -- none other than Father Le Jeune himself -- the vanguard of European exploration into the interior.By contrast, the reader is invited to become indignant -- as the colonists were -- at the latter half of the reign of George II, &quot;the unwashed and unsavory England of Hogarth, Fielding, Smollett, and Sterne; of Tom Jones, Squire Western, Lady Bellaston, and Parson Adams; of 'Rake's Progress' and 'Marriage a la Mode'; of lords and ladies who yet live in the undying gossip of Horace Walpole, be-powdered, be-patched and be-rouged, flirting at masked balls, playing cards till daylight, retailing scandal, and exchanging double meanings.&quot; Great stuff.Throughout, you'll get plenty of history and plenty of Parkman, with all that entails. I've seldom enjoyed reading so much as with this book, and I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in the subject matter.CAVEAT: This book was written over 100 years ago. That means there is no new historicism, no Marxist theory, no psychoanalytic criticism, no semiotics, no neoformalism (or, for that matter, plain old formalism), no structuralism or post-structualism, no analysis of perceptual processes, no modes of discourse or discourse on modes. So beware."},{"Title":"The Battle for North America","review":"This is one of the most remarkable books I have ever read. It covers areas of history that I did not know happened. It is written in a elegant prose unknown today. Although undoubtedly accurate, it will never achieve Mr. Trebble's purpose for this book which is to restore Francis Parkman's reputation with the lower level academia. The description of the native Americans is so repugnant the book will never be allowed on college reading lists. I am grateful, however, that it isstill available to the interested reader."},{"Title":"The Battle for North America","review":"This has long been considered the classic study on this conflict. Parkman wrote extensively on the French and Indian Wars in addition to his works on the famous conflict of 1756-63. This volumne contains an amalgam of his writings chronicling the entire French North American experience. The editor has carefully chosen the main parts of the series of publications written by Parkman in the late 19th century.Readers today may be offended by his views toward the Indians. One has to remember that in Parkman's day the Indian was still an important issues. One needs to look at how the Huron and Irequois warriors were universally dreaded and feared in Colonial times. There was good reason for this. These warriors delighted in torture and ritualized killing, as well as canabalism. The woodland Indians were not some idyillic society that was just crushed by the white man. Those who apply that simplistic approach toward their reading of this great work will not get much out if it. Like everything to do with history; it must be seen within the context of its time. The reader will also find that Parkman's biteing observations are not only reserved for the red man. The French and colonists also come in for their share of criticism.The reader will get a first-rate knowledge of the early French Explorers and their deeds in founding the French colony in Quebec and America. Some of the chapters dealing with the Jesuits and their labors to convert the Huron are a bit slow at times, but the reader is always rewarded with his patience. The early wars between the British colonists and their French adversaries is brilliantly developed. Parkman is blunt in his dislike of the centralized French system of government in Canada, but he acknowledges its ability to harness its limited resources to poise a major threat to the American colonists.The book comes to life in the final part when the major events of the 1756-63 conflict are discussed. Here Montcalm is favored over Vaudreil in the administration of the French colony. Montcalm represented the more conventional conduct of the war, whereas Vaudreil wanted to wage the savage war of raids. Today the view may be more in favor of the latter over the former. This is due again to the Indian favortism of today. In Parkman's day it was seen differently and the reader needs to balance both perspectives.Parkman's main strength is his great use of the English language which makes this work a classic and joy to read. The reader will find vivid imagery of the times and the main characters involved. Fascinating as well is the development of New France which took place more or less in the same time frame as the British colonies. American readers should be aware of the contributions of Champlain and his contemporaries who founded both Quebec and Montreal. The French influnece remains alive in both places today. This is surprising when one considers how France abandoned her French Colonies in North America leaving them to more efficient British administration.A classic work that is well worth the time and effort."},{"Title":"Non-equilibrium thermodynamics","review":"Systematic and comprehensive introduction to linear non-equilibrium thermodynamics. After an extensive description of the fundamentals, a variety of examples is given. As the authors indicate in their preface, the book only deals with linear NET, which means that the more exciting modern examples of non-linear NET are not covered. This does not mean, however, that this book would be obsolete; a lot of physics happens to be linear, and the classics of linear NET (Wiener-Khinchine, Onsager) are certainly worth studying. I would even say, that linear NET should first be appreciated before venturing in the more modern aspect of non-linear NET."},{"Title":"Non-equilibrium thermodynamics","review":"Not meant as a modern textbook, but highly useful for anyone who's already somewhat familiar with N.E.T. This book has a certain historical value, and it is rather obligatory for people who work with N.E.T. and/or are highly interested in it. Mathematically, it is quite rigorous. Knowledge of fluid dynamics, tensor calculus and other rather advanced mathematical concepts is definitely helpful, but not outright necessary.You will find the title of this book in many 'further reading' lists.

The derivations are complete but are lacking steps that a newcomer to the topic might want to see. Format is OK, would have been nice if the publisher updated this edition with less text on each page (i.e. larger font and pages). This is a hit or miss; I think it really depends on your background.

Joe Domanick's book is an obviously well researched piece that skillfully weaves together a view of historical L.A. and it's police dept. I have read the book three times and enjoy it anew with each revisit. I am deeply aware of the Department's history and can say that the author has hit his mark with this very intriguing and thoroughly researched book. I recommend this book to anyone that wants to familiarize themselves with the true psyche of The Los Angeles Police Department. My hat is off to you Joe Domanick!"},{"Title":"To Protect and to Serve: The Lapd's Century of War in the City of Dreams","review":"Joe Domanick moved from Queens NY to Los Angeles in the mid 1970s. He noticed the unusual power and autonomy of the LAPD. The \`Acknowledgments' list the people and sources who helped him with this 1994 book. Is the LAPD \\"the most powerful, most independent, most arrogant, most feared, and most political big-city police department\\" (p.7)? The 465 square miles of Los Angeles had the fewest police per resident, and no major police scandals as in other big cities (pp.13-14). The manufacturing economy of South Central and East L.A. collapsed in the late 1970s and created high unemployment (p.15). This book lacks references to the \`Source Notes'.Part Two gives the history of Los Angeles and explains the development of the Police Department. August Vollmer began the professionalization to deal with corruption (p.49). What if this led to a powerful and independent entity? Police Chief James Davis invented the \\"dragnet\\" to stop and search for any \\"suspicious characters\\" (p.64). Mainstream reformers critical of the LAPD and City Hall were entrapped and arrested, the funds coming from organized crime (pp.54-56)! How could vice, gambling, and bootlegging flourish under a law-and-order police chief (p.56)? Davis also invented the \\"bum blockade\\" in 1936 to keep out people from other states (pp.60-62). The \\"Red Squad\\" broke strikes and attacked unions (pp.63-64). The shooting of a gambler united the forces of reform (p.75). Did the Intelligence Squad set a bomb in the car of an investigator for the reform movement (p.77)? Bill Parker rewrote Section 202 of the city charter to create new powers for all LAPD officers (p.94). There would be no checks and balances on the LAPD (p.95). There were no corruption scandals as in other big cities. \\"The Grip\\" described the \\"pro-active policing\\" of Bill Parker (p.111). These policies began to be overturned by the decisions of the Warren Supreme Court (p.113). That should tell you how \\"pro-active policing\\" violated the Constitution.Part 3, Chapter 6 describes the ruling class of Los Angeles, such as the Committee of Twenty-five (p.151). Shows like \\"Dragnet\\" helped to promote the city. Hollywood controls almost all TV and movies, they were under the influence of Bill Parker and the LAPD. The LAPD did not tolerate immigrant gangsters (p.156). Bill Parker's Intelligence division allowed him to manipulate politicians (p.157), helped real estate interests (p.159), and to control a mayor (p.171). \\"Senseless violence\\" seems to be the result of unrelenting oppression (p.229). Domanick is wrong to claim Proposition 13 was a \\"revolt of the affluent\\", it was a correct response to Nixon's devalued dollars and the war on the middle class. Part 6 Chapter 1 tells what happened after the working class L.A. was devastated by corporate policies (p.311). That quote from \\"48 hours\\" might be planted propaganda (p.327).When juries awarded LAPD's victims tens of millions of dollars in settlement awards, the city council authorized more money for a special police litigation unit (p.342). Again, Domanick doesnt' understand that \\"white people\\" (p.345) were getting hit with stagnant wages and rising costs. \\"Mass transit funds\\" (p.346) didn't help most people, only big corporations. Chapter 3 tells \\"The Raid on Dalton Avenue\\" was based on a false affidavit! LA now has the highest rates of violent crimes (p.355). Part 7 deals with the Rodney King encounter. The problem was the public didn't know \\"how to be arrested\\" (p.392)! Daryl Gates was suspended for 60 days. Gates knew how to do PR (p.395). The Christopher Commission decided Gates must go to improve the management of the LAPD (p.403). The verdict on the four LAPD officers was followed by an outbreak of fires and looting (Chapter 5). The LAPD did little (p.426). SNAFU (p.428)? The cause was Daryl Gates (p.429). The \`Epilogue' sums it up. Proposition F passed, the LAPD would follow the rules, maybe (p.436)."},{"Title":"To Protect and to Serve: The Lapd's Century of War in the City of Dreams","review":"This book could have been a \\"great\\" history on the problems faced by and of the LAPD.Too many unsubstantiated comments turned this book into just another \\"axe to grind\\" slam against the LAPD.

If he doesn't like the LAPD, that's fine, it's his opinion, but such antics as writing sarcastic comments about &quot;the look&quot; of police officer's familes really left a bad taste in my mouth.

As a former officer, having experienced the Watts riots, worker the riots and assigned to 77 Street Division, all I can say is he is WRONG about the riot. His depiction of a rouge Department is unbelievable. Allow me one example. I worked Wilshire Division in 1962. We had two man patrol units then and even before that. The author claims two man units were introduced just prior to the riots because of the tension building in the community. That is false. There was no tension. The bottom line is simple. EVERY NEWS channel showed the looting as it was occurring. It could not be stopped. There were 200,000 people rioting with 3,000 officers on duty to protect 465 square miles of LA. All we could do is surround the area and prevent the riot from spreading. Not until the National Guard was called in and a curfew established was order established.

From the other side, he skillfully weaves together a view of historical L.A. and the tradition of excess and abuse within its Police Department.The book is engaging and enlightening, and the long-standing issues/problems within LAPD management are obvious from the facts presented by the author. However, the author's obvious bias, sarcasm and anti-police slant discredit the facts and attempts at establishing objectivity. The author should have respected the words of Dragnet's iconic LAPD character, Officer Joe Friday ... \\"only the facts, nothing but the facts.\\"I often felt that his historical accounting of the LAPD was so tainted by his personal bias, I became dubious reading accounts of legitimate LAPD abuses. The diatribes directed at conservatives, an oppressive US government, Reagan, etc. felt forced and misplaced.

This is one non-fiction book that is hard to put down. A great read!My impression, contrary to some of the reviews posted here, is that Joe Domanick has focused on the facts and is not pursuing a political agenda. Much of what he says has been proven by recent events and makes sense in the light of the Rodney King case and its aftermath, as well as the O.J. case. His criticism is focused on the leadership and structure of the LAPD, rather than on characterizing individual officers as inherently bad.

And certainly not to the public. This situation only exerbated the racial tensions of Civil Rights movement, but rather than declining as the years wore on, things grew worse at Parker's protege, Darryl Gates took command and continued to try to rule with Parker's Iron &quot;Grip&quot;.

Beneath a picture of the first LAPD chopper he writes, &quot;Worshipping the god of technology.&quot; Gee, Joe, how about just getting there faster to find people who shoot ten year olds off their bikes. And then laugh about it with their homies.

And in 430 pages, not a single mention of the Mexican Mafia, a criminal organization that puts a couple of hundred Latinos in graves every year. A lot of them kids and moms hit by stray bullets. And his take is that the fate of South Central was sealed with the arrival of &quot;impoverished Mexicans&quot; and Salvadorans fleeing civil war and &quot;American-trained death squads.&quot; Right. They were so terrorized by American oppression back home that by the millions they voted with their feet to come to America, the very heart of the oppressor. Give us a break, Joe. Your paranoia is showing. Let's recap, shall we. The LAPD is evil. The US government is oppressive. Conservatives want to barbecue black babies. Reagan invented AIDS.

It depicts an (ape) allying view of going from all fours to upright. If this is what you are looking for then you need to read \\" 2001: A Space Odyssey\\" by Arthur Charles Clarke.This is a quick review of the book not a dissertation on Darwin or any other subject loosely related. At first I did not know what to expect. I already read \\" The Voyage of the Beagle: Charles Darwin's Journal of Researches\\" (see my review). I figured the book would be similar. However I found \\"Origin\\" to be more complex and detailed.Taking in account that recent pieces of knowledge were not available to Charles Darwin this book could have been written last week. Having to look from the outside without the knowledge of DNA or Plate Tectonics, he pretty much nailed how the environment and crossbreeding would have an effect on natural selection. Speaking of natural selection, I thought his was going to be some great insight to a new concept. All it means is that species are not being mucked around by man (artificial selection).If you picked up Time magazine today you would find all the things that Charles said would be near impossible to find or do. Yet he predicted that it is doable in theory. With an imperfect geological record many things he was not able to find at the writing of this book have been found (according to the possibilities described in the book.)The only draw back to the book was his constant apologizing. If he had more time and space he could prove this and that. Or it looks like this but who can say at this time. Or the same evidence can be interpreted 180 degrees different.In the end it is worth reading and you will never look at life the same way again"},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"Creationists often state categorically that &quot;there are no transitional fossils&quot;. This is simply not true. In fact, ALL fossils are transitional. One of Darwins main points was that evolution is an on-going process. It may speed up and slow down, but on it goes. This book is a must read. Even after 120 years it's still selling and still being read.Darwins point in The Origin of Species has been overwhelmingly proven over and over. There are abundant transitional fossils of both the &quot;chain of genera&quot; type and the &quot;species-to-species transition&quot; type. There are documented speciations that cross genus lines and family lines. You cannot simply say that there are no transitional fossils, because there are. As Gould said (1994): &quot;The supposed lack of intermediary forms in the fossil record remains the fundamental canard of current antievolutionists. Such transitional forms are scarce, to be sure, and for two sets of reasons - geological (the gappiness of the fossil record) and biological (the episodic nature of evolutionary change, including patterns of punctuated equilibrium and transition within small populations of limited geological extenet). But paleontologists have discovered several superb examples of intermediary forms and sequences, more than enough to convince any fair-minded skeptic about the reality of life's physical geneology.&quot;Darwin has been vindicated by the remarkable temporal pattern of fossil morphology, with &quot;an obvious tendency for successively higher and more recent fossil assemblages to resemble modern floras and faunas ever more closely&quot; (Gingerich, 1985) and with animal groups appearing in a certain unmistakable order. For example, primitive fish appear first, amphibians later, then reptiles, then primitive mammals, then (for example) legged whales, then legless whales. This temporal- morphological correlation is very striking, and appears to point overwhelmingly toward an origin of all vertebrates from a common ancestor. Creationist can say whatever they want to and practice all the deceit they want, but the clear evidence in the geological record is not in dispute by any one except fundamentalists.Numerous &quot;chains of genera&quot; that appear to link early, primitive genera with much more recent, radically different genera (e.g. reptile- mammal transition, hyenids, horses, elephants), and through which major morphological changes can be traced. Even for the spottiest gaps, there are a few isolated intermediates that show how two apparently very different groups could, in fact, be related to each other (ex. Archeopteryx, linking reptiles to birds).Many known species-to-species transitions (primarily known for the relatively recent Cenozoic mammals), often crossing genus lines and occasionally family lines, and often resulting in substantial adaptive changes.Even the gaps are easy to explain, since for stratigraphic reasons alone there must always be gaps. In fact, no current evolutionary model predicts or requires a complete fossil record, and no one expects that the fossil record will ever be even close to complete. As a rule of thumb, however, creationists think the gaps show fundamental biological discontinuities, while anyne who has studied the evidence knows they are the inevitable result of chance fossilizations, chance discoveries, and immigration events.Darwins revolution will continue, even if there are a few setbacks, because the evidence is real and overwhelming."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"This book is one of the most talked about of all time, yet during my philosophical discussions on evolution, this is the typical line of conversation.&quot;Have you ever read &quot;Origin of Species&quot;?&quot;No.&quot;&quot;Do you KNOW anyone who'd read it?&quot;...&quot;No.&quot;This is one of the most significant books of the last 500 years, it effects practically everyone's idea about how the natural world works, and almost everyone's ideas of God and creation.

Rather than take another person's word for what Darwin meant by Evolution through Natural Selection, I opted to go straight to the source. I was not disappointed. Darwin's rich array of facts and furthering evidence was almost overwhelming, and yet he yields a long list of resources by which one can attempt to disprove his conclusions. Darwin is a true &quot;Truth&quot; seeker and does not seem driven to merely further his own theory by any means necessary. Read &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;. Read the Bible. Draw your own conclusions. You owe it to yourself."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"Most people are at least familiar with the theory of natural selection, but that is not to say that they are familiar with what Darwin actually said in Origin and how he said it. Thus I agree with the reviewers who say this is essential reading.Although Darwin says it is \\"one long argument\\", it is in fact two: that the diversity of life shares a common ancestry, and second that this divergence came about primarily as a result of natural selection.There are a number of re-editions of Origin out there, especially given the recent 150th anniversary of its publication, so why choose this one?Above all it is an ideal student edition (and I include here anyone who reads critically): it is cheap, has been type-set with sufficient margins for notes, and is as lightweight a paperback as you will find for a 400 page book. The type is large and accessible, and the introduction by George Levine is, at 20 pages, short enough to hold one's interest while with enough content to warrant its inclusion. Also, given all the recent re-editions available there are few that provide the 1859 text of the first edition. This one does.This is important if you want to know how Darwin originally presented his ideas. Later editions (there were six in total, the last published in 1876) included clarifications and answers to specific later objections. As a result the first edition reads better and is a more straightforward argument. If you are a Darwin scholar you will probably want to engage with these later editions - the sixth is widely available, for the others you can find them in specialist libraries (the University of Oklahoma has the lot!), or now also in beautifully scanned editions through the Darwin online website.This is not the place to go into the detail of what gets added to the later editions, but if this book gets you hooked you might want to take your Darwin studies further. Perhaps the most notable and certainly the most famous addition is the insertion from the second edition onwards of the words \\"by the Creator\\" into the poetic last paragraph of the book (There is grandeur in this view of life... ) This is interesting stuff: was Darwin seeking to clarify that he saw evolution as God's mechanism for creating the awesome diversity of life that we see around us? Or, was this a judicious attempt to allay theological concerns that distracted his readers from the science? The jury is still out on this. Darwin certainly wrote to his friend and confidante Joseph Hooker that he later regretted \\"truckling to public opinion\\", but he did not remove the insertion from later editions. In his autobiography, written towards the end of his life, he confided that while he had gradually lost his faith in a personal God, he recognized that others had found natural selection quite compatible with religious belief, most notably the Anglican theologian Charles Kingsley and the American botanist and Presbyterian, Asa Gray.There is so much in this book that it will keep you coming back. You might also want to take this further: Although Darwin only hinted at human evolution in Origin, saying only in the last pages that 'Light will be thrown on the origin of Man and his history.\\" He addressed that hot potato explicitly in Descent of Man (1871)."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"Was disappointed when I opened the book to see the extremely small print - never have worn glasses and great vision, but what I'm sure was going to be a deliciously meaty book, full of Darwin's views and where they stem from, has become a book that is passed over for something more traditional in size and font.Maybe I should have read the reviews or book into closer and would have noticed this was mentioned.Oh well, someday I'll get to it...once I find my magnifying glass!Smalls"},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"Darwin was one of the most brilliant men who ever lived.

He had studied theology, medicine, and, finally, biology and geology. He saw how organisms change with time and environment and how Biblical events simply could not have happened as stated. He spent twenty-three years going over his notes, rethinking, and agonizing over the results. In 1859, he published Origin of Species, and it upset the world. He demonstrated evolution as no one had.

He even said, \\"I see no good reason why the views given in this volume should shock the religious feelings of any one.\\" And he also said \\"Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings, which have ever lived on this earth, have descended from some primordial form, into which life was first breathed by the Creator.\\"Not only that but he himself understands that there are still many problems with his theory. I was impressed that he included and admitted problems with the theory. For example he said, \\"Why, if species have descended from other species by insensibly fine gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms? And he also said, \\"Can we believe that natural selection could produce... organs of such wonderful structure, as the eye, of which we hardly as yet full understand the inimitable perfection?In the end, even though I myself am still a skeptic towards the theory that simple organisms have evolved into many different complex species, I would recommend reading this book, if not for anything to see how the evolutionary theory got started and though Darwin's theory has changed since his time, it would be a good read still for historical purposes if nothing else.

His bookwas published under two titles: 'The origin of species', and 'On the origin ofspecies'. Both also had subtitles. The term \`the species' has sometimes beenused by creationists as a synonym for \`human beings', and they incorrectlyrefer to Darwin's book as \`The origin of the species', implying that it isabout the origin of humans. Of course, it is not. It is about the origin ofspecies - duh. Publishing a book with this incorrect title helps support the creationists' misrepresentation of Darwin.

Reading the text put me into the mindset of Darwin at the time when this idea was so much more controversial than I could ever imagine."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"I believe this book is well written. Darwin doesn't overload you with endless facts and information which would bore you to death and distract you from understanding his essential theories. Not that facts and tests are irrelevant. He has done tests and has lots of data, but he keeps this separately for those who wish to build upon his theories or dispute them. He uses just a few examples to prove his points, and the results are remarkable.There are several points in time which have changed the way people look upon the world around us. Finding out the world is not flat, but rather round is one. The Earth revolves around the Sun, rather than the reverse, and that all of the continents used to all be connected at one time, are a few more. Darwin's Theory of evolution rates right up there with these. For someone believing that the world evolved from Adam and Eve I can't imagine how upset he made these people feel by suggesting that we may have evolved from Monkeys, or some amphibian creature. Darwin's theories that animals (humans included) may have evolved from just four or five different progenitors, and that plants may have evolved from even fewer, or that we all may have evolved from just one species is fascinating. I believe he approaches it just the right way. He doesn't argue or criticize. He just lays it out there and you are forced to acknowledge it. Darwin keeps religion our of the equation. If religious groups want to go on there to name the amphibian being which crawled out of the ocean for the first time onto land Adam, that would probably be all right with him, so long as you admitted that their probably was such a being.Science has improved since Darwin's day's and geology and archeology has improved, but he is still correct that we will not be able to find perfect fossils after all of these years to match all of the changes. Some of his other thoughts and comments I do not know whether to contribute to the period in which he wrote them to or just as preliminary thoughts that the actual tests would disprove.For instance, Darwin mentions that he believes characteristics are only passed down to males to make them more capable of obtaining a mate and reproducing. Characteristics such as increased strength, brighter colors, and the ability to sing. However I would believe that other or similar traits would be passed down to the females as well to make them more attractive to male suitor, forcing them to want to fight over these particular females more than others.Also Darwin mentions that the strongest produce the most descendants. In our society today that is not necessarily true. Money is associated with power or strength. Someone who has two kids may have more money and be considered to have more power. Since they live within their means they may be able to afford a better house, and to put their kids through colleges, as opposed to a family with seven kids in which they live by lesser means, and are unable to afford the same amenities as the family with just two kids, because they have less money to go around. The family with seven kids by this example may not be considered the strongest since they have more money, but yet they have the most descendants."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"Some time ago I found Darwin's \\"Origin\\" in a second hand store. More than a hundred years old, except for the [presumably] original owner's name, written elegantly inside the cover with a quill, it showed no sign it had ever been opened. Possessing a pleasant 'old book' smell but having no marks, stains, or dog-eared pages, it had rested unexamined, apparently for several generations. Then I came along and -- viola! -- punctuated equilibrium.Darwin's writing style is engaging, his lines of thought easy to follow. He did not 'discover,' or 'invent,' \\"evolution.\\" Classical philosophers long ago discussed evolutionary ideas, St. Augustine among them. Aristotle taught that the extent to which biological forms could change was tightly restricted. Many held this view in Darwin's day, but many did not. Many believed that species had evolved from earlier forms but no one had proposed a coherent mechanism for such a theory. Lamarck's theory of evolution failed to impress most thinkers because it smacked of vitalism and couldn't describe how changes might be heritable. Where Lamarck's theory failed, Darwin's was seen as succeeding. It is apparent to this reader, however, that in critical areas, Darwin's arguments often 'beg the question' -- in their underlying metaphysical assumptions and logic and also in terms of the difficulty resolving mathematical incongruities in 'the struggle for survival by means of natural selection.'Problems of mathematics:Several times, in the opening paragraphs of chapter 10, Darwin underscores the quantitative nature of his \\"small steps\\" gradualistic theory. Life forms are said to be \\"blended together by innumerable transitional links,\\" and, \\"so must the number of intermediate varieties, which have formerly existed, be truly enormous\\" and again, that the number of transitional links \\"must have been inconceivably great.\\" Darwin takes pains in dealing with paleontological difficulties in this regard. Concessions, arguments, and paleontological problems aside, the more interesting difficulty is one of straight-forward mathematics -- these \\"innumerable . . . truly enormous . . . inconceivably great\\" number of slow and small modifications that \\"must have incessantly occurred.\\" If 50-100 billion (the most conservative of generally cited estimates, but more realistically several hundred, if not thousand billion) species of life (mostly prokaryotes, but Darwin argues that modification proceeds most rapidly in \`higher', more complex forms) are to have been brought about by \\"small steps\\" in 2.5 to 4 billion years (3.5 billion is typically cited), with most of the action happening in the last 0.54 billion (since the Cambrian/Tommotian period), the necessary modifications and even outright 'speciations' would have to occur as a continued whirlwind of evolution. We would observe modification and speciation constantly, in significant quantity, even daily. We certainly do not observe this. Here is perhaps the most easily stated and understood of Darwinian gradualism's mathematical difficulties, but it is not the only one, nor is it seen as being the most intractable.Problems of logic:In chapter six Darwin argues, \\"It is scarcely possible to avoid comparing the eye to a telescope. We know that this instrument has been perfected by the long-continued efforts of the highest human intellects; and we naturally infer that the eye has been formed by a somewhat analogous process. But may not this inference be presumptuous? Have we any right to assume that the Creator works by intellectual powers like those of man?\\" The problem here is that Darwin himself proceeds to enlist repeated (metaphysical) assumptions about how the Creator would and would not work. Let us concede, with Darwin, that such thinking is presumptuous, and Darwin is repeatedly caught in his own trap.Another problem of logic: Darwin writes, \\"If it could be shown that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find out no such case.\\" Of course no one could -- how does one observe \\"any\\" possible complex organ \\"not possibly\\" being formed? In case you think Darwin is suggesting that his theory of gradualism might be falsifiable, look again. He has actually hedged his argument behind the thorny logic of 'proving a negative.' In fact, Darwin argues, \\"we must suppose\\" that nothing could present such a \\"break down\\" case! Theories that can't be falsified aren't typically held to be scientific. Yet not only has Darwinian theory gained wide assent, it has come to be protected by law in certain quarters; the only scientific theory, so far as I know, to ever be so protected (unless one counts the Vatican's Earth-centered universe theory, per Ptolemy, in Galileo's day!). Kepler's and Newton's theories did not appeal to enforcement by jurisprudent mind-police, neither did Einstein's or Planck's.Darwin frequently argues that if we presume his theory is true, and disregard countermanding evidence, then we have \\"no difficulty\\" in finding his theory to be true: \\"In all cases positive paleontological evidence may be implicitly trusted; negative evidence is worthless, as experience has so often shown\\" (chap. 10). This kind of argument could be employed to \\"find\\" any theory to be \\"true.\\"Metaphysical problems:Darwin's \\"long argument\\" is, as he freely admits, a line of reasoning more than a body of extant evidence. In argument Darwin references his theory, over and again, to an arbitrary metaphysical demand. He says that the absolute fixity of all forms is integral to the idea of 'creation', i.e., that 'creation' must be rigidly static -- \\"special\\" creation, as he defines it. This is, of course, a very useful demand. With the language sufficiently colonized (as a prescribed condition), all evidence of variation is then automatically evidence against \\"creation\\" and supportive exclusively of his theory, and this appeal is made repeatedly. The problem is that the idea of divine creation does not demand the absolute fixity of forms. Early in the fifth century, Augustine contemplated the possibility of forms evolving, he seemed not particularly impressed with the impact of such an idea upon the principle of divine creation. In fact ideas about 'creation' [in most instances better described as 'intelligent design'] are present from early Ionic philosophy, see, for example, Anaxagoras (500-428 BC) and Aristotle (384-322 BC), and earlier, if but vaguely, Heraclitus (535-475 BC), who affirmed both an essential \\"Logos\\" (design) and material change (evolution).Some evolutionary biologists (e.g. cell biologist Lynn Margulis) doubt that the natural selection \\"battle\\" can adequately explain variation. Natural selection states: if a gene z is more likely to succeed (reproductively) than a gene y, then gene z is more likely to succeed than gene y. Is this an explanation or a tautology? It makes a statement that z has been whittled from [yz], but what does it tell us about the existence of [yz] except that it, in turn, had been whittled from [xyz], for example. It states a subtractive process by which a genetic set can be modified. But does it tell us anything about how or why modifiable sets exist? Even if we accept Darwin's arguments for natural selection acting on random variation as an adequate mechanism for all variation (and doubt seems reasonable), it remains that the very existence of such things as complex cellular and genetic material (proteins, enzymes, DNA) remains unexplained. To be selected, something must exist.In citing problems with Darwin's arguments, I do not dismiss all his ideas. But his \\"struggle\\" arguments don't have the broad explanatory qualities that he believed them to have. Whether in 1859 or today, his theory is obviously incompatible with certain ideas about 'special creation', but as Darwin admits, it hardly undermines the final implication of an extant Creator. Philosopher Garth Hallett, who appears to have no difficulty with Darwinian theory, says, \\"What in Hume's day looked like products of intelligent design now look like the results of natural evolution, but natural evolution itself -- from big bang to life, sentient beings, and Homo sapiens -- now looks like the product of supremely intelligent design. To construct whole villages from Tinkertoys would be clever; to construct Tinkertoys that form the villages on their own would be prodigious. How prodigious the unfolding of the universe has been, we have only recently begun to glimpse.\\"Darwin appears to have been a rather pleasant gentleman, frequently praising others, conspicuously including his detractors (a wise tactic perhaps). He was intelligent, wrestled with very difficult questions, and tentatively believed he had discovered the best answer possible. Many still do (e.g. zoologist Richard Dawkins). As for contemporary scientists who doubt, in one way or another, that he did propose an adequate mechanism, and there are more than you may have been led to believe, I recommend the critiques of: philosopher of science David Stove, mathematical geneticists Hubert Yockey and/or Lee Spetner; mathematician M.P. Schutzenberger, biochemists Michael Denton, or Dean Kenyon, and quantum chemist Henry Schaefer III (maybe not the names you were expecting?). Some Darwinians love to hate these guys, but they are respected scientists, they don't reject Darwin 'wholesale', most of them (the above mentioned, that is) are avowed agnostics, Yockey is likely the most eminent scientist in his field, and Schaeffer has been nominated for a Nobel Prize at least five times. They've published many peer-reviewed papers (this matters inordinately to some folks!). Darwin has become a polemists icon, if not poster child, but many people [probably most] cling strongly to opinions of his work that, whether for or against, are too extreme.wes janssen 2005"},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"First of all the subtitle has been wrongly interpreted. Some creationists have decided to use this title to expose Darwin as a racists. He may be, I have not read \\"The Descent of Man\\" yet. The origin of species talks very little of man. It is a book of observations and study. It concentrates on how plant life, has by selection, brought forth all the species we see today. The survival of the fittest through millions of years by gradual change. Darwin covers his beloved pigeons in depth. I agree with him that all the different types of pigeons we see today probably came from one ancestor of the pigeon. This is called variation of kind. We see this in just about every living creature and flora. The problem arises when the next step is taken, the rise of one species turning into another (reptile to bird). Throughout the book Darwin does admit to this fact, but he still maintains that it must be, with much difficulty.There is no doubt there is a tremendous amount of work that went into his book. It is a difficult read. I would rather have read the dictionary. One does need to know his enemy. Darwin is not the originator of \\"evolution.\\" There are many who came before him, since the dawn of time. He was influenced by numerous men of his time, some being more radical. Darwin was nothing new, he just maid it \\"hip.\\" What he started has turned into the secular humanism the world has adopted. I don't think he meant for this disease to spread like it has. From his writings I understand him as an agnostic, but doubtful. I believed he struggled with the possibly of a deist.

He was a confusing man.150 years later and there still has been no intermediate fossils found to prove the case. In fact we are discovering more that validates creation.The theory of evolution caused Darwin to loose his faith and his experience has been repeated in countless lives. Evolution is an acid that eats away at the mind, a cancer.One only needs to open the pages to Michael Behe's book, \\"Darwin's Black Box\\", to understand the futility of the evolutionary theory.

Wallace may have seen something further than Darwin when he later in his life said that we have souls or spirits that accounts for our humanity. I believe that the paradigm shift which brings into account ghosts and spirits when it comes to why we cannot fully explain humans is overdue. I know the reader is skeptical about these kinds of things but I myself saw entities that could not be mistaken for something else other than ghosts and spirits, which is also seen and observed by many other human beings all over the world. I do not believe that they are non-material beings who co-inhabit this planet with us and are just mistaken for ghosts for when you see them they have the form of humans, and it is well known that the physical form of humans evolve so that it could be used in the physical world to handle material objects such as legs for running, arms and hand to hold and lift objects, etc. that is why it doesn't make sense that these non-material beings mimic the physical form of humans, so it is most likely that these beings are ghosts and spirits who once inhabit the physical body of human beings and that they mimic the physical form for they once inhabit a physical body...I also cannot believe that they are holograms. On the other hand, to me it is funny that people who believe in a God has a double standard. They believe in a God that they do not see but find it humorous to believe in Ghosts that they also do not see. Isn't the two just different manifestations of the after life? To me it is even easier to see a ghost than to see God, I believe they visit the physical world more than God does..You can hear people say \\"I saw a ghost last night\\" or \\"I saw a ghost in that old house\\" but I never really heard anyone say \\"I saw God.\\" As for Scientists, wether they believe in a God or not, I cannot blame them for being skeptical about these kinds of matters for they cannot emperically observe ghosts and spirits. But not everything has to be observed. It is true that \\"observation is the key to knowledge\\" but Einstein stated that \\"imagination is much more important than knowledge\\" so that is the reason why I believed Wallace saw further than Darwin when he later on believed and suggested that we have souls that make us human for he probably realized that humans are too complex to just be explained by evolution even though our animal bodies are also a product of evolution like any other animals in this PLANET, that is the reason why when studying Chimpanzee behavior, which are 95% the same as our DNA, their are eery similarities to how they behave in society. All those power struggles, murders, sexual jealousy, male machismo and competition, its all rooted in our DNA. But unlike Chimpanzees, we humans have souls, it is the responsibility of our souls to be FREE ENOUGH of our \\"bloodline\\", free enough of our bodies to make decisions, to make choices and not be easily overcome by our bodily tendencies. Also a reader might think that in this VAST UNIVERSE, ghosts and spirits DOES NOT FIT IN THE PICTURE...but what if this VAST UNIVERSE is a VAST RUSE...DESIGNED to trap an OVERLY INTELLECTUAL MIND... Even scientists nowadays are admitting that when it comes to the study of humans we are barely scratching the surface. Darwin and Wallace was both right about their observations about evolution, but Wallace saw further for he probably knew that we cannot emperically observe everything... Science can only explain what it can observe.P.S. I challenge ALL scientists who comes across this review to begin an ALL OUT investigation of the phenomenon of seeing ghosts..so we could tell once and for all if so many people all over the world are just dillusional, that is why they have sightings of ghosts...OR they truly did saw something and is just being discredited by science because they cannot, FOR NOW, explain it!"},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"I picked this edition because it includes new modern evidence, not found in the original publication, that macroevolution is a fact: the cover art.

Therein lays the main argument behind Darwin's view. Darwin observed how organisms vary in nature and he observed how man had harnessed this ability for man's own benefit. Darwin referred to this trait as artificial selection, which was the basis for Darwin's dangerous idea or extrapolation: Natural Selection. With natural selection however, Darwin, proclaimed it an unguided, random process that had no real purpose. Artificial selection is nothing of this sort though. Artificial Selection is an intellectual guided, predetermined event. In fact, it is more appropriately called Intelligent Selection, since knowledge is used to carefully select those traits that can be beneficial to man.In Intelligent Selection, nothing is left to chance; farmers did not and have not relied on randomness to maximize their crops output. They have always used knowledge and skill. Darwin used Intelligent Selection for establishing the basis of natural selection, proclaiming that he named it natural selection &quot;in order to mark its relation man's power of selection.&quot; Pg 53 However, since Intelligent Selection requires knowledge, order, and guidance it can hardly be used to support Darwin's dangerous extrapolation: Natural Selection, a random, unguided process. Darwin repeatedly says that if man could do so much in his short time-span, than imagine what Nature could do through it's long time-span: &quot;I can see no limit to the amount of change, to the beauty and infinite complexity of coadaptions between all organic beings, one with another and with their physical conditions of life, which may be effected in the long course of time by NATURE'S POWER OF SELECTION.&quot; Pg 91 However since Intelligent Selection is so different, or even more accurately the opposite of Natural Selection, it cannot be used as evidence for Darwin's dangerous extrapolation. Thus, Darwin's chief example for his theory is null and void.Chapters 3 thru 8 deal with specific examples of descent with modification found inside nature. To help clarify, the examples that Darwin gives are not in question. In fact, the ideas concerning populations that Darwin borrowed from Malthus, the struggle for existence that organisms go through, and many of the other examples that Darwin covers are not being questioned. What IS being questioned is the extrapolations that Darwin made that went past the evidence. Scientists observe that organisms vary in nature; Scientists observe that descent with modification occurs within nature. NO ONE doubts this. But rather the objections to Darwin's work are because his claims goes PAST the evidence. Scientists know that organisms can vary, but they ALSO know there is a limit to the amount of variation that can go into any organisms (called genetic homeostasis). There is a point of no return, where the variations start to have an overtly negative effect. To say that creatures have the ability to vary in nature is true, however to proclaim that nature can do what man has not been able to due goes beyond what the evidence tells us. In fact, it goes AGAISNT the evidence; it goes AGAINST science.Chapters 9-12 are devoted to the subject geology and geographical distribution of organisms. Darwin owed much credit to Charles Lyell, who gave Darwin the vast amount of time needed for natural selection to supposedly work. Darwin proclaimed that &quot;the future historian&quot; would recognize Lyell's book the Principle of Geology &quot;as having produced a revolution in natural science&quot; pg 232 Yet, Lyell's view of a gradual, non catastrophic, uniform geological rate has been rejected. Even today's most ardent evolutionists have conceded that catastrophes have vastly shaped today's earth. Darwin however believed the opposite. He relied greatly on the theory of uniformatarianism being the absolute truth and even declared that &quot;species are produced and exterminated by slowly acting and still existing causes and not by miraculous acts of creation and by catastrophes.&quot; Pg 398 Thus, Darwin's view on the geological record is mistaken. Catastrophes have had a great deal to do with the formation of the earth and on the production and extermination of organisms.Darwin devotes Chapter 13 to talking about embryology and how the facts of embryology alone would be enough to convince him that evolution were true. (pg 374) But yet, studies in embryology since Darwin's time have not strengthened evolution. There are just too many examples where the embryo does not repeat the stages of his past ancestors. The human embryo for example develops its tongue at an early stage in their development, but it is only when the child is a few months old that they starts growing teeth. Yet, our supposed ancestors are said to have evolved their teeth first and then their tongue. Moreover, the idea that a human embryo goes from a single cell organism, to a fish, an amphibian, a mammal, a monkey, and then a human has been demonstrational shown to be false. (See the works of Embryologist Wayne Friar for further info) Anyone who still sticks to this old argument, is no longer dealing with science, but have entered the realm of the dogma, where evidence and reason takes a back seat.Charles Darwin has become synonymous with evolution. But why? He didn't reveal any new ideas in the Origin. (The idea that organisms shared common ancestry and that the earth was extremely old had been around for a while. Ancient Greek philosophers had similar speculations.) So, what was so different about Darwin? Why do people associate Charles Darwin with evolution and not Alfred Wallace, Charles Lyell, Thomas Huxley, or even Charles's grandfather Erasmus. The answer, although in no way a short one, can be partly attributed to his attempt to rid special creation from the scientific throne. In its place instituting a naturalist paradigm, that ever since has hindered science. Before Darwin, along the time of Galileo, the dogma came from the religious sect. But, since Darwin's time the dogma has switched sides, or at least superficially. The dogma still comes from the religious sect mind you, but a religious sect masquerading around as science. In short, Darwin is synonymous with evolution not because of his scientific contribution but because of his adherence to a naturalistic philosophy, which in the words of Richard Dawkins &quot;made it possible to be an intellectual fulfilled atheist&quot;. Darwin removed the need for a designer."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"Regarding the complete lack of transitional forms in the fossil record, Darwin said in the 1850's:&quot;Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain; and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and serious objection which can be urged against the theory. The explanation lies, as I believe, in the extreme imperfection of the geological record.&quot; ---Charles Darwin, &quot;On the imperfection of the geological record&quot;, Chapter X, &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;, J. M. Dent &amp; Sons Ltd, London, 1971, pp. 292-293.But 120 years later!&quot;Well, we are now about 120 years after Darwin and the knowledge of the fossil record has been greatly expanded. We now have a quarter of a million fossil species but the situation hasn't changed much. The record of evolution is still surprisingly jerky and, ironically, we have even fewer examples of evolutionary transition than we had in Darwin's time. By this I mean that some of the classic cases of darwinian change in the fossil record, such as the evolution of the horse in North America, have had to be discarded or modified as a result of more detailed information -what appeared to be a nice simple progression when relatively few data were available now appears to be much more complex and much less gradualistic. So Darwin's problem has not been alleviated in the last 120 years and we still have a record which \`does' show change but one that can hardly be looked upon as the most reasonable consequence of natural selection. Also the major extinctions such as those of the dinosaurs and trilobites are still very puzzling.&quot; ---Dr. David M. Raup (Curator of Geology, Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago), &quot;Conflicts between Darwin and paleontology&quot;. &quot;Field Museum of Natural History Bulletin&quot;, vol. 50 (1), January 1979, p. 25.Are there any transitional forms at all?&quot;... I fully agree with your comments on the lack of direct illustration of evolutionary transitions in my book. If I knew of any, fossil or living, I would certainly have included them. You suggest that an artist should be used to visualize such transformations, but where would he get the information from? I could not, honestly, provide it, and if I were to leave it to artistic license, would that not mislead the reader?I wrote the text of my book four years ago. If I were to write it now, I think the book would be rather different. Gradualism is a concept I believe in, not just because of Darwin's authority, but because my understanding of genetics seems to demand it. Yet Gould and the American Museum people are hard to contradict when they say there are no transitional fossils. As a palaeontologist myself, I am much occupied with the philosophical problems of identifying ancestral forms in the fossil record. You say that I should at least \`show a photo of the fossil from which each type of organism was derived.' I will lay it on the line-there is not one such fossil for which one could make a watertight argument.&quot; ---Personal letter (written 10 April 1979) from Dr. Colin Patterson, Senior Palaeontologist at the British Museum of Natural History in London, to Luther D. Sunderland; as quoted in &quot;Darwin's Enigma&quot; by Luther D. Sunderland, Master Books, San Diego, USA, 1984, p. 89.&quot;I know that, at least in paleoanthropology, data are still so sparse that theory heavily influences interpretations.

The evolutionary trees that adorn our textbooks have data only at the tips and nodes of their branches; the rest is inference, however reasonable, not the evidence of fossils. Yet Darwin was so wedded to gradualism that he wagered his entire theory on a denial of this literal record:\\"The geological record is extremely imperfect and this fact will to a large extent explain why we do not find interminable varieties, connecting together all the extinct and existing forms of life by the finest graduated steps. He who rejects these views on the nature of the geological record, will rightly reject my whole theory.\\"Darwin's argument still persists as the favored escape of most paleontologists from the embarrassment of a record that seems to show so little of evolution. In exposing its cultural and methodological roots, I wish in no way to impugn the potential validity of gradualism (for all general views have similar roots). I wish only to point out that it was never \`seen' in the rocks.Paleontologists have paid an exorbitant price for Darwin's argument. We fancy ourselves as the only true students of life's history, yet to preserve our favored account of evolution by natural selection we view our data as so bad that we never see the very process we profess to study.&quot; ---Stephen Jay Gould (Professor of Geology and Paleontology, Harvard University), &quot;Evolution's erratic pace&quot;. &quot;Natural History&quot;, vol.

It is unreasonable to present information that the reader cannot verify by checking references.P.5: He refers to the \\"struggle for existence among all organic beings. This is the doctrine of Malthus, applied to the whole of the animal and vegetable kingdom.\\"Malthus's \\"Principles of Population\\" states that disease, accidents, war and famine \\"keep down the population of savage races to so much lower an average than that of more civilized peoples.\\" There is no scientific evidence to justify the application of Malthus's controversial exposition to the whole of the animal and vegetable kingdom.\\"P.6: Natural Selection almost inevitably causes much extinction of less improved forms of life, and induces what I have called divergence of character.\\"He provides no examples to support this assertion, and does not define \\"less improved forms of life\\". Less improved? In what way?P.7: He states that the notion that \\"each species has been independently created is erroneous.\\"He provides no evidence to support this assertion.P.11: He states that there is \\"inherited development of udders in cows and goats in countries where they are habitually milked\\".So it seems Lamarck was right then.P.16: \\"I think it highly probable that our domestic dogs have descended from several wild species\\".But what did the wild species descend from?P.17: On the subject of dogs he states that \\"by crossing we can get only forms in some degree intermediate between their parents ... We must admit the greyhound, bloodhound, bull-dog, etc. in the wild state.\\"It would appear that he is stumped at the presence of the domestic dog. As for the evolution of the domestic cat, Darwin is silent on the matter.P.51: \\"the doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdom\\".So, the doctrine of Malthus is not just applied, it is applied with manifold force. What does that mean? He doesn't say.P.51: \\"There is no exception to the rule that every organic being naturally increases at so high a rate that if not destroyed, the earth would soon be covered by the progeny of a single pair. Even slow breeding man has doubled in 25 years\\".What is he implying here? That people should be destroyed according to the principles of Malthus: disease, accidents, war and famine to keep the numbers down?P.51: \\"Several of the plants now most numerous over the wide plains of La Plata, clothing square leagues of surface almost to the exclusion of all other plants have been introduced from Europe\\".Is he saying that his Malthus theory only applies in cases where humans have wantonly introduced new species into a previously undisturbed area? It would appear so.P.54: \\"On the other hand, in some cases, as with the elephant and rhinoceros, none are destroyed by beasts of prey\\".The fact that Africa was not overrun by elephants and rhinos would appear to invalidate his Malthus theory as applied to the animal and vegetable kingdom.P.62 \\"[T]he vigorous, the healthy and the happy survive and multiply\\".How can a wild animal be happy? He doesn't say. Is he referring to people and/or domestic cats and dogs? If people, then why should they multiply? Why not keep the population at a stable and sustainable number? Then, the dreaded principles of Malthus would not have to be invoked.P.66: \\"Nor ought we to think that the occasional destruction of an animal of any particular colour would produce little effect: we should remember how essential it is in a flock of white sheep to destroy every lamb with the faintest trace of black.\\"No evidence is provided to substantiate this statement. InSpandau The Secret Diaries, for the entry of Feb 19th, 1964, Albert Speer states that he \\"never thought much of the Darwinist theory of struggle and killing with which Hitler was obsessed\\". The implication of Darwin's statement is that white purity is something that has to be strictly enforced.P.71: \\"The tendency [for cats] to catch rats rather than mice is known to be inherited.\\"Is this evolution through acquired characteristics or natural selection?P.105: \\"I believe that the nearly wingless condition of several birds, which now inhabit or have lately inhabited several oceanic islands, tenanted by no beast of prey, has been caused by disuse.\\"The kiwi of New Zealand is a flightless bird that thrived until Westerners imported rats to the island. Beasts of prey existed in New Zealand before the rat arrived. So it would seem that he is wrong in his belief.P.110: \\"[S]uch facts as that former species of the elephant and rhino were capable of enduring a glacial climate, whereas the living species are now all tropical or sub-tropical in their habits, ought not to be looked at as anomalies, but merely as examples of a very common flexibility of constitution, brought, under peculiar circumstances into play.\\"So, he's saying that a \\"very common flexibility of constitution\\" caused the extinction of the mammoth is he? What rubbish.P.134: \\"By my theory these allied species have descended from a common parent; and during the process of modification, each has become adapted to the conditions of life in its own region, and has supplanted and exterminated its original parent\\".So, once species have become \\"modified\\", they exterminate the original parent. Sounds like something Communist regimes over history have practiced.P.136: \\"[I]ntermediate varieties should not endure for very long periods ... as a general rule they should be exterminated and disappear, sooner than the forms which they originally linked together.\\"By stating that intermediate forms \\"should be exterminated\\", Darwin appears to be advocating that people should be doing the exterminating. He provides no evidence as to why this should be the case.P.136: \\"[A]ny form existing in lesser numbers would, as already remarked, run a greater chance of being exterminated than one existing in large numbers\\".He neglects to say that man is the cause of extermination of species. Anyway, what about the extermination of the dinosaurs and mammoths?P.136: \\"Hence, the more common forms, in the race for life, will tend to beat and supplant the less common forms, for these will be more slowly modified and improved.\\"He supplies no evidence for this. If I was a Communist then I would perhaps take inspiration from this, as it implies the triumph of \\"a socialist dictatorship of the proletariat\\".P.152: \\"We are profoundly ignorant of the causes producing slight and unimportant variations\\".He doesn't say who the \\"We\\" refers to. If he doesn't know what causes these variations, then perhaps he should abandon his theory.P.154: \\"If it could be proved that any part of the structure of any one species had been formed for the exclusive good of another species, it would annihilate my theory, for such could not have been produced through natural selection.\\"In his book on ESP, T.C. Lethbridge refers to a parasitic beetle that is only found in wasps' nests. He says, \\"This kind of situation occurs everywhere in the world of insects, spiders and so on. Every parasite is adapted for its life role and some of these are very complicated. How did the liver-fluke think out an evolution whereby its first host is a small snail which is then eaten by a sheep? These things make no sense as explained by Darwinian evolution; but they are perfectly understandable, if you once postulate an external mind planning them.\\"P.154: \\"After the lapse of time, under changing conditions of life, if any part comes to be injurious, it will be modified; or if it be not so, the being will become extinct, as myriads have become extinct.\\"This does not account for sudden, mass extinctions.P.155: \\"The endemic productions of New Zealand, for instance, are perfect one compared with another; but they are now rapidly yielding before the advancing legions of plants and animals introduced from Europe.\\"On page 62 he claimed that \\"the vigorous, the healthy and the happy survive and multiply\\". Therefore, is he stating that the European plants and animals are happier, healthier and more vigorous than the NZ species? H.G. Wells inMr. Blettsworthy on Rampole Island,makes the following point: \\"The struggle for life can terminate in the triumph of types unfit to live, types merely successfully most noxious. In nature a relative survival of the rotten and dying is possible.\\" So, as the kiwi bird is exterminated by the rat, this presumably the sort of evolution that Darwin has in mind in his Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection.P.157: \\"Natural selection in each well-stocked country must act chiefly through the competition of the inhabitants one with another, and consequently will produce perfection, or strength in the battle for life, only according to the standard of that country. Hence the inhabitants of one country, generally the smaller one, will often yield, as we see they do yield, to the inhabitants of another and generally larger country.\\"Is he saying that perfection equals strength, or that either perfection or strength will be produced? If he is saying that strength and perfection are the same thing then this is Marxist ideology. As for the inhabitants of smaller countries yielding to those of larger ones, perhaps this is what provided some inspiration to the Nazi lebensraum program.P.158: He continues: \\"For in the larger country there will have existed more individuals, and more diversified forms, and the competition will have been severer, and thus the standard of perfection will have been rendered higher.\\"He provides no evidence for this statement. If something is perfect in nature, then it is perfect. Who is Darwin to judge on the standard of perfection in nature?On page 168 he discusses slave making ants. \\"If we had not known of any other slave-making ant, it would have been hopeless to have speculated how so wonderful an instinct could have been perfected ... The males and fertile females do no work. The workers or sterile females, though most energetic and courageous in capturing slaves, do no other work.\\"Slave-making is described as a \\"wonderful\\" instinct. The workers are \\"courageous\\" in capturing slaves. It sounds like Darwin is a fan of slavery.P.169: \\"According to Huber, who had ample opportunities for observation, in Switzerland the slaves habitually work with their masters in making the nest, and they alone open and close the doors in the morning and evening\\".How many ants nests have doors in them? Is Darwin extrapolating from ants nest findings theories about how human slaves should behave?P.171: \\"Such are the facts, though they did not need confirmation by me, in regard to the wonderful instinct of making slaves.\\"Yes, Darwin is a fan of the \\"wonderful\\" instinct of making slaves.P.186: There is \\"one general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.\\"Let the strongest live and the weakest die, he says. So, presumably, Darwin would be against all forms of pest control, because the rat is the strongest animal, so it should be allowed to live. I wonder if fans of eugenics were inspired by Darwin's one general law.P.214: \\"... all changes have been effected very slowly through natural selection.\\"All changes eh? Excluding humans, of course. Darwin offers no explanation for the rapid development/sudden appearance of modern man.P.229: \\"If numerous species, belonging to the same genera or families, have really started into life all at once, the fact would be fatal to theory of descent with slow modification through natural selection.\\"Lloyd Pye, fromEverything You Know Is Wrong: Human Origins: \\"600 million years ago soft-bodied corals and tiny worm-like creatures appear. All come suddenly and - like prokaryotes and eukaryotes - with no precursors.\\" It would appear that it is time to ditch Darwin's theory.P.235: \\"I look at the natural geological record, as a history of the world imperfectly kept, and written in a changing dialect; of this history we possess the last volume alone, relating to only two or three countries ... On this view, the difficulties above discussed are greatly diminished, or even disappear.\\"So, Darwin, instead of finding his flawed theory at fault, because it cannot be substantiated from geological records, instead puts the blame on Geology. Is this a case of sour grapes?P.242: \\"The theory of natural selection is grounded in the belief that each new variety, and ultimately each new species, is produced and maintained by having some advantage over those with which it comes into competition; and the consequent extinction of less favoured forms almost inevitably follows.\\"That's rubbish. The mammoth was a superior animal to the elephant. Also, modern man walks in a less efficient manner than earlier forms of man.P.259: \\"But the utter extinction of a whole group of species may often be a very slow process, from the survival of a few descendants, lingering in protected and isolated situations.\\"He does not give specifics. When is it a very slow process? How about sudden extinctions?On page 269 he refers to \\"an ingenious paper by Mr Wallace, in which he concludes, that 'every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a pre-existing closely allied species'But... that sounds like spontaneous acts of creation! If as if realising the implication, Darwin then starts rambling about modification during the process of descent from a single parent. The trouble with Darwin and his whole theory is that he cannot provide the evidence to back it up.He rambles on from mention of Mr Wallace's ingenious paper with a mention of English race horses. These \\"differ slightly from every other breed, but they do not owe their difference and superiority to descent from any single pair, but to continued care in selecting and training many individuals during many generations.\\"So, they only proof that Darwin has to offer for evolution progressing by very slow changes is not proof at all. It is when humans interfere by breeding and improving the stock of race horses and cattle.P.367: \\"The noble science of Geology loses glory from the extreme imperfection of the record.\\"Sour grapes because the evidence is lacking to support his theory.P.368: \\"To my mind it accords better with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the Creator, that the production and extinction of the past and present inhabitants of the world should have been due to secondary causes, like those determining the birth and death of the individual.\\"Darwin believes in God! No doubt the likes of Richard Dawkins would accuse him of being unscientific on this score.P.369: \\"Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most excited object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having originally breathed into a few forms or into one, and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed laws of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful, most wonderful, have been, and are being, evolved.\\"There is no grandeur in Darwin's view of life governed by Malthus's principles. Darwin equates perfection with power. As H.G. Wells says, \\"The struggle for life can terminate in the triumph of types unfit to live, types merely successfully most noxious.\\" Such as man! In the glossary Darwin defines \\"parasite\\" as \\"an animal or plant living upon or in, and at the expense of another organism\\". Humans could legitimately be called parasites, and so it seems Darwin must be insanely optimistic if he thought that endless forms most beautiful are continuing to be evolved, when as he noted on page 51, \\"Even slow breeding man has doubled in 25 years\\". If Darwin was a realist, then he might have come to the same conclusion as H.G. Wells: \\"So that so far from Evolution being necessarily a strenuous upward progress to more life and yet more life, it might become a graceless drift towards a dead end.\\" He was more blunt in 1939, in his Fate of Homo Sapiens, referring to a \\"new barbarism\\" and predicting that \\"Mankind which began in a cave and behind a windbreak will end in the disease soaked ruins of a slum.\\" Considering, the evidence, Wells' outlook seems more likely than that of Darwin. In addition, Darwin it seems did not want to consider any evidence for sudden mass extinctions in the past.In the glossary, Darwin defines \\"retrogression\\" as \\"Backward development. When an animal, as it approaches maturity, becomes less perfectly organised than might be expected from its early stages and known relationships, it is said to undergo a retrograde development or metamorphosis.\\" This appears to have occurred in Darwin's case. This book is a candidate for the most overrated book in the history of publishing."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"Even though it was fun to read, I give it one star lest the brainwashed academics out their suffer further undue influence. This book has been highly misrepresented by evolutionists for decades. One reviewer made this point but failed to back it up with any facts. That reviewer failed to point out that it was in the \\"Descent of Man,\\" not \\"Origin of the Species\\" where Darwin first presents man as having descended from apes.Evolutionists apply natural selection to explain all biological development. It's the worse case of reductionism in history. James D. Watson and Edward Wilson were on the Charlie Rose show talking about this book. They described natural selection as the single great development in science since Newton. They claimed to describe this book as great English literature yet they badly misrepresented it as teaching that natural selection applies to everything biological. How could these allegedly great scientists be so unscientific? Scientists aren't supposed to be cavalier in their judgment. Scientists are supposed to be conservative in their judgment.First of all, let's quote Darwin himself from this book, page 75: \\"To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree.\\" There you have it, from Darwin himself, from his famous book. Yet, today, textbooks that claim a lineage to Darwin, depict evolutionary trees of everything biological sprouting from natural selection. Evolutionists like Robert H Hurlbutt, oppose William Paley's design argument because it makes God, not natural selection, the origin of design in the human eye. See Hurlbutt's book, page 173, \\"Hume, Newton and the Design Argument.\\" Watson and Wilson also attacked the human eye argument in an ad hominem way without producing any argument.But, while Hurlbutt is a typical product of academic brainwashing, which passes for education these days, how could two Nobel Prize winners of science, Watson and Wilson, make such a foolish mistake? First of all, Watson and Wilson are crooks. Their Nobel Prize fame for unlocking the secrets of the structure of DNA was illfounded. Rosalind Franklin of King's college is well known to have discovered the structure of DNA and her supervisor Wilson passed it on to Watson and Crick, who, along with Wilson, took credit for it. A little research by the Nobel Prize committee would have discovered this. I guess the Nobel Prize really isn't worth anything when you consider how sloppy they are in giving their awards. Einstein was given a Nobel Prize even though his papers on Brownian movement are a plagarization of Josiah Willard Gibb's book \\"Statistical Mechanics.\\"Concluding unscientific postscript: Could Darwin's \\"Descent of Man\\" have psychological origin in the fact that Darwin himself looked like a monkey?"},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"\\"Step back from the tree Charles\\"...he can't - he's dead."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"To illustrate what's wrong with this book, I below lift out the central hypothesis which is the theory of Natural Selection.&quot; can we doubt (remembering that many more individuals are born than can possibly survive) that individuals having any advantage, however slight, over others, would have the best chance of surviving and of procreating their kind? On the other hand, we may feel sure that any variation in the least degree injurious would be rigidly destroyed. This preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural Selection.&quot;The fact is that *all* individuals do not survive, all individuals die. Such exactness is important in science and Darwin fails this scientific standard. This seemingly insignificant error in the fundament of the theory gives a cascade of errors later on. It is really quite different to say that the chance of reproduction determines which organisms are left in the world, then to say a struggle for survival/existence determines it. The first puts focus on the individual organism (since they reproduce, but don't survive), the last puts focus on the population (which doesn't reproduce much, but can be said to survive).Throughout the book there is no effort at formalization, which is why Physicists, Chemists etc. people of the socalled hard sciences(up until the 19!80's when physicists also started to make their science softer because of the problems they ran into), looked down on Darwinism as a soft science employing a magical struggle for existence and intuitive terms like that.It is clear that Darwin, having dropped Christianity, invested as much emotion into his theory as he could, making it a suitable substitute religion for him, rather then try to make it a hard science.&quot;Hence we may look with some confidence to a secure future of equally inappreciable length. And as natural selection works solely by and for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection.&quot;The natural force of goodness? For crying out loud. This should have read something like: and as natural selection works by the chance of reproduction of each organism, all corpereal endowments normally contribute towards reproduction.The security of humanity depends on politics much. Certainly humanity is capable of killing themselves entirely, what with superweapons like the earth slicer, or some biological weapon, or destroying the ozoneshield, or stopping the oceanic pump etc. :( It is not good for Darwin to ignore politics as an active agency in favour of some biological determinism. This is something he also does in the Descent of Man in a *much* more creepy way when talking about the extermination of one race by another. There really is much better work done in biology in the same era, this is not up to scratch."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"There is only one other book that is so widely known, discussed, and debated, yet so rarely read: that other book is the Bible. To make my point, here is a little quiz:1) Which name is most closely associated with the theory of evolution?2) Which book did this person write on evolution?3) What claims are made in that book?4) What else is contained in that book?With astonishing regularity, the average literate adult will respond as follows: 1) Darwin, 2) Origin of Species, 3) Humans descended from apes, and 4) I have no idea. The first two are correct, the third is absolutely false, and the fourth is an admission of complete ignorance. Considering that &quot;Origin of Species&quot; is over 600 pages long, and took nearly two decades to write, one would expect it to contain something more than the four simple words &quot;Humans descended from apes,&quot; which, in fact, it neither contains nor implies. So, what DOES it contain? There is one word that best summarizes the bulk of Darwin's magnum opus: &quot;observation&quot;.It is a lengthy book; at times it is tedious, at times politically incorrect, and at times scientifically off-base. But, despite its numerous flaws, it is one of the greatest achievements in the history of mankind. Even if you are among the few who refuse to accept Darwin's ideas, you cannot deny their impact. The theory is the cornerstone--if not the very foundation--of modern biology. Whatever your preconceptions, you will likely be surprised by this work. Darwin was the consummate naturalist and scientist, as well as a refined and articulate gentleman. &quot;Origin&quot; is a delight and an epiphany to read. It's amazing how much Darwin got right, despite the fact that he had essentially no idea of how inheritance worked. It's amazing how much data Darwin carefully assembled, analyzed, and described. It's amazing how meticulously Darwin weighed the evidence, noting when competing theories made different predictions, when the available evidence was not what he would have expected, and what future evidence could completely discredit (falsify) his theory. It's amazing in its honesty.The misconceptions about &quot;Origin of Species&quot; are not merely rampant, they are effectively universal, fueled (largely in the US) by the rise of creationism, which seeks first and foremost to vilify the theory of evolution as well as Darwin (often failing to distinguish between the two). It's worth the time to read this enormous but meticulously crafted volume, if only to allow you to form your own opinions about such an influential book. Once you have, take the little quiz again. You may need 600 pages to answer the last question."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"The Origin of Species, for the first time offering an adequate explanation for biological change and origins, should be required reading for anyone interested in biology, history, or life in general. Because the book outlines the beginnings of a vast, new theory, it is accessible to laypersons. It does not suffer from the esotericism of most scientific writings, which expect readers to have a working knowledge of a specific scientific idea. Darwin starts from scratch and builds up all the evidence for his theory in a way that renders his argument undeniable.Darwin's idea explains the production of differing species through natural selection. Darwin did little to explain evolution, or the change, of species, but this book fully outlines how the mechanism of selection would make sure such random changes would produce complex organisms. The mechanism Darwin proposes is at once so simple and seems so obvious with hindsight. It is something evident to any dog breeder--that traits can be selected and passed on to different generations--and Darwin even draws upon knowledge of artificial selection in birds and dogs to bolster his claims. Ultimately, however, the evidence for evolution by natural selection lies not in a vague analogy to artificial selection, but in the predictions Darwin's theory made and fulfilled. Darwin's expectation of biological similarity in ancestors and descendants is fulfilled by simply looking at exterior features or even bone structures. He also notes that his theory thoroughly predicts and explains the existence of rudimentary features like teeth in whale embryos and flightless wings in birds. The fact that island species correspond most with similar species on the nearest continent, instead of in distant lands, shows that these species are descended from them and changed after migrating to a separate environment. Darwin also showed how his theory explained the difficulties with classifying species, because evolution thoroughly broke down the distinction of species as pure and distinct.Not only is this book useful in gaining an understanding of evolution, but it is also a good outline for scientific methodology and research. One comes into reading the book wondering how one could prove an unobservable process that takes millions of years to occur, and is overwhelmed by the ingenuity of the predictions offered by the theory that are fulfilled by subsequent observations. Darwin's book shows that the predictive power of theories are vital, allowing them to be tested and refuted. The entire book outlines the vacuousness of the design inference as a common explanation for life, showing that an inference of design does not explain similarity in biological structures, vestigial and rudimentary parts, the geological distribution of life, and the difficulty in classifying species. All of these observations are explored in meticulous detail by Darwin, and shown to be thoroughly explained by evolution combined with natural selection.From a historical perspective, reading the book causes one to marvel at Darwin's ingenuity. One can see glimmers of later discoveries reflected in Darwin's reasoning. One shakes one's head at his ability to explain the distribution of life by glaciers and flight and rafting...only to realize that the theory of plate tectonics would have been a delightful solution to the several problems Darwin noted with distribution for fossilized species. Darwin often makes bold predictions that the modern reader knows come true, and it is simply a wonderful thing to behold such accuracy.The Origin of Species is a wonderful book, accessible to all, and a treasure to read for anyone with a passion for history, science, or life."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"Before reviewing this excellent book it would be best to introduce this review with an overview of the current climate when it comes to Darwin.Charles Darwin (a naturalist) is the father of modern Evolution (not *Evil*ultion; it is pronounced *Evo*-lution).Darwin's overall explanation of evolution, in this book, is not modern evolutionary biology. Modern evolution can, and does, go beyond Darwin's view.Darwin's model is often called Darwinism, a partially philosophical concept but mostly the science of biology and geology combined. It is widely considered to be the single most important scientific discovery of all time. Darwin's underlying points are the essentials of evolutionary biology.Theories are comprised of facts without gaps. Theories are factual. Theories contain facts to explain a factual instance of something material. Theories do not contain fabrications or a little bit of lies plus some truths. If a theory is not all facts then it is not a theory.The phrase \\"it is just a theory and not fact\\" is a contradiction of terms. A factual instance of something (such as observing speciation) needs to be explained. Facts are used to explain the factual instance of something material.Darwin used philosophy and biological science and earth sciences (geology) to develop the concept of natural selection which is primarily based on explaining how evolution occurs with the mechanism of \`natural selection'. Darwin observed in the world about him what he believed to be the result of a single cell organism that had evolved into all forms of life we see today. More importantly, there is no chaos involved. It has order. \\"The Origin of Species\\" (TOOS) is all about Darwin discussing how he came to this conclusion.In the 21st Century, \\"Speciation\\" has been observed countless times. Go search right now for \\"Observed Speciation Events\\".***Speciation is a fact whether we can explain the mechanisms of how it works or not. This can not be understated! A fact is a fact regardless of our ability to explain how it works. Gravity existed well before Newton could explain it. Speciation exists (a new species developing in the world, under scientific observation) meaning evolution is a fact. Look at the title of this review. Nobody should have to explain evolution in order to prove it factual. ***Now is the time to say this. If you don't believe theories are factual, then stop engaging the results of factual science in your life right now. Walk the talk. Turn off the PC. Turn off the electricity. Turn off the heating... and walk. I will allow you the option of a bronze spear... that is if you know how to smelt bronze.As a note, the Catholic Church has been teaching the fact of evolution and the theory of the mechanisms of evolution in Catholic schools since the 1950s. This is exactly the same coursework that secular schools have on evolution. However there is some discrepancy over natural selection. Natural selection has order but it is not guided. This is the problem part for most religious people. One would do well however to experience thinking about natural selection without any divine guidance. This is truly the type of thinking that grasps the full impact of this work.The theory of the mechanisms of evolution is independent of the fact of evolution. The theory of the mechanisms of evolution is a compilation of facts (without gaps) used to explain the fact of evolution. The theory of the mechanisms of evolution is here, in part, but are much better explained and referenced by modern evolutionary biology. If its modern evolution you want (and you may well do if your first search brought you here) then go to talkorigins on the net and read about the \\"29+ evidences for macroevolution\\". It can take days, weeks months, or years, or a lifetime to parse the data, but keep going over it and it will eventually click.The most popular version of The Origin of Species is the one which contains the first edition published by Darwin in 1859 with an editor's introduction by J. W Burrow first published in 1968. Burrows covers the history of the work, the successive editions of the book that Darwin published and recent scientific discoveries that shed light on Darwin's theory.IntroductionDarwin in TOOS starts by describing his life and times as a naturalist. Darwin explains the problem of immutable claims about the species and goes through the historical record to show instances where people have indicated that the species are mutable. He explains that he is writing this book because Alfred Russel Wallace has drawn the same conclusions about natural selection.Chapter 1: Variation under DomesticationDarwin goes straight into variations under domestication showing that farmed animals are substantially different from their wild counterparts from which they came. Darwin did not have access to Gregor Mendel's laws of inheritance but he did guess that there was a mechanism like this responsible for variation. His bases for the assertion that species come from other closely related species is absolutely fundamentally correct by today's standards. His explanation for it was revolutionary for his time.Chapter 2: Variation under NatureDarwin exposes the instability of the then current system of taxonomy to show that categorization and labelling is not fixed and thus questions the bases for immutability. This paves the way for the natural overview that all like organisms share commonalities and that variations can be immediate or subtle gradual changes over time. Darwin discusses intermediate forms and shows that group changes are proportional while alluding to the first shape of an evolutionary tree.Chapter 3: Struggle for ExistenceDarwin presents the ecosystem and shows that all organisms struggle to survive and that this struggle influences what we, who have survived this struggle, see in the world today. Darwin shows this complex structure and connects it with such descriptions as the presence of a feline determining through the intervention of mice and then bees the frequency of certain flowers in an area.Chapter 4: Natural SelectionThis is core material of how highly complex organisms are formed from organisms with lesser complexity and has still stood the test of time today. Darwin not only verifies evolution but explains its mechanism, natural selection. Using the analogy of a tree and the taxonomy of living things Darwin shows how beneficial variations in conjunction with heredity are responsible for the formation of new species gradually over long periods of time which compete and cause extinctions. Darwin establishes the foundation for common descent.Chapter 5: Laws of VariationDarwin, without knowing Mendel's laws of inheritance, comes close to explaining it by in-depth analyses of the variations in organisms, such as the horse and cabbage. Darwin has been preparing the reader to accept that species are highly variable and that this means that ideas of a static independent design of the species without variation are highly flawed and evolution can be the only sensible conclusion drawn from the evidence.Chapter 6: Difficulties on TheoryDarwin does what religious writers avoid which is self-critic, the hallmark of scientific thinking, brings up all possible problems with his theory and slowly shows how the answers are natural even though he doesn't have them all yet, but still manages to explain the evolution of the eye by comparison to lesser complex eyes in nature as well as the evolution of flight by comparison to gliding organisms. Darwin then shows imperfections in nature, explains why they are there and pulls off a last minute rationalization for why organisms more suited for another environment live in a completely different one with natural selection.Chapter 7: InstinctDarwin looks at complex instincts in the animal kingdom. Here Darwin examines the life of aphids and ants, revealing their instincts, turns to birds, before going back into the micro world of slave-making ants and the hive-bee, before tackling the design of complex hive honeycomb structures. Not only does Darwin show the evolution of beehives but has all along been preparing us for the slow long gradual evolution of instinct in all living things and then directly implies Mendel's laws of inheritance. Darwin amazingly demonstrates that neuter or sterile insects that perform specific tasks can be produced from parents who don't do those tasks, by way of natural selection.Chapter 8: HybridismIn order to understand this chapter one should know that at the time the sterility of species was considered the divine indication that species where not allowed to crossbreed. Darwin using sterility examples shows the reader that there is very little to distinguish species from varieties, if they can be distinguished at all. This undermines any attempt to say that a species has an exact definition or is fixed and this is fatal to the independent creation of species hypothesis. Darwin establishes yet another proof for evolution.Chapter 9: On the Imperfection of the Geological RecordDarwin using Lyell's geology changes our view of the world. Suddenly we find that we are no longer the centre of the earth, just as Copernicus showed that we where no longer the centre of our solar system. Darwin describes geology in-depth, with the erosion of land, atom by atom, and the formation of land, atom by atom, adding that the world has seen many forms of life, gradually evolving, through a vast amount of time that we can barely comprehend. He challenges questions about the limits of the fossil record by revealing the story of life as only evident in some parts, with other parts yet to be found, if they will ever be found at all. It's a breathtaking chapter that reshapes how human beings will see themselves after reading it.Chapter 10: On the Geological Succession of Organic BeingsNow that Darwin has completely revised our world view with the evidence of evolution he proceeds to explain how geological movements over long period of time, as well as the migration of species, will create an imperfect fossil record but that this imperfect fossil record will always show organisms of lesser complexity evolving into organisms of greater complexity via the mechanism of natural selection. Darwin shows that species evolve at different rates over time and in different directions which explains the present existing complexity of life today and the scientific record of every organism that has ever lived.Chapter 11: Geographical distributionDarwin describes a series of practical experiments that anyone can do in their own back garden involving picking seeds from bird droppings, germinating them, sinking seeds in water for 28 days, growing them, analysing the content of mud in the paws of trekking animals and then concluding that the geographical dispersal of fauna from island to island is not a mystery. Darwin then explains why similar fauna are found up mountains around the world by way of glaciers pushing and splitting primordial plant life from the ground upwards. These simple explanations are yet another blow to the suggestion of the immutability of species.Chapter 12: Geographical distribution -- continuedWithout directly saying it, Darwin has been implying the common decent of all biological organisms from a single source, the origin of species. Darwin now says it but continues on the topic of distribution showing how birds can easily spread freshwater organisms and how the geological changes of streams, intersecting and separating, can spread freshwater life across the planet. Darwin joins geology with distribution presenting the historical record for all life on earth. Laws of diversity regarding degrees of complexity are introduced. Darwin has established the structure of evolutionary biology as the explanation for life. The scientific impact is immeasurable.Chapter 13: Mutual Affinities of Organic Beings: Morphology: Embryology: Rudimentary OrgansFor anyone left unconvinced, for some odd reason or another, Darwin simply points to the current work in the natural system and shows that the underlying theme taxonomists have been searching for is actually common decent. Darwin then demonstrates how natural selection can create similar developments in very diverse organisms. Embryology alone is argued as evidence for common decent as Darwin illustrates that all embryos and newborn virtually look the same in some respect and that growth and aging in the lifetime of any organism is almost enough evidence alone for mutability. Finally Darwin delivers on a collection of useless organs and appendages no longer in use because they have been naturally breed out because of disuse or \`inutility'.Chapter 14: Recapitulation and ConclusionDarwin runs through all the main points of his argument for natural selection. Darwin is aware that evolution is a minority view but hopes that in the future more evidence for natural selection will appear. He says he can offer nothing to support the idea of the immutability of species and closes with a profound statement and for the first time invokes and ends with the classic word that defined his view. Darwin says, \\"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, EVOLVED.\\"The complex web of relations with livings things to the environment is staggering yet so obvious in hindsight. The whole point of TOOS is it is ridiculous that someone didn't get this sooner. The environment has an impact of living things and living things have an impact on the environment. This is a symbiotic relationship. There is an opportunity for improvement or deterioration in the offspring just on the basis of all possible genetic combinations. Minor changes add up to big ones.Darwin's findings about how the environment causes variations in living things is accurate in his proposals although his tenders are mostly humanistic with references to biology especially with regards to \\"monstrosities\\" that simply don't have any reason for things like \\"wings\\", such as some insects and some birds, if they can't fly. Vestiges are an extremely good case for evolution. The cave crab with an eye stalk without an eye is like a telescope without the lens. Darwin identifies the possibility of sex linked traits in animals, a proven point today.Reading TOOS is like a romance novel where the birth of something to unify the sciences further is described in a man's love for nature and his crucial discovery. TOOS is something that needs to be reread several times for the full impact. Walking around in the world today knowing that all organisms have evolved from lesser complexity to greater complexity by means of natural selection is a whole different worldview to thinking that a supernatural deity did it. Challenge yourself. Try it."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"This is not a difficult book to read, and I would encourage readers to read the original work of Darwin.\\"The Origin of Species\\" is considered to be an important work in both world literature and science. An interesting aspect of the book was the pressure for Darwin to publish the book. Prior to publishing, he had spent almost 30 years developing and testing his ideas. The book is a combination of argument and debate along with descriptions of Darwin's own experiments with birds and plants, including his own cabbage garden. In short, according to Darwin, the evolution of species takes place over a long time period and is a series of random events with survival of the fitest, or what is called \\"natural selection.\\"Darwin was born in 1809, trained as a botanist and zoologist at Cambridge University, and made his famous trip on the H.M.S. Beagle from 1831 to 1836. He was first inspired by the writings of the geologist Sir Charles Lyell. This same geologist would play an important role in pushing Darwin to publish his findings in 1856.Darwin - as he writes in his book - was not working alone. He was not the first to come up with the ideas. Darwin was preceded by many before him with similar ideas. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire wrote as early as 1795 that species are \\"degenerations of the same type.\\" Lamarck was in fact the first person to suggest that \\"all species, including man, are descended from other species.\\" He published his ideas in 1801, 1809, and 1815. W.C. Wells presented a paper on human skin colors in 1813 and published his results in 1818. This was followed by The Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert published in the \\"Horticultural Transactions\\" in 1822 that \\"botanical species are only a higher and more permanent class of varieties.\\" In 1826 professor Grant \\"declares his belief that species are descendent from other species.\\" Also, Von Bush in 1836 \\"expresses his belief that varieties slowly become changed into permanent species.\\" And, in 1846 M.J. d'Omalius d'Halloy published a paper with his opinion \\"that it is more probable that new species have been produced by descent with modification than they have been separately created.\\"After the Beagle trip, Darwin's main pre-occupation was to prepare his five volume work \\"Zoology of the Voyage of the Beagle\\" over the years 1840 - 1843. Also, he undertook a series of experiments on evolution and wrote shorter papers. But in 1856 geologist Sir Charles Lyell persuaded Darwin to take his notes and publish \\"The Origin of Species.\\" As he prepared the book, Alfred Russel Wallace sent him a manuscript with an identical or similar theory. The two men decided to present their works simultaneously to the Linnaean Society. Wallace had visited Malaysia and come up with similar conclusions to Darwin, but he had not yet prepared an impresive large book, as had Darwin.Darwin had been very cautious, and in the years 1840 to 1856 he had undertaken a number of experiments himself with pigeons and various plants. He had even joined two pigeon clubs and had his own garden in the country. He describes some of the slightly amusing details in the book. For example, he was able to grow over 200 varieties of cabbages by cross breeding. Among the findings, he had come to the conclusion that domestic pigeons were probably all related back to the rock-pigeon (Columba livia). He undertook a number of experiments including one where he mated two mongrel pigeons, and the resulting offspring looked like rock-pigeons.So, although Wallace had the same ideas at the same time, Darwin had a fifteen years accumulation of notes, observations, and his own experiments that he could put into the book. Once the book came out it was an instant best seller and Wallace was largely forgotten, along with his other predecessors. Darwin was very cautious with his findings, and the many years researching and thinking about his ideas - almost two decades - paid off for him when he finally released the near 700 page book.Darwin published a second well known book in 1871: \\"The Descent of Man.\\"\\"The Origin of Species\\" is a well crafted and interesting book. There are just a few figures in the book. It is an easy read, although some parts have many small details. Darwin lectures us on a variety of subjects such as flower reproduction. The heart of the book is Chapter IV: Natural Selection. He has fifteen chapters covering a range of topics including geology and fossils.It must be remembered that when the book came out in 1859 it was generally assumed that only God could create life. The book was revolutionary, and too detailed to refute. It was a comprehensive book and came as a major challenge to the accepted norm. At the end in the conclusion Darwin tells the reader that his findings just give a different explanation in the way \\"the Creator\\" works, and it does not imply a lack of a God."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"I started reading this book expecting to find offensive, disrespectful, and vicious material throughout it. What I came to realize instead, was that people have criticized this book based on offensive, disrespectful and vicious accusations. I can't identify how people have linked this work to God and blasphemy. It has nothing to do with religion, faith, or creation. This is a work of observation, logic, and adaptability. It makes perfect sense, and trust me, it is in no way offensive.To think that for a century people have been debating, fighting, and cursing Charles Darwin over this work seems comical once you read his book. The book is written in easy to understand common language, allowing the not so biologically or anthropologically astute to understand it as well. Even if you are not convinced by Darwin's observations, you will be convinced that there is no threat to anyone's beliefs from this book.I found this work to be very convincing and highly compatible with my faith in God. It does not threaten God, and it certainly does not require me to abandon any beliefs even though I fully understand and agree with Mr. Darwin. Read this book, it is worthy of consideration and it is only fair to hold judgment until after you have read it."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"This edition (Modern Library Paperback) has several distracting typos.

I wouldtake quite the opposite view: given that this _is_ a scientific work,comparable in its impact to Newton's Principia, it is a surprisinglyeasy and lively read. While the text is a bit dry, and the numerous examplesmay seem overwhelming, I still found Darwin to be a gifted writer, and his choiceof examples enlightening, and entertaining (this is the first time I read aboutants that enslave other ants, for instance). I wishthat modern scholarly works in biology, or any other science, werewritten nearly as well as the \\"Origin of Species.\\"Even so, it is difficult to give this book a rating. It's impact on the view wehave of ourselves as a species is so enormous that judging the literarymerrits of the book is, perhaps, beside the point. Darwin's amazing prescience,and the thoughtfulness in presenting an \\"abstract\\" of his argument fordescent with modifications are awe inspiring."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"Darwin's Origin of Species is the first book I've read on evolution and being someone that appreciates the scientific manner of explaining observed phenomena with consistent theories, I tried to pay attention to the merits of Darwin's argument. I believed Darwin's theory was generally right(or at least on the right track) before reading this book and after reading it, I'm only more convinced.Although I knew the general ideas put forth by Darwin, I'm now more educated as to the manner in which Darwin came to his conclusions. It was interesting the way in which he considered, for example, how two similar species of mammals or plants could be found on two different continents very far from each other. I particularly liked his consideration of our knowledge of geological history and its relationship to his theory. I also enjoyed learning about the difficulties in distinguishing varieties and species and why it is this distinction may be somewhat arbitrary.One of the things I like about this book was the fact that Darwin addressed the various counterarguments against his theory and usually provided compelling discussions as to why his theory provided better explanation as to the observed nature of things than the idea of Creationism, which he mentions a few times throughout the book. He was meticulous enough to give much thought to potential weaknesses in his theory and yet offer explanation to how these supposed weaknesses may not be as formidable as they initally appear.I found that Darwin's work was rather thought-provoking as I found myself thinking more of mankind's development and the potential uses and development of our own organs and how they may have given us an advantage over other species.Darwin was sometimes a little long-winded in his discussion, but considering the importance of the subject matter, I appreciated his thoughtful and thorough exposition.I'm no expert in evolutionary theories or how Darwin's theory is regarded by experts today. And I don't necessarily think he got everything completely right, but I found his argument generally pretty convincing and think he was closer to being right than wrong. The origin of species, particularly ourselves, is a very important subject and I believe someone would be doing themselves a service to read such an important work."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"Many people assume that Darwin's initial account of natural selection is so out of date that it is to be avoided in favour of more recent text books of evolutionary theory. While it is true that huge gains have been made in the one and a half centuries since the first publication of \\"The Origin\\", there is nothing in this work which is wrong. Darwin was too good a scientist and too cautious.Some claim that Darwin admitted of the possibility of Lamarkian mechanisms. They have not read the original. Darwin knew nothing of the molecular basis of genetics, but knew that natural selection did not need a Lamarkian mechanism. He simply did not rule it out, although he found it improbable. Everything that is stated in this great classic is as true today as it was at the time of first publication.It is also said that Charles Darwin was a lesser intellectual when compared to most other great names of science; that he was a plodder, a naturalist, a sort of gentleman stamp collector who pressed flowers into his books and barely a scientist in the contemporary sense. This is nonsense. Darwin was one of the giants of rigorous systematic thinking; the kind of rigorous thinking and critical attitude that asks the right questions and provides the capacity to answer them. Let me buttress this claim with one example.At the end of chapter six Darwin noted that the theory of natural selection could not account for structures or behaviors found in one species that exist solely for the benefit of another unrelated species. In setting out the theoretical terms for the refutation of the theory in this way, he anticipated Karl Popper, that analytical non-nonsense philosopher of science, by more than a century.I recommend you read this book with an attentive curious analytical mind. You will find yourself walking in the footsteps of an intellectual giant."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"There are many different versions of Darwin's \\"The Origin of Species\\" available, but I found this one particularly helpful. First, while it is nicely printed and easy to read on good paper, it is not terribly expensive. Second, it reprints the first or original version of the book which Darwin subsequently modified substantially in the the further five editions he published. Third, it also includes Darwin's \\"Historical Sketch\\" and \\"glossary\\" which had not appeared in the first edition. Fourth, the color cover illustration by the Victorian artist Henry de la Beche is an important indicator of why the Victorians were so into prehistoric studies. However, the thing that really distinguishes this Penguin Books edition is the incredibily incisive and invaluable introduction by the editor, J.W. Burrow. Burrow is beyond question one of the most significant intellectual historians of our time. Among other things he has written extensively on the concept of evolution in Victorian thought in his classic \\"Evolution and Society: A Study in Victorian Social Theory.\\" In 37 crisp pages, Burrow incomparably sketches the Victorian intellectual background against which Darwin wrote. Although the essay is nearly 40 years old, it has stood the test of time very well. It alone is worth the price of the book. Altogether, a very nice introduction to this critical event in scientific and intellectual history."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"Charles Darwin may not have been the first to champion a theory of evolution, but he certainly was the best. Dry nineteenth-century writing aside, the book is a fascinating introduction to evolutionary theory. It still amazes me that someone completely in the dark about modern theories of inheritance could have successfully explained so much about evolution and variation. The book is chock-full of brilliant insights.It's true that the book is - of course - a little outdated. Reading a more modern update, like Richard Dawkins' &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; (and &quot;The Extended Phenotype&quot; if you're ambitious), will definitely bring you up to speed on the topic..."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"This is a handsome hardcover edition; the type is easy to read. Anyone who vilifies Darwin and claims that evolution is untenable hasn't read The Origin of Species. Christian fundamentalists should read this work: once they grasp the powerful connections Darwin makes between animaland plant breeding (intelligent selection) and how the environment gradually eliminates individuals less suited to its conditions (natural selection), they might see that arguing against Darwin's theory is like arguing Netwon's theory of gravity is wrong. Read Darwin before you cast the first stone!"},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"Like many other seminal literary works and ideological manifestos, 'The Origin of Species' has suffered from the fame (and notoriety in equal measure) heaped on it by reviewers, commentators, atheists, agnostics and orthodox bible believers. I would not equate this work with the bible or 'Hamlet' or any other literary work. This is NOT a literary work: it is a study, a collection of observations from which Darwin himself draws only tentative conclusions. As a man of science there is little more than Darwin can do because the truth lies somewhere between 'we don't have a clue' to '42' and he admits as much at various points in his published research.What is fascinating - to me, at any rate - is watching the process of his logic unfold as the pages are devoured. I wonder how many readers of this have read publications from, say, the Church of Scientology? I must confess I have not but my given understanding is that there is no way of completely proving or disproving their mantras.This book has set in train a wondrous debate about God, Creation and Natural Selection and in that sense it ranks as a work which although difficult at times to read - Darwin would I'm sure admit to being no literary genius - is worth reading simply to discover for yourself what all the fuss is about.I think it's important to read historical reports of the aftermath of the publication of the first edition of this book.

LeRon Shults in his brilliant book Reforming Theological Anthropology (p. 207). I've owned The Origin of Species for nearly 10 years now but never actually read it: or hardly cracked it open. I did spend a lot of time trying to DISprove what I had not read though - which really got me nowhere. I'll be preaching on ideas of creation and evolution at our church in Brooklyn, and decided that instead of just giving second-hand quotes from the book without reading it, why not read it? I'm glad that I did.Darwin's most well-known book was really virtually nothing like I had expected that it would be, and I found that I really enjoyed it: and for the most part thought that he made excellent points. At no point did I ever see him trying to disprove God in any way - he simply spoke against \\"the common idea of creation\\" (pp. 66-67, 113, 171, 223, 379, 382, 384, 392, 415-417, 458, et. al) which he seemed to take as meaning \`all things were created as they are today with no room for mutability' or something along those lines. In fact at several points he even seemed concerned that we not mock God/the Creator. On page 201 Darwin states, \\"To admit this view is, as it seems to me, to reject a real for an unreal, or at least for an unknown, cause. It makes the works of God a mere mockery and deception; I would almost as soon believe with the old an ignorant cosmogonists, that fossil shells had never lived, but had been created in stone so as to mock the shells now living on the sea-shore.\\"Darwin very systematically looks at a number of objections and problems to his theories - for example:\\"To suppose that the eye, with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree.\\" p.217\\"If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not have possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find no such case...\\" p.219\\"If it could be proved and any part of the structure of any one species had been formed for the exclusive good of another species, it would annihilate my theory, for such could not have been produced through natural selection.\\" p.228-229\\"Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain; and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and gravest objection which can be urged against my theory. The explanation lies, as I believe, in the extreme imperfection of the geological record.\\" p.292\\"If numerous species, belonging to the same genera or families, have really started into life all at once, the fact would be fatal to the theory of descent with slow modification through natural selection.\\" p.309It is important to note, however, that after each of these possible explanations Darwin gives credible thoughts as to how these (and other objections) could be overcome. He often \\"freely admits\\" that not all will believe his theory based off of his arguments, and I find that the general tenor of the book is humble: at times a little too apologetic (in the \\"I'm sorry for this\\" sense) as he often states that [putting all the details here would be impossible]. I'm actually thankful for that as at times the book became frightfully boring as he listed fact after fact about different species/varieties of creatures. Don't get me wrong though: there were many shining moments of interest as I read. For example the section on ants (p.243ff), the bit about the seeds in the mud that he studied (p.374ff) and the section on the metamorphosis of the cirripedes which I found to be stunningly interesting (p.420ff).Darwin's tremendous volume of study is clear throughout the book: the ease that he demonstrates in switching his focus from animal to animal and issue to issue was extraordinary - it would be fantastic to actually meet him and watch his mind work.I think that Darwin's most significant contribution in the book overall is showing just how dependant the entire world is on each other - I think that we could all learn a lot from this very true concept. On page 125 he states, \\"Hence it is quite credible that the presence of a feline animal in large numbers in a district might determine, through the intervention first of mice and then of bees, the frequency of certain flowers in that district\\" just to name one such instance of interdependence.Another sort of \`theme' that emerges in the book is Darwin's need for an actual explanation of why things are the way they are (pp.67, 399, 415-417, et. al.). He's not happy to just say \\"such and such was created thus\\" - he want to know WHY they are the way that they are. The Bible (both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament) are really never interested in the \\"why\\" or \\"how\\" of creation - only that ultimately God was responsible. With this pointed out, I can confidently say that nothing in \\"The Origin of Species\\" contradicts anything that's in the bible to any sort of severe degree, outside of staunch strict literalism, which the Biblical texts by no means demand.I would certainly recommend this book to anyone interested in reading about the core of the ideas that have become so prevalent in today's world. I'll end my review with one last quote, which is what Darwin states at the very end of the book (pp.459-460):\\"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixes law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\\""},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"I had read The Voyage of the Beagle first. It is easy to see how Darwin's theory of evolution was growing as he traveled and saw how plants and animals adapted to different environments. Then he invented a theory to explain what he had observed.This book is a 300 page definition of the theory of natural selection. Darwin goes through a detailed explanation of how evolution must have occured. He is very methodically, very detailed. When he doesn't understand something, he says he doesn't. He is humble in his presentation, giving credit to other scientists. I was amazed at how many experiments he performed himself, growing generations of plants and insects, watching how they developed and changed.There is a quote in the book from Darwin's gardener who said, \\"He's really a sad little man. Sometimes he stands and stares at a flower for hours. I really think he'd be better off if he had something to do.\\"We are so lucky that Darwin inherited money and could spend his early years traveling and his later years in contemplation and writing."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"Even if one doesn't accept the concept and theory one should read this.

There are books that are arguably more influential, but they do not, by-and-large, contribute to our understanding of the physical world. There are books with greater factual content which has been less revised in the light of new knowledge, but it is hard to think of one quite as influential. Darwin, after a decades-long process of formulation, research and self-doubt, with this book both established the theoretical framework that turns natural history into a science and identified humanity's place in that framework. The effect has been profound.I must admit, I found Darwin's prose harder to follow than I had expected. Victorian prose tended to circumlocution, and Darwin for this reason was for me less readable than either modern protagonists of scientific theory or the philosophes of the Enlightenment. This was a pity, and detracted somewhat from the pleasure of reading such a profound work. For crystal clarity of explanation I would choose Dawkins. For gravity and historical impact, one has to read Darwin.Stylistic niggle aside, it is striking how much Darwin got right at a time of limited knowledge and means, and sometimes even more illuminating what he got wrong, or did not know. The greatest lacuna in his rather encyclopaedic knowledge of nature concerned the rules of variation and development. These are a continuing triumph in science and their effect has been to confirm and complete Darwin's own triumphs. Darwin was not aware of the rules of Mendelian inheritance. He was, therefore, forced to fish in the dark for an understanding of how variation arises and re-emerges over generations. The synthesis of this understanding, when it was widely realised, reinforce natural selection and turn it into a true, mathematical, science discipline. Darwin believed in the inheritance of acquired characteristics. We now do not, except in the limited technical sense of epigenetics, but this, along with the plasticity provided by the principles of use and disuse, merely strengthens natural selection.When he gets it \\"right\\", as defined by our present understanding, Darwin is even stronger. On homology and biogeography his case is simply compelling. He backs up his arguments about the movement of species with case after carefully-tested case regarding the survival of seeds in salt-water, the presence off-shore of flying insects, the movement of eggs and earth on birds' feet and so forth. It has been said that Darwin's unique notoriety in a period when evolution was emerging all around him and was formulated independently by another, Wallace, is due to his discipline and patience in gathering and documenting evidence. I have to agree. He is the quintessential scientist.Had Darwin never lived, natural selection would have been known before the end of the Century regardless. We owe to Darwin that it became a true science and that it stood so early on such strong foundations."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"The Origin of Species: On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for LifeThis is an excellent ebook.

I say least understood, because Darwin advances several theories (all relating to) evolution. It is a fascinating read, and a marvelous experience to &quot;peek&quot; into the mind of a genius.First, Darwin's theories are about natural selection, adaptation, extinction, species variation, and significantly, a common ancestor - all of which are a part of the bigger picture, that all life has evolved and is continuing to evolve. His evidence is overwhelming (it had to be in order to advance such radical ideas) and, for lack of a better word, brilliant.Much has been made about religion and evolution - which is why I mentioned that his theories are not well understood. At no point is God (or a Supreme Being, or whatever you want to call it) mentioned, let alone removed from Darwin's theory (regardless of how you feel about the matter.) Yet it is these theories that have laid the ground work for entire disciplines of science, and which has revolutionized science as a whole.With that said, the book tends to beat the points to death a bit. (Again, understandable given the magnitude of the ideas), but the lay reader can get a good flavor of the arguments, and the evidence about a third of the way through.

Read you Darwin"},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"Enthusiastic readers approaching Darwin's revolutionary book often find themselves sorely disappointed. They expect a great existential debate on the origin of Man and instead they get arguments on why this or that tree produces fruit with a fuzzy skin.The reader who perseveres however will find a beautifully argued hypothesis explaining why the living things we find now in nature are both so similar to one another and so different from one another. Darwin explains why there are species of plants, trees, flowers, and ferns; why there are species of animals, insects, and pigeons; and why species can be classified into groups of similar but distinct species of cabbages or ants or primates.The book is superbly organized as \\"one long argument\\", to quote Darwin's own description of his work, and the first four chapters deserve to be singled out.It opens by examining variations under domestication. Darwin presents species we know very well have been modified consciously over time. Pigeon breeding had been a rich man's hobby for centuries and Darwin had copious data to cull. And while Darwin certainly was a rich gentleman, he was no snob when it came to appreciating expertise: he enthusiastically corresponded, discussed, and chatted with horse trainers, cattle breeders, and fruit farmers.The second chapter presents examples of variation in nature. Important ideas Darwin describes include a) that while human breeders act on this or that feature of an organism, nature always acts on the entire organism all at once and b) while man works a breed for a few decades or centuries, nature works on all species for millions of years.The third chapter explains that the natural environment is not a paradise or an Eden, but rather that it is a harsh competitive place where every organism must struggle to survive.The fourth chapter finally describes Darwin's theory of natural selection contrasted to Man's artificial selection. The theory of course is absurdly simple. Children (plants or animals) are very slightly different from their parents. Parents have more children than can possibly survive. Children who are slightly stronger and faster will have a slightly better chance of surviving and having their own children. As this process happens over millions of years and with billions of individuals, the differences accumulate into the diveristy of species we have today.This simple theory has far reaching consequences. Darwin devotes a whole chapter to these Laws of Variation and then several chapters to anticipate objections to his theory. It is in the first of these chapters, brilliantly but humbly titled \\"Difficulties On Theory\\" that Darwin shines brightest.For instance he freely admits that it seems absurd that an organ as perfect as the eye can have developed without an agent to design it. But Darwin points out that we have species where the eye is a single nerve cell that detects the presence or absence of light and nothing more. We have species that have bundles of nerve cells coated with pigments that detect different colors and amounts of light. We have insects with faceted eyes that also begin to discern shape.In short in nature today, we can find a series of species all possessing the same organ but each possessing a different grade of that organ ranging from rudimentary to extreme perfection. If these insensible gradations all are found today, it requires no great leap of the imagination to see they could have accumulated over time as well.Finally Darwin is a humble man but without false modesty. He is justifiably proud of his insights and the care with which he has researched his evidence. He is also conscious of his ignorance. He doesn't presume to discuss the origin of life and he says so explicitly. (Though we've found out quite a bit more about that since his day!) His book is filled with statements that if true would ruin his theory. He is a scientist who understands he must supply criteria against which his ideas are to be tested, and his theory on the origins of species by means of natural selection has passed these tests with flying colors.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"Darwin, C. R. 1859. On the origin of species by means of natural selection, or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life. London: John Murray. 1st edition, 1st issue.How does one write a review of the Origin, that most influential of scientific books? Darwin's peers reviewed him critically and in great length according to the traditions and beliefs of the day. Yet a modern person inevitably reads the book influenced by their knowledge of the theory's great and lasting impact on science and culture. Likewise, a modern biologist would recognize the gaps and errors in Darwin's incomplete theory. Instead of evaluating its cultural impact or scientific value I will focus on its actual written style and argumentative structure. Was his argument logical? Was it \\"good science\\"?Chapter one examines a practice already well-known to the English: artificial selection by breeding, or domestication. Horticulturalists and animal breeders already knew much about selection of variations through generations of practice. Darwin speculates on the scientific causes of variation, but concluded that not enough was known about the principles of inheritance to address the issue. Instead he focused on what he did know - only inherited variations come into play in selection. By taking up the study of pigeons, Darwin learned firsthand the art of animal breeding. By establishing himself as a pigeon expert, Darwin is trying to legitimize his claim as a zoologist and one who intimately understands breeding and domestication. His claim appears to work; at least has convinced me of his authority on the subject, and I'm sure many contemporary readers. By describing the accepted idea of artificial selection in detail, Darwin creates an analogy between it and his revolutionary idea of natural selection to enable the reader to grasp the concept more readily.In chapters three and four Darwin introduces natural selection. He posits that natural selection acts on the same principles as artificial selection, but on a broader scale with no intelligent agent guiding it. Nature is a Malthusian struggle for existence - Darwin illustrates this by describing the geometrical increase that would result from unhindered reproduction. Many living organisms produce far more offspring than their environment could actually support, leading to a fierce competition for resources. Nature consists of checks and complicated relationships between species in order to preserve this precarious balance. If species are being naturally selected for fitness in this savage environment minute by minute over a vast time, it could explain the immense number of different species we observe in nature.Darwin details his mechanism of natural selection by listing the conditions in which it would work faster or slower, including intercrossing, isolated populations, and number of individuals. The means of natural selection is to a large degree sexual selection, by which species choose the fittest mates and pass down successful inherited qualities. Natural selection may even cause a species to become extinct if it is not able to compete with other species. Trying to portray natural selection as an unfeeling force of nature, Darwin was not hesitant to describe the savage ways that species compete with each other, including parasites.In chapter six Darwin addresses possible objections to his theory, as should any well structured argument. For example, according to natural selection, we should see such a progression of species showing every step of modification between two related but divergent species. Yet we do not see such species in nature - Darwin concludes that they probably went extinct, since natural selection would favor extremes so that species would not occupy the same niche. Only in the fossil record may we find such intermediary species, and the fossil record will always be incomplete. One popular argument against natural selection both then and now is the \\"organs of extreme perfection\\" argument, of which the eye is the most popular example. How could the eye, an organ so perfectly adapted to perceive light, have evolved by random variation? Darwin answers this objection by recounting observations of eyes in crustaceans, which are presumably relics of mammalian evolution. He observes that the crustacean eye is a less developed, less sophisticated version of the mammalian eye and thus can illuminate the transitory steps that resulted from random variation over the ages to result in the perfected eye. Darwin also points out that not all animal organs are perfectly suited to their task. What about the peculiarity of humans in that all food must pass over the trachea, leading to possible risk of infection if food enters the lungs? The glottis seems like a stopgap, an imperfect measure to ensure that this does not normally happen. That such evolutionary maladaptations exist points to a lack of an intelligent design.In his conclusion, Darwin agrees that there are holes in his theory and aspects which could be better explained. After all, his Origins is just an abstract of the real book that he hoped to publish. Yet on the whole, he is convinced that the evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of natural selection. His argument is logical, and according to the Whewellian model of inductive reasoning he has gathered a bewildering array of observations from nature to examples to support his hypothesis. At a time when hypothesizing was not considered \\"good science\\", Darwin still submitted his broad theory because he realized it explained many observations in many different fields of science. Even now, his theory explains scientific findings that Darwin could never have dreamed of. Such is the legacy of true \\"good science\\"."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"Darwin's _Origin of Species_ is a phenomenal work and was truly brilliant and insightful at the time.

I laugh when I see them claim that more and more scientists are rejecting evolution. Such claims are a blatant lie. Go to a university library and spend and afternoon browsing the science journals.

This way of describing the evolution of organisms on earth has by now become the standard and, in fact, one hardly ever thinks of evolution without automatically connecting it with Darwin's ideas.At first, upon commencing reading this small book, I continued to ask \`where is the evidence for that' but on realising that he had gathered a large volume of data to support this theory I simply continued to read on. Its not either an easy read or that complicated. Darwin looks at evolution in a very comprehensive way: first, linking the main idea with the variation of animals under domestication, something he himself had extensively studied in the case of pidgeons; second, associating this with variation under nature and the struggle for existence; he then goes on to describe in detail natural selection and the laws of variation. He follows this like any good scientist by an analysis of what may be the theory's weaknesses, such as the scarcity in the geological record and the lack of organisms in a state of gradation. He then applies the ideas to instinct, hybridism and then discusses in great depth the imperfections of the geological record. He also considers how geographical distribution can alter the results of evolution and how the embryos of various animals have a resemblance to that of other animals and how they also appear to repeat previous evolutionary steps as they mature.Its too bad the 20 volume set was never published, even the incomplete version would have been better than only the abstract. Nonetheless it is well discussed and written as a comprehensive summary of the main thesis. At times the style can be repetitive and even dull but this is compensated for by fascinating little excerpts which are present throughout. This was, remarkably enough, my first reading of &quot;The Origin of Species&quot; and I do believe that every practicing scientist should read it as part of their education rather than accepting its tenets without question as is the wont. However rather than being a description of the true origin of species, it actually takes a change which occurs (by whatever means) and then describes the process the species undergoes from then on. Darwin never actually said anything about how new variations are formed, this was left for others to consider and eventually led to the modern Darwinian thesis including the idea of mutation caused by radiation, viruses or chemical agents. Much has also come to light over the last century such as the symbiosis of organisms producing the merger of cell and mitochondria seen in every cell today and similarly the recent evidence of gene swapping going on between bacteria and now also larger organisms, see &quot;Lamarck's Signature&quot; by Ted Steele. Since Darwin did also not explain form but rather the possibility of how form came about Brian Goodwin's Form and Transformation is a good place to start.It must also be remembered that in his time the thesis was new even if many others were working on similar ideas Darwin was the first, in conjunction with Wallace, to expand on natural selection and obtain strong evidence for it.

This book details Darwin's Laws of Biological Variation and Natural Selection but it is not about &quot;evolution&quot; (as it might be defined outside of this).

Darwin comes across not only clever and articulate in his scientific observations but also honest as to the limitations of his work. I found his depth of understanding and discussion of his theory as well as his willingness to mention and discuss its difficulties (some proposed by well known contemporaries) to be impressive and sincere, &quot;...and this objection, as urged by Sir William Thompson (who later became Lord Kelvin), is probably one of the gravest as yet advanced&quot; (p. 620). Darwin also mentions another concern in regard to the lack of geological evidence in support of his theory of Natural Selection, &quot;[geological research] does not reveal the infinitely many fine gradations between past and present species required on the theory&quot; (p. 617).This book in no way induced a reduction in my own Christian faith nor did it lead me to question my belief in God, as I believe Darwin himself would have understood when he said &quot;I see no good reason why the views given in this volume should shock the religious feelings of any one.&quot; (p. 638). It would even seem that a fundamental belief of Charles Darwin emerges at the end of his work~ when he states, &quot;There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one.&quot; (p. 649).This book, in part, addresses the biological concept of how out of a few species can come many but this should not be confused with the concept that out of nothingness came"},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"Of course this is one of the landmark books in history.

Having to look from the outside without the knowledge of DNA or Plate Tectonics, he pretty much nailed how the environment and crossbreeding would have an effect on natural selection. Speaking of natural selection, I thought his was going to be some great insight to a new concept. All it means is that species are not being mucked around by man (artificial selection).If you picked up Time magazine today you would find all the things that Charles said would be near impossible to find or do. Yet he predicted that it is doable in theory. With an imperfect geological record many things he was not able to find at the writing of this book have been found (according to the possibilities described in the book.)The only draw back to the book was his constant apologizing.

Before he published The Origin of Species in 1859, biology was a collection of unrelated facts, much like the state of chemistry before the periodic chart of the elements was worked out. After its publication, biology became a systematic science with a unifying theory.To learn more about how Darwin's groundbreaking work led to the amazing growth of biological knowledge in the fourteen decades since its publication, I recommend that you also read British geneticist Steve Jones' new book Darwin's Ghost: The Origin of Species Updated."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"It took 277 years for the Church to accept that the universe did not revolve around the Earth, from the publication of Copernicus' 'On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres' in 1543 to the Vatican's total repeal of the condemnation of the Copernican doctrine in the period 1820 to 1835. If that's anything to go by as far as the speed with which the Church accepts new truths about the universe, none of us will be around to see the day Darwin is vindicated as one of humanity's guiding lights, as opposed to the Son of Satan. Seldom in history has such a noble person been subjected to such vilification. It reminds one of the ridicule once heaped on supporters of the Copernican theory, and their disbelieving mockery - how could the Earth possibly revolve without the people flying off? Today we all can only laugh at their ignorance, but only some of us can laugh at the ignorance of those 'Flat-Earthers' who still disregard Darwin's theory. Like many have already pointed out, much of the material that fuels the evolution debate is not to be found in this book. There are no claims or even insinuations in the book of descent from apes. Rather, it was disciples like Huxley who really helped focus the debate on man's primate anscestry, and Darwin was far more direct in his beliefs in his later books such as 'The Descent of Man' and 'The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals', both of which are worth reading as they bolster his theory in countless ways, always combining a penetrating natural observation with intelligent analysis. In fact, I must admit to enjoying them even more than this book, although of course as Darwin's classic, it's a must read for anyone interested in man's evolution, and no open-minded person could possibly remain unconvinced after going through Darwin's evidence and arguments against spontaneous creation. (Creationists still believe that God came down to Earth in 19th century industrial revolution England to create the darker moths which started appearing as the trees gradually darkened from pollution, kindly making sure they did not stick out like sore thumbs on the blackened trees anymore...)"},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"It is a crying shame that many reviewers have used this forum to try and critique evolutionary theory, making no references to the text at all and drawing on erroneous conclusions about Darwin in general. The Origin of Species is most definitely the most important work in the field of biology, as it is the most succinct and well developed explanations of the unifying principle of the field, evolution via descent with modification. I don't want to spend a lot of time explaining the theory or why a person should study it. I want to explain who should read this book and why. If you are looking for an introductory text on the theory of evolution you need to stay well away. There are other better books. In many cases Darwin's examples and arguments are outmoded or have been changed. The book overlooks many aspects that are included in modern evolutionary theory, such as genetics, simply because Darwin did not know about them. Natural selection as Darwin wrote it is one of the most effective explanatory theories in all of science but by reading this book you miss almost 150 years of the things it has explained. It is also a flat out PAIN to read, they where much \\"wordier\\" in the 1800's and Darwin's English is rather stilted and formal, even compared to modern scientific writing. So, who should read this book? Any person who is an advanced student in biology (I read it the summer before my senior year) should be aware of how the modern theory of evolution was born. You can't really achieve this without reading Origins. I am aware of no better way of understanding evolution that to follow its development through time, beginning with Darwin. And, if you don't understand evolution, you don't understand biology. As something to read it is a classic, arguably the most influential work of all time.A note on edition: this copy is the one I have. I would suggest the facsimile of the First Edition found elsewhere on Amazon. I don't know why the publishers felt the need to put the caricatured human evolution (addressed nowhere in the book) on the cover."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"Perhaps the most influential work ever written, and a shining beacon of modern scientific thought. This book is the much needed breath of air the scientific world needed after millennia of religious (unscientific and assumable) oppression. The work, shines on many points, and dulls on others, but, keeping in mind the time it was written, it does not deserve a lesser rating. I will here give my impression on what was \\"hot and not\\" about this volume;Positive-Despite many who would disagree, the book is eloquently written. It is a very enjoyable read. It does, I admit, get a tad dry and repetitive at times, but keep in mind that this is a scientific volume -- it is not entertainment. Also, it was written 150 years ago, and the rules of grammar and language would of-course differ from today's.-The book is truly scientific; it does not make blind assumptions, but backs up it's theories with facts. It is the burden of the proposer to back up his claim, therefore, claims that Evolution is false and volumes of energy are wasted just to defend it is erroneous.-And, of-course, the book lacks a-lot of the modern principles discovered regarding evolution since its publication. However, there is no need to rate it down just because of age. I don't see Dickens being rated down because 19th century London exists, now, only in books. As far as a scientific work, however, it lacks in this department.Negative- It is outdated, so it should not be completely trusted as a source of valid information. Don't misinterpret me: most concepts are correct, however, details are often erroneous and not up to date. This book should NOT be used as a source of serious arguments for or against evolution, with few exceptions and examples.- The language may tire and bore some modern readers.The last comment I have is for readers who are very vexed by this book and choose to bash it publicly and claim its error in, well, almost everything. Those are usually Religious readers who are opposed to any mention of evolution for obvious reasons. I am an open atheist, I won't deny it, and, everyone on this earth has a right to their own opinion. However, bashing a work purely based on instilled hate for science is NOT helpful to the community which reads these reviews. First, if the book was so erroneous and \\"laughable\\" in its propositions, Religious folk wouldn't have felt so threatened by it as to post 3 page reviews full of angry remarks. An evolutionist/secularist/atheist is not someone who knows too little about religion or is ignorant -- it is someone who knows too much. Religion assumes, and, the bible was written for political purposes -- if you are a truly educated Creationist you would have at least an idea of what I claim here. Therefore, people who ONLY read the bible and use it as an example do not hold any water to their claims. The bible has no authority with many cultures on this earth. Science, however, can have authority with everybody, because it proves its points with facts. The angry theist reviewers, here, are as gullible as a child. I did not read Darwin's work and become an \\"instant believer\\" in evolution; I had to read several books and weigh the evidence. Another excellent work is \\"What Evolution Is\\" by Earnst Mayr.Comments I was really vexed by:- Darwin was an atheist -- most theist posts claim this in one version or another. He was not an atheist, and, even though his underlying intentions will never be clear, he was openly a theist. Throughout the book he mentions the \\"creator\\" as the \\"breather of life\\" on earth. The last sentence in the book is truly beautiful, and disproves the atheist claim.- The fossil record refutes evolution; maybe so today, but I am convinced this is erroneous; the evolutionary link to the lineage of birds from dinosaurs (Mayr 2001) was only a proposition supported by Darwin and many evolutionists, quite blindly. Why? No \\"Intermediate\\" between dinosaur and bird was found, and therefore, theists had a field day bashing evolutionists. However, the Archaeopteryx was discovered in due time. I believe that it is due to the vastness of the fossil record and its unimaginable distribution and randomness that these \\"gaps\\" exist. I believe the future will surprise evolutionists quite pleasantly.-Posts which include remarks such as \\"Yes, there is a God, and he is not you, Dr. Ego Monkeyshines.\\" are clearly the futile attempts of an uneducated theist at disproving evolution. Having no facts, of-course, he must resort to name-calling when all else has been expired. I urge you to read that post, and, if possible point to one fact that supports his claim. He claims we should be \\"REAL\\" scientists and investigate for ourselves -- well, most of us are, and we have simply concluded that Darwin puts forth amazing proof of evolution. This is only a very accusatory rant by yet another disappointed theist who just saw a huge chunk of Bible validity being crushed by a genius of scientific advancement. Religion and science do NOT mix; one is based on assumptions, the other on facts. I very much find it interesting that many people here compare \\"Origin\\" to the Bible -- in a way it is; it is the modern bible. It simply replaces or updates, if you will, the ideas of the bible. The bible can be viewed as a very outdated theory on the world -- one that predates science and explains everything without the need of thought -- it's all simply magic (god). The \\"Origin\\" updates it, and goes on to explain the magic of God as scientific laws. Which sadly for many, does contradict the bible.- A reviewer commented that the full title of the book was concealed by Amazon with shady purposes to cover up the book's \\"racism.\\" I particularly love the claim that Darwin was a racist. The reviewer claims that Darwin displayed racist remarks towards black people in his book, favoring races and saying Africans were inferior; where in the book, dear reviewer, did you see any mention of Africans, and, overall humanity? Darwin makes VERY little reference to humans in the \\"Origin,\\" perhaps you'd be interested in \\"Origin of Man\\" (Descent of Man). \\"Preservation of favored Races\\" refers to the animal \\"races\\" or, more modernly, types/varieties/breeds. This erroneous claim is baseless, because the word \\"races\\" was used with a different meaning in \\"Origin\\", and again, take into account that the book is 150 years old -- grammar rules and interpretations change. I remember Darwin using the word \\"Gay\\" to refer to his happiness in a discovery of some sort; the same reviewer could probably claim Darwin himself was homosexual based on this remark.And, finally, this book *proves* nothing. This book, or almost any other I have read regarding Science/Evolution/Religion proves NOTHING. They just claim, and defend, either successfully or unsuccessfully, and with variable effectiveness. Before you bash me as a hot-headed atheist, consider this; I don't believe in Darwinism completely, I don't even believe in the complete validity of the modern evolutionary synthesis either; I just treat religion and science (The bible and \\"Origin\\") as two very rightful, and respectful claims of explanation for a common problem; I only defend \\"Origin\\" because, although it doesn't prove evolution, it certainly puts forth many more valid, scientific, and truly unbiased facts for its existence, than the bible puts forth for the existence of god and his version of the operations of our world-- in fact, it puts forth NONE, it assumes the reader will trust it unquestioningly as an undisputable authority. Mr. Darwin, has successfully disputed it, willingly, or unwillingly, and uses Nature as HIS authority of choice.All you have to do is read it for yourself, and make your own decision as to the validity of his claims. However, do keep an open mind, do not embark on reading this work with a frown on your face and an eager exaltedness to ridicule and dispute its content. It is a beautiful work of unbiased and honest truths (mostly), and is a rather enjoyable and informative read to the curious and open-minded reader."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"To begin with, a note on the edition. This Barnes & Noble Classics series version is based on the first edition of The Origin of Species, which is actually nice for a couple of reasons. First, it allows the reader to experience the book as it originally appeared. This is not only interesting historically, but a nearly unmitigated virtue because of the second reason: The core content of the book remained essentially the same throughout the later revisions Darwin made in his lifetime, but such changes as he did make were for the most part unnecessary or even (in retrospect) unfortunate--mainly minor concessions to skeptics (religious and otherwise) and to the Lamarckian theory of evolution (as opposed to natural selection as the basic mechanism driving evolutionary change).That said, there are several things to say about the book itself. First, it is extremely readable. Modern audiences (especially those educated in the American government schools, which almost certainly failed to introduce them to this material) might be intimidated by the prospect of tackling a somewhat technical scientific volume of this size written a century and a half ago. Those who attempt it, however, will be pleasantly surprised to find that Darwin's presentation is extremely clear and intelligible, at times even beautiful. This admirable writing style is in large part due to his scientific method, which leads me to the book's next great virtue.Darwin's approach is primarily inductive--that is, he was not some armchair philosopher abstractly theorizing off in an ivory tower somewhere, as one might suspect from the photograph of him as a bearded old man with which we are usually presented. In other words, evolution is not \\"just a theory,\\" precisely because Darwin was not just a theorist. Rather, Darwin gathered massive amounts of evidence on his Beagle voyage, and continued to accumulate ever more (with the help of his scientific colleagues in various related disciplines) for decades before he felt ready to publish his theory (and he still felt rushed into it). (Indeed, for anyone interested in the philosophy of science, or in epistemology in general, On the Origin of Species should be the textbook case of scientific induction.) Darwin then presents all of this evidence to us piece by piece, building up his case from the ground, as it were, and in effect recreating his own line of thinking for his reader making it incredibly easy to follow his case. Which brings us to the third point.What kinds of evidence does Darwin draw on? Intriguingly, Darwin did not begin his career as a biologist aiming to solve the species question. He boarded the Beagle as a brilliant amateur natural scientist generally with an inclination toward geology. Perhaps this is why he was able to draw so widely on various fields in making his case for evolution when that question did become his main interest. From Lyell's theories and his own geological observations, Darwin concluded that the period of time available actually allowed for a very (previously unthinkably) slow process of evolution. From this geological perspective, he naturally was able to look at various pieces of evidence more directly bearing on the species question, such as the fossil record and the geographical distribution of species. After the Beagle voyage, he was able to conduct experiments in many other areas (and correspond with colleagues about the results of their experiments), including artificial selection (Darwin's pigeons being the most famous example of this) which became important as an analogy for the process of natural selection; the means of the geographical distribution and isolation of species (including seeing whether seeds can germinate after extended periods of submersion in salt water or passing through the digestive tracts of birds); and even the sex lives of barnacles. All of these experiments are described at some length in The Origin of Species.But Darwin, ever the scientist, was in fact cautious not to overstep the limits of what he could prove. The Origin of Species contains an excellent chapter anticipating and answering possible objections to his theory, and acknowledging its shortcomings. For instance, Darwin acknowledges that the fossil record at the time did not tend to show gradual progression from one species to another, and offers an explanation as to why the fossil record might be so incomplete. He also acknowledges that while he found the evidence for evolution by means of natural selection to be overwhelming, he did not know the actual physical, biological mechanism by which this takes place (as genes had not been discovered and the discipline of genetics created at that time), but he does briefly mention a hypothesis that was actually sort of on the right track. In fact, in all of these weak areas, subsequent history has borne Darwin and his theory out remarkably well.And finally, in addition to being a masterpiece of scientific thought, The Origin of Species is also a work of, at times, almost poetic beauty, and deserves praise for its literary merit. After presenting or indicating all the evidence in a specific area throughout each section, Darwin ends each chapter by summing it up in an eloquent statement naming the general principle to be derived from this vast array of specific evidence, often employing an apt and evocative metaphor. The most famous of these passages is of course the one with which he concludes the book: \\"Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\\"You cannot legitimately consider yourself an educated person if you haven't read this wonderful book, and yet a shockingly small percentage of Americans (including even those who claim to believe in evolution) have read it. But you will find that to do so is not a chore, but one of life's great pleasures."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"\\"Origin of Species\\" differs from most other scientific books or original articles in that it can be understood in its original form by an average person. When Newton wrote his Principia, only a handful of people could understand it. It had math and it was written in Latin. But Darwin's method is the same as Newton's: both developed a theory which \\"explained\\" observation. Neither gave nor claimed to give the final word. Neither is a discussion of ethics, politics, religion. business, etc. It was known to everyone that variation in life existed with some sets of living organisms being more akin to one another than to other sets. Some sub-sets within a given set of organisms were able to interbreed with one another, but not with other members of the set. Darwin attempted to explain how this happened. Science is never \\"true\\" in the sense thatreligion is \\"true\\". Science does not depend upon the authority of individues.The idea that the Pope may pronounce something true and it becomes \\"true\\" is a different definition of the word \\"true\\" than Darwin or Newton or any other scientist saying someing is true--on the one hand the \\"truth\\" exists because of who made the statement, but on the (scientific) hand, the one making the statement is not relevant.Some reviewers have stated that \\"Origin of Species\\" is hard to read. I suppose that is true compared to a novel, but compared to most scientific literature it is a piece of cake. It is about as hard to read as \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" by Adam Smith.Darwin's work, like all science, is based upon the concept that nature is consistent over time. To throw out Origin of Speciesbased upon the idea that God creates inconsistencies now and again to effect this purpose or that mekes no more sense than throwing out Newton, Einstein etc and physics and chemistry as well as biology. No amount of evidence to the contrary convinces those who insist upon God's intervention because it cannot be absolutely disproved. Such views are OK, but they are not science and must not be introduced into science classes."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"It's important to remember that Charles Darwin was born in 1809 and published this book in 1859, almost a century and a half ago. It's also important to remember that &quot;the past is a different place: they do things differently there.&quot;Victorian England believed strongly that northwestern Europeans were the most favored of races, with the English at the pinnacle of favor among Europeans. Darwin grew up in an England that had just defeated Napoleon at Waterloo and was also taking on the direct rule of India as its own special destiny. So it's not surprising that he absorbed the confident young empire's predominant view of the world. Nor is it surprising that the book in which he presents his ground-breaking theory of natural selection also reflects his rather uncritical acceptance of nineteenth-century England's belief in Progress with a capital P and in The White Man's Burden with similar capitalization. Darwin lived in the England of Kipling's India.These beliefs can seem quaint, antiquated and even repulsive to us from our late twentieth-century perch, but they were characteristic of the men of his time, place and education. No doubt our own favorite assumptions about America's natural role in the world will look as odd and misplaced to readers from the mid-2100s, a century and a half in our future.Do we expect Sir Isaac Newton to be a Jeffersonian Democrat or a modern chemist in the mold of Lavoisier? No, of course not. Sir Isaac died in 1727, nearly 50 years before the Declaration of Independence was written, and 16 years before Jefferson and Lavoisier were born in 1743. Not only that, but--as strange as it may seem to us now--Newton's gaze was fixed upon the past, not the future. In this, Sir Isaac was also very much a man of his era.The focus of Newton's research was the experimental and mathematical recovery of knowledge he and his contemporaries thought had been known in ancient times and since lost. In a lifetime spent trying to reconstruct lost wisdom, he managed to create valuable new sciences that had never before been available to humankind. In so doing, he changed the way we think about the world forever. Newton's own laboratory notes seem strange to us today precisely because we live in his intellectual shadow; the same is true of Darwin. The landscape never looks the same after a major earthquake, whether the landscape is physical or intellectual. And both Newton and Darwin launched intellectual earthquakes with the publication of their discoveries.The following comment, taken from the last lecture in Caltech physicist Richard Feynman's 1964 series on &quot;The Character of Physical Law&quot;, vividly describes what it takes to seek new, testable physical [and biological] laws:&quot;...The truth always turns out to be simpler than you thought. What we need is imagination, but imagination in a terrible strait-jacket. We have to find a new view of the world that has to agree with everything that is known, but disagree in its predictions somewhere. . . . And in that disagreement it must agree with nature. If you can find any other view of the world which agrees over the entire range where things have already been observed, but disagrees somewhere else, you have made a great discovery. ...A new idea is extremely difficult to think of. It takes a fantastic imagination.&quot;Newton and Darwin both did this, in spades. They had in common both that fantastic imagination and the incredible discipline it took to put it into Feynman's strait-jacket.As B. J. T. Dobbs shows in her superb study &quot;The Foundations of Newton's Alchemy&quot; (1975), Newton's decades of fine-grained experimental investigation of the claims of alchemy developed both his amazing powers of concentration and the broad range of ideas that he could bring to bear on a problem. The results shook the world for generations after him. Similarly, Darwin's intense focus on a single big question for decades after the Beagle voyage led to an earth-shaking new view of life that still rocks our intellectual world today. This book reports that view and the evidence for it.Like Newton's monumental &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;, Darwin's &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; profoundly changed the way we see the world. The &quot;Principia&quot;, with its infinitesimal numbers, its invisible forces and its gravitation, took generations to achieve widespread acceptance, even as it revolutionized the study of physics. Similarly, evolution by natural selection as presented in the &quot;Origin&quot; has completely reoriented the study of living creatures, and it too is taking generations to achieve widespread acceptance. This, too, is not surprising.However, unlike the original English-language edition of the &quot;Principia&quot;, which sports concepts, vocabulary, spelling and capitalization conventions we find difficult and distracting today, the &quot;Origin&quot; is still fairly easy for us to read and appreciate. Our friends in 2139 may not be so lucky. Read it now, while you still can.-dubhghall"},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"Few moments in science change humanity's perception of itself, and presents science with an impetus to guide generations ahead.

The contents of the book are invaluable - priceless gift to humanity. HOW CAN A REVOLUTION BE RATED? It is also my duty to tell you that this book is not for unscientific fundamentalists whose lives are guided by rigid walls of baseless faith, and not an inkling of true science.I shall not be restating the contents of the book. Suffice it to mention that any lay person without the knowledge of current scientific advances in biology should completely agree with the deductions of Darwin. I will however, mention this. No more is evolution a 'theory'. It is a fact. For proof, the Human Genome Project has been completed, as have the genomes of several plants and animals sequenced. Just compare them. And you'll find the truth for yourself. Here are some facts for fundamentalists to chew: a human embryo is almost identical to that of a fish; the genetic code of a bacterium is identical to that of human, and every other species on this planet; and by the way, the basic constituents of DNA of every living species on the planet is the same!!!!! So, stop advancing anti-scientific and pseudoscientific nonsense in place of evolution. That is balderdash!Now, for the open-minded and/or the scientific, I have a request for you. Once you finish reading the book, sit down and think about this - in hindsight, without knowledge even of the basics of genetics and without the aid of scientific advancements we know today, a man, through sheer observation and deduction, proposed the 'theory' of evolution - which has virtually all the sciences to back it up.

Of course the book being 150 years old there are some shortcomings, especially focussed around Darwin's lack of knowledge of the mechanisms invoklved in inheritance (genes).

At the time, this flew in the face of accepted theories, and especially upset current theological doctrine, Archbishop Ussher would be particularly upset!.Darwin agonised for years over the publication of his book, and it was only at the urging of his friends (that he was about to be upstaged by Wallace) that he finally published. The delay was of his own making - torn between the evidence of his notes and correspondence with Wallace, and the furore that would inevitably result. The furore was bound to happen anyway, surrounded as he was by small-minded [people], so he should have published earlier. But ... this might have deprived us of the brilliant arguments he puts forth in support of each section in the book.He obviously knew what he was up against, so he tried to present his case as lucidly as possible - and here's the unusual aspect of the work - in layman's language! This was almost unheard of in a Victorian Scientific treatise - they were meant to be read by Scientists, not the hoy-poloy! He tries to counter every conceivable objection to each statement, as nicely (in both senses of the word) as possible, without any of the fervour and tunnel vision that one expects from a convert to a new ideal. He takes us by the hand and gently walks us through the evidence in support of his theory, helping us to realise that, yes, he is talking sense, no matter what our pre-conceptions of life might be.Discover for yourself that evolution is not 'survival of the fittest', but 'survival of the most fit' - that is, fitted for that particular ecological niche - fittest being a Victorian word that has taken a different modern meaning.An amazingly good read, even for our enlightened times, but recommended reading - I'll bet there are hundereds of copies on dusty bookshelves that have never been read - time to dust it off and find out for yourself the genius of the man."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"It's really amazing how polarized people's opinions of this book are!

I would often be lost or have to read something many times in an effort to understand it. I also have been told this many of the ideas expressed in it are no longer valid in modern evolutionary theory. The book was written over a hundred years ago, so this is to be expected. Still, the book has much value. Many times as I found myself wondering what Darwin was talking about, I would suddenly have a wave of comprehension and feel very vindicated. All I'm saying is, don't give up on the book. As soon as you start to think it is not worth your time to read it, it will be. That was my experience, at least.

Additionally points previously made in the book are repeated throughout the book way to much. For those wanting to read the book for historical reasons its great and gives some insight into the times of its writing. For those wanting to learn natural selection for the first time stick with some modern book. I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't so difficult to read."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"Required reading for any serious biologist. This is the theory from the man himself. Also valuable for understanding evolution in a historical sense. Darwin got some things wrong, but, in my reading of this (which I have done many times over), I am struck by the brilliance of a man who figured all this out in the absence of understanding the genetic mechanism of inheritance. I think Darwin is one of the great minds of western civilization, on a par with Newton, and he deserves FAR more respect than he is given today.For all the stir this book caused, for all the stir Darwin's legacy continues to stir today, I am always struck by his modesty and dedication to the principles of scientific endeavor. He seems such a quiet man to have revolutionized everything we know and understand about life."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"I figured while I was on my evolution book kick, I might as well go back to the original (well sort of the original, Alfred Russel Wallace published a paper on natural selection which prompted Darwin to publish this \\"abstract\\"). Now that I'm finished I feel two different ways about the book, a loved yet bored type of feeling. First I'm amazed at just how much of Darwin's theories and ideas are accurate and accepted even today 150 years later (which is a pretty darn long time in science). One thing you have to appreciate about this book is that its pretty evident that Darwin didn't just rush out and publish this theories but thought about every possible question everyone could have and he attempts to answer them all. Another question he spends a lot of time on is how flora could make it to islands, he goes through page after page of experiments trying to see how long seeds can stay in salt water and still germinate. Even better way back 150 years ago Darwin already anticipated the irreducible complexity argument of the eye and proposed his own ideas about how the eye could evolve and how each gradation is useful in itself. Some times the prose was pretty amazing, I think the famous line about \\"There is grandeur in this view of life.....\\" is one of my favorites in any book I've read.So as amazing as some parts where why then did I rate it 3 stars? Well for every amazing part there are page after page of material which is (to me) just plain boring. The prose which is great in sections is pretty tedious in other parts. The fact that he thought of every question means that he goes over proof after proof. Remember the salt water and the seeds mentioned above, well its cool at first but 40 pages of his experiments makes me start to care less and less. There were also a few parts which he got wrong, he spends a whole section trying to figure out why certain animals can't cross breed, something which is quickly addressed now days with DNA. I think at another part he denies that there ever were any mass extinctions (something we know happened several times in the earth's history). Another thing which made the book a little harder for me is Darwin mentions lots of people and animals I've never heard of, of course a better reader would have spend time looking them up but I just read on, I guess I didn't care enough to do that much research for the book.So overall for importance I'd rate this book a 5/5, but I have to factor in enjoyment and I so its gets the lower score. Truthfully this book is 150 years old and written in Victorian English, its very important, but there are better books on evolution out there, so if you're curious about the fascinating world of evolution, start elsewhere, only if you're curious about how the theory got started pick this one up."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"The shockwaves from the publication of this book still resound today. The full title of the book is \\"On the Origin of Species By Means Of Natural Selection or Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life\\" by Charles Darwin and it was first published on November 24th of 1859. The importance of the work was not in the originality of the idea; the idea of evolution had been a theory long before as Darwin discusses in the text, nor was Darwin the only scientist at the time to arrive at the theory, as a paper by Alfred Wallace arrived the same year as Darwin's. What made \\"The Origin of Species\\" so significant was the way Darwin discusses the theory, and that it was not written just for scientists, but for everyone. This makes it a work of Literature as well as one of Science.Another key aspect to \\"The Origin of Species\\" is that it has completely changed the focus of the subject from the point of its publication until now and undoubtedly will do so for some time to come. It is still the dominate point of reference in the argument between those who oppose the theory and those who support it. Those on both sides of the argument (and I use the term argument because the term discussion would lead one to believe that the discourse is much more civil than it actually is) would do well to emulate Darwin in the way he discusses his theory.\\"The Origin of Species\\" in many ways sets the standard for scientific argument. Though again Darwin did not create the standard with this book, the significance of the work and the readability of the book make it stand out as an example of the correct way to present and defend a theory. Of course Darwin presents facts which support his theory, but it is his discussion of problems with the theory which is the strength of the book and his theory. Darwin admits he doesn't have answers to all of the issue, and he offers ways to prove his theory wrong or at least force a significant adjustment to the theory.It is interesting that the issues with Darwin's theory and the methods of proving it wrong are in many ways unchanged. There will always be gaps in the fossil record, and there will probably always be questions of reducibility, but that doesn't mean that there isn't more evidence to support the theory than there ever has been, there is a lot more which has strengthened the theory, and the key point is that there hasn't been any evidence found to disprove the theory. And with regards to species being fixed, the scientific argument has long been over, though one can still find non-scientists who would argue the point.\\"The Origin of Species\\" remains an important work of science and literature today. Understanding Darwin's theory is necessary to understanding the political discussions and ramifications that continue to take place. It also serves as a great guide to understanding what a scientific discussion is and how it works, and by contrast how it differs from a political, social, or theological discussion. It should go without saying that \\"The Origin of Species\\" gets five stars, and the introduction by John Burrow enhances the experience by putting it in the context of Darwin's life, and the times in which it was written and published. I was a little surprised that the Penguin Classics edition didn't include any notes on Darwin's text, but it does include a bibliography of Darwin's works. Also, while the text included is from the first edition of the book, it does include \\"An Historical Sketch\\" and a Glossary which were in later editions."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"This is one of those books you should read.

But Darwin's basic argument makes good sense and can be seen to work in the wild. The argument is that if an animal, a biological system, can exist in an environment, it will do so, and it will multiply as a result of its fitness for that environment. If it cannot, it will die. That's pretty much it. Put a camel in Antarctica and it will die. Put a polar bear in the middle of the desert and it will die. Easy, huh? Over time, those undesirable traits (from a survival standpoint)in a given population will be bred out, either slowly or quickly. They have to be! Otherwise, the species dies! Voila! Evolution theory! They made us read this in Biology 4560, and I'm glad they did. A necessary read for anyone who strives for any modicum of scientific literacy."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"Everyone is aware of the importance of Darwin's 1959 classic science text. Yet, few of the many defenders and detractors of evolution have read it. While certainly out of date and lacking in the loads of modern evidence to back him up, Darwin nevertheless provides the best introduction to evolution by means of natural selection.Darwin goes through nearly every point imaginable, providing the results of years of tests, observations, and study. Each chapter goes on an exhaustive analisys of different topics. I had already read much evolution literature, but I was even more convinced after reading Darwin's well-written thesis. He is unpretentious and modest. Even when the subject gets tedious (he goes into rather extensive details on raising pigions and floating various seeds over water), his good humor is always evident and you know you only have to wait until his next big find is revealed.&quot;The Origin of Species&quot; should be read by anyone claiming to know the origin of mankind. Though often tedious and lacking in modern evidence, this is still science writing at its best. Any layman can understand the principle concepts of evolution through Charles Darwin."},{"Title":"The origin of species by means of natural selection;: Or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life (International science library)","review":"As a news junkie and biology major, I am constantly reminded of the need for people to read and understand this book. Nothing brought this home more harshly and succinctly than when I was watching a debate among Republican presidential candidates and when they were asked if they believed in evolution. The overwhelming majority signified that they did not.Few books have changed the collective human perspective about the role of humans in the universe than this book. In it, Charles Darwin describes in great detail what he had observed and the conclusions he reached. The man was a superb scientist, honestly and carefully going where the data led him, even though he knew how his conclusions would be received.That hostile attitude has not changed, for many people are not swayed by the data and the facts, they know only their emotions. Evidence of evolution is everywhere; Darwin's theories of how species change as expressed in this book have been validated over and over again. The strongest evidence is present in the attempts by humans to beat back organisms that we dislike such as bacteria and weeds. Both have evolved to withstand the chemical assaults in a manner exactly as Darwin described in this book.While the current political climate in the United States will preclude it, the country would be in much better shape if this book were required reading in high school."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra (Import)","review":"This paperback edition published in Spain (in English), edited by Manuel Sanchez, has many very nice color engravings from Roberts, Lewis and Dore, which really add a lot to the reader's enjoyment."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra (Import)","review":"I read this years ago, when I read everything by Washington Irving.

Those have not been updated in years, Gordon Updates his book twice a year. I have met William Gordon and had lunch with him, what a great guy.

Ditto for burial sites (assuming that remains stay put in one place.....unfortunately, that isn't always true as I seem to always be finding out). What is really impressive about the many editions of this book that have been published to date is that the author constantly updates the information in the book, so that it is as accurate as it can be given the odd and fluctuating state of celebrity mindsets (and fortunes).So if you are willing to assume that some of the information may become outdated, you will probably enjoy this book quite a bit."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Hollywood Tour Book (2nd Edition)","review":"When I took an exploratory job trip for two weeks in L.A., I had a copy of the previous edition of &quot;The Ultimate Hollywood Tour Book&quot; and found a lot of cool stuff using this book.
