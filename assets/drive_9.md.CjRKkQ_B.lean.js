He wanders around DC without a clue until he gets dragged on a journey to Rome and Cairo, and gets pulled into some hefty intrigue.Jackie Burke is a windsurfer with a crappy job who suddenly gets hired by the wife of the ill Congressman whose place Wynn takes. Jackie realizes something big is afoot when the investigation she has been hired to undertake gets her apartment broken into and trashed. She meets Wynn and feels an instant attraction and kinship when they go to Rome, though most of their relationship throughout the rest of the book happens over the telephone.Behind all the aforementioned intrigue is financier Pavel Hayek, a billionaire maverick who moved his foreign exchange trading business to Florida from Wall Street. As the author took so much time carefully constructing the plot, it seems unfair to give it away here. Suffice it to say, Hayek is a very bad man with some very big, very bad plans, and it's up to Wynn and Jackie to figure out what they are and stop him.Once things got moving, it was a fairly compelling read. It was hard to get a fix on Wynn's character, aside from the fact that he had a painful past and a lot of money to blow. The other characters, save one or two, didn't go very deep, either. Jackie was likeable, though. Things wrapped up a little too neatly with a pretty bow on top, and the author relied too heavily on leaving everyone out of the loop-the protagonists and the reader-but getting there managed to keep my interest. All in all, not a bad financial/political thriller."},{"Title":"Drummer in the Dark (Marcus Glenwood Series #2)","review":"The protagonist is Wynn Bryant, past owner of a high-tech business, who has no one in the world except his sister who is married to Senator Grant Wells.Senator Graham Hutchings had been pushing for a bill dubbed the Jubiliee bill. It was aimed at curbing and controlling the big time hedge fund operators who played with economies like one plays with dominoes. Then Hutchings has a stroke leaving his seat empty. Elections are in the offing. Grant Wells is Hutchings' political opponent and is totally against the Jubilee bill. Seizing the opportunity, Grant pushes Wynn to run in the elections. At his sister's recommendation, Wynn reluctantly accepts and soon becomes a cog in the wheel of Washington DC.But Wynn doesn't turn out to be the puppet that Grant expects him to be. Before opposing the Jubilee bill as per his brother in law's instructions, he starts digging into its details and backgrounds. This leads him from Washington to Cairo and back, with many revelations on the way. In his diggings, he comes across Jackie, a private detective who has been hired by the wife of Graham Hutchings to hedge fund scams. Both of them are lonely for company and a mutual attraction develops between the two. Together, they cross the path of Pavel Hayek, the biggest of the big hedge fund operators - a ruthless man who would let nothing stand in his way.The novel is a page turner, zipping its way from start to finish at breathtaking pace. It is full of interesting characters and situations. I wish T. Davis Bunn had spent a little more time (even at the expense of slowing down the narrative) to educate readers like me (who are ignorant of commerce, economics, the workings of the wall street, etc.) a bit more about hedge funds. Not knowing the significance of the one of the key elements of the story reduces suspension of disbelief. Other than that, as said above, it is a great read.

Having lived in Orlando for the past twenty-one years, I find it extremely annoying to read a novel about my city that is so full of inaccuracies. His geography is all mixed up, his roads are confused, and even the weather is incorrectly represented. In the twenty-one years I've been here, it never once hit 100 degrees, and certainly no where near that in April, for heaven's sake! Maybe this wouldn't bother someone who doesn't live here, but there's an old, but correct, saying: &quot;Write about what you know.&quot; Mr Bunn simply does not know Orlando.

Lagraff (CRC Press) excerpt: The primary purpose of this second edition of Inorganic Materials Chemistry Desk Reference remains its value as a resource to assist in the preparation of solid state inorganic materials by chemical processing techniques. The idea for a second edition was conceived several years ago in an effort to both add new chemical precursors available to the Materials Scientists and to include existing or emerging topics where materials chemistry plays an important role, such as microelectronics, surface science, and nanotechnology. Additions to Chapter 1 include discussion of the role of materials chemistry in micro- and nano-fabrication, surface materials chemistry, self-assembly, scanning probe microscopy, and carbon fullerenes. The glossary in Chapter 2 contains over 200 new definitions related to the aforementioned topics. Chapter 3 has been greatly expanded to include 50% more new chemical precursors and their properties. The reader is referred to the preface of the first edition (following page) for more information regarding this book.This Inorganic Materials Chemistry Desk Reference is meant to be a resource to assist in the preparation of solid state inorganic materials by chemical processing techniques. Ceramic materials can be prepared by a variety of chemical routes and this handbook provides a brief introduction to inorganic materials chemistry and these processing routes, along with definitions of most commonly used terms in the field. The focus of the desk reference is a compilation of property data on inorganic precursors and on inorganic solids to assist in the selection of candidate precursors and materials for a variety of applications.The idea for such a resource for inorganic materials chemistry was conceived from my personal experience with initiating new materials chemistry-related projects, all of which began by necessity with the painstaking effort required to collect relevant information from a multitude of sources, including textbooks, handbooks, journals, proceedings, and magazines. Beginning with my thesis and postdoctoral work on sol-gel processing at the University of Illinois with Professors W. G. Klemperer and D. A. Payne, I found myself devoting a considerable fraction of my efforts to collecting relevant information in the area of materials chemistry. During my work at Battelle in Columbus, Ohio, and subsequently following my move to the General Electric Corporate Research and Development Center, it was clear to my colleagues and to me that there is a pressing need for a resource that not only explains the terms frequently used in the inorganic materials chemistry field, but also provides data on the physical properties of the precursors available for use in chemical processing techniques. Such questions as \\"What precursor can I select to prepare this inorganic solid?\\" and \\"Which precursor (from the processing point of view) is suitable or viable for this process?\\" are the types of questions that scientists and engineers need quick answers to in order to initiate a successful materials chemistry project. This resource provides a rapid reference to help answer these and other such questions. In addition, it provides physical property data on inorganic solids to answer questions such as \\"What kind of properties should I expect from this or similar materials?\\"The desk reference begins with a general introduction to the area of inorganic materials chemistry with an emphasis on chemical processing routes. Several sources of additional information are provided for newcomers to the field and for the experienced practitioners as well. The second chapter provides a quick reference to many commonly used terms in the field of inorganic materials chemistry. The primary purpose of the desk reference, that of providing data on inorganic precursors and ceramic materials, is served in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4. The third chapter is a compilation of physical property data on various organometallic, metal organic, and inorganic salt precursors used in the processes described in Chapter 1. The fourth chapter consists of seven sections detailing physical property data on inorganic solids, including oxides, carbides, nitrides, borides, selenides, tellurides, and sulfides, among others."},{"Title":"Memory Emory and His Hiding Places","review":"Memory Emory is a one-of-a-kind book that presents basic memory techniques in a creative, beautifully illustrated way.

He merely describes the beliefs, techniques, and background, and allows you to decide for yourself. Even if you don't buy into the idea of reincarnation, for example, at the very least Surya will get you thinking about the possibilities.This book is essentially a guide for those who wish to custom craft their own spiritual life. It allows you to decide how best to discover truth, and to discover yourself. Don't think this is a Buddhist book, because it is not. The lessons you take away from &quot;Awakening to the Sacred&quot; can be integrated into any lifestyle. You may not find yourself meditating at dawn and chanting while you shower, but you will certainly learn something about yourself as you journey through this book.Definitely a must-read for those seeking truth and happiness."},{"Title":"Awakening to the Sacred","review":"I couldn't put this book down. Its artful combination of wit and wisdom are a pure joy.

Awakening To The Sacred is that book for me.In his incredibly clear, wise, and humorous style, Lama Surya Das' has written a book that seems to speak directly to me about bringing the sacred into everything I do.... indeed, embracing it in every moment of my life. I've read the book twice now, and know that I am forever changed by what it's taught me."},{"Title":"Awakening to the Sacred","review":"The American-born author of this fine book is a Lama in the Dzogchen lineage of Tibet. He was raised in the Jewish faith, and his unique background makes him an especially lucid exponent of the principles of Tibetan Buddhism for Westerners steeped in Judeo-Christian beliefs and principles.Lama Surya Das has been engaged in spiritual studies for over thirty years and sat at the feet of a number of teachers in Asia. He has written several books, and this one is a particularly good introduction to the spiritual life. Though the emphasis is on the philosophy and practices of Buddhism, some of the descriptions of the spiritual path and the problems that many of us encounter, can be applied for people working in other traditions. The strongest points of the book and of Lama Surya Das' teachings in general, are his suggestions for incorporating a sense of the sacred while living an active Western lifestyle. So often we see writers and teachers extolling the virtues of a spiritual path that is not compatible with a family life and career. I once knew an excellent teacher who had some extraordinary insights. He insisted that anyone who came to learn from him should give up his or her home, family and career. He did not have that many takers.This book is far more realistic. The chapters are short, pithy and deal with many of the more common problems that we might run into as we walk the spiritual path. They include the practicalities of the establishing a regular practice as well as issues like the emergence of the dark side of our nature as we meditate.There are numerous suggestions for meditation, prayer and chanting. Many can be found elsewhere, but what sets this book apart is that all the practices are grounded in daily life.The book is very engagingly written: clear, insightful, and even some humor. This is one of my top ten favorite books on practical spirituality. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Awakening to the Sacred","review":"Lama Surya Das is such a wonderful communicator of the Dharma as it applies to all of us in this life. If you are just beginning the quest, don't look to Awakening The Sacred for your answers. But find in this book a friend along the spiritual path, a guide to the answers already inside you. If you are a Buddhist practitioner, a Jewish practitioner, a Christian practitioner...find in this book a friend who walks beside you. As we strive in the West to adapt spirituality to our lives, we have a gift in Lama Das. Read and re-read and re-read his books, then strive to apply, apply, apply. We'll all be better for your effort."},{"Title":"Awakening to the Sacred","review":"I read the book. Fine. Before I read the book, I was a Libertarian for Harry Browne.

Before reading the book, I thought that mathematics was fun - but had no real use. After I read the book, I am including the study of mathematics as part of my spiritual path.The main point of this book, if there is one, seems to be to hammer away at our attachments. I am this...I am that... On and on and on. The biggest leap in spiritual practice seems to be to jump over the &quot;hurdle&quot; of logic. Lama Surya Das pounds and pounds away. Forging away for a new American Buddhism. I coughed blood many times while reading this book. &quot;He prays to God everyday?!?&quot; &quot;He sees a therapist?!?&quot; &quot;He's one of those 'environmentalists' who have trees growing out of their ears?&quot;. &quot;He loves 12-step meetings where they worship a Christian God?&quot;If you are fixated on one or many different agendas in spirituality, this book will disgust you. It digusted me! But I kept chewing and finally swallowed it. After, of course, spitting it out several times. It's very good to upset the intellect this way. To bruise the ego. I was following into the trap of &quot;I go by logic, therefore, I know everything!&quot; Order and read the book. It may not be a fun read. But it's a good thing to do.

His excellent books provide both the theoretical background and the practices that any seeker on the Buddhist path yearns for - he prepares you for challenges and doubt, assuages your concerns and fears, empowers you to find your own path and seek in your own way, and strengthens your courage while helping in subtle yet powerful ways to diminish your ego.This book is primarily about practice. The first section provides some additional theoretical background about Tibetan Buddhism (the Dzogchen lineage in particular) and then segues cleanly into literally dozens of meditations, prayers, chants and mantras that we can integrate seamlessly into our American lives. He provides plenty of information surrounding the more active forms of meditation such as Tai Chi or yoga. If you are looking for innovative ways to inspire or renovate your spiritual practice, his words may provide the kickstart that we all sometimes need to break free from a rut.If you can't take years out of your life to study in a monastery, yet still want to find happiness and freedom, Surya Das may provide the tools that you need.

I would recommend it as a rainy afternoon book. I enjoyed the different perspectives of the same event from four different people. Typically, it is easy to see right or wrong in a story as one character is made out to be \\"the loner\\" or \\"the bad guy.\\" Instead, this book shows four unique perspectives of the same event, no one person any more good or bad than the other. The book is split into sections where each of the four main characters describes their life, the events surrounding the accident, and their perspective of what happened. It is very balanced, each character has a good and a bad side. They each give a biography and a few choice stories and opinions of the other characters in the book. Some of the tales they tell make you empathize with them, and make them morally strong characters. Each character also shows their \\"dark side\\" which I think is a very realistic and endearing move for the author to make. The phrase \\"sometimes good people do bad things\\" comes to my mind after reading this book. The thing I dislike about this book is that it plays out like a mystery, but there is no closure. I understand the book would not work if the \\"real truth were revealed\\" but it still left me wondering. A driving point of this book is, there is no one truth, so closure is really not a focus or necessity. I feel one of the characters goes off on tangents that are not essential in building his character and seem to have little relevance to the book, other than that, the book is a page turner."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"I was assigned to read &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; for a class and my inital response was far from excited. I read the back cover to see what the book was going to be about, but I still wasn't interested. Finally, I sat down and forced myself to to read it. About twenty pages into the book, it began to peak my interest. Soon after that, I was hooked. I spent the rest of the day reading the book, and I spent that evening recomending it to everyone I talked to. It wasn't so much the plot of the book that interested me, as it was the characters. I really liked the way that Russell Banks tells the story from four very different perspectives. It was the characters side stories that really drew me in and kept me reading. After reading each characters account, I found myself wishing there was more, especially when I was through with Mitchell Stephens' account. I was really interested to find out what happened between him and his daughter. I think Banks did a wonderful job both with creating realistic characters, and creating the tragic situation that they were dealing with. I found that Banks does a good job of setting the mood of the story. He does this through the descriptions of the cold, bleak weather. I found that to play a big part in the feeling that I got from the book. After reading &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot;, I am interested to read more of Russell Banks' writing."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"The Sweet Hereafter Review I found The Sweet hereafter to be a very stimulating book. The story describes those affected by a terrible car accident that kills and injures many of the town's children. It clearly points out the varying perspectives of a tragedy; the victims, the scared, the hurt and even those taking advantages. The book also vividly describes the feelings that go along with a tragedy and how individuals overcome those feelings. In the book there is the first hand account of a variety of people involved in this tragedy. The one that really made me think was the story of a young girl named, Nicole Burnell. She was paralyzed in the bus crash that took place on her way to school one morning. I genuinely felt sorry for her because her outlook on her future was so grim. Her negative outlook was apparent when she didn't go to her own graduation (of which she was a valedictorian.) She also mentions some sexual abuse incidents with her father before the accident. All these terrible events in her life surely made her quiet introverted. The story also details the lives of many others in the community and the way they were affected by the event. The driver of the bus that crashed, Delores Driscoll, was another severely affected party in the tragedy. She was dealing with the guilt and shame that comes with being responsible for getting the kids to school safely and not fulfilling that responsibility. Overall, the book makes you feel, really feel for these people and the horror the have to live through. The theme of the book can be interpreted a number of ways. I think the book makes you realize how people really are their bare selves when a terrible thing happens. The book also helps me to realize the importance of children in our daily lives."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"I found the book to be okay but very,very boring in some parts. I felt that the way it was presented by telling the lives of the people involved was an excellant idea, but I think maybe to muched happened in their lives. I feel there was to much detail. This is what caused the chapters to seem to go on forever. I will give credit about how well Banks described the setting of a small town. The description of the small town where everybody know the lives and secrets of everyone else was great. You could feel the essences of a small town. The laid back, not busy,poor little town that seemed froiegn to the rest of the country was seen, but you could still find hints and traces of city life. For example the ambition and of the lawyer to find some one to blame for the accident. Also there was the way Dolores Driscol, the bus driver, explained the way Bear Otto greeted her as a &quot;black kid from the city&quot;(pg 12). The beginning and the middle of the book seem to go on. I understand that it was important the story, but to me it seemed to long. Personally the most interesting part was in the chapter where they explained what Mitchell Stephens, the lawyer, was approaching the case and how he was trying to get the blame off Dolores and place in on the town and the state of New York for not having guardrails. It was also interesting how the town was saved by Nicole Burnell by not giving in to the city lawyer who was involving the whole town in the lawsuit. The book seemed very gloomy and sad but turned out to have a pretty good ending. With as much happiness as it could have for a town that went throught such and tragedy and a girl that will not walk again. The town went back to their lives with the accident always in the back of their minds"},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"The Sweet Hereafter was a book that I chose to read after I saw the movie. I liked the movie a lot and decided to give the book a try. It was very similar to the movie, but I think that the book was easier to follow. It was about a tragic accident in a small town. It goes through the process of healing and whos to blame for this accident. There are also some other twists that come about in this book. It showed how people tend to always have to put blame onto somebody when really it is nobody's fault. It also shows how a family can be ripped apart by a tragedy. When I started the book, I really did not want to put it down until I was finished. I liked the book a lot and think that if anybody is looking to read a easy to follow interesting book, this should be the one. The author is Russell Banks, he seems to be a good writer. I will probably try to read something else written by him."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"After a bus accident kills several children in a small town, everyone needs someone to blame. Russell Banks tells this story well by focussing on only a few characters and letting us get into their heads by way of switching narrators, among whom are parents of the dead children, a teenager who survived the accident, the bus driver, and a lawyer in town to get rich off of the accident. Banks is unwavering in his portrayal of immense grief and you feel by the end as though you personally know the characters. I read this only after seeing the movie and was not disappointed"},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"This book caused me to put myself in many different people's shoes in a tragic situation. It made me think about what I would do in a situation like that and how I would feel. I found myself gravitating more and more towards Mitchell Stephens' character. In the book Mitchell Stephens is a lawyer who's main goal in life is to revenge the &quot;innocent&quot;. His anger is palpable. He fights back in the best way he can. He's about as honest as a lawyer can get. He was also the only character I could sympathise. The best feature of this book is it's ability to allow you to peek into other &quot;people's&quot; psychies. You view one event through many different eyes and it shows you just how different each person's perception is. It reflects the fact that each person is an individual and can't see the same situation in exactly the same way. Each character brought with it a unique emotion and point of view. They each came away with something different and so does the reader as they read each character's portrayal."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"I found The Sweet Hereafter by Russell Banks to be a really good book on the differences in peoples character. I think that he showed that there are many points of view on one situation. In his book, Russell Banks tells a story of a school bus that goes off the side of a road and into a sand pit full of water. He gives four different perspectives of this terribe accident. One of the people wasth lady busdriver, Delores Driscoll. Delores has been driving this bus route for twenty-two years. She is an extremely careful person, &quot;the kind of person who always follows the manual&quot; (4). Delores knew each and everyone of those children an she cared about them. She tried to let the kids be kids and have them enjoy their ride to school each day. Delores is the the type who tries to think of what might happen before it does. She is an &quot;optimist, basically, who acts like a pesimist. On principle. Just in case&quot; (25). Delores knows that the accident was just that, and accident, but she starts to question her judgement when everyone else does. This story is well worth reading, it puts you into other peoples shoes, even if only for a short while."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"Russell Banks has many strengths, as a writer, but one of his greatest is the pathos with which he expresses the trials we all must go through in life; in particular, the considerable repercussions the deaths of some school-children have on a community and the individuals within it. His speakers share their ordeals so eloquently that we feel sure that he has, like them, experienced a significant bereavement. We are drawn into their lives and carried, suspensefully to the end. However, the despondency, shared by the main characters, united with these afflictions does not make this book an uplifting read, and the ending provides but bitter-sweet satisfaction.There is also a conspicuous collection of sensitive topics/situations included in The Sweet Hereafter: AIDs, drugs, drinking, coarse and foul language, poverty, an extramarital affair, greedy lawyers, selfish lawsuits, hypocritical \\"Christians,\\" dysfunctional families, unhappy marriages, misfit children and adults, a stroke-victim, a death to cancer, and, of course, multiple deaths of children. Is this Reality? Yes, but condensed down to some of its meanest parts.Why, then, is The Sweet Hereafter so captivating? Well, the humor does have its value, the characters are intriguing, the story is original, and curiosity has a strong pull, but the primary strength of this book is in the contrasting viewpoints. They flatter each other as do complementary colors. To hear Billy Ansel, self-absorbed, perceptive, after listening to Dolores Driscoll, personable and wordy, is like drinking hot tea after eating ice cream. It's a shocking sensation, but one that goes well with literature. Our interest in the story increases with each expansion of our perception by the narrators and each viewpoint is sharpened by the others; the tea is all the hotter."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"The Sweet Hereafter by russell Banks is a insightful book showing how involvement and personal curcumstances alter the same event in people's lives. This book has four narrators, each telling there own account of the accident, each knowing things the others don't. There is the bus driver, Dolores Driscoll, concerned with the saftey of her &quot;childeren&quot;. Then there is Billy Ansel, a widowed vietnam veteran who liked to drive behind the bus and wave at his childeren in the morning. Next we have Mitchell Stephens, a lawyer driven by anger. Lastly there is Nichole Burnell, a beautiful teenager paralyzed in the accident, whose testimony about will change lives for ever. These four different people were drawn together by this tragic accident, there lives forever altered. This book made me realize how the same incident can affect people so differently. The four narrators with their totally different perspectives made this book very interesting and insightful into the lives of others."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"The book is great. I read it about a year after seeing the movie. The movie was stirring and haunting, suffused with a feeling of loss and sadness. There was a lot of emphasis on the attorney's character, played so well by Ian Holm. Atom Egoyan is a terrific director (see EXOTICA! ).The book is the same story, only different. I felt completely different reading it, while acknowledging that it is telling the same story. The same, and yet the tone is different, the details emphasized are different. And the character of the attorney has the same experiences as the one in the movie, but feels like a different person to me.I recommend both very highly. How often can you read a book and see a movie, then say, &quot;I loved the book, and I loved the movie too, even though it changed alot.&quot;"},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"This is a beautifully written book about the aftermath of a tragedy in a small New England town. A school bus accident kills many of the town's children and the novel examines the complexity of grief, hope, and the need for assignment of blame - - blame to make sense of and sort out the unfathomable. It examines how people withdraw into themselves, uniting only in the commonality of their shared tragedy. Each person deals with the tragedy deeply and we are given witness to the strength and resilience of some vs. the fragility and hopelessness of others.The novel is told from the vantage point of three townspeople - - the bus driver, a 14 year-old survivor and the parent of 2 dead children - - and a lawyer. The lawyer has come to town to find clients in order to build a case and help assign blame.This is an incredible book, multi-layered, beautifully written, and one that you will not soon forget."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"Mitchell Stephens, the admittedly angry New York City negligence lawyer from Banks' &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; runs through a litany of societal problems that have caused a blinding fissure between generations. &quot;We have lost our children,&quot; he says, and though he blames drugs and the &quot;sexual colonization of our young people by industry,&quot; he is too logical to attempt to focus his anger at vague ideas. Instead, he mounts angry cases against the cities, counties and states from which the children disappear. We see that his true occupation is avoiding the sorrow and guilt he feels because of the &quot;loss&quot; of his own daughter.When children are lost, parents are left in a sort of amoral timelessness, without history or perspective. The future disappears, and suddenly everything is permitted. The freedom is lonely and terrifying, and parents, in an attempt flee back to the world of rules and consequences, turn their grief outward where it mutates into blame.But &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; is more than an examination of grief and culpability. The novel investigates the communities that arise when anger and blame are the primary means of social currency. By the end of the book we find ourselves within questions much larger than the individual lives involved, and though we are sad that two characters must be martyred, we are relieved, because we know that martyrs couldn't exist without the morality we thought we'd lost. Even the martyrs find can solace in an understanding their of roles: they are proof of redemption."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"This book is a quick read, which somehow, for me is a disappointment. I found the premise very intriguing and I liked the way each chapter is devoted to one character, so we can see how the accident has affected each of them. The atmosphere of a small town is nicely depicted. Of all the characters, Nichole comes across as the strongest, and it is her chapter that I enjoyed the most.Overall, a good book, full of humanity. I haven't seen the movie, but I am looking forward to."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"The Sweet Hereafter is one more novel that stretches itself across several characters and their struggle in the aftermath of terrible tragedy: the death of a whole town's children. I hesitate to give this book its full due--it probably deserves five stars--because of the wearying emphasis on children. If you're a DINK (Double-Income-No-Kids) like me, you might find the slavish doting on children a little tiresome. But this detail never undermines the profound sense of loss which these characters struggle against. Without sentimentality, the novel manages to investigate grief and unimaginable loss in four very real approaches.The risk with a novel like this is in the characters--your enjoyment of the book hinges in large part upon your enjoyment of the people narrating. Each of the characters is sweetly likeable, yet as a human being each is deeply flawed. These are people facing what they could never have imagined, and this novel shows us the demons such tragedy brings out in otherwise likeable people--especially when the lawyers begin circling.The Sweet Hereafter is about blame, sure, but it's also about the humanity within each of us that struggles to make sense of the senseless. I appreciate most the stance this book takes on good and evil, on the nature of mistakes and blame, consequence and punishment. If you haven't read this book yet, there's no reason not to."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"The Sweet Hereafter is an interesting look at a small rural town in upstate New York before and after a tragic school bus accident killing several of the town's children. The story is told from a multiple first person perspective, through the eyes of the bus driver, a father of a lost child, an injury lawyer, and one of the child survivors.I found the perspective of Mitch Stevens, a rather selfishly motivated lawyer, to be the most interesting perspective. Mitch Stevens is, for the most part, a straightforward New York City lawyer who feels he has lost his own child Zoe to drugs, lies, and prostitution. He claims that he is motivated not by money, in these \\"injury due to negligence\\" lawsuits, but by anger; the anger that drives his life. I also liked the perspective of Nichole Burnell, the child survivor, who is paralyzed from the waist down by the bus accident. I thought the most appealing aspect of the novel, for me was the shifting view between characters. I would start to understand the view of the current protagonist, the standpoint would shift, and I would be given the view of a new protagonist, with different values and agendas.Overall I thought this was a well written story, but there were some issues I would have liked to have seen tied up, and in the end I felt that these issues were unresolved. This I did not like. I recommend this book to people who are looking for something a little different and do not mind a slightly unresolved ending."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"From the opening paragraph, &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; captivates you, and it never lets go. I picked it up, and finished it soon after. Russell Banks paints a portrait of a small town, and its people. You feel touched by the tales told by the people who were a part of this bus accident that killed many children.The character that particulary touched me was 14-year-old Nichole. Look at her: her life is already miserable, but she's the ony one who knows it. She is being molested by her father, and contemplating suicide. Then, she is nearly killed in this tragedy. She will never walk again. The other character that got to me was Billy Ansel. His wife has died not too long ago of cancer, so his young twins are the only light in his life. He follows behind the bus everyday on his way to work, waving at his children. He watches them die right before his eyes. However, all the characters are amazing. The bus driver, Dolores, has a crippled husband, and he lawyer has a daughter with AIDS.The novel is very poetic, and will pluck on the strings of your heart.

Honestly, it is the best book that I have ever read!"},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"Russell Banks weaves the people around the story, and though he is doing the storytelling, he lets us do what we will with the characters. Much of his writing is painful, and he makes it even more so by doing it with a conscious hand. &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; is nothing short of a masterpiece, a novel that's as clear as a curved piece of glass and makes you wonder why and how the visions are distorted by its curvature.

A fatal school bus accident occurs, and the aftermath is viewed through four different perspectives. Every character in this book is written with realism and clarity, Russell Bank's does a remarkable job creating small-town personalities and their profoundly sad lives. The whole atmopshere of the story is stark,(and at times uninteresting) but is still quite absorbing, with moments of humour that steer the story clear away from sentimentality in which it could of easily plunged into. I personally thought the most engrossing part of &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; is when one of the few survivor's of the accident, Nichole Burnell, explains how her life is after the incident. She tells her story with such sincerity, you can't help feel sympathy towards her, especially after we learn that she lives with a painful secret. The one thing that struck me about this book was that there was no real optimism in it, everything seems to hopeless, but at the same time it doesn't wallow into the depths of anguish. &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; is well worth reading, although it's not for everyone's tastes."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"I admit this book was hard to start for me but once i made it in about 60 pages it took off like a shot.This is a story about a bus accident in a remote town in upstate NY and how the lives of all are altered.

I will not go into the story because many have done that already below me, but I can say that if you read this book, there will be one character that you can relate to.

In the novel, told from four different points of view, a small town is deeply shaken by a horrible accident. Dolores Driscoll, a school-bus driver in the small town of Sam Dent, swerved to avoid hitting what she thought to be a dog, and ended up plunging through the ice of a water-filled sand pit. Billy Ansel who was following behind, watched helplessly as fourteen children died, two of which were his own. Nichole Burnell, one of the children on the bus, was maimed. Mitchell Stephens, a big city lawyer, soon arrived to turn the towns pain and suffering into profit. Through their eyes, Russel depicts how ordinary people try to find someone or something to blame for the accident. Instead of facing the truth, and accepting the tragedy as inexplicable, they point the finger. Because of this, they never really deal with their grief. What I believe Russel is trying to say is that we have to not only accept, but relish in the unpredictability of life. Yes, sometimes it is the cause of much pain and suffering, but without grief, there can be no happiness. As a result of these things, we learn and grow. If we waste our time trying to rationalize, like the characters in the book, we will become stagnant. We must deal with tragedy and death in order to find eventual happiness and new life."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"Do you believe in omens?

The real bizarre turn came when the book came to an end. The last scene of the book occurs in the town of Sam Dent at the County Fair's Demolition Derby. Believe it or not, I grew up in that town. It's called Westport, New York and Mr. Banks describes the fairgrounds perfectly.

This book may be slow in the beginning, but don't be discouraged. The story soon kicks into high gear and will be very difficult to put down. Russel Banks does a teriffic job in having four of the characters involved in the bus accident narrate the novel. The narrators are a lawyer whose daughter is a desperate drug addict, a bus driver whose husband is crippled by a stroke, a young girl who is molested by her father, and a father whose wife died of cancer. The bus accident greatly effects these people as well as everyone else in the town. Banks thoroughly describes the character's tragedies so well that anyone would be forced to sympathize with them. All the characters seem to have some kind of personal problems, which is also probably true for people in real life. The townspeople deal with their problems in many different ways. Some try to forget the accident ever happend while others become very angry and seek revenge. It seems like the community was stable and happy one day and, after the accident, the entire town fell apart and turned into a dark existence. The book was easy to read and understand. The themes include dealing with the death of a child, coping with a child who is a drug addict, sexual molestation, adultery, and many more.

In all, it is a great novel."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"The Sweet Hereafter is a realistic tale about the small town of Sam Dent through the eyes and minds of four people. Sam Dent is shattered by a tragic school bus accident were many children die or are injured.Four people are now fatally linked by this tragedy:We experience the accident first hand through the eyes of the bus driver, Dolores Driscoll. Banks lets us peek into her psyche as she contemplates her part in the accident. She questions herself and is quite willing to accept her fate, yet she lacks the courage to declare her innocence.Behind the bus at the time of the accident is Billy Ansel, a Marine Vietnam veteran. He not only witnesses the crash but also the deaths of his two children, the only thing he had to live for. We delve into his mind and explore his thoughts and feelings. Billy Ansel has a tragic story of his own: once a war hero, now little more than broken man with a heart of stone. Ansel becomes a mentor for Nichole Burnell, and though he is a tragic hero gone to alcoholism we can not help but admire his morals that help inspire Nichole Burnell to rebel against parasitic lawyer types.Mitchell Stephens is one of those big city lawyers that plagues Sam Dent in a time of tragedy. Banks allows us to see that he is not just one of those big city lawyers, Mitchell Stephens is a human as well. We experience life through his eyes, and we learn that even a lawyer has his own morals.Nichole Burnell is the queen of her class. Her destiny to become a rising star is given a violent turn as she is maimed by the accident. The heroine of the story comes to terms with herself and other darker conflicts of her past; and by doing this she is able to save the town from itself.Russell Banks has allowed us to experience the strife created in a small town. This could of happened to anybody in any town. His characters could of been us or they could of been somebody we know-- that is how realistically he portrays them. The story is so realistic you must remind yourself that you got this book from the FICTION section of the bookstore.

I think Banks was able to comminicate the details of the accident without being objective. I feel that accidents help people understand themselves better.

When I first started the book, Dolores was just a lady driving a school bus. Her knowledge of the others in her town was your basic gossip. She knew enough to fill you in on the people. And then Billy, &quot;...at the moment it [the accident] occured I was thinking about f***ing Risa Walker&quot;(37). Needless to say, my jaw dropped. That was the last thing I expected. I enjoyed the chance to look into the characters' minds and to see things from their point of view. I got to see how they reacted to their surroundings and to each other. Each believed that they knew everything about each other when no one really knew the truths. Each character had his or her own secrets that no one knew about.

My one quible would be that none of the main charecters had a stong religious faith so I felt that this viewpoint got short changed a bit(maybe my Christian bias).

The author shows the impact of a dramatic event in a small town in New York. The lives of the charecters are drastically altered forever, and the town, instead of coming together in this time of grief, starts to dismantle itself. Every charecter has his or her own way of grieving. The driver of the bus cloaks herself in solidity, a man who lost first his wife, then both his daughters, drowns his sorrows in a bottle of liquor and a young, sweet cheerleader becomes a cynical, hardened bystander of life. When a tragedy of this caliber happens, everyone is changed, and not a one is better for it. A powerful novel, The Sweet Hereafter is like a tour through a hall of fun house mirrors, each divulging it's own dirty secret. Each mirror is like one of the charecters, their reflections distorted. Views become slanted, and people's lives are shattered as they tear themselves apart, searching for an answer as to why. How could one small town be overcome with so much grief? One can not function if blanketed in ones own sorrows. This novel is an excellent reflection of such. With each paged turned, one becomes more deeply entwined in this maze of exquisite torture, of pain and anguish. By expressing the overwhelming sense of grief through multiple charecters, the author has accomplished his goal of making you rethink your values and of all the things you hold dear. Life is a precious gift not to be wasted."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"I originally bought the book, not becuase I wanted to, but becuase I needed it for a school project. After opening it and forcing myself to read the first 3 paragraphs (I thought the book was going to be bad) I found myself unable to put it down. Banks is a GREAT novelest. I intend to read his works more often. Once I finished The Sweet Hereafter, I picked up Affliction (I haven't finished it... yet)"},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"I would not prefer to read this book a second time since it was a deeply sad story of what occurs inside and was not the kind of story I'd normally read but was required for a class. There were as others say multiple narrators of the story but that added to difficulty since they seemingly went back and forth in time to fill in the details to make the story touch you the way it did me. Of course for an English class this is helpful with all the meanings and the thoughts make meaning of details.The above is why I gave it a 3 and If I had to read again I'd probably give it less."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"The story concerns how people go on after a terrible tragedy. Normally I don't like to escape to depressing books, but this one is very well written and a fast read."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"Though the book had an excellent story line, it was really slow, with too much detail about the towns people. This made it drag on mainly in the begining and the middle of the book. I think that it was important to tell a little bit about the people involved so that the reader could connect with the story, but it went on forever. The Sweet Hereafter isn't so much about the accident, but about how the whole town deals with the loss of their children. Everyone's life in that town changed when the bus accident happened. Sam Dent was a small town, that still lived &quot;apart&quot; from the world. After the bus accident occured, the town was forced to give up the little town life and learn to deal with the big city one. The author does a great job in telling each of the people's stories differently, the language he uses is really effective in helping the reader relate the book to real life. He also does a great job writing about how the town held together when they were being blamed for the accident. Banks did a great job proving to people that it is impossible to blame any one person for a tragedy such as this one. It was a chain of events that caused this accident. Throughout the book the reader recieves a sad and dark feeling, but it ends on a happy note, this is a very surprising twist, that made me want to read it again. My overall impression is the author used a good writing style, but carried on a bit too long with detail."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"A lot of other people have reviewed this book, probably better than I could do. I'll just add my two cents, it's a terrific book."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"Russel Banks is a truly accomplished writer and &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; serves to cement that reputation. Beautifully written and constructed, Banks accomplishes a rare feet in narrating the events from four seperate viewpoints--each of which comes across authentic.Many reviews have called this novel depressing, a reading I dispute. Like any good tragedy the novel employs extreme cirumstances--events which violently disrupt the lives of those involved. But as the novel progresses, so to do the characters. Perseverance in the face of tragedy is, in my view, a triumph of human nature and it is rarely expressed so eloquently.As beautiful as the novel is, it sometimes leaves the reader feeling cold and analytical. The prose has a tendency to lull the reader, rendering him or her placid and unfeeling. At times you wish Banks would break out with some raw emoting, but it rarely happens."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"&quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; is a sensitive and perceptive novel about what happens to a small town when it loses a number of its children in a senseless accident. The novel is narrated by different people, all of them involved with the incident in one way or another. I admire Banks' ability to change voice from one person to the next, and the way he maintains suspense not only from a plot point of view (what happens next?) but by reliability of narrator (that's what he said; what will she say?). My only gripe is that it's a rather short book and could have gone into more detail. But isn't it better for a novel to be too short than too long?"},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"Russell The Sweet Hereafter is a book filled with events and surprises. His style of relating the story or I should said stories as there were inter-linked events and situations revolving all the 4 main characters. This novel started with a tragic school bus accident on a snowing morning. Fates changed and questions asked. Who to blame? The bus driver? The weather? Or other factors? A lawyer was brought into the picture to investigate. He began the search for the truth. He never anticipated that his perspective of life and living would alter too.This novel is uniquely written in a way which readers can see from different sides of the story. Aftermath of the accident was multi-dimensionally written. Every victim had his/her own perspective. The novel was divided into various parts whereby I could hear from people involved directly or indirectly to the accident. Revealing many dark secrets and details.. From Dolores, the bus driver to a young girl 's viewpoints showed how people react differently and what they do when the same thing happened. Amazing discovery of human nature's complexity and authenticity.What a cruel world!Banks created intrinsic characters and vividly sequenced the events. This novel also had a touch of irony and realistic. It's cleverly concluded with justification. Quite a remarkable attempt!"},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"It all began in a small town, where normal people led normal lives. Nothing really exciting ever happened there. Nothing really changed. Day in and day out, life was basically the same. But the people liked life the way it was. It was what they were used to. Then one day, in one instant, because of one accident, everything suddenly changed. One early snowy morning, a school bus plunged through a guardrail and sank in a frozen-over quarry. All the children died or were seriously injured. As a result, a lawyer came to the town and the media showed up, too. One thing's for sure - these small-town people's lives would never be the same. The Sweet Hereafter is very well written. Russell Banks does an excellent job of relating the problems that occur and the changes that take place after an accident as drastic as this. One problem, everyone shifting blame onto everyone else, becomes very dangerous in a small town. All the people involved are neighbors, friends, classmates, or co-workers. Everyone feels pressured to take a side. By just one event, a friendly small-town community can become divided against each other. The author does an amazing job of drawing the reader into his story. He takes three characters and describes the accident and the events leading up to the accident through their eyes. He also tells the lawyer's story, a story in which he learns of his rebellious, drug-addicted daughter's newest problem - she is HIV positive. These four characters' stories are written so well, and their lives are described so well, that it's easy for any reader to relate to some aspect of the small-town disaster."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"Russel Bank's book &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; is a well written novel. Banks takes you deep into each characters life letting you see how each one thinks and feels. He also has a good ability to draw you in with the characters and see things from their point of view. Every part of the book is gripping and really helps you to relate with what is going on. It is interesting how Banks shows many different views and perspectives throughout the differen characters. Banks really knows how to describe each character's story in a different way. He is very resourceful in relating the book to real life. I enjoy how Banks intertwines each character with the story and with the other characters. It is without a doubt unlike any book I've ever read before. Banks has such a way with writing that you feel every emotion of every character. From the sad moments to the frusterating realization that you have no controll over the situation, Banks keeps you glued to the book wondering what will happen next? The book is in a way a journey to find out what really makes the character tick. Banks masterfully decribes the scene surrounding each character showing clearly the influences on each character. All in all &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; is a well-written novel that challenges the reader in the way he thinks about life, that nothing can or should be taken for granted."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"Russell Banks' &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; is a powerful story about the struggles faced by human beings when tragedy invades their lives. It provides excellent insights into the question of placing blame when a loved one is taken, of sacrificing the character of one person for the solidarity of a community, and what can happen when false hopes are placed in a false hero. The setting, which is in a small town in upstate New York, emphasizes the &quot;small-town America&quot; community life, and demonstrates the aspect of everyone knowing everyone else. The novel asks whether the small town life is really the perfect situation it is perceived to be, because if everyone knows everything about everybody else, the character of one person can be destroyed if and when the entire community turns against him or her. It can start by simply two neighbors having an argument, then more and more people jump on the proverbial bandwagon, simply because everyone else seems to be already on it, until the entire community has turned on one or a few people."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"Russell Banks' use of four different characters to tell this story is what makes this amazing novel so unique. The story begins with a school bus accident that leaves 14 children dead. Not only do we get immersed in the lives of the characters narrating the novel, we also want to get involved in some way or another and help the people most affected by the accident reach a happy ending. Part of us identifies with the bus driver and tries to find an explanation for the accident and peace with everyone in town. After all, the whole town is affected by the accident, and more than one person thinks that somebody should be blamed for it. We also associate with Billy Ansel, Nichole Burnell and the New York lawyer, who thinks he can pull together a good case to reward the victims for the damages of the accident. This book offers an excellent glimplse of the small town community and the relationships between the people living there. The story is also filled with different themes that make readers want to keep reading until they reach the right conclusion, not just for the characters in the story, but also for themselves."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was told in a way that had you unraveling the story like a ball of yarn. With each person you get a new highlight to the story, it made you keep reading so that you would get to the next person and see how they saw the accident. Twists in people's feelings and changes of perspectives made the story complex and kept you on your toes. Involves all the aspects of a small clustered community."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"The novel, The Sweet Hereafter was a wonderful protrayal of how one accident can tear down a community, along with individuals. The seperate view points of four community members really allows the reader to feel that they are experiancing the emotions and lives of the people before and after the bus accident. Everyone took the accident differently and it had a different effect on everyones lives, this aspect made the book more interseting and actually read faster. The only reason I felt this book deserved 4 stars instead of 5 was the fact that Banks didnt give any insight into what happend later in some of the victims live and also because I became very board when I got to the section about the lawyer. I would have to say that my favorite part in the book is when Billy Ansel begins telling us about his wife and her ordeal with cancer. And how Ansel notices how small and fragile a woman really is when he starts to box up his wifes clotes. Ansel remarks on how men tend to forget or not even notices of tiny and delicate women really are, and just by lookin at their clothes you see how much of it there really isnt. This would have to be my favorite part in the book, dont ask me why, it just is. There we other many wonderful and moving parts to the book, but none that I can recalect like that scene. For anyone who is looking for a book that will make you think about life and how precious it is and how easily it can be taken from us, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"The novel, by Russel Banks was exceptional. There is a great trajedy of a simple town, and most people did what people expected, and shut others off. Others became enraged. Mitchell Stevens esq. prayed for those people who looked for someone to blame. He was a big time lawyer who needed to make a living off anothers loss. He was a clever fellow, and was one of the main people to try to destroy the small town of Sam Dent. Of course their were those opposing him like Billy Ansel, who was a direct victim, having lost both his children in the accident. He knew that by people pointing blame on someone, it was bound to tear his town apart. He knew that. Or did he? After all that was only his point of view. Others had a different opinion. The lawyer, Mitchell Esquire, for example did not see the whole case as a way to destroy a town, rather than a way to make someone pay for a mistake. He believed that their are no accidents, and that there is always a corner cut somewhere, when an accident happens. Therefore he needed to do what he could to make sure that this type of thing never happened again. Of course he might come off as the type of person who was just trying to stir up trouble to other people, but there are many other lawyers out there, and if he didnt work fast to gain clients, there was a chance that things could be covered up. Therefore he must act the way he does, in order to best develop a case. Was it a case or a lie that Mitchell Stevens was creating? Nichole Burnell was not sure. She had known that he seemed like a nice guy, yet at the same time, she knew he had something up his sleeve. Not to mention the fact that she wanted the whole issue dropped, being the low-point in her life. She had heard his side of what should be done, and by evesdropping, she had heard Billy Ansels version as well. Two totally different opinions, and both not liking the others. She understood that there were hard payments to be made from the deads family and some money could help, but at the same time, she understood what a scapegoat was doing to the town. With all that was happening, her side was simply this: tell the truth, no matter what. The people of Sam Dent had two great trajedy happen to them. They lost some of their children, and they tried to blame someone to get revenge. It is hard to know the real truth of something horrible, when it comes from only one persons eyes. Each of the narrators told their side of the story, and I conclude simply: no one is to blame, and everyone is to blame."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"I loved this book. I had seen the movie a few years back but decided to try reading the book anyway. It was a good choice. The characters in this book are drawn so well you feel as though you can see them. The author does a great job of making everyone in this book believable and he establishes credible and decent motives for their behaviors that sometimes seem incredible and less than decent.The book is about the end of innocence. From the loss of the children on the bus, to the loss of a drug addicted child, to the loss of community and finally the loss of one's self in Billy Ansel's case, this books ties it all together. This is my first book by Russell Banks and I'm eager to read the others."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"I thought Etom Egoyan's film to be superior to the book. I first saw the film and considered it to be one of the best I've ever seen. Ian Holms' depiction of the stressed out lawyer was something to behold; his performance was riveting and completely believable. He was much more flesh and blood than the character came across in the book. And, unlike others, I thought the ending in the movie to be much more compelling than the contrived ending in the book. This is a story of people taking advantage of other people, taking advantage of any kind of weakness or opportunity to exploit another. Things generally even out except for the poor bus driver who receives a bad hand all around."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"On the surface, The Sweet Hereafter, by Russell Banks, seems to be a story about how the small town of Sam Dent in upper New York state deals with the accidental deaths of several of its children. However, the novel more deeply examines the way different members of the community deal with the tragedy. Four characters each narrate a portion of the story, and each narrator has a unique way of viewing and interpreting the events that have taken place. Each narrator brings his or her own life experiences into the description of the events surrounding the accident. The combination of each narrator's version of the truth allows the reader to come to his or her own conclusion about who, if anyone, is responsible for the suffering that this small town has experienced. People believe what they want to believe, and, as a result, the truth (or the most sensible version of the truth) often becomes clouded. The bus accident that killed several of the children of Sam Dent had very different effects on each of the citizens of the town. While some feel like their lives have been torn apart by the accident; others, like the character of Nichole Burnell, a survivor of the crash, feel that they have been liberated by it. Most lives were changed by the accident, but Nichole's life actually improved because of the accident. After the crash, Nichole had the emotional strength to deal with the problems that had been present in her family for years. The author's use of different writing styles for each of the different characters makes the novel truly believeable. Each narrator is given his or her own individual voice. No character is similar to any of the others, and it is this distinct voice that makes each character's account of the accident worth reading."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"A heartbreakingly beautiful exploration of the space between light and dark, heat and fierce cold; that prolonged moment of unbearable, profound tragedy, what came before and the pale comparison of all that comes after. I could not put it down. I am certain these characters will live with me forever."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"The Sweet Hereafter is a definate must read. The plot gets you interested and keeps you there, it flows extremely well, and it is very easy to relate to. The different viewpoints of the book work well together to show you an all-around view of what happens to a small, poor town when the unthinkable happens. Russel Banks portrays every sort of stand, from guilt, to mourning, to anger, to helplessness, by looking at the tragedy from the viewpoints of the driver who blames herself, the mourning father, the anger-filled lawyer, and a survivor of the wreck who will be crippled for life. The reader feels a certain connection to the characters in the novel, likes them, dislikes them, feels their pain and their sorrow. But all around it is a lesson in viewing with an open mind a situation and the way people react to not only this tragedy, but everyday life."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"The Sweet Hereafter by Russel Banks is a masterpiece. He writes the book from four different narrator's perspectives. This gives the book an interesting point of view that any reader can enjoy. Even those people that don't like to read. The way he writes this book gives you a sense that the four character are actually sitting in front of you and giving you there side of the story. He also gives you a sense of what a small town is like when big things happen. Every point of view that Banks expresses in this book can be seen clearly which makes this book very compelling. Another compelling thing about this book is the way that the characters deal with the accident. The characters react in different ways to the lawyers and media swarming the town. During this time the characters lose and gain relationship due to the accident. The one thing that remains consistent in the book is that every character personality changes after the accident. This novel shows how real people react to tragedy and heartache. It also shows themes that we see in everyday life. Such as, losses of people we love, alcoholism, divorce, and secret affairs are just a few of them! This book sucks you in and wont let go until you get to the end. It was much better than I anticipated and you might be able to see yourself in the themes of this book. This book keeps its perspective in a realistic point of view and is a must read."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"I know this space is usually reserved strictly for a review of the book, but since Amazon's review of &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; makes many references to the clear superiority of the novel over the film, I feel obliged to briefly respond. And to passionately disagree.The movie is not merely good; it is an outright masterpiece.Banks' novel is strong and insightful on so many different levels, and I would have thought, by the very nature of its structure, that it would have been virtually impossible to bring to the screen. But Atom Egoyan has been able to write and film one of the most intensely intelligent screen adaptations I have ever seen. And Amazon's review about it completely misses the bus.Banks brings to life his remote and icy small town clearly and realistically, and there is not a false note in his portrait of his characters or the isolated world they inhabit. Although we hear four different narrators throughout the story, the book always seems to be viewing its devastated people in Sam Dent from high above, as if they are under a microscope in their struggles to survive the worst that life offers.Whereas Banks uses literary skills to reflect on his larger themes, Egoyan uses the breathtaking skill of his filmmaking to come up with a comparable work. &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; is one of the great films of the '90s; like the book, it is not about death but about surviving the incomprehensible death of those closest to you.Egoyan manipulates time in his film -- not as a gimmick but for similar purposes that Banks chooses various narrators to see some of the same events from different perspectives. Both works avoid using the bus crash as a literary or cinematic climax in any way; their profundity is in the examination of coping with loss, not about the loss itself.Egoyan, of course, isn't able to give all of the background that Banks so beautifully captures about his characters. But his choices of what to include and how to include them are impeccable. The lawyer's &quot;future&quot; airplane trip where he meets Zoe's old friend is a perfectly believable and moving way to include the story of Zoe nearly dying as a child. In some ways, it serves as the muted centerpiece of the film.Egoyan's choice of having Nichole read the poetic fairytale to the children she babysits is another brilliant inclusion not in the book; it adds unforgettable resonance to the work.The books' last sequence works quite well, as Amazon notes, but Amazon's critique of the film's ending is simply way off base. The last image -- Nichole reading to the children the night before the crash and then walking toward the window where a light from the &quot;sweet hereafter&quot; reaches out to her -- shakes one to the core.It's fashionable to criticize a film in comparison to a book, especially one as good as Banks' novel. But there is no need. Banks has created a terrific read that stays with you after the final page. But Egoyan has created a masterpiece in his own right, bringing Banks' novel to the screen as well as anyone could.It is so completely rare to read a book so good made into a movie so good. I simply wish Amazon had recognized Egoyan's remarkable accomplishment as they did Banks' great read."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"&quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; startled me as, I guess, all books which you're not expecting to be as good as they are do. It is an amazing story, with lines that made me have to put the book down and say to myself, &quot;Wow.&quot; Its depiction of a town trying to rebuild itself after a bus crash kills 14 of its children and the themes it presents, such as the human need to blame, are haunting. I find myself seeing its themes in my everyday life--that's how well Russell Banks depicts who we are and why we are. There are so many things I could say about the book, but that would take up more lines than would probably be appropriate. I simply recommend this wonderful story to everyone, and suggest that they read the book before they see the movie--the movie is also beautifully done with right-on performances, but it misses things that only can be found in the book that are worth knowing."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"...He's a modern day Ernest Hemingway, very simple but incrediblly complex. It's full of love, humour, mystery, tension, soul searching and double edged swords. It's big city meets small town and it's a clash of two different worlds.Billy Ansell is one of the most dynamic characters ever in the rpinted word. He suffers from the death of his wife, but has to add to that the death of his kids. He remains a champion of human decency when he deals with Mitchell Stephens, as complex a character can get without carrying his skeletons with him instead of leaving them in the closet.The story is simple and complex, thus comes the movie tagline, \\"There is no such thing as the simple truth.\\" The simple truth is, however, that this is one of the greatest English language novels of the last 20 years. It receives my highest recommendation possible."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"I read this book a month ago, and have since read three other books, but this one still resonates with me. Every time I drive down a snowy Connecticut street, I think of Dolores and her bus full of kids. This work is brilliant. It's narrated from four points of view, each one utterly engrossing. I haven't seen the movie and have no interest in doing so. Russell Banks brings us to so many moral questions, so many human emotions, so many lives, that I feel enriched, saddened, and even transformed by his art. How could the movie match that? The overall theme of this work is loss and transformation, within a sparkling narrative of a terrible event. Read it."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"This book is a quick read and keeps your attention throughout, but at the end I found it unsatisfying. The author weaves an interesting, though tragic, story, which leaves the reader heading hopefully towards an exciting finish. But the ending left me empty because it seemed like I missed it. The story had no climax; it just sort of ended. Based on this, I would not recommend the book."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"Billy Hansel Billy Hansel, widower and father of two was the only person to witness the accident. He was, as Dolores Driscoll described him, \\"Smart and charming. And a successful businessman too.\\" She also noted that \\"in High School he was the boy other boys imitated and followed, quarterback of the football team, president of his senior class, et cetera.\\" \\"A man with a mission\\", a natural leader and \\"maybe the most liked man in town\\" as Wendell put it, Billy Hansel worked hard long hours to sustain himself and his children. When his children were taken away from him, the pain was simply too much to cope with as an overwhelming feeling of solitude and perhaps self-pity swept him off his feet and into excessive drinking habits. The night after the accident, Billy Hansel described his emotions in the third person saying: \\"[...] he has suffered an irretrievable loss, has discovered that he is inconsolable, and [...] has removed himself from normal human contact.\\" In fact, this is exactly what he did; he removed himself from normal human contact through hi alcohol abuse more than a conscious decision on his own part. Hansel was neither a victim nor a strong advocate of stereotyping. As far as I could tell, the only preconceptions he had were about lawyers whom he regarded and spoke of as \\"shysters\\", \\"bastards\\", and \\"sonsofbitches\\". He felt they were driving the town \\"completely crazy\\" and making it a \\"hateful place to live\\". Fortunately, Hansel' s stereotyping does not compare in any way with my own experience. I feel that the author's intent was on showing that accidents sometimes really are accidents and that striving to find a culprit will only make things worse. Even though one of his characters, Mitchel Stephens does not believe in accidents, Russell Banks puts the emphasis on the importance of forgiving and how everyone benefits from it that kind of attitude. The town went from being a vengeful place to a returning to a relatively normal place to live. As we see through different eyes with each chapter, \\"The Sweet Hereafter\\" has shown me how bitter attitudes can hurt and how in times when death seemingly prevails, it is more important to focus on the living."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"This book is based on a lack of understanding of the law.The school board and town, (their insurance companies) are liablefor the accident...regardless if the bus driver was negligent becauseof speeding or a sudden swerve.

Being a psych major as I am you would think I might find that interesting, well I didn't. I guess I was supposed to be reading into the deeper meaning of the book, unfortunately I kept falling asleep right before that could happen. I guess you could say I'm not a fan of cryptic writing. If there's a meaning to be understood why not just put it out there on the surface? I think that most people are afraid of saying exactly what they mean because then it would loose too much of its mystique. I think when you summarize this great deeper meaning it doesn't appear so deep after all.One would assume that when a busload of kids goes flying off a cliff into an icy pond that there might be some repercussions in the community (sarcasm). I think Russell Banks' attempt to aggrandize, overanalyze, and add mystique to the event is futile. He drowns the main story in the pointless whining of his characters. Although I must say I found the whining at times to be more interesting then the continual rehash of the accident.I guess overall you might say I didn't like the book, just incase you didn't catch on to the deeper meaning of my review (more sarcasm)."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"I was assigned to read this book over the summer by my school, and I had to unpleasantly plow my way through this book. I did not enjoy this book at all. The characters got on my nerves SO much; all they did was whine and complain about things not even related to the accident, and I hated the way they thought. I couldn't read this book for more than 30 minutes at a time; it bored me too much. I feel like this book had no point to it at all.

I was amazed at the ease in which Banks portrayed four different characters, each of a different age and extreme personality. Small town life was precisely described down to the different sections(geographicallly and socially) and the many different relationships bettweeen citizens. The tragic event that occurs might have happened to anyone in any town, but with the hidden secrets of Sam dent it becomes unique.

This book may be slow in the beginning, but don't be discouraged. The story soon kicks into high gear and will be very difficult to put down.Russel Banks does a terriffic job in having four of the characters that were involved in the bus accident narrorate the novel. The narrorators are a lawyer whose daughter is a desperate drug addict, a bus driver whose husband is crippled by a stroke, a young girl who is molested by her father, and a father whose wife died of cancer. The bus accident greatly effects these people as well as everyone else in the town. Banks thuroughly describes the character's tragedies so well that anyone would be forced to sympathize with them.All of the characters seem to have some kind of personal problem, which is also problably true for people in real life. The townspeople deal with their problems in many different ways. Some try to forget the accident ever happend while others become very angry and seek revenge. It seems like the community was stable and happy one day and, after the accident, the entire town fell apart and turned into a dark existence.The book was easy to read and understand. The themes include dealing with the death of a child, coping with a child who is a drug addict, sexual molestation, adultry, and many more.Though sad and tragic, The Sweet Hereafter tells a very compelling and pragmatic story.

The change between characters only tells the same story over and over DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!"},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"I must say I really did not enjoy this book. I found it depressing and lacking any significant revelations or conclusions."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"Book Review for \`The sweet Hereafter'This novel by Russell Banks told in the voice of four people, Dolores Driscoll, the driver of the school bus that crashed causing the death of many of the school children, Billy Ansel, a Vietnam veteran and the father of two kids who died in the accident, Mitchell Stephens, a New York lawyer who has come to file lawsuits, and Nicole Burnell a girl on the bus who gets paralyzed in the accident.Hearing each of them tell the story we realize that there is no absolute truth and there are different angles to the same event. We realize that Dolores has driven the bus for many years, and is taking care of a husband who has suffered a stroke. Similarly the New York lawyer is himself estranged from his daughter who though not dead is heavily into drugs and calls him only when she needs money.The novel begins with the events of the day of the accident in this small town in upstate New York, told in Dolores voice. Then like a relay race, the voice shifts to Billy Ansel and he tells the story from the time of the accident to the meeting with the lawyer. Then we hear the lawyer's story and then Nicole from the time of her coming back home after being hospitalized. Backstory is cleverly woven in.This book breaks some of the rules, such as show, don't tell, as a lot of the book is telling but the telling is vivid and drew me right into the head of the characters. Also the other rule to break up and go back and forth between the various characters is not followed as we gets chunks from different people and finally circle back to Dolores, but it works the way it is. That could be because we are moving forward in the year and the events with each narrator and some significant moments like the meeting of Billy and the lawyer are in scene from both their viewpoints. Also all the others in the neighborhood, like Risa who is having an affair with Billy Ansel and whose child has also died and other characters are mentioned in the four narrations and we get to learn about those characters too so we feel like we are seeing a community coping with their loss.The final event is Dolores Driscoll and her wheelchair bound husband back at the country fair in the town of Sam Dent and here we also see Billy Ansel and Nicole Burnell and it is strangely ironic that they are all watching cars crashing against one another. In the end will the town forgive Dolores or not that is answered right at the very end.This book is definitely worth reading, I was surprised a couple of weeks later how the book has remained with me. And it makes us think, about the question asked in the book back flap, when the worst things happen who do you blame?"},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"This book is haunting. Although it is a primarily bleak tale, you won't be able to put it down or get it out of your head once you are finished. Banks does a great job of presenting each chapter from a different character's view and the reader really becomes invested in the story. It makes me want to read more of his work!"},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"'Sweet Hereafter' is my first novel from Russell Banks and it surely won't be my last. The reasons are quite clear. In 'Sweet Hereafter' the author employs excellent dialog and fine characterizations to fully capture the rural setting of local tragedy (a fatal school bus crash). The plot itself is very basic, perhaps too basic, but not overly familiar. Normally such books don't interest me but give me excellent writing and I'll read anything.Bottom line: the writing skills of the author trumps a plain Jane and morbid little story. Recommended."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"I loved the story so much I researched the movie to see if it's good too. It seems as the movie watchers who did not read the book missed quite a bit although the film has good reviews.OK back to the book which has quite a few elements that I like. The characters and their relationships are very well, thought out. It takes place in New York State. The descriptions are so well written I could see the places. I thought each page is full of intrigue & surprises. The romantic encounter I expected never happened. Oh for a second book with that encounter!"},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"The Sweet Hereafter by Russell Banks is an intriguing book. I could hardly put the book down when I was reading it. The book is told through the viewpoints of four different people who, under normal circumstances, would not have had anything in common. Banks is able to make the characters come alive; you can really feel the characters' emotions. As you learn more about the accident, which is pivotal to the story, you can really see the characters evolve. For instance, Billy Ansel had seen death before the accident with his wife, but he still had his children. Right before the accident, all he had been thinking about was his illicit affair with Risa. He really didn't realize what happened; he wasn't thinking about his kids. The night before the funeral, however, he showed emotions, indicating that his character has changed. Now he doesn't even speak to Risa. People all throughout the town of Sam Dent felt the need to blame somebody for the accident. Everyone felt that they needed to blame someone else, even if there isn't always someone to blame. Sometimes things just happen, and you need to accept that and learn from it, but don't dwell on who's to blame. I felt that Russell Banks did an excellent job of capturing the feelings of the people in the town of Sam Dent, which were the feelings that most people would feel if something like the bus accident were to happen in their town town. I thought, for instance, that Billy Ansel was 100% correct when he was talking about news people coming into their little town and shoving microphones in the parents' faces instead of letting them grieve. I really enjoyed reading this book and I would recommend it to everyone. I think the book is a real eye-opener, and it makes you think about how you would react if something tragic happened near you."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"I felt that the story was very well presented and quite touching. I think Banks was able to comminicate the details of the accident without being objective. I feel that accidents help people understand themselves better. They need to be opened and explored by the people involved to better see the porblems. I think that Banks did this and was able to prove that accidents are accidents and no one should be blamed."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"have you ever wondered, as you were walking down the street, &quot;hey... i wonder what this person's life is like after our brief encounter?&quot; russel banks is able to capture this query and and answers it in the form of four different perspectives of the same story... beautifully, almost lyrically done. kudos to you, mr. banks."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"Read the book and see the movie.

Banks is truly a craftsman of words, and &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; is remarkable."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"This book is amazing. Its narrative, presented from four utterly engrossing points of view, turns on an awful event, a fatal school bus crash in a small Adirondack town. Every time I drive down a snowy Connecticut street, I think of Dolores, the bus driver, and her bus full of kids. Russell Banks gives us, with his sparkling narration, a brilliant array of moral questions and human emotions. After reading this book I felt enriched, saddened, and thrilled by his art. The overall themes of this work are terrible loss and riveting transformation.

Big time NYC lawyers want to sue someone, of course, but the only witness, one of the surviving kids, points a finger at the one person where lawyers can't go--and the suits are dropped. Banks knows this part of the world and what makes these people tick better than anyone (\\"Affliction\\" has a similar setting), and the book is interesting and well written. Recommended."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"First and foremost, I would like to say that I highly resent the comment about this being a book only for those who like Oprah. This is not because I'm not a huge fan of Oprah (for reasons I won't spew out here), it's just that her literary tastes tend to veer towards the weepy and transparently 'deep. 'The Sweet Hereafter', on the other hand, is a beautifully written and deeply affecting story that is not at all pretentious in the way it presents its themes.Yes, it sounds mind-numbingly depressing, but it's a kind of story where you can just wallow comfortably in the sadness. I know that doesn't sound like a good thing, but it is."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"While the Egoyan film meditates on the divine mysteries of pain and forgiveness, Mr. Banks's novel seems content to simply trinagulate the here-and-now motives of his four narrators. At times the first-person narration falls flat--the characters are a bit too reflective for their own good. Their words are also not sufficiently distinct, tending to follow a script for pushing the plot instead of acting like real people. I was also bothered by the repetition in the narratives of the first meeting between Billy and Stephens. Stephens's recollection of their first meeting is an almost word-for-word retelling of Billy's account. More aggressive editing would have caught this.Only the Dolores Driscoll sections resonate, perhaps because she reflects the author's own voice, and perhaps because she resembles so many people I've known. She probes and reflects on her commonplace but heartfelt ruminations, and obsessively reports on their progress to anybody who might happen to be listening. Often, her reflections humorously miss the point, but she is so overwhelmed by calamity that you know she has to stop the flow in order to cope."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"an incredible book about an accident and how it altered a small town and it's people....truly amazing....I found this book a little hard to read because it's a lot of run on sentences....but unique in that the story is told by many people in the town and their persceptive on the accident. I don't rate it five stars for the subject matter but by the beautiful writing style....This book will leave your heart a little sad but it's a must read!"},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"I enjoyed the way Banks set up the chapters, the story line and the mini plots within the story which all seemed to gel by the last chapter. Perhaps what drew me to this in the first place was tone- 19 children die in a bus accident. As a mother of a child who died, perhaps I was searching for common ground. It really doesn't exist as you are in a world of your own. But the book was very well written nonetheless."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"From the perspective of a college freshmen, the book \\"The Sweet Hereafter\\" told a very interesting story. Banks, the author, was able to keep my attention throughout the entire book. This is sometimes hard to do considering I would usually rathar be watching t.v. or taking a nap than reading. When something tragic happens, like that which happened in the book, the same question always arises; who is to blame? This is something that is expected these days. In this story, Banks, in my opinion, answers this lingering question indirectly. Most of the time the anwser is the same; no one is to blame, it was purely an accident. The people of this small town setting need a scapegoat in order to survive after the accident occurs. Through one of the most prominent characters, Banks, gives them what they need. Although it is not the truth of the matter, it will save the town from a lot of anguish and grief that could be avoided. Other characters think that the only way to survive this particular tragedy, and probably all other tragedies, is to get revenge against someone, anyone, meaning nasty, drawn out lawsuits. In the end, the story proves that life does go on after something terrible happens, and sometimes without so much as one word being uttered the vicitms of that tragedy come together in an unspoken bond. \\"The Sweet Hereafter\\" was a really good book. I reccommend this book for anyone who wishes to read it."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"I read the book because I work in the school bus field as a trainer. I found the book interesting in its character presentation but flawed in the technical area, primarily in the climactic ending where Nicole states the bus was going 75 miles per hour. Even with more more powerful engines and improved drivetrains, today's newest school bus models will not exceed 65 miles per hour under the most ideal conditions such as downhill on an interstate highway with a light load or empty. In addition, there is almost no way a passenger can view the speedometer on the type of bus that was portrayed in the book. I know these are not big things but they did take away from my reading of it."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"The Sweet Hereafter draws you into a small town in upstate New York, Sam Dent, giving you insigt to a tragedy of immense porportions. Sam Dent is a small town on a few hundred, slightly backward people. One cold and frosty morning an event occurs destined to change the lives of everyone in the town forever. The town school bus has a fatal accident, causing each and every person in the town to examine their lives to the point of scrutiny. The book tells the story from the perspectives of four very involved people. Dolores Driscoll is the ill-fated bus driver. She is the slightly self-righteous town gossip who has to bear the guilt of killing all of those innocent children for the rest of her life. Billy Ansel was the father of two of the children killed in the accident and was following behind the bus when the accident occurred. Mitchell Stephens is the lawyer from New York city called up to take this case for the town. And Nichole Burnell is the young survivor who gives an view into the life of a victim. The book was a bit of a snoozer for me because the narrators kept going off on tangents until they had you half asleep. It was sort of like having a chat with Forrest Gump on a bench at the bus stop. Although not nearly as &quot;mind stimulating&quot; as it. It does do a good job at giving different angles on the events that transpired leading up to and after the accident, but it could have used a bit more dialogue and a lot less monologue. Overall, not a nail biter."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"I have no idea where they came up with this title. There is nothing sweet about this book.

I always felt like I was upstate New York while I was reading it. Its a very quick read. Now I will rent the movie."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"The book starts out with a school bus accident involving the children of a small American town near Canada. Russell Banks uses the perspective of four different individuals to tell the story. He begins with Dolores Driscoll, the driver of the school bus. From her perspective, the reader is introduced to the main characters. We also see the crash from her point of view. Next we see the view of Billy Ansel, a widowed Vietnam vet who was following the bus and waving at his twin children at the time of the accident. From him we can see the impact it had on him to lose his children in the bus accident. From there, Banks introduces us to Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, a big time lawyer who has come to cash in on the towns' pain and sufferng. From him we can see an outside perspective on the town and the effect it had on the people when they lost their children. We then see the view of young Nicole Burnell, probably the most heart breaking and eye opening view of them all. We are shown the hurt and pain that she and her family go though after the accident. Before the accident she was a pretty, popular, cheerleader who had her whole life ahead of her, but then she becomes paralized from the accident. From here, Banks again takes us back to Dolores Driscell where we see the town finally starting to recover from the losses and remember life before the accident. This book was not what I was expecting, and I was very surprised by how well it was written. I would recommend it to anyone willing to step out of their own little world and see it from someone else's point of view."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"In response to the book, I felt that the stories were good. Each character showed a completely different perspective on a whole picture. I felt that the author had taken a view of all sides when he wrote this book. In contrast, however, I had trouble with the actual style of writing because the sentences were too long. This did not sway me away from the book, but it did make me a little bored when reading the stories. Dolores Driscoll was the first and last writer. She wrote in the beginning of a typical day in Sam Dent, New York. Her story led me to think of the people she described in her own words. This set a setting for me. Then the next chapter completely through me off, which was good. I understood her view of the people in the town, and then of Billy Ansel's. The next chapter was the lawyer, Mitchell Stevens, Esquire. His thoughts were of a man not at all interested in this town the way the rest of the people were. Then Nicole Burnell. Her story was not at all what I expected, but was a superb opinion of a little 14-year-old girl injured in the accident. Delores came once again with a different view. Each of the characters definitely was changed after the accident. Although I personally liked the book, I felt that the writing structure could be improved. The whole book, even when told in different characters, had the same sentence structure. The sentences were sometimes an entire paragraph long. There were commas everywhere connecting sentences. I do not believe the sentences were run-ons, but they read like it. Sometimes I would get bored reading all the details that would go on, and on. If this structure was better, the story could have had higher ratings. In conclusion, I feel that the book was great at showing the whole picture. Every side seemed to be looked at. Was there a true person to blame? Not really, but the book shows the ways people can contort the truth."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"I have long appreciated Russell Banks, and on reading the Sweet Hereafter it rapidly became one of my favorite novels. There are several truly remarkable skills Banks has as a writer that shine in this novel. First, as a woman, I find his male characters especially nuanced, complex, and sympathetic. He doesn't write \\"flat\\" men. It's hard for a writer of the opposite gender to get the \\"voice\\" right, to make it feel authentic. But it's also hard to do that for your own gender, and many books I've read whether written by men or women have male characters who are simply not as complex, thoughtful, multifaceted as Banks men. The male psyche is so often oversimplified. So Banks writes the male psyche very well.Impressively, he still also does a solid job with the female psyche, in that his women, while not as well fleshed out as his men, are still fully realized characters also complex. He does women well and men excellently. To be able to write complex sympathetic characters of both genders is a gift.The other thing I love about Banks is that he paints portraits with his novels. Portraits of the emotional circumstances in which real people live. All of the contradiction, the dual desires, the ambivalence, come to life, and this portrait seems to be the end goal in and of itself. Not some tidy plot driven ending. But to \\"get it right\\" emotionally for the characters. He doesn't make the endings nice and tidy and happy for you, here or elsewhere, just to make you feel satisfied. Life is messy, people often don't end up any more certain than when they began on a trajectory. Russell Banks doesn't force his novels into an unnatural clean arc. Its messy. Right and wrong are not so clear, although there are still guiding virtues. Things are not black and white; good people have their reasons for doing not so good things. Generally outcast people, those who have been shunned for doing things we consider unsavory or even wrong, are always more complex than we like to think, and often have their own nobility in hidden streaks. These are the people of his novels.I read the Sweet Hereafter while emotionally paralyzed by a tragedy in my own life. A tragedy not as life altering as that faced by the people of the novel, but on the same scale for me personally due to its philosophical implications and the way it changed how I viewed the world. And when I read the Sweet Hereafter, I immediately identified with the character Mitchell Stevens. Everyone hates the ambulance chasing lawyer, but here is a lawyer driven by demons to chase the ambulance, and to do his damndest to get others to chase them too. Not for money. To feed his demons. To try to salve his own psychic trauma. He really believes that someone is to blame. And he may not know who, but he will find them. Because he wants someone to blame for his own losses. But it's not that simple. And in this novel, we see that the person who may or may not be responsible for the tragedy isn't a unidimensional character. And in many ways is the saddest victim of the tragedy.Nothing ties up tidy for us. No one will ever be the same. If they are shells of the people they used to be, so is their town. One tragedy can change everything, for everyone forever. And as you sift through the dust, you may not find the bad guy you want so badly to find in the ruins, thinking somehow justice against him will heal the wound. It's just not usually that easy.No one paints this kind of emotional portrait like Banks. And that's where he leaves us. With an uncomfortable but potentially transforming truth, an uncomfortable but potentially transforming portrait of ourselves. Which will only be transforming if we have the ability to see it honestly for what it is."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"Russell Banks is a master.

The different narratives help enhance the telling of the story. Each character is so unique and true to form. The writing is sparse yet vast. I really felt transported to the cold winter woods of the Adirondacks, like in a Dreiser novel. I didn't want the book to end, but I felt compelled to read until the very end. The novel poses many questions about relationships and perceptions.

Excellent thought-provoking reading."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"The storyline of The Sweet Hereafter is: There is a school bus accident in a small town in upper New York state. Most of the town's children on the bus are killed. The book relates the events leading up to the accident and what follows after the accident from the perspective of four characters: the bus driver, a father who witnessed the accident and whose children died in the accident, a lawyer who comes to town to try to start a class action lawsuit and a student who has survived the accident.As the story unfolds we discover that there are many, many secrets in this small town. Some relatively minor, some very disturbing. Lives are uncovered and changed. Friendships are affected. Divisions in the town occur. And a question is persistent throughout the book: When the worst thing you can imagine happens, whom do you blame?Turns out that this book was based on a real incident that occurred in Alton, Texas, in 1989. There was also a movie made based on the book, which I took out from our local library. I thought it followed the book for the most part but was not a fan of it.All in all, I thought this was a good book, a good discussion and I'm glad I had the chance to read it."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"This is a great book that blew me away with its many layers of story and the credible tension that Russell Banks was able to create out of such a simple premise, it almost reads like a mystery. He writes in such a way that he opens up the small town of Sam Dent and deposits you right in the middle of it leaving you feeling like you personally know all the characters or might have once lived there yourself. It is also an interesting character study and from my experience realistic in the way each person here deals differently with grief; Some self-destruct while others find new strength, all want to lay blame somewhere and everyone in this once innocent town is irreversibly changed. Banks manages to show all sides of these ordinary characters, even the negative and because this was written from 4 different perspectives almost anyone will be able to find a piece of themselves in one of them. Ultimately it will leave you looking at yourself and those around you differently because every town has its secrets.As I said the story is simple; One snowy morning a school bus goes off the road and into the frozen waters of a small American town, 14 children are lost in the accident and its citizens are confronted with life's most disturbing question when the worst happens who do you blame and how do you cope. We then enter surviving school bus driver Deloris Driscoll's head as she recalls the morning of the accident and introduces us to the town and its members while making stops along the bus route.We then switch to widower and war veteran Billy Ansel who is following the bus on his way to work, his story is heartbreaking and full of secrets. The narration then turns to New York lawyer and pariah Mitchell Stevens who has come to Sam Dent like all the other lawyers and media to try and make a buck off the tragedy, surprisingly I really enjoyed his view as you can\`t always judge a book (lawyer)by its cover. We also hear form 14 year old Nicole Burnell, who before the accident was a cheerleader and the town princess and is now confined to a wheelchair, her part in the story shocked me.I highly recommend this and now hope to see if the movie can live up to this amazing book."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"As a high school teacher, I think our kids seek authentic stories and issues above all--yet so much of what is out there is cynical and discourages their own sense of power in the world. This book offers an accessible, engaging story about a perfectly ordinary tragedy (if such a thing exists), around which characters familiar to any modern teen converge in the hope of establishing responsibility, or perhaps more of assigning guilt. At the center of the tale is a young girl whose life has been changed, for better as well as for worse, who slowly realizes that she holds the power to perpetuate the pain or to begin the healing. Her choice angers some powerful adults, but affirms our better instincts and validates the notion that young people can change the world."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"I rented the movie the Sweetheafter, and found it haunting.

He knows his territory. Also an excellent examination of the ways a disaster can destroy a small tightly-knit community. A good read."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"I know this space is usually reserved strictly for a review of the book, but since Amazon's review of \\"The Sweet Hereafter\\" makes many references to the clear superiority of the novel over the film, I feel obliged to briefly respond. And to passionately disagree.The movie is not merely good; it is an outright masterpiece.Banks' novel is strong and insightful on so many different levels, and I would have thought, by the very nature of its structure, that it would have been virtually impossible to bring to the screen. But Atom Egoyan has been able to write and film one of the most intensely intelligent screen adaptations I have ever seen. And Amazon's review about it completely misses the bus.Banks brings to life his remote and icy small town clearly and realistically, and there is not a false note in his portrait of his characters or the isolated world they inhabit. Although we hear four different narrators throughout the story, the book always seems to be viewing its devastated people in Sam Dent from high above, as if they are under a microscope in their struggles to survive the worst that life offers.Whereas Banks uses literary skills to reflect on his larger themes, Egoyan uses the breathtaking skill of his filmmaking to come up with a comparable work. \\"The Sweet Hereafter\\" is one of the great films of the '90s; like the book, it is not about death but about surviving the incomprehensible death of those closest to you.Egoyan manipulates time in his film -- not as a gimmick but for similar purposes that Banks chooses various narrators to see some of the same events from different perspectives. Both works avoid using the bus crash as a literary or cinematic climax in any way; their profundity is in the examination of coping with loss, not about the loss itself.Egoyan, of course, isn't able to give all of the background that Banks so beautifully captures about his characters. But his choices of what to include and how to include them are impeccable. The lawyer's \\"future\\" airplane trip where he meets Zoe's old friend is a perfectly believable and moving way to include the story of Zoe nearly dying as a child. In some ways, it serves as the muted centerpiece of the film.Egoyan's choice of having Nichole read the poetic fairytale to the children she babysits is another brilliant inclusion not in the book; it adds unforgettable resonance to the work.The books' last sequence works quite well, as Amazon notes, but Amazon's critique of the film's ending is simply way off base. The last image -- Nichole reading to the children the night before the crash and then walking toward the window where a light from the \\"sweet hereafter\\" reaches out to her -- shakes one to the core.It's fashionable to criticize a film in comparison to a book, especially one as good as Banks' novel. But there is no need. Banks has created a terrific read that stays with you after the final page. But Egoyan has created a masterpiece in his own right, bringing Banks' novel to the screen as well as anyone could.It is so completely rare to read a book so good made into a movie so good. I simply wish Amazon had recognized Egoyan's remarkable accomplishment as they did Banks' great read."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"The Sweet Hereafter is a compelling novel of a small town in America that has to overcome a devasating tragedy.The novel is written from the perspective of four completely different narrators which is what makes the story so interesting. The way Russel Banks portrays each character can make even the most insensitive reader identify with them. The language he uses can make you almost hear the character speaking and makes them seem more realistic. A reader from any cultural background can read this book and get the feeling of a small town in America and sympathize with the characters in it. The novel is written so well that every point of view can be clearly seen even when the characters are expressing some of their negative attributes.The way the people deal with the accident is what is so compelling because their lives can be altered in a positive or very negative way depending on how they deal with the influx of big city lawyers and media.This novel gives you an in depth look at how ordinary people deal with pain and loss. We see how certain relationships deteriorate and others develop after the tragedy. The way they see each other and the way the reader sees the characters will change drastically from beginning to end.There are themes in this novel for everyone from secret affairs, loss of loved ones, alcoholism, selfishness, divorce and the need to blame others are just a few. Anyone can get involved in this book and will most probably see some aspects of their own lives in it.The outcome of the novel was pleasantly surprising but it is inevitable to have a slight feeling of sadness for some of the characters. It is very realistic but not at all dull, everyone has to read this book!"},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"I was perusing the reviews of this book earlier, and I have to agree that this book is one of Russell Banks' most haunting, despondent, and beautiful pieces of prose. The Sweet Hereafter chronicles the story of four individuals who are struggling with the aftermath of a horrific school bus accident, resulting in the deaths of many schoolchildren riding that morning. The book uses four different narrators; there is Delores, the once tough but eternally optimistic driver who now is consumed by guilt. Another voice is Billy Ansel, the ruggedly handsome widower who witnesses the accident from his truck. With the death of his twin son and daughter, Ansel becomes grief-stricken and shuts out any possibility of redemption, offerd in the form of a personal injury lawyer, who placed blame on the town and offers promise of financial reparitions. The lawyer is Mitchell Stephens, who also is reeling from the \\"death\\" of a child; his daughter has disappeared into a lifestyle of drugs and detox centers. The fourth and perhaps most intriguing voice is Nicole Burnell, a former cheerleader now paralyzed by the accident. She is a crucial witness for Stephens, and her surprising actions reveal ambiguous motives. I can't really reveal too much more about her, but she is the most interesting character in the book, in part because it is never clear why she does what she does. The book also has a heatwrenching epilogue, demonstating that, in a story like this, there can be no neat sense of closure. Rather, the devastation of survival plagues and haunts each member of the community, and time does not heal suffering, but rather prolongs it.Another reviewwer commented that the book was light on dialogue. Indeed, it is. However, I think it is necessary to omit large chunks of conversation, because so much of the book centers on the internal process of grief and the ianbility of hte characters to express their emotions effectively to others. Everything just shuts down, becomes static, and indeed, suspends people in a \\"sweet hereafter.\\" This is an incredible book by one of the greatest contemporary authors in the United States. The film adaptaion is also stellar, with fantastic work by Ian Holm and a parade of talented Canadian actors."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"It's hard to write a review for the novel and the novel alone, for if you've seen the brilliant film adaptation they really mold into one amazing experience. Both the novel and the film add so many layers and compliment one another so well that I'm almost forced to advise everyone who has read the novel to see the movie and visa-versa. It's only in that way that you'll get the whole experience. That's not to say that either is incomplete but that each one is so well-rounded, so well fleshed out and so in tune that it's almost a continuation rather than an adaptation. That said I'll try and focus mainly on Russell Banks novel here but don't get upset it I reference Atom Egoyan's film adaptation more than once.First I want to point out that Russell Banks is a masterful writer. This is the first novel of his that I have read and I'm so impressed that I've already ordered \`Affliction'. His style is so calm and relaxed; it perfectly fit the atmosphere of the story. Some have mentioned this being boring or slow paced. It's far from boring in my humble opinion, but the slow pacing is essential to the feel of the novel. It helps you to get inside the aftermath of the tragedy by fully understanding the mindset of the town. If you've seen the film you'll understand better, for Egoyan also was able to brilliantly capture that pure unsettling serenity that Banks exposes on each and every page.It was a very easy read, not something you long to put down. My only fault with the writing was more the arrangement. There are only five chapters, each with a different protagonist (except the first and last, each being the same) and each chapter is quite lengthy of course with no breaks in text to render a good stopping point. So, with that said it became difficult to find enough time to devote to finishing a chapter. I know that not everyone will have this problem, but for someone who can't seem to set aside more than ten minutes or so to get in some reading it can prove difficult. Don't let this detour you from divulging this brilliant novel. That would be a grave mistake.The story focuses around the small town of Sam Dent after a tragic bus accident leaves 14 children dead, the bus driver, Dolores Driscoll, and a 14 year old student Nichole being two of the only survivors. The novel shifts between four key characters, Dolores, Nichole, Mitchell (a lawyer) and Billy Ansel, a widower who lost his two children in the wreck. The story follows Mitchell as he tries to persuade the town's people to file a negligence suit against the town of Sam Dent. There are conflicting opinions in regard to the suit, to the money and to the accident as a whole and those opinions are fleshed out so well before us. Each of these four human beings has so much history, so much baggage, yet Banks' superb novel never gets bogged down. That is due in large part to his calm and steady style.To me the novel excels in really exposing Mitchell Stephens, the lawyer, for the man he really is. He's troubled by the wayward course his only daughter Zoe has taken and this affects his almost every move. It's almost as if he's fighting for her with every breath, every case, as if she was his only motive. I feel that film adaptation excels in really exposing Nichole's character. That's not to say that Banks doesn't breathe life into the soul he created, but Egoyan's film effortlessly makes her the star, giving her so much substance and character and really fleshing her out in all due subtlety to make her relatable and heartbreaking, the moral center of a tragic accident. The book brilliantly relates Dolores Driscoll's account of the accident as well as the post-accident life in the small town, her treatment by the town's people before and after.Somewhere where the novel and the film seem to tie or at least both deliver valiantly is in the case of Billy Ansel, the Vietnam-War Vet widower who loved his kids more than anything, the man who was trailing behind the bus waving to his children when he lost his whole world with the sight of a crash. His story is heartbreaking. The book though really delivers with its final chapter, something that is not delved into with the film, and it adds a few more layers to both Ansel and Driscoll. So, this is why I can't help but recommend both in the same breath. They both add so much and deliver so well that you truly must read and then watch or watch and then read to grasp the magic in its entirety."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"This is the story of a town that lost many of its children in a schoolbus accident. I read this book a long time ago after suffering a great loss of my own, but rather than making me sadder strangely it made me feel better. Banks communicates the terrible loneliness and isolation that surrounds and overwhelms the parents, the surviving victim, and even an attorney who is planning to sue for damages (who has himself lost a daughter to drugs).Banks' chacters have feelings that are genuine and human rather than stereotypically \\"bad\\" or \\"good.\\" Because the characters are flawed and struggling with those faults, it avoids sentimentality. I identified with many of them.If you have avoided this book because of its tragic story, I urge you, \\"Don't\\". I can think of no other author who can convey the emotions of ordinary people as well as Banks.I would not have believed it, but it made me feel better."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"How does Russell Banks do it? His book THE SWEET HEREAFTER blew my mind. After reading RULE OF THE BONE I was immersed in his style. The Sweet Hereafter is a book about a school bus accident that flips a small tight-knit community in upstate New York, upside down. The tragic event affects the entire town. The story is told from the perspective of four very differnt people. One of them is an over the hill bus driver, the next is a Vietnam vet/towns most liked person in his 30's, the third is a hotshot NYC lawyer and the last is a crippled fourteen year old who used to be the town princess. The book is honest and gritty. It really lets you into the town of Sam Dent. You become a different eye in the commmunity at the turn of every chapter.The characters are realistic and are vividlt portrayed. You get a clear vision of the town, the people in it, and the on-goings. It is simple yet gripping, quiet yet screaming.It posseses you."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"Russell Banks' precisely-crafted novel takes an interesting technique -- 4 different views of the same tragedy by 4 different narrators -- and uses it to show that the same chain of events can yield as many different realities as there are observers.The tragedy in this case -- a schoolbus full of children skids on an icy road and plunges into a frozen, water-filled, abandoned quarry, killing and crippling many of a small town's progeny -- is seen, alternately, as an accident or negligence, an opportunity for justice or revenge, as an excuse for heroics or submitting to despair, by various characters in this drama set in rural New York state, near the Canadian border.Into the fray wades New York City personal injury lawyer Mitchell Stevens -- who has problems of his own. He tries (sometimes in vain) to show the grieving mourners and survivors how they can come together to mete out a ringing punishment against 'those responsible'. It's an uphill battle, and Stevens, an outsider, is met with predictable suspicion by many of the locals. His efforts to convince them of the merits of the case and their view of events don't necessarily coincide, to say the least -- and his attempts to deal with his own personal demons take a toll on his life as well.Through his adept use of multiple narrators -- which in the hands of a writer of lesser ability would be cumbersome -- Banks allows the reader to learn many things about these characters, and watch as they learn things about themselves as well. The success or failure of the case comes down to the testimony of one person, high-school beauty queen Nicole Burnell, left in a wheelchair by the accident, who, as it turns out, has an unforseen card up her sleeve -- and in playing it, shows us all too clearly that even justice has more than one face.Banks is one of America's most skillful contemporary writers -- he has several acclaimed novels to his credit, and a hefty volume of some of the finest short fiction anywhere, THE ANGEL ON THE ROOF, to show for his efforts as well. His stories and characters have a way of intertwining and reappearing -- the wrecked schoolbus from this novel pops up again in his RULE OF THE BONE. He is becoming increasingly recognized for his work, and justly so. THE SWEET HEREAFTER is a poignant look at how everyday people react to and grow through a tragedy such as we all hope we never have to endure. None of these characters is 'perfect' -- and that just makes them more real.This is an entertaining, well-written novel with a nice twist -- and much more satisfying than the film, which wasn't a bad adaptation...but you should definitely read the book first."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"One snowy morning a school bus careened off an embankment, killing fourteen children and leaving the small upstate New York town of Sam Dent forever changed. With literary mastery, author Russell Banks answers the implied question, \\"How does a small community respond when tragedy threatens to destroy its foundation?\\" This intricate story is unveiled by four narrators: the bus driver, a grief stricken father who witnessed the accident, a negligence attorney who feels a compelling connection to the grieving parent's plight, and a teenage girl who was crippled in the crash and who later became the determinative factor in the future of this small community.The juxtaposition of the four separate narrators creates what literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin describes as polyphonic dialogue. Mr. Banks carefully shapes the consciousness of each narrator in a way that invites the reader to fully comprehend the intricate discourse of the people of Sam Dent. After reading one narrator's accounting of an event, the reader may be left with myriad of questions which will often come to light by deductively paying attention to each subsequent narrator. Mr. Banks does not lace the narrations with common underlying themes, but rather highlights the individual differences of each character, thereby allowing the reader to discover the connections and make key realizations as each narration builds upon the last. This creative interplay of multiple voices produces an intriguing, suspenseful, and honest story, leaving the sensitive reader no choice but to consider the totality of the circumstances before passing judgment.The tale begins with the voice of the school bus driver Dolores Driscoll who appears to be thinking out loud while trying to make sense of a traumatic event. Mr. Banks paints Dolores as an honest, caring, and selfless woman, who is saddled with the guilt of being the person responsible for the death of fourteen children, whom she cared for as if they were her own. A brief factual description of this horrendous event would leave most people blaming Dolores, but Mr. Banks humanizes her, thus leaving the reader sympathetic to the poor woman's plight. Putting Dolores first in the order of narrations softens the reader's judgment of her and effectively facilitates an impartial review of the remaining narrations.Billy Ansel, the ex-football hero, Vietnam veteran, cancer-widower, and father of two of the victims was the only witness to the bus crash, as he was following behind the bus while waving to his joy-filled children. His narration, like Dolores's, reads more like a journal than a story. The intimate details of his struggle with losing his wife are heart wrenching and his subsequent motivation to be a positive role-model for his children by remaining strong is admirable. The loss he suffers after the crash evokes nothing but empathy in the reader and Billy's downward spiral becomes not only understandable but seemingly unavoidable. Regardless of his despair, Billy has a strong resolve to move on with his life. When he hears about the attorneys who \\"swam north like sharks from Albany and New York City,\\" Billy becomes enraged. Unlike most people in the town, he did not wish to blame anyone, although Banks seems to hint that Billy's detachment and self-destructive behavior were due in a large part to self-blame.When Mitchell Stephens, Esquire reads about the Sam Dent tragedy in a New York newspaper he immediately makes the long drive upstate. If this story were told in any other way than first person, feeling empathy for the lawyer would be near impossible. However, Mr. Banks masterfully guides the reader through the mind of Mitchell Stephens. Stephens is a father of a drug-addicted daughter and this causes him to feel a connection to people who have suffered terrible loss. Stephens' motto is \\"There is no such thing as an accident,\\" and he asserts that some company must have cut a corner somewhere, which ultimately led to unnecessary death. Mitchell Stephens is angry or more aptly \\"permanently pissed off\\" and it is his mission to \\"ensure moral responsibility in this society.\\" Stephens' conviction convinced at least three families to share in his anger and he formed a class action suit against the school board and the state of New York. His strongest witness was the crippled teenager who survived the accident, but little did he know that she would also prove to be his worthiest adversary.Nichole Burnell was the town princess, beautiful, talented, and intelligent. To the onlooker, she appeared to have a blessed life. Nichole begins her narration with the moment she wakes up in the hospital, and then she leads the reader through the ordeal of learning how to live with a permanently crippling condition. Although her body is damaged, Nichole's mind is sharp and she unhesitatingly discloses her innermost fears and feelings. Nichole's trials and tribulations are further personalized with her revelation of a deep secret, which manifests through passive-aggressiveness. Her tenacity and determination to obtain personal vindication drives her to make decisions that shape how this small-town community will survive the sweet hereafter.Russell Banks skillfully guides his reader through the shattered lives of the people of Sam Dent. Reading this book is like putting together a 5000 piece jigsaw puzzle which upon completion brings tremendous satisfaction. It takes amazing literary aptitude to bridge four separate voices through polyphonic dialogue, but Mr. Banks believably attains this feat in a manner that makes this book a classic must-read for all literary enthusiasts."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"Many often do a film a grand injustice by reading its book first. I did the book a grand injustice by watching its film first. In all fairness, however, I did my best to seperate the images the film had already painted into my mind as I read Banks' tragic novel.This novel deals with the death's of 14 upstate New York school children after their school bus careened down an enbankment on a cold January morning. The town is naturally at a loss and looking to absorb its pain into some sort of retribution. Ultimately though, the town is forced to face its own pain directly at the expense of a few willing sacrificial lambs, and those, people once regarded as pillars of the community.Banks takes us through the perspective of four individuals: the surviving bus driver, Delores Driscoll; a grieving single father named Billy Ansel; a slick and determined New York lawyer named Mitchell Stephens; and a 14 year-old town darling who survived the accident named Nichole Burnell. Each of their perspectives provide insight into the way a town and its survivors grieve or choose to suspend grief and turn inward on a self-destructive frenzy. A town's children, as Delores Driscoll believes, is what holds a place together, and when they are taken away, the foundations of each life is slowly ripped away, scattering everything that once seemed decent and strong.A very good read and I especially enjoyed the last chapter which was not included in the film."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"In Russell Banks' book &quot;The Sweet Hereafter,&quot; he perceptively puts his finger on several basic human truths. He makes the point that every one of us has some deep dark secret, that is life changing, yet it is highly possible that no one knows of it. If someone else does know our dark secret, they are probably just as dedicated, or even more dedicated, than we are to keeping it completely hidden. Every character has some deep dark secret that is never revealed to the town, yet it affects the person's behavior, and even the final outcome of the book. This is illustrated with all four main characters, possibly with the exception of Dolores Driscoll. Another truth he emphasizes is how alone each of us is. Those closest to us really don't know us at all. Each character is alone in their grieving; no one understands what they're going through, though few even bother to try. In addition, he points out the greed of all people. We all have creative kinds of greed that attempt to camouflage it-but deep down it's still there. Some of us are greedy for praise, some are greedy for status, and some are greedy for revenge. Those in the book who were involved in the lawsuit didn't really believe that the state was at fault. They were all simply greedy for some personal gain. The lawyer wanted a vent for his ever-present anger, Nichole wanted revenge on her father, her parents, along with the Driscoll's and a couple of other families, wanted money. Overall, it's a depressing book. Well written, yet not a must read."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"This is an excellent read.

This story is about the aftermath of the crash and the survivors.I enjoy books that tell their tales with a variety of perspectives but I think Russell Banks did a poor job of developing the various voices of his narrators. If you listen carefully they all have the same voice, the same style of speech, or thought with long sentences and several thoughtful phrases interjected for clarification of facts or ideas.I thought that this would be an emotional and moving book, how could it not be given the topic, right? Well, I have to say that I am a total self-admitted sap and this book didn't move me at all.I thought the narrators were flat and somewhat unlikable.I think that Banks would have done better to tell the story of the bus crash's impact on the town in the way that he eludes to it's effects at the end of the book.

His relationship with the \\"lost\\" daughter never improves and, regardless of interaction with a new set of grieving clients, he seems to draw on past performance of either anger or logic in order to get them on board (no pun intended; what! no pun received?--this is a bus movie.) I liked the wife at the motel; nice bod. I liked the girl singer; good voice. I liked the opposing attorney at the deposition; nice pausing between his questions. I didn't like the photographs the hippie mother produced. I didn't like the way the gas station man's kids kept waiving at him. There was one other thing which I liked, but I cannot \\"pin\\" it to a public wall. The elements of locale and weather, though contributory to great visuals, do not significantly tell the story; but, the artful relating of the pied piper throughout was as good a metaphor brought home as I have EVER seen done. Congratulations on that!!! I see the ending differently from all you folks who rate the movie highter than I do, or lower. This girl singer sees her future as one that is diminishing while all the others around her are positioning themselves into fuller life situations from an increase in the money that comes their way with a successful lawsuit. She is not going to give them--and especially her father who, I guess, is incestuous with her--that alternative of wealth and happiness it affords. She is not going to let herself be forgotten among them as they would go (with their new, additional money) into pursuit of recreation, interests, or even relocation. Face it, she does not regret falsely accusing her bus driver; she breaks her earlier oath to only tell the truth, which she breaks as she fabricates the speeding bus section; she is going to dumbfound (further) her speechless father so that his mind turns into mush and regret. \\"Will he let us keep the computer?\\" this teenage girl asks about the attorney who gave her the gift through her parents. She knows the advantage of money but she has her own mild showing of anger that has to be acted out. And act out, she does: she is a good actress. Bye.

I would be interesting sometimes but other times the book would be completely boring. The way that Russell Banks writes through each persons eyes is a really good way to get the story across. He can use four different perspectives in order to compare and contrast points. The first character he writes through is Dolores Driscoll. Near the end of the first chapter she has an accident and crashes the bus that she is driving a full load of kids in. The next chapter takes you through the eyes of Billy Ansel. His point of view is kind of dark and secretive. He tells what is behind his life and why he didnt exactly &quot;see&quot; the bus crash. Mitchell Stevens takes over the third chapter and seems to not like this town one bit. He couldnt care less about the people living in it also. The fourth chapter is told by someone who was in the actual accident. Her name is Nicole Burnell. Banks gives us some good thoughts about what it is like to have a crippling illness. As in the first, the last chapter takes place with Dolores as the narrator. I recommend this book if you are in to strongly developed plots and multiple points of view. As long as you can get past the boring first chapter then you will be pleased with this book."},{"Title":"Sweet Hereafter: A Novel","review":"Why is this author so reverred? As an attorney, I was totally turned off, and could no longer suspend my disbelief in this syruppy nonsense of a novel, especially when he got to the lawyer's story which was so unbelievable as to make me angry enough to throw this book against the wall. First, so a bus went over a cliff killing some kids. That's original fodder for a novel? No one else thought that was emotional enough of a subject to write about? And then the lawyer comes and commits all kind of ethical violations (in person solitication is unethical) and is going to pursue a \\"class action\\" lawsuit? Huh? No, he would represent each kid's estate and try and get something. Only thing is, these cases are not normally million dollar cases. Kids just don't generate much money in lost wages.

It's a MUST READ for Card fans or anyone who's read the prequel &quot;Seventh Son&quot;."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"At the end of Seventh Son, Alvin goes off to become a prentice blacksmith. Red Prophet is about what happens instead. It's very slow going at the start, as Card has to introduce us to a whole new set of characters including a couple whose names we know, but not in this form: Napoleon, Andrew Jackson, and William Henry Harrison. The three are presented in a very negative light, as they are all anti-Red, but at the same time they are working toward opposite goals.Nevertheless, I'm reading this series for the interest I have in the character of Alvin Miller, Junior (Alvin Maker), so this becomes a bit of a trial. It is, in fact, not until around page 90 that Alvin is even mentioned, and he doesn't become lead character again for some time later. Taleswapper, his mentor, doesn't show up again until two-thirds in -- albeit very mysteriously.Red Prophet, however, is still a solid continuance of the story, even though it is presented as tangential. Alvin, with the help of Ta-Kumsaw, Taleswapper, and a former &quot;likker-Red&quot; called Lolla-Wossiky -- Ta-Kumsaw's brother -- who becomes the title character and changes his name to Tenskawa-Tawa, discovers ever more about his abilities, including that his half-Red, half-White soul allows him to do things that either side cannot. We get to see him heal a lot, and perform new feats of natural magic while confounding the Reds (who can usually sense the Whites' hexes, but not Alvin's).All in all, Red Prophet is a good entry in the series and gives us a lot more information than we had before. However, it doesn't flow like Seventh Son did, and it was a struggle to get through; the suspense quotient just wasn't there. If the next book (Prentice Alvin) is this difficult to finish, I may not get through the series at all."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"This was a great novel.

I'm writing this after completing the entire series. This was the worst of the bunch."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"Book II of Card's Alvin Maker fantasy alternative history of frontier America covers some of the same ground as in Book I, Seventh Son, but now through different eyes. Rather than the mostly idyllic and rational vision of the white man's world-that-was-or-might-be, centered on Alvin's family, this story mostly gives us the Red man's view of white oppression versus working to live together. White's forest clearance vs. Red's forest custodianship is the most powerfully expressed metaphor of the contrast, while the black, Unmaker, rivers run through. Certain central events in Alvin's numinous awakening to his powers in the first novel are now seen from an unsuspected \\"other\\" side, not that of the Devil as the intolerant Rev. Thrower would have it, but from the native Shaw-Nee or Kicky-Poo side of the rivers. This book includes a version of Tippecanoe, the massacre that made William Harrison our President, that chills the blood. Card has an especially different take on liberty-loving Lafayette, an associate here of Napoleon rather than dead Washington! Really, these amazing shifts in view on American political icons are one of the great appeals of this series.The other appeal, of course, is that Card is an imaginative teller of tales. He infuses this tale with a mythic, sometimes elegiac and mystical, quality, despite dialogue cast in backwoods provincial patois. Card is imagining a more hopeful frontier experience, among Hoosier \\"hill-billys,\\" where the green hope of the Reds and their Napoleon is crushed finally. The story has become fiercer, bleaker and more desperate. It can be hard going because attention is not always on the central character, but digresses into sweeping quasi-historical tangents that only eventually feed back in to the \\"main story\\"--if that really is Alvin. I suspect the more you know of frontier history in the old Northwest Territory (after the East Coast Revolution and before the Cowboy Frontier of the West), the more fun these stories will be. That adds a level of detection to the interest of the story. The similarity here to Card's totally brilliant ENDERS GAME is the coming of age of another boy, who also struggles with \\"swarms\\" and powers whose strength is only slowly revealed."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"RED PROPHET is the second book of Orson Scott Card's &quot;Tales of Alvin Maker&quot; and perhaps the best book in the series (out of the five released so far). It has unforgettable events, an epic sweep, and gives a sobering reminder of how white settlers wiped out the Native Americans.For the first forty pages the reader is introduced to the world outside of the frontier town of Vigor Church, where most of the first book SEVENTH SON was set. There is a glimpse at the French Canadians in this alternate history, and the black heart of one William Henry Harrison, who in our world became president after his slaughter of the Indians at Tippecanoe. The novel's main plotline then begins with Alvin's setting out from Vigor Church to Hatrack River, the place of his tumultuous birth and where he now will become an apprentice smith. He is accompanied by his brother Measure and it isn't long before they are captured by Choc-Taw hired by Harrison to smear the reputation of the Red prophet Tenskwa-Tawa (formerly Lolla-Wossiky) and his brother Ta-Kumsaw. Alvin and Measure survive their capture and are rescued by Ta-Kumsaw. Then, on the shores of Lake Mizogan, Alvin begins to learn of his destiny as a Maker and the incredible city which he must build.And this is only the beginning. RED PROPHET takes us over a wide array of places and shows us incredible characters and sweep of history. There is so much here that stays with the reader long after the novel ends, such as the anger of the townsmen at Tippecanoe, Alvin's travels all over this wide land, Eight-Face Mound, and Becky's mystical loom. Card has triumphed in creating such an enchanting novel.While The Tales of Alvin Maker isn't of the highest quality in terms of prose, I'd certainly recommend this series, especially because RED PROPHET is part of it. This installment is not only captivating, but it also spurs one to read more about this era of American history, when settlers and Native Americans violently clashed."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"This was a wonderful book that deserves wider attention. It is set in an alternate early America, during the time of the Tecumseh and the Indian Wars. As much a frontier western as it is a fantasy, this novel will delight fans of both genres.Card is an excellent writer who weaves his story with moral and religious overtones. He exposes the best and worst of the frontier Americans, as well as objectively showing the impossible and inevitable conflict with the Native Americans. Card doesn't ignore his characters. Alvin, Tecumseh (renamed Ta-Kumsaw) and his brother, the Prophet, are all deep and vividly portrayed characters. And William Henry Harrison, notorious in history for being the president with the shortest term, is portrayed here as the darkest of men.If you want to read this book, you will have to read the first in the series, The Seventh Son, also a very good novel, but as you read it keep in mind that you have this one to look forward to. The Red Prophet is a well-written, highly entertaining and original story that ranks among the best fantasy fiction available."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"Red Prophet lives up to the expectations that I had after reading The Seventh Son. All the wonderful things that I said about the first book continue to apply. We get to see a \\"what-if\\" America where magic actually works, and our history is revealed in alternate ways (like George Washington having been executed at the start of the revolution). This series has been a lifeline for me in the fantasy genra.The good of Red Prophet:1) Alvin is finally coming into his powers a little. No more accidental board splitting - now he runs to the melody of greensong and goes to places where no white man has ever been.2) In this book, we run into historical celebrities like Napoleon, the Marquis De La Feyette, more from William Blake (Taleswapper), Andrew Jackson, and Tippy-Canoe Harrison. Its neat seeing the writer's interpretation of these historical figures, and they were well done, if not completely accurately (as the author states about Harrison, for example).3) The characters are never, every one dimensional. The good guys aren't all good, and the bad guys - even the worst guys - have limits to their vileness. In fact, there's an ever-present feeling of the power of redemption throughout this book which I found appealing. I kept hoping that certain people would rise to the occasion - no spoilers though!The bad of Red Prophet:1)I would have liked to see even more of Taleswapper. He's the most interesting side-character in the entire series. I think Card avoids heavy usage of him because it requires incredibly diligent writing, and its just plain difficult. And I totally appreciate his work here.2) I was disappointed with Alvin's dad and brothers when they did \\"a certain act\\". I thought that it was out of character and not really believable, and thus I felt led along a path, patiently counting the pages until the believable story began again."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"Orson Scott Card has created a captivating alternate world of colonial America: a world rich in magic, peril, and culture.One of these cultures is the Reds, as Card calls the Indians. One of these Reds is a whisky-red named Lolla-Wossiky and he is under the tyrannical care of the white Governor Bill Harrison. Lolla-Wossiky manages to steal a keg of whisky, a necessary tool for his survival, and runs away. He searches for his dream beast, \\"All of life at first is a long sleep, a long dream. You fall asleep at the moment you are born, and never wake up, never wake up until finally one day the dream beast calls you\\" (Card 63). He finds the beast in a white boy named Alvin. Alvin is the seventh son of the seventh son, which we find out in the first book of the series, which is appropriately titled Seventh son.With this order of birth come certain knacks, supernatural abilities, and attributes. Alvin is only eleven at the beginning of Red Prophet and is yet unaware of his powers, but Lolla-Wossiky finds him and is able to see his potential.Lolla becomes Alvin's dream beast and teaches him a powerful lesson on the administration of his powers. Alvin, in turn, is able to be Lolla's dream beast and cures him of \\"the black noise\\". Lolla-Wossiky is then able to accept his destiny as a leader of Red men. \\"He would call the Reds together, teach them what he saw in his vision, and help them to be, not the strongest, but strong; not the largest but large; not the freest, but free\\" (Card 98). Lolla-Wossiky becomes the Red Prophet and his name changes to Tenskwa-tawa.Alvin's life is in danger so his parents send him to Hatrack River to be a blacksmith's apprentice. On the road to his new life, Indians, who were hired by Harrison to torture white boys, stirring the whites against the Red Prophet's people, capture Measure and Alvin. Alvin uses his powers to keep them from harm but the Red Prophet senses their danger and sends his brother, Ta-Kumsaw, to save the boys' lives. Ta-Kumsaw takes the boys back with him to see his brother. Alvin and the Prophet are reunited and Alvin is taught and informed of his future. Alvin is then sent to accompany Ta-Kumsaw on his crusade against the white man. He learns to understand the ways of the land; he learns to understand the Red man. He is so in tune with the land and with the people that at the end of his journey with Red men Ta-Kumsaw tells him, \\"If all White men were true like you, Alvin, I would never have been their enemy\\" (Card 304).Red Prophet is dripping with Archetypes. Alvin is the young hero, the only one who can save the world from being unmade. As Joseph Campbell states in his book A Hero With a Thousand Faces, \\"the \`call to adventure'-signifies that destiny has summoned the hero and transferred his spiritual center of gravity from within the pale of his society to a zone unknown. This fateful region of both treasure and danger may be variously represented: as a distant land, a forest, a kingdom underground, beneath the waves, or above the sky, a secret island, lofty mountaintop, or profound dream state; but it is always a place of strangely fluid and polymorphous beings, unimaginable torments, superhuman deeds, and impossible delight\\" (Campbell 58). Alvin also goes into the belly of the whale when he goes with Ta-Kumsaw into the Red man's world, \\"The idea that the passage of the magical threshold is a transit into a sphere of rebirth is symbolized in the worldwide womb image of the belly of the whale. The hero, instead of conquering or conciliating the power of the threshold, is swallowed into the unknown and would appear to have died\\" (Campbell 90).Alvin is helped in his journey by Taleswapper, a wanderer who trades stories with those he meets. Taleswapper is very wise and is able to help Alvin realize his destiny. A young girl named Peggy also aids him. He does not know of her existence or her role in his life, but she is always aware of him and keeping him safe.Card is not as opposed to allegory as C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien. He openly states in his introduction his thanks to \\"my great-great-grandfather Joseph for the stories behind the story in this book.\\" He is speaking of Joseph Smith. The similarities in the lives of Alvin and Joseph are prominent in the novel: Alvin is Joseph Smith's brother's name, Joseph hurt his leg the same age as Alvin, Measure and Hyrum Smith share many similarities. Yet, as author Michael Collings says, you do not have to be a Mormon to understand the book, \\"Card is not a \`Mormon' writer. He is a writer who is a Mormon. . . He never sets out to preach, to proselytize, to convince\\"The fantasy themes in Red Prophet are subtle. It almost seems that Red Prophet is a historical novel but for the knacks, charms, hexes, and beseechings that really work. They use their knacks to build, to protect, and to heal. There are special knacks that only certain people possess: a spark can start fires with their minds; a torch, which is Peggy's knack, can see people's heartfires, and the rarest is a maker, the last maker was Jesus Christ and the next is Alvin.Colonial America never seemed so captivating as in Orson Scott Card's alternate world of the Red Prophet."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"this was a FANTASTIC follow up to Seventh Son. I found it extremely moving, and at certain key points, i even became teary eyed. i thought it was incredibly interesting how OSC incorporated historical figures into his version of revolutionary/developing America. really cool. Red Prophet and Seventh Son are my favorites in the series so far."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"Card's second novel in the Alvin MAKER series (see SEVENTH SON)Focuses more on national events than the simple tale of the boy, Alvin Miller, in early America. In this alternative world, religion proves but one of many factors directing men's lives: superstition, folklore, and forces undreamed of by most men. The Unmaker is stealthily at work, rending more than any Maker can create or restore. Folks have special talent too: to ward, to fend and to hex, and to doodlebug. A Spark can set fires with his mind; a Torch can predict the future, or several possible versions. How will Alvin be expected to help mankind?In this revised geographical North America many forces are working viciously for war, with only a few urging peace. The Indians themselves (called Reds) are divided on this epic controversy as two brothers seek to attract increasing numbers of their own people to their respective causes; one to uniteall Reds to fight the white men and drive them back across the sea; the other to live with whites in peace.. The Prophet has his visions and his duty, as does the war leader, but they both come to respect the ten-year-old boy who senses the greensong of the land beneath their feet, who learns to walk in Indian ways.Meanwhile the French and English struggle for control of the New World, where Americans exercise their fledgling democracy. This tempestuous mix is further poisoned by the personal schemes of Governor William Harrison and Senator Andy Jackson, with their own private agendas of power and revenge. How can a mere boy keep the feuding agents apart and stave off Red massacre? The day Measure and Alvin set of for the lad to become an apprentice blacksmith begins a year of incredible personal growth for both the Miller boys. How can all 4 dedicated protagonists prevent the carnage of Native Americans?&#60;P&#62; Master storyteller Card has woven a fascinating tapestry on his literary loom, with the warp of Fantasy and the woof of History, connecting all with the shuttle of Superstition. Readers who delighted in Alvin's growing awareness in the first novel will eagerly await his entrance after the start of this second book. Darkly brooding, emotionally riveting, this book is for adults of all ages to savor."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"First off, this isn't my favorite Orson Scott Card book. That honor falls to &quot;Ender's Game,&quot; and to a lesser extent the novels that follow it. However, many people consider his &quot;Alvin Maker&quot; series to be just as good, and so I've begun working my way through them.Like &quot;Ender,&quot; Alvin is a gifted child who is destined to play a major role in the events of his world (in this case a magical alternate 19th century America). Alvin's enemy, the Unmaker, is a bit more mystical than Ender's alien enemy, and certainly more evil. On the basis of the first two books of the series, it looks like there may be a few other parallels as well, but not having read the other books, I can't be sure how--or if--these will work themselves out.&quot;Seventh Son,&quot; the first volume of the series, dealt with Alvin's early years and first struggles with the Unmaker. Much of its focus was on tangled family relationships, especially that between father and son. &quot;Red Prophet,&quot; however, is darker and more disturbing. It picks up when Alvin is on his way to become an apprentice blacksmith and paints a broader picture of the history of Indian-White relations in Card's alternate America. Many historical figures, including Napoleon, Mike Fink, and William Henry Harrison, make appearances, although they bear little resemblance to their real life models. Because of a plot intended to upset the fragile peace between Reds and Whites, Alvin spends much of his time as a sort of hostage to Ta-Kumsaw (Tecumseh) and his brother, the Prophet. During this time, he learns more about his own magic, which is as much Red as it is White, and has his first visions of the Crystal City, which it is his destiny to build.There are many effective scenes in this novel--Alvin entering the mound and Becca's loom, for instance. However, I found that the emphasis on the political machinations of the Whites and the Reds made the book drag. When it was good, it was very very good, When it wasn't--well, I got through it. Eventually I'll get around to reading the next volumes too."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"After reading 'Seventh Son' I could not fathom how Orson Scott Card could follow a book o such poignance and brilliance. I now know I should have had faith. 'Red Prophet' is far more dark, and addresses disturbing issues such as racism, religious discrimination and the search for purpose. As 'Seventh Son' a masterwork of Magic Realism. Due to personal preference I disliked elements of the ending, but just when I was unsatisfied by the ending I picked up 'Prentice Alvin' that continues the tale magnificently. READ THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"This sequel was very good, written with the same sytle as the awesome first book. My main problem was the repetetiveness of all the Reds. Okay, we get it, Whites have no feel for the land and the green music, and Reds are the chosen people. It seemed like every other stream-of-conciousness from Ta-Kumsaw was some variatiion on that idea. I also wish that the book had been more about Alvin. Despite these problems, Red Prophet was a very compelling read. It was just cool to see well-known historical figures moved about and manipulated to do things that they never did in reality. Harrison in particular gets the shaft. Also, Ta-Kumsaw's decision to fight the war despite his understanding that the land (which he holds in such high esteem) is against it, was a powerful comment on human nature. Also, Mike Fink's beating of Measure almost made me cry, I had to put the book down and relax for a while. Powerful stuff."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"I've enjoyed all the Ender books and the first Maker, but this one was just weird and seemed forced. Hasn't steered me off the series, but it did make me lose my OSC momentum....I'm reading other stuff for a while."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"As the first volume was sometimes struggling to put together the world (spending less energy to create adventure) this second volume become much more ballanced. The world of Alvin Maker becomes even more interesting, and the flow of events is strong enough not to let you stop reading this book. Excellent work, I wish I could have more of theese kind."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"The second book in the Alvin Maker series is darker than the first but just as thought provoking. Card takes American history and changes it just enough for the reader to wonder what might have been. The entire series is addictive."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"I don't know how much but it jumps from letter being delivered to napoleons betrayal.Flawed product that is charging full book prices.

My rating is for the flaw in the kindle product."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"This book was a disappoitment! I really longed to know what happens next to Alvin, and the characters of the first book, but this book doesn't bring anything new to it! It only raises more questions!Now, then. This still isn't a bad book. I liked the ways the indians were developed, I liked Napoleon's brief visit in the book, and I liked a lots of other things in it. This book would have been far better, if it had been a part of the first book. Still, I liked it so much that it is worth of four stars."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"I just finished Red Prophet and I must say that it's one of the best books I've ever read. The story of Alvin is simply great. It has everything that a good book needs. It's exiting and vividly written. I couldn't let the book out of my hands until I had read it. I sincerely recommend the whole story of Alvin."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"Orson Scott Card is definitively a great story teller. But from my point of view he has three kind of books:1 - When he writes as his characters. He is great when he does it. \\"Ender's Game\\" and \\"Songmaster\\" are the best Scott Card I've read.2 - When he is inspired by other books. \\"The Worthing Saga\\" is the main example of this situation. It's a great story, it's well told but yet when you read it, you may feel like you already knew it.3 - When he is too much of himself. \\"Homecoming\\" series are the main exponent of this. It's like he is trying to convince you about something instead of telling a story.Red Prophet is an example of type 3. The first book is quite better and between types 1 and 3.It is worth the money you pay for it, but is not gonna change you. You may agree or you may not, but won't change your life what is what you really expect from reading."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"Wooden Characters.

It was a good take of how the natives really saw the colonial americans. If you like last of the mohicans you'd probably enjoy this book.Card shows good range as this is a different style of the ethical dilemmas presented in the Enders game series"},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"Originally posted at FanLit.Red Prophet is the second book in Orson Scott Card's THE TALES OF ALVIN MAKER, an alternate history set in a frontier America in which folk magic is real. In the first book, Seventh Son, we were introduced to the main protagonist of the series, Alvin Miller who, because he's the seventh son of a seventh son, is a gifted healer. We meet Alvin as a baby and follow him into boyhood. At the end of the story he has a vision of a shining man who gives him moral guidance.In Red Prophet we learn that the shining man is Lolla-Wossiky, an alternate version of Tenskwatawa, spiritual leader of the Native American Shawnee tribe. His brother Tecumseh is their chief. While Card focused on the religious implications of a magical American frontier in the first book, the focus here is on the interaction between the \\"Whites\\" and the \\"Reds\\" and culminates with The Battle of Tippecanoe.At the beginning of the story, William Henry Harrison, governor of Carthage City, is dealing with the Native Americans his own way -- with poison. He purchases huge quantities of whiskey and sells it to the \\"Whiskey Reds.\\" Because they have a low tolerance for alcohol (it's genetic), they become alcoholics and many die. Andrew Jackson is disgusted with Harrison's sneaky tactics; he wants to do the more honorable thing and just shoot them all.Tecumseh, who realizes that alcohol is killing his people and knows of Jackson's plans, decides to lead his people against the Whites. He allies with the French in Canada, led by the effete Marquis de Lafayette and Napoleon Bonaparte (yes, Napoleon's in America). Lafayette, however, has his own agenda. He secretly loves the idea of democracy and he admires the American spirit. He wants to use Bonaparte to bring democracy to France. (This storyline is amusing, especially when read by the narrators I listened to in Blackstone Audio's version.)Alvin Maker, who is on his way to his apprenticeship, meets Tecumseh and becomes involved with the war. Not only is he instrumental in affecting the outcome of The Battle of Tippecanoe but, with the help of Lolla-Wossiky, the Red Prophet, he sees visions of possible futures and learns more about his powers.Orson Scott Card is a great storyteller and he's got a big imagination. This alternate history is exciting, entertaining, thoughtful, and occasionally humorous. I thought Card's depiction of the Native Americans' magical connection with the land was beautiful and makes for a lovely American mythology. Many \\"Whites\\" who read Red Prophet will feel ashamed at how the Native Americans were treated by our ancestors. Some readers have accused Card of being racist (anti-European), but I didn't feel this way and I noted that Card gives us many Caucasians to admire and shows us that not all \\"Red-White\\" interactions where destructive.Orson Scott Card is particularly good at voice, dialogue, and character nuance. His heroes are capable of doing evil and his villains can have good motives. Characters don't always do what we expect them to and there are times when we might even change our minds about how we feel about them. I look forward to seeing these characters grow throughout the series.I'm listening to Blackstone Audio's productions of THE TALES OF ALVIN MAKER which is performed, in alternating chapters, by Stefan Rudnicki, Scott Brick, and Stephen Hoye. All three of them are excellent readers. I've already purchased book three, Prentice Alvin, and book four, Alvin Journeyman, on audio.Red Prophet, first published in 1988, was nominated for a Nebula and Hugo award. It won the Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"In Red Prophet, Alvin is about ten years old. He's beginning to grow into his powers and as he learns to use them other people take notice. A mentally ill Shawnee named Lolla Wossiky is drawn to Alvin who he sees as his dream beast. When Lolla Wossiky meets Alvin, his illness is cured and Wossiky emerges as a powerful prophet capable of seeing the future.Lolla's brother Ta-Kumsaw also notices Alvin's talents after Ta-Kumsaw rescues Alvin from a group of indians who have joined forces with the evil William Henry Harrison. Harrison, plots to destroy the reds east of the Mississippi. Ta-Kumsaw seeks to unify the reds and with the help of the French led by Napoleon and drive the English from America.Alvin and his brother Measure are caught in the middle.Overall, I thought was very good especially when the compared to the other books in the series.However, there are numerous flaws.Despite this being the second book in the series, it's still not clear what Alvin's purpose is. The story takes place in the early 19th century, so it's not clear why the French are in North America. The French lost all their North American possessions, after the French and Indian War. This is an alternate history, but the author doesn't explain how the French got the North American possessions.The other issue is that Alvin isn't original. A boy superhero is nothing new. Ta-Kumsaw bringing the reds together is an obvious reference to the real life Tecumseh. And Wossiky, an interesting character, but if he also all this power, why did he wait until he was cured by Alvin to use it? Surely, he must have had this power earlier in life. Then Wossiky shows Alvin a Crystal City but fails to tell him why to build it."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"This book was a great read - and as usual, Card is inventive and unorthodox. What appears to be an anti-religious tirade settles into a more considered point of view. Meanwhile there are some interesting diversions into things that actually make a society strong and meaningful, and into issues surrounding native Americans, whilst all the time taking the overall story of a seventh son of a seventh son forward.Not Card's best work, but certainly not his worst either - and well worth reading"},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"The pacing is a lot quicker that Seventh son. You'll have trouble putting this one down if you enjoyed Seventh Son."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"Entertaining historical fantasy. Orson Scott Card obviously put a lot of thought to the alternative historical events not even depicted in the book. This is the most action packed volume in the series."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"Red Prophet is very slow to start. I do not understand why Mr. Card spent so much time talking about Hooch, when it ends up that he is not a major character and serves very little purpose for the plot. However, after the slow start, WOW! This book is so intense that I could hardly set it down. I did not think that it would be better than Seventh Son, but I was very wrong. It is well worth the slow start just read the last wonderful half of this book. You must read this book if you enjoyed Seventh Son."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"I just finished reading this part, and I have to say I love it so much more than the first one. I thoroughly enjoyed the first book although it was a little slow, but after reading this one in comparison it makes the first one seem very slow. After finishing the Ender's Saga I thought it doesn't get better than this, but so far Orson Scott has kept up his standards and I am very impressed in his amazing details of Old America.I Really recommend this second part to anyone who has read the first one. I just hope the rest of the books can live up to what he has created so far."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"The scope of the Tales of Alvin Maker series greatly expands with this book. New characters and places, as well as much deeper insights into the political landscape of the [imaginary] time make this story so much more than the telling of a special child growing up in Vigor Church. Characters familiar to us from our own world history play a much larger role in this book, with William Henry Harisson and Napoleon having the most impact. As with 'Seventh Son', Card relies heavily on vernacular from \\"Ol-timey America\\" to emphasize and bring to life his characters. This also influences the naming of geographical features like rivers and mountains (with the Big Muddy being referred to as the Mizzipy). Some reviewers have complained about this, saying they get tripped up over the vocab, but IMHO it works great and adds life to the story.One very noticeable difference between this book and the previous one is the escalation in the amount of and the explicit nature of violence. OSC has a gift of being able to portray feelings and emotion in a powerful way, as well as being able to paint extremely vivid pictures with his words. A couple of scenes in this book (especially revolving around Mike Fink and Measure) are very graphic and brutal. Some of this material may not be appropriate for young or sensitive readers. This book is definitely more mature and darker than any other OSC books I've read (Ender and Homecoming series). Just a warning.'Red Prophet' opens up by telling the story of the Shining Man that appears in 'Seventh Son', who is known in this book as Lolla-Wossiky, Tenskwa-Tawa, or simply The Prophet. In fact, the first quarter of this book has an overlapping timeline with the first book, telling of broader events occurring while the more personal events of Alvin growing up are happening. The story eventually catches up to where 'Seventh Son' ends, with Alvin setting of to apprentice as a blacksmith. Instead of that, he and his brother Measure find themselves captives of some pretty evil Reds hired by the even more evil William Henry Harisson. The majority of the book follows Alvin as he learns more about his abilities and about Red-magic from a powerful new character named Ta-Kumsaw. Meanwhile, grand events are taking shape that will lead to a major confrontation between the Reds and the Whites that could shatter hope for a peaceful future.All in all, this book does a great deal to progress the overall theme of the series, with Alvin undergoing much maturing, and the world around him being shaped by many powerful forces. Can't wait to read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"I originally read this several years ago, but read it again after getting the new book in the series for Christmas. I enjoyed the book even more this time than I did the first.Card does a great job of creating a world that is very similar to our own from the same time period, but with some very important differences in how the world works and some tweaking to early American history. He populates this world with many interesting characters including some historical figures. The result is an incredibly compelling story which has many different levels. The massacre at Tippy-Canoe and the results are particularly well done.This book is better than the first in the series and leaves me eager to re-read the next one, Prentice Alvin. If you have read Seventh Son, you should definitely continue the series by reading this."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"This is the second book in the 'Alvin Maker' series by Orson Scott Card, which began in &quot;Seventh Son.&quot; Alvin was prenticed off to a blacksmith, and at the start of this novel, he's on his way when he's ambushed by Reds and stolen away.Card is writing a very alternate history of North America, with figures and places that match history, but always twisted just slightly. The Hio River, the Mizzipy, and so forth all make me trip up on my mental tongue sometimes (in fact, I would rather have had Ohio and Mississipi, as it was quite distracting). This world, however, has something different to it: magic, in all its forms, be they faith, nature, hexes, superstition, knacks, etc, all of it works. So when Alvin, the seventh son of a seventh son, shows the same ability to speak and wield the powers of the land like any Red (read: Natives), he is taken by Ta-Kumsaw, and woven into a story that threatens to be bigger than all of them - and likely a tale that will soak the ground with blood.This second book has a lot more characters to it, and the story expands from the scope of just Alvin's point of view. Be prepared to meet various historical figures in this tale, including Napolean and 'Ta-Kumsaw,' and references to many more like Andrew Jackson and Ben Franklin. The drama of the story widens (and is much more cruel and bloody than the previous book, be forewarned).Very well done, but in places, as I said, the tendancy to use almost-right names and locations drove me nuts. I'll keep reading the series (and am looking forward to doing so), but I think I need a break from it.'Nathan"},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"This dark sequel to Seventh Son is set in an alternate American frontier where folk magic and hexes are real, and George Washington was decapitated for treason.

Alvin is semi-apprenticed to an Indian shaman, who gives him a deeper understanding of his \\"knack\\" and he goes on a long journey to save the life of his brother. The story is engaging and readable, but the tone is almost unbearably preachy; a politically correct testament to the idea of \\"the noble savage\\"."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"In a pre-industrial America where magic, religion, and science compete for ascendancy, Card has created a unique alternate history wherein the states are not united, various regions owe allegiance to various central governments, and Native Americans represent a dangerous and unpredictable force. Picking up the story of Alvin Miller begun so impressively in Seventh Son, Card introduces Alvin to the mystical world of aboriginal Americans. From his \\"Red\\" mentor Tenskwa-Tawa, Alvin learns the folk magic of Native Americans, who \\"run with the Greensong,\\" drawing power from the wild, uncultivated land. This puts them in conflict with the White frontiersmen, whose growing domination of the land is destroying the very wilderness that the \\"Reds\\" depend on and revere. Also in this second installment, Card begins the practice of introducing famous names from history (e.g. LaFayette, Napoleon, William Henry Harrison) and imagining how they fit in this vastly different world. Harrison plays the heavy in this version of history, and sets events in motion that change Alvin and his family forever. There are a couple of unforgettable scenes of horrific violence and its terrible aftermath that are easily among the most powerful in the series, but may be too intense for younger readers. Nonetheless, this a very engrossing read, propelled by Card's seemingly effortless prose and storytelling skill. Further volumes in the series are: Prentice Alvin, Alvin Journeyman, Heartfire, and The Crystal City, but be forewarned that as of this writing, the series has no definite conclusion."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"Red Prophet picks up where Seventh Son left off and shouldn't be read without previously reading the latter. Set in fictional colonial America, this is the land of alternate history where Americans have \\"knacks\\" or ability to do specific and limited magical acts.There are various sub-plots throughout Red Prophet that include Napoleon, Andrew Jackson, and the infamous William Henry Harrison. Most of the story continues the story of Alvin, a seventh son of a seventh son who has peculiar powers and is befriended by the famous Indian leader, Tecumseh.I felt this was the strongest book of the series and really separated itself from the rest of the pack. There are lots of elements going on and they all work. It's an exciting page-turner with a brisk pace and lots of action. It's a coming of age story where Alvin is learning to find himself and his abilities. It intelligently looks at American Indian's oppression by white colonial Americans. It has political intrigue elements wrapped up and brought together in the WHH and Napoleon sub plots. It also intelligently uses alternative history in a clever and satisfying way and at times is very dark and heartbreaking.The sequels are worth reading (well at least the next two) but unfortunately don't achieve the same level as Red Prophet. It's a shame that you must read Seventh Son (although not a bad read at all) to really understand this properly because this book could of reached a much larger audience if it was a stand-alone.This book was nominated for a Hugo and a Nebula award in 89'. It didn't win either, losing to Cyteen by C.J. Cherryh in the Hugo and Falling Free by Bujold (also nominated for a Hugo) in the Nebula. I haven't read Cyteen but this book was far superior to Falling Free in my opinion in what was an overall below average year for the awards.Also I noticed a new reissue of the paperback coming to Amazon in August. Of course they jacked up the price to RIDICULUOS 14.95 list price, and seem to be discontinuing the mass-market version (only 5 left as of this review). Almost as appalling is the new cover art which is not only ugly, but is inappropriate for the mood of this book (compare it to the old version) and really is aimed at the \\"young adult\\" crowd which is limiting for a book like this.Bottom Line: Card at his best here in what I believe is his 3rd best book after Ender's Game and Speaker For The Dead. Worth reading at least the first 3 of this series."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"The second volume of Alvin Maker continues the saga in fine, albeit bleak fashion. Tensions are escalating between Whites and \\"Reds\\" in an alternate frontier America where various folk magics really work. As usual one of my favorite authors shows his effortless storytelling brilliance in a tale that's vivid, intense, and at times heart wrenchingly moving."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"I have never enjoyed a book so much in my life (and I have read and loved a lot of books!). The world that the author creates is so deliciously parallel to the history we know, and yet so fascinatingly tangental. I was so moved by the characters and the events. I continue to be enraptured by Alvin's growth. I say skip Huckleberry Finn and make this required reading in high school English classes."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"This book gets rather slow at parts, but in the end you are rewarded for sticking with it. There are good parts to the book, and the next three books in the series are excelent! If the books in this series were seasons, Red Prophet would be winter. But spring DOES COME! hang in there!"},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"The first novel in this series swept me away with a captivating world of what might have been. This novel returns to that world and proceeds to get really lost. This story is a very heavy handed look at the abuse that immigrants gave to the native americans. While events very much like the events in this book actually happened, and often in ways just as cold if not colder than what this book showed, this does not excuse the way that these events are shown. Not that this book is really bad, it just doesn't have any urgency to it. This book reminded me of the movie &quot;The Green mile&quot;, in that it had the same setimentalism that to me seemed contrived. There are plenty of stories to be told on this subject, but this one just had to urgency and oddly for Card a weak sense of character.Card as always has very good characters, but many of their actions seemed forced. Many of the characters where given to the readers as reluctant fighters, but I just wasn't convinced. I will still read the next book in the series to see if Card recovered, but this is not a sequal up to the quality of the seventh son."},{"Title":"Red Prophet","review":"I had bought the book for its' cover. I held onto it because I had not read it. Finally when I was beseiged by clean and sober Native Americans in my life who were showing better lifestyles to me than I had been living, I chose to devote some time to this book, an exercise in belief in a spiritual lifestyle.Luckily, I was able to read the story, uninterrupted, with a desire for understanding of the intermarriage of the home culture and the invading one. Well, I ended up homeless for quite some time after that experience, but glad to say i now have more compassion for my garden, if not for the rat that raids it, but I finally have the intercultural rhapsody that was the blessing offered in this book.

From the design and what hardware to choose to making sure you have no downtime to consideration outside the network world, this book seems to cover every angle and approach.The authors make sure you understand the need for security, how QoS affects the website and why network management is so very important. Put it all together and you have the foundation you need to not only run an e-business but manage it as well.Overall, I am not sure if this book was written for any one exam certification but it should help with several.

I don't think the book is very good or particularly insightful. I have other books by this author which are good, but this book is made up of dry, cookie cutter listings of film terminology and (in my opinion) simplistic definitions of the same. The &quot;exercises&quot; at the end of certain sections appear to be last minute add-ons that don't offer much in terms of actual directing. It might have useful general information for the filmmaker wannabe, but there is nothing that lends credence to the cover's subtitle of &quot;killer style and cutting edge technique'. There are certainly much better books out there that talk about directing that more intersting and a much better read. Like I said, I have other books by this author which are pretty good, but as someone who has actually started to direct I didn't find much of use in this book.

Writing was torture. He needed an escape mechanism, and he also needed money. This edition unites the 2 products of that double motive. The first is a collection of essays about the sea, the second a short autobiographic walkabout.I like A Personal Record a lot better than The Mirror of the Sea.With Conrad, fiction beats non-fiction.An amazon friend's review of a Gide essay collection recently was entitled \`non fiction beats fiction'. (Gide was Conrad's French friend in the literary world.)My opinion on Conrad is: while Gide's fiction may have sunk with time, and his essays may still be floating, with Conrad it is the other way round. His sea fiction has enormous buoyancy, while his essays have a certain leaden quality.During his struggle with Nostromo, in 1904/5, Conrad wrote, on the side, and by dictation at night (I am wondering about the opportunities involved in that), a series of sketches of autobiographical nature. They were all published separately in newspapers and magazines, and then collectively as The Mirror of the Sea.The book was a critical success, but it has been shown that it was unreliable as a biographical source. Conrad made things up and misrepresented facts. Which proves my point, he was a fiction writer.The book is a lament of the lost culture of the sailing ship, and at the same time of a closed chapter of his own life. He had quit the sea for the life of a writer on land, and it was a hard life, the writing.JC says in his own introduction: I have attempted here to lay bare ... the terms of my relation with the sea. ... for twenty years I have lived like a hermit with my passion! ...Within these pages I make a full confession not of my sins but of my emotions.So, he goes and writes, at times entertainingly, about landfalls and departures, anchors and wrong language (casting!), drinking captains and presumptuous mates, storms, pleasure sailing, the ethics of craftsmanship, ships in calamity (overdue, missing, stranded, lost), the near mystic relation between man and ship (a she!), between man and nature, about river estuaries, ports, docks, about Nelson and Trafalgar and about some stories from his youth... This is an easy process for Conrad, compared to the hard labor of his fiction. The writing did not require his usual meticulous composition; the voice is that of a TV documentary host. The texts are assembled without subtitles, and in a sequence which is different from the publishing chronology.Is it worth it? For me and for other members of the fan club, sure. For aficionados of the subject, i.e. ships and the sea, certainly. For others, hardly.Now the Personal Record is another matter entirely. JC wrote it for his soon to be former friend F.M.Ford, who wanted to start a new magazine and publish literary autobiographies. JC's text focuses mainly on two subjects: his escape from Poland for the sea, which meant moving to the West, and his escape from the sea for writing as a living. Interestingly, he denies explicitly that the question why he chose to write in English is a legitimate question at all. After all, what else could he have done?We follow different episodes involving the growth of Almayer's Folly, his first novel. We follow JC on a visit to Poland to his relatives and hear a lot about the family history back to Napoleon and about the uncle, who had adopted JC when his parents had died.Why did he \`run away' to the sea after all? He was a reader from childhood on. He likens his escape to the exodus of Don Qijote from his village in La Mancha: the romance of adventure.Now, honestly, does that amount to a \`Personal Record'? Critics at the time were annoyed. Not only was the text absolutely no record of anything, rather a rambling discourse which jumps through chronos like we love it from Conrad's fiction. Well, some of us do. I do.Conrad anticipated some opposition. He quotes Marcus Aurelius asking for heroic truth. He makes a categorical statement: JC's truth is more of the humble kind.And anyway, another quote, now from Novalis (not so beloved by me): I will believe myself as soon as I find somebody else who believes me. (Maybe that's less a quote than a free interpretation.)As I said, Conrad was great at fiction, his fiction beats his non-fiction hands down. Lucky for us, he was no fanatic of bare facts."},{"Title":"William Cullen Bryant (Twayne's United States Authors Series)","review":"This volume is a critical examination of the poet's work, which attempts to search out the sources of his creativity and to define the dynamics of his creative process. By studying in detail many of the lesser known poems, as well as those frequently reprinted, the reader is brought to a full appreciation of Bryant's achievement as an artist and as a thinker. Bryant, who was also editor of the New York Evening Post, a leading anti-slavery paper noted for its literary accuracy, has been known as a nature poet because of such works as \\"Thanatopis,\\" \\"To a Waterfowl,\\" \\"Inscription for the Entrance to a Wood,\\" and \\"The Yellow Violet,\\" all written before he was twenty-one.--- from book's back cover"},{"Title":"A Shelter in the Storm (Seven Sisters, Book 3)","review":"Having already read books 1 and 2 of Debra White Smith's Seven Sister series and loved them, I came to A Shelter in the Storm with high expectations and wasn't disappointed. As she has done with the first two books of the series, Debra has shown how imperfect Christians deal with the uncertainties of life and how their faith helps them to become overcomers. Sonsee struggles with her growing feelings of love for her life-long friend, Taylor, because he cannot allow himself to love her. The story is not only a romance, but also a tale of suspense that leaves the reader hanging on every word, not knowing who done it until the very end. God's redeeming love is shown as both Sonsee and Taylor comes to terms with their faith and the misconceptions about it that threaten to keep them apart.The Seven Sisters series is wonderful...each a unique story unto itself. I find myself wishing it were more than seven sisters. There are only two left :-)."},{"Title":"A Shelter in the Storm (Seven Sisters, Book 3)","review":"I love Debra White Smith's &quot;Seven Sisters&quot; series.

You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"A Shelter in the Storm (Seven Sisters, Book 3)","review":"I did not like this book as much as I did the first in the series for a couple of different reasons. The author repeatedly used a style of dramatic writing that subsequently became distracting. For example: &quot;[she felt]...agony. Agony and anxiety. Anxiety and accusation. Accusation and acrimony.&quot; In addition, the inner spiritual conflicts the main characters experienced I found hard to understand.

Unlike some other series books by other authors, Ms. Smith has made this story stand alone. We meet the other people in the series, whom I am sure have their own books, but this story is totally about Sonsee and Taylor. I loved the suspense, the mystery, and the romance woven into the mix. Ms. Smith juggles all these parts with skill and an entertaining manner. You'll keep turning pages to find out how it all ends. Warning though, if you read this one, you'll want to read ALL the others!

If you're only going to buy one French dictionary, this should definitely not be it. There are plenty of words that are not defined in it, and the definitions themselves are quite short and often incomplete with words that have multiple meanings. However, as a pocket reference to have on the road or when you just need a quick and basic definition, it's quite fine.

Second, it contains a variety of idioms and slang.Unfortunately, this dictionary proved virtually useless. When I didn't know a word or an expression, I rarely found it in the dictionary either. That proved true both for the unusual and the idiomatic or slang language.The dictionary is suitable for casual use by tourists who need a quick reference, or for beginning and intermediate students of French.Random House publishes an excellent Portuguese-English dictionary in the same series.

To that end this particular dictionary is fairly useful under most circumstances as it can easily slip into a pocket, purse, fanny pack or a camera bag. The print is quite small however, so if you need reading glasses you'll need them! That or buy a larger dictionary. One quick problem I encountered in Montreal was the differences between French as spoken in France and French as spoken in Quebec as sometimes both cultures use different words. In more than a few instances I was left drawing a blank as this is geared towards French as spoken in France. Mercifully most Quebecois in Montreal switch to English effortlessly. Were I elsewhere in Quebec I'd probably be in trouble.If you're looking for a proper dictionary where portability is not the primary concern then I would not recommend this one. Students would be well advised to select a better dictionary, particularly one that includes phrases, metaphors and idioms, as this one will be of little use to you. This is fine for prowling the streets of Paris, Marseilles, Montreal or Lyon or perhaps reading Le Monde, but not if you're trying to grasp the subtleties of Proust or Descartes in the native language."},{"Title":"The Voice of Hope","review":"I have been intrigued with the situation in Burma since watching the movie Beyond Rangoon some time ago. It was therefore with great interest that I ordered this book as soon as it was available. In &quot;The Voice of Hope&quot; Alan Clements brings us into the present with this tragic situation through the person of Aung San Suu Kyi and her incredible life. But what sets this work apart from histories, biographies, and oddly enough even self-help material - is the powerful integration of beliefs and action found in Aung San Suu Kyi's life and philosophy. In reading chapter seven alone, (&quot;Saints are Sinners who go on trying&quot;) I was personally and deeply moved by the clear connectedness described between her experience with a repressive government and the need for thinking people everywhere to courageously fulfil our potential as thinking, &quot;questing&quot; individuals. The repressive government in Burma is shown to be an extreme and yet still relevant metaphor for intellectual repression in all its forms. And Aung San Suu Kyi's message offers specific insight together with believable emotional support for those who struggle to reconcile what we discover and know through our own searching with what we are expected to believe by others. If it helps anyone who is deciding whether this book is worth the money - I can only say that as one who buys and reads more than 100 books a year - this book has earned a unique place in my library and in my heart. I would trade every other book I have read this year for Alan Clements' latest contribution.

The government's repression and horrific inhumantiy are just unbelievable. But, more amazing is the dedication to nonviolence which Aung San Suu Kyi and her party follow in their democracy movement. Her manner in speaking of Burma's serious situation is so calm, hopeful, and loving that it makes one reinterpret and recast their interactions with their own worlds. One may also reflect on one's place in humanity and see that Burma's tragedy, Burma's fate, is our own and we must act now. Aung San's hope and strength are qualities we would do well to adopt as our own.

The movement was harshly crushed by the military junta that renamed Burma as Myanmar. Alan Clements, the first American ordained as a Buddhist monk in Burma, met with Aung San Suu Kyi after her release from her first house arrest in July 1995. She delivered her perception of engaged compassion and spoke of how she maintained her hope and optimism despite continued governmental oppression. \\"You must not forget that the people of Burma want democracy. Whatever the authorities may say, it is a fact that the people want democracy and they do not want an authoritarian regime that deprives them of their basic human rights.

I'd never heard of her compatriots before - and I think everyone would be struck by their innate gentleness, compassion and insight. If only the SLORC (the military-ruled government of Myanmar) would read and take seriously these accounts. They have nothing to fear from these patriots.

From this perspective, Both Ends of the Night is an exceptional read"},{"Title":"Both Ends of the Night (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"Three years ago, Matty Wildress taught private detective Sharon McCone how to fly an airplane.It is time for Sharon to renew her flying license, so she goes to see Matty, who she has not seenin a while.

She's moved from a tiny studio apartment with eccentric neighbours to a fully renovated house with two cats and has a half share in a property on the coast. She has learned to fly and become an accomplished pilot. After a series of go-nowhere relationships, she's finally settled into a comfortable long-term partnership, on her terms, with someone who doesn't want to change her. She's been shot at, beaten up and got herself into and out of every sort of dangerous situation. She's a product of Marcia Muller's imagination, and every time I open one of her novels, I feel like I'm catching up with an old friend.When Matty, the woman who taught Sharon to fly contacts her with a rather transparent excuse for a meeting, Sharon soon finds herself on another case. Turns out the instructor's live-in lover has disappeared, leaving Matty with his adolescent son and $70,000 in the bank. When she finds a message from her missing lover warning that her life may be in danger, Matty refuses to forego a planned aerobatic air show, with disastrous results. Sharon finds herself with a grieving boy on her hands, but luckily, her network of friends are more than willing to help. Soon Sharon finds the missing man is not who everyone thinks he is and she, together with her lover, Hy Ripinsky, set off across the country on a search for the truth. And the truth is not pretty, as they uncover a network of corruption involving a large corporation and government, while desperately trying to stay alive.Since I met Sharon many years ago in an anthology of short stories by women detective fiction writers, and quickly catching up with her old stories, I've been lucky enough to meet up with her at least once a year to hear of her latest escapades. Yeah, I know she's not real, but once you get involved in this series of books, you can't help but feel she is. Marcia Muller has created such a constantly evolving character that instead of becoming stale after 18 novels, she's only become more interesting, and has taken on a life of her own. Most writers can't help but project some of themselves onto their characters, and I'm guessing Marcia Muller is fearlessly loyal to her friends, happy in her relationship and really LOVES to fly!Keep \`em coming, Marcia Muller! I'll keep reading them as long as you keep writing them."},{"Title":"Both Ends of the Night (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"Sharon visits her flight instructor, Matty Wildress, and senses that something is bothering her. After some questioning, the private Matty discloses that her lover John has disappeared and has left her with his young son. Sharon and her lover Hy fear that Matty and the boy may be in danger and they try to protect them. Circumstances go from bad to worse, there is a murder, and Sharon and Hy begin looking for the perpetrator. From California, to Arkansas, Florida and Minnesota the two investigators hunt for John to try to find out who the murderer is, and why John disppeared so suddenly.

This book is a winner for those who enjoy mystery and adventure stories."},{"Title":"Both Ends of the Night (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"I have read a lot of Marcia Muller's books and find them riviting and believable.

I would recommend this vendor to my friends and family."},{"Title":"Both Ends of the Night (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"I enjoyed \\"Both Ends of the Night\\" very much. Marcia Muller is one of my favorite writers; always excellent and never a stinker. There is always so much more than just solving a puzzle and getting it over with in the Sharon McCone series. Sharon worries about losing her moral center and what kind of person she is becoming, about making the wrong kinds of compromises and shortcuts. In \\"Both Ends of the Night\\" these issues become acute for FBI agent and friend Craig Morland, who is tired of seeing wealth and influence trump justice.Sharon's flight instructor Matty Wildress hires Sharon to locate her missing husband, who has disappeared leaving Matty and his son Zach to fend for themselves. He leaves Matty $70,000 and instructions to disappear at once. Obviously he is not who he says he is, and perhaps isn't much of a father and husband either as his first thought is for his own hide, and he leaves little guidance and no protection for Matty and Zach.Matty is a top flight instructor and aerobatic flyer, and there are a number of wonderful joyous flying scenes. Muller always inserts interesting minor players, and Gray Selby is one of the best. He is a flight instructor at the same airport as Matty, a bitter, angry war vet who at first seems to be a hard-core misanthrope with a special grudge against women. But, as is so often the case in the McCone series, things are not what they seem.Sadly, the case turns into a murder investigation, and it takes a number of twists and turns on its way to a surprising conclusion."},{"Title":"Both Ends of the Night (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"Good entertainment with a fairly well constructed plot. I was interested in knowing about the Federal Witness Protection Program and the disappointments in people in Florida. Too many flying lessons, and too much tribute to the dead pilot.

McCone is hired by Matty Wildress, who was McCone's flight instructor when Sharon got her pilot's license, to find her lover, John Seabrook, who had disappeared. Matty does aerobatics and had one final meet for the year. Before that she gets a letter from John telling her not to fly in the last meet. He puts $70,000 into Matty's account and asks her to take his son, Zach, and flee California. Matty choses to fly anyway, and dies in a crash while performing a simple move for her. Since Matty is McCone's friend, McCone continues her investigation. because the murder of Matty and John Seabrook's disappearance, seem to be conected. McCone's lover, Hy Ripinsky, who is usually a minor character, plays a major role helping Sharon to find Matty's killer because of his friendship with Matty from years back. They uncover corporate corruption, government witness programs, and people who will stop at nothing to fulfill their dreams. This novel is very well written. The characters are well-drawn and Muller is one of the best at putting the reader there. I had shivers when she and Hy were in sub-zero weather in Minnesota. An excellent novel!"},{"Title":"Both Ends of the Night (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"I'm a big fan of the Sharon McCone series and this one was a very good read. Fast-moving, credible. I enjoyed all the plane-related detail. Muller, like Sharon and Hy, obviously loves flying. I'd never do it myself, but I enjoyed going along for the ride, so to speak.If you're new to Muller, I URGE you to read the McCone books in order, starting with &quot;Edwin of the Iron Shoes.&quot; Believe me, you'll get to this one soon enough."},{"Title":"Both Ends of the Night (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"I keep coming back for Muller's next Sharon McCone story, so it's safe to conclude that I have enjoyed the series so far. By number 19, it's become as much about McCone and her extended family of familiar characters as it is about the mysteries. For that reason, I suggest that somebody new to the McCone books not start with this one. You can, but it all works better if you have some background.I didn't find BOTH ENDS OF THE NIGHT to be one of Ms. Mullers' most compelling mysteries. It held my interest all the way through, but there was a little more rhapsodizing on the joys of airplane piloting than I wanted. I also thought that there weren't many real surprises in this one and the climax was too straightforward and obvious. Further, given the personal history of the guy living in the woods, he wouldn't have been difficult for a wealthy father to locate over the course of ten years.I have enjoyed Mullers' McCone novels and will certainly read more of them. This one, however, while OK, was a bit of a letdown. Not bad, but not one of the best. I'm not suggesting that people (especially fans) not read it, just that there are others I liked better. My four-star rating on this one is a bit soft."},{"Title":"Both Ends of the Night (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"Marcia Muller takes San Francisco private investigator Sharon McCone to new heights (no pun intended) in Both Ends of the Night. This is the best book in the McCone series that I have read so far.McCone is a pilot and learned how to fly from Matty Wildress. Matty is not only a flight instructor but also one of the top aerobatic flyers in the nation. Matty hires McCone to find her live-in lover, John Seabrook. Seabrook left suddenly with no explanation, leaving behind his 12-year old son, Zach. McCone not only has to discover where Seabrook has gone, but also, why he disappeared. The search for Seabrook leads McCone to Florida, Arkansas and Minnesota as she follows leads, assumptions and a trail of evidence. McCone is also worried that perhaps she won't find Seabrook alive.To solve this mystery, McCone must navigate through the Witness Protection Program, a 10-year old unsolved contract killing, a corrupt aviation company, a federal investigation, a company cover-up, and the disappearance of the owner's son. Along the way, she receives help from her ever growing staff, friend and San Francisco homicide detective Adah Joslyn, FBI agent Craig Morland, and lover Hy Ripinsky (who is also a personal friend of Wildress). In the course of the book, we also learn much about planes, flying and human nature.The plot for Both Ends is extremely well-developed. Unlike many mysteries, the bad guys aren't all bad and the good guys aren't all good. Also, not all the good guys are still standing at the end, which makes Both Ends more like real life.Muller has become one of those series which I am determined to read every book--it's that good."},{"Title":"Both Ends of the Night (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"I don't think this book is as good as some of the others in the series.

Still, disappointing flaws remain, and this book fell significantly short of her stand-out work in Games To Keep The Dark Away and The Shape Of Dread.Matty Wildress, who taught McCone to fly an airplane three years earlier, asks the detective to investigate the sudden disappearance of her widowed lover of a year, John Seabrook, who, without explanation, leaves behind his adolescent son Zach, $70,000, and a note warning of great danger. Soon, Matty's sabotaged plane crashes during an air show. McCone and her lover Hy Ripinsky, a close, long-time friend of Matty's, vow to help Zach and avenge Matty's death. McCone drops off Zach with her country music star ex-brother-in-law Ricky Savage and her assistant Rae. Ricky and Rae implausibly became a couple in the last book and during the winter holidays are overseeing Ricky's own brood, along with Habiba Hamid, a pre-teen girl whose family was wiped out during the over-the-top \\"Diplobomber\\" case of two books ago and who was taken in by McCone's currently vacationing ex-employer (from the days of the now-defunct All Souls Legal Cooperative) Hank Zahn and his wife Anne-Marie Altman. McCone and Ripinsky plan to confront two airplane workmen about the crash, but find both shot dead. Traveling cross-country, McCone tracks down John's real identity and history, which is connected to an airplane manufacturer located in the Southwestern U.S. With the help of a local reporter, McCone learns that after the company's founder became an invalid, his dissolute son Dunc -- a would-be hunter and survivalist, now a fugitive -- took over and got the company involved in gun-running, drug trafficking, and even murder for hire. When law enforcement, assisted by a whistleblower, moved in on Dunc and his circle, a smooth operator with close ties to the family and big-time political aspirations took over the company from him. The trail ends with discoveries by McCone and Ripinsky in a remote, snowy region of Minnesota, followed by a new round of corruption inquiries instigated by McCone.Although the book (and flyleaf) telegraphed some important aspects of the story, and the story flagged at times, Muller reinvigorated it with enough new, creative developments at various stages to keep the book interesting almost until the end (when it seemed to run out of gas). It was good to see McCone back to doing her own in-depth digging, legwork, and interrogations, with better dialogue, descriptions of place, and, to some extent, characterizations than in any prior Muller book in some time. Although Muller's narrative experimentation in Broken Promise Land (back and forth from McCone to \\"Rae's diary\\") was forced, fake, and distracting, the short flashbacks inserted at various chapter breaks here fared better, as at least some means of conveying, through flight training sessions, a sense of what Matty had meant more broadly to McCone. There was a risk that Muller would go overboard with the flight theme and details, indulging her own personal hobby-horse to the detriment of the story, but for the most part she stopped short of that.Nevertheless, the book was disappointing in a number of important respects. Matty never came to life the way she should have. The main reason is that Muller cast her in the same limited, limiting mold as she has cast McCone -- as someone who is \\"reserved\\" and does not \\"speak of personal matters\\" or \\"trade in emotions.\\" John came off as just as stiff, cold, and flat, Zach only slightly less so. Worst of all in this regard is the shallow Ripinsky character. Anything he touches suffers. Muller's attempt to give him a long-ago, emotional connection to Matty (reflected in the book's title) was trite, cloying, and artificial (is that really how mature, close friends would have behaved? -- something out of a bad soap opera?). Happily, Ripinsky was gone for long stretches of this book. He and the \\"living on the edge of danger\\" action-hero element that came with him -- at the expense of careful tending to characters, setting, plot, and investigation -- is one of the worst things to have happened to the McCone books. The rich background with which Muller surrounded McCone in the earlier books (All Souls, group house, Remedy Lounge, etc.) is all but gone. By contrast, all too often the more recent books up to and including this one merely accumulate baggage, such as the pretentious, hackneyed Habiba character, a product and unwelcome reminder of one of the least convincing and effective McCone books; or, when they do continue a past character (such as Rae), it can be at the price of wild exaggerations, inconsistencies, and distortions in the character and her situation, as the reader has known them before.The narrow, confined depictions of Matty and John deprived the story of poignancy and force. Although this book was more tightly written and had more going on than its immediate predecessor in the McCone series, the plot resolution remained a problem. The book did not adequately and convincingly explain why the killers, instead of effectively focusing on John himself, would have ended up targeting a wife and, especially, a years-later girlfriend; this came off as plot contrivance. The political/government corruption aspect of the story was too vaguely and thinly developed to support the weight placed on it. And, again, Muller failed to deliver a well-developed, compelling confrontation scene at the end. Indeed, the would-be climactic passage robbed the reader of any chance to see in action a character built up as a supposed force-of-nature master criminal and likewise deflated all of the build-up toward his come-uppance. Instead, Muller substituted a momentary physical skirmish with a far sketchier and less interesting villain, from which McCone had to be rescued by someone else, with the final resolution relegated to a pat \\"leak\\" of conveniently obtained damaging information about the person to law enforcement authorities.The blurb on the back cover pretty well summed up what Muller was attempting: \\"Now embarking on a personal vendetta that will take her across the country, McCone uncovers an insidious web of corporate theft, government corruption...and murder for hire. While at flight's end, in the cold Minnesota wilderness, a cunning killer awaits.\\" Unfortunately, it is the reader who still \\"awaits\\" after finishing the book because, in the end, it did not live up to this billing in intricacy, suspense, or satisfaction."},{"Title":"Both Ends of the Night (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","review":"My friend needed more room on her bookshelf and after being a Marcia Muller fan for years she was giving up her collection.

In a world where most female characters are portrayed as helpless and mired in a role of expected female traits, Sharon McCone is a breath of fresh air as a capable, smart and skilled investigator.

Also, the male hero &quot;smirked&quot; (author's word choice) about a hundred times which really annoyed me. The uncle whose villainy precipitated her marriage was gross. Also, I couldn't believe that a woman who had the courage to be a spy against her own country would be so weak-kneed as to give in to that piece of slime. Totally out of character. The hero's search for his father could have been poignant, but he spent too much time going from one potential father to another, and the author spent too little time telling us who these men were that I never got a good grasp of who the &quot;father&quot; suspects were. I didn't care if he ever found his father. I read it through to the end because I kept hoping it would get better.

It consists ofscientists criticizing Velikovsky on scientific terms. It is significant that they don't criticize so much on historical terms, which is the approach Velikovsky used. The longest chapter is by Carl Sagan, and he did include historical criticisms. This book was originally intended to include all speeches from a 1974 session of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. That would have included both Velikovsky himself and one sympathizer. But, not due to the editor, both of those chapters never made it into the book. Instead, another critic was added, and Isaac Asimov was invited to write a foreword, and Goldsmith himself wrote an introduction. So the title fits the final form.At the 1974 AAAS meeting Velikovsky was 77 years old and it was 24 years after the publication of &quot;Worlds in Colision,&quot; which was the topic of the meeting."},{"Title":"Scientists Confront Velikovsky","review":"The title is quite misleading. In fact, probably the only real scientist at the Cornell Symposium was Velikovsky; a disgraceful event which, its organisers admitted, was never intended to objectively look at Velikovsky's ideas. The purpose, from the very beginning, was to \\"warn off\\" the public; a public which had become increasingly attracted to his work. And the syposium had the desired effect. Velikovsky was repeatedly and outrageously mistrepresented and never permitted, either there or in any of the respected academic journals, which Sagan and co had free access to, to present his own case. This nasty little book was the result of the \\"proceedings\\" from the event. Don't bother to read it. Apart from the fact that it's boring and virtually unreadable from a layman's viewpoint (page after page of mathematical equations \\"proving\\" Velikovsky's catastrophes couldn't have happened), it doesn't honestly address a single issue raised by him. Let me provide a few examples:1. How, Velikovsky asked, could ancient writers connect unusual events in the cosmos with catastrophes such as volcanic eruptions and tidal waves on the earth? We now know, thanks to Newton, that should another planet, or planetoid, such as the moon, approach the earth, then the earth's tectonic plates would go into convulsions and giant tides would be raised. But how did the ancients, who knew nothing of the law of gravitation, know this? (No answer)2. How, Velikovsky asked, do we explain the sudden demise of the mammoths, some of which, though their flesh is perfectly preserved in the ice, have undigested flowering plants, such as buttercups, in their mouths and stomachs? These animals were evidently grazing in summer temperatures, when they were overwhlemed by some force, transported into the Arctic regions, and their flesh frozen so quickly that it can still, in some cases, be eaten. How to explain this without a cataclysm? (No answer).3. How, Velikovsky asked, do we explain the evidence of recent rapid mountain-building encountered all over the globe. For example, on the Pacific coast of South America a raised beach, a thousand metres up, complete with sand and sea-shells, runs the length of the continent. If mountain-ranges rise extremely slowly, as the textbooks now tell us, by no more than a couple of centimetres per century, then there should be many intermediate beaches between the present seashore and the raised beach. Shellfish and other marine life quickly colonize new shorelines. The fact that there are no intermediate beaches between the raised beach and the present shoreline indicates that the raised beach was raised very quickly indeed. (No answer).4. All over the Antarctic continent, Velikovsky noted, often hundreds of kilometers from the shore and hundreds of metres about sea-level are found the bodies of whales, seals, fish and other sea-creatures. How did these cadavers get there, without giant tidal waves? (No answer).I could go on and on, but this provides a tiny sample of the many volumes of first-class evidence Velikovsky presented, and which was (and still is) consistently ignored by the \\"experts,\\" who instead to try to baffle the reading public with mathematical equations and other hand-waving exercises. Nothing of the evidence Velikovsky presented is addressed.Instead of the nonsense presented in this book, I would recommend instead, \\"Scientists confront scientists who confont Velikovsky\\", by the editors of Kronos."},{"Title":"Scientists Confront Velikovsky","review":"This book contains the majority of the papers presented at a 1974 AAAS Symposium on Immanuel Velikovsky's controversial 1950's book WORLDS IN COLLISION. Velikovsky's paper was not included and the reasons for this as well as a full rebuttal antidote to SCV may be found in the books VELIKOVSKY & ESTABLISHMENT SCIENCE (1977)and its sequel SCIENTISTS CONFRONT SCIENTISTS WHO CONFRONT VELIKOVSKY (1978). As the Editor-in-Chief of both books, I can tell any reader that no attempt was made by Sagan & Co. to proofread their own manuscripts or make any corrections prior to publication. Therefore, SCV is not only replete with inaccuracies, multiple errors, and misspellings but also reflects the laziness of those \\"scholars\\" who thought that their critique would prove to be the ultimate coup de grace to WinC. Not so! Sagan, who was the \\"leader of the band\\" presented the most inept and self-contradicting criticism of all concerned. One by one his mistakes and misrepresentations were pointed out in V&ES. Beginning with Velikovsky's own AAAS paper - \\"My Challenge to Conventional Views in Science\\" - followed by his \\"Afterword\\" and \\"The Ten Points of Sagan\\", the articles by Greenberg - \\"Sagan's Folly\\" - and Juergens' \\"Sagan's 'Ten Plagues'\\" left Sagan's paper in shreds and irredeemable. The other contributors to SCV - Goldsmith, Asimov, Storer, Mulholland, Huber, and Morrison - were also appropriately dealt with. Indeed, a further response to Huber can be found in SCSWCV, and Morrison was demolished in KRONOS V:2 (1980). None of this, however, is ever acknowledged by those authors (except possibly Huber) as they went on their merry way still singing the same old song. The issue of Venus' high temperature, the subject of extra-terrestrial life, the identity of ancient planetary gods, the cratering of the Moon, the atmosphere of Mars and its geological makeup, the Earth's rotation, Ancient Calendrics, the circularization of Venus' orbit, non-gravitational forces in the Solar System, the atmosphere of Venus, and the thermal balance of Mars and Venus are among the many subjects discussed in all three books cited above. In the end, SCIENTISTS CONFRONT VELIKOVSKY is a study in futility. The collective weaknesses of the arguments presented there and the devastating responses they engendered failed to advance astronomical science in either direction. The discoveries that continue to be made in the Space Age are far more favorable for Velikovsky. Yet, his theoretical contributions remain unacknowledged since science, especially Astronomy - Queen of the Sciences, abhors an outsider just as Nature abhors a vacuum. Sagan, primarily a popularizer, has receded into the mists of the past; Asimov will always be known as a fine science fiction writer and nothing more; Goldsmith, Storer, Mulholland, and Huber are basically unknown today, and Morrison is busy debunking the misrepresented Mayan \\"theory\\" of the end of the world on Dec. 21, 2012. Meanwhile, Velikovsky still has books written about him, articles published based upon his historical reconstructions, and his seminal ideas purloined and appropriated by mainstream and not-so-mainstream writers as if that information has been known for centuries. And so it goes..."},{"Title":"Scientists Confront Velikovsky","review":"If you want an honest appraisal of the 1974 symposium in which several establishment scientists opposed Immanuel Velikovsky, this is not it.When Velikovsky put forth his catastrophic cosmic thesis in Worlds in Collision in 1950, establishment scientists rose en masse to denounce him as a charlaton, a crank and a fraud. Most had not read the book. And Dr. Harlow Shapeley of Harvard University inspired a boycott of MacMillan by universities across the nation who purchased their textbooks from MacMillan. If this book was the pack of lies they claimed it was, why be so afraid of it?The slander and vile demonizing continued in the 1960s and 70s, led by Carl Sagan and Isaac Asimov. In this symposium, five different specialists delivered their own papers while Velikovsky was severely limited in time and space to respond to them all, as if he was responding to only one. It was five against one, and to limit him so was like tying a boxer's arms behind his back. Sagan's paper was the sloppiest and most error-filled, and he published it in several places. It was a kangaroo court, and a public who knew no better, who saw Sagan as the great popularizer of science, believed the liars.If you want an honest assessment of Velikovsky's work and its impact, read Scientists Confront Scientists Who Confront Velikovsky, as well as Velikovsky Reconsidered and The Age of Velikovsky. You will get fair, unbiased treatment, and the truth there. You will not find it here."},{"Title":"Scientists Confront Velikovsky","review":"This book has never been shipped to me. Where is it?

The 6th edition was published in 1990; an 8th edition published in 1999 is available and, although more recent, is still over a decade out of date. When looking at a book like this one has to evaluate its treatment of principles that remain constant (aerodynamics, aircraft structures, propulsion, atmosphere/weather, aeromedicine, and basic flying and navigation) versus those that even today continue to go through fast-paced changes (aircraft types, composite construction, avionics, flight control systems). I find Van Sickle's treatments of the foundation subjects to be comprehensive and summary. I look forward to picking this book up to quickly review a subject for my work. And on subjects like avionics where there are much newer references, I find the systems covered in this book to provide a nice bridge from the \\"steam\\" gages and mixed displays still found in many light aircraft and the fully integrated display and avionics systems now common in the heavies. I think this book will make an excellent companion to the Standard Handbook for Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineers edited by Mark Davies published in 2002.

Susan Doran has written a complete, if brief, biography of Elizabeth I that hits all the main points of her life and rule. Nothing important seems to have been left out, and the narrative seems unhurried. One could read this book in a fairly short time, and have an understanding of Elizabeth's reign. However, for those who would like a bit more elaboration, Doran includes a Further Reading List at the end.Doran's style is clear, engaging, and very readable. This seems to be a book intended for an adult reader, but it would be an excellent introduction for high school students (or even precocious middle schoolers), as well. The only spot where the narrative jars is when Doran briefly compares Elizabeth to Diana, Princess of Wales. Charismatic celebrities exist in every generation, and in twenty years, this reference may seem dated.This is also an attractive book, apparently one of the first in a new series by The British Library. It includes many color photographs of portraits and documents throughout."},{"Title":"Queen Elizabeth I (The British Library Historic Lives)","review":"Elizabeth I (The British Library, Historic Lives Series) by Susan Doran is a really superb book! Though I have read many books about Queen Elizabeth this one, though concise, thoroughly captures the essence of the history of Elizabeth and her England. Susan Doran provides us a captivating glimpse into the complicated world facing Elizabeth both in her personal and majestic life as she confronts the dynamic political and religious world developing around her and the England she loves. Elizabeth I was a complex person ruling in a complicated world. In a very even handed way, Susan Doran presents how a dynamic Queen Elizabeth, at her best and worst, navigates as best she can, through the perils and complexities confronting her and England. Susan Doran gives us an Elizabeth who is real. She shows Elizabeth as a Queen who has human frailities, who is adept in propaganda, can be as cruel as she is rewarding, yet whose monarchy enthralls and inspires us to this day. Susan Doran's adept use of a superb collection of illustrations throughout the book really provides a wonderful dimension to her protrayal of Elizabeth as a dynamic queen of England. This is a book I recommend to anyone who has an interest in Elizabeth I, Queen of England."},{"Title":"Alfred, Lord Tennyson: Selected Poems","review":"While not an avid reader of Tennyson myself, I bought this book for my brother's birthday.

Now they have a Farm Animals Republic, a bank, a newspaper, an atomic powered car and even a rocket ship. But, despite the prestige and renown of being Bean farm animals, their basic nature had remains the same - they are honest, forthright, and darned funny.Things bode ill for the Boomschmidt Circus when Herbert Garble (who has never had an honest day in his life) joins them with six strange looking men from Mars - each a foot high, in red pajamas and wearing red fluffy whiskers. Freddy is sure there is some fraud involved, but the Circus is making a ton of money and the last thing the farm animals want to do is hurt Mr. Boomschmidt. Freddy, Jinx the Cat, Uncle Ben and Mrs. Peppercorn head out to investigate.What they find is pretty fishy, or rather, pretty ratty. Mean old Simon the rat and his family are up to their necks in trouble making, and Garble's Martians are just the start. If the rats have their way the Beans will be forced off their farm and Uncle Ben will lose his rocket ship. Drastic times call for drastic measures as the animals prepare to go to war.If things are strange with fake Martians, they get stranger when a flying saucer full of real Martians shows up to investigate. Soon there are rats pretending they are Martians, rabbits pretending they are rats pretending they are Martians, and real Martians stirring the pot. As Freddy nearly is sent to Montana to become pork chops and bacon, everything hangs in the balance.As always Walter Brooks' tales combine humor and suspense with a natural sense of values that apply equally to animal and man. If the science in this book is a bit silly it is still engaging enough for its intended readership. And the simple lessons of friendship and doing what is right never grow old."},{"Title":"Freddy and the Men from Mars","review":"At first, when it is announced that Martians have landed and are on display at Mr Boomschmidst's Circus, Freddy the Pig, poet and detective, is intrigued. However, when he finds out his old enemy Herb Garble is the one who discovered them and is promoting them, he grows suspicious and decides to investigate. The Martians wear red long johns and describe a home planet suspiciously like earth, more specifically, rural New York. Freddy smells a rat...literally and it isn't Garble. A hilarious mystery with all of the favorite characters of the series have come to love over the years. We also get to meet Mr. Hercules, Mr. Booms brother who is not quite bright but enjoys a good joke....once he gets it. And, much to Garble's annoyance and chagrin, as slow as Mr Hercules is to get a joke, he is even slower to forget it. Can't say more without giving the story away. Lots of laughs as our Freddy barnyard sleuth solves the mystery of the Men from Mars. Cleverly illustrated, once again,by Kurt Wiese.Freddy the Pig is a hero of over 2 dozen books for the young at heart by Walter R Brooks.

Clearly an excellent piece of scholarship where she argues very persuasively why the institution of marriage is a far superior choice than cohabitation which has the added disadvantage of having negative externalities to go with negative attributes.I was an avid reader of this particular volume in the series which appears to have the avowed aim of maintaining the family as constituted in the conservative press and other media as the central institution of our society upon which all else is built.I do find in odd that such a reactionary conservative agenda originates from a think tank which began life as an integral part of the free market Institute of Economic Affairs in London. The theme of the family as the bedrock upon which all society rests is a recurring one in their publications and here in this little report the trend toward cohabitation as a lifestyle choice is critically attacked as somehow undermining that sacred institution.Morgan writes very persuasively and marshalls her facts and arguments to portray cohabitation as a very inferior choice which does untold harm to the very fabric of our socity. Connecting this with the sexual revolution she sets out to undermine the story of cohabitation as a longstanding tradition within Britsh society going back hundreds of years and instead portraying it as a modern aberration. She argues that individuals who cohabit tend to be from the lower strata of society, tend to be less educated and tend to do less well in life and she uses the emotive argument of children suffering through cohabitation and being disadvantaged in life through being reared in cohabiting family units.However, Morgan is disengious in her attack. The subtext of her contribution is that we are somehow all better off in families but she never really shows how everyone in a family is better off. Now, of all things I may be, I do not consider myself to be a leftwing believer in female liberation. I do consider that women are individuals too and that their choices are just as valid as a man's. If we examine the basis of Morgan's view then surely women in marriage must gain to some extent if they are participant in it voluntarily. The problem is that women are voting with their feet. They may want to marry but they might want to defer that action until a time of their own choosing. Morgan undertakes some reverse engineering to show how the reasons people give for cohabitation fail the test in comparison to marriage regardless of which indicator is chosen.What Morgan seems so outraged about is the fact that traditional societies are changing to more individua;istic ones where women have their own earning power and greater control than ever before over their own lives. Not all changes will be for the better but there will be a learning process, a trial and error process and in the meantime there will be dislocating effects. I am not arguing that these effects prove Morgan's points but I am arguing that the choices which many millions of individuals are making will produce different results and different patterns of family structure to those which have been around for centuries.The point, clearly lost on Patricia Morgan, is that those choices are for the individuals involved to make and not hers. The conservative reactionary agenda she espouses is one from which women were not able to participate in because they did not have the economic or political power necessary to participate.Marriage-Lite is certainly a book that anyone interested in debates over social policy should be reading with a critical eye but especially women."},{"Title":"The Jerusalem Bible","review":"The type in the book is inferior.

After nearly 40 years, the Jerusalem Bible in English is still as exciting and fresh as when it first appeared in 1966. At the time, it heralded an entirely new approach to the Scriptures. It was the first translation by Catholic scholars to use the original languages rather than the Latin Vulgate. It was translated into modern English. It was the only version to break with King James tradition and spell out the divine name (Yahweh). Despite being the work of French Dominicans, the annotations were non-doctrinal and acclaimed by scholars of all faiths.How disingenuous to the original spirit, therefore, that the back cover proclaims that &quot;it still holds to the traditional (noninclusive) language that appeals to conservative Catholic and Protestant Christians.&quot; It was not the specific intention of the editors and translators to produce a Bible described like that. Gender inclusive language was not even an issue at that time. If the Jerusalem Bible lacks gender inclusive language, it's due to its historical dating rather than a deliberate decision taken by its translators. There has also been some writing about how the JB compares to the New Jerusalem Bible (1985) in this regard. While the producers of the NJB acknowledge that they made some very minor changes to accomodate gender neutrality, they are by no means severe. In both the JB and NJB, for example, &quot;brothers&quot; does not become &quot;brothers and sisters&quot; throughout the New Testament (as it does in the NRSV). Also God created &quot;man&quot; in both the JB's and NJB's accounts of Genesis--not &quot;humankind&quot;(as in the NRSV). Gender inclusive language, therefore, does not seem like a significant factor in choosing between the JB and NJB.In other regards, however, there are some differences between the older and newer versions. The NJB, being newer, has the advantage of 20 additional years of scholarship. A lot of new research and discoveries were made in that time that are reflected in the text and notes. (In fact we are probably due for yet another updated English edition soon as there has already been a new French version released in 1997).Other differences between JB and NJB involve personal preferences which can not be objectified. I like the Psalms in the older version (compare Psalm 23: &quot;In meadows of green grass he lets me lie. To the waters of repose he leads me; there he revives my soul.&quot; [JB] with &quot;In grassy meadows he lets me lie. By tranquil streams he leads me to restore my spirit.&quot; [NJB]). On the other hand, I prefer the NJB where Matthew's Beatitudes are &quot;blessed&quot; over the JB where they are merely &quot;happy.&quot;In closing, I would recommend adding the Jerusalem Bible to one's library. Unfortuately this &quot;Reader's Edition&quot; with abridged notes is the only one still in print. The copy that I saw was not as poorly printed and bound as noted by others. It was not, however, as nice as my original 1966 edition. Another reviewer called for republishing the full edition, which I think is a marvelous idea."},{"Title":"The Jerusalem Bible","review":"No other bible can be compared to the quality and accuracy of The Jerusalem Bible (1966). It is approved for liturgical use in Europe by the Vatican. That makes it an official Catholic bible. With relaxations of the official church position on bible translations, Alexander Jones of Christ's College, Liverpool took the opportunity as an editor to guide a team of translators in an English language translation of the Holy Bible using a method already accomplished by the Dominican Biblical School in Jerusalem with their production of La Bible de Jerusalem (1956) in French, by means of Hebrew and Greek sources while bypassing the Latin Vulgate (the key reason why the Catholic Church thought long and hard about approving this process). Thus the English version of the JB is not French to English translation as some have erroneously suggested. Along with creating the JB the editors also historically researched each book of the bible, and prepared an introduction for most books along with creating sets of footnotes that would cross-reference the entire bible. The Old Testament sources are the Masoretic texts, with a critical inspection comparison using the Greek Septuagint (the LXX). Since the Dead Sea Scrolls mostly matched the LXX, the JB happens to be the most accurate rendition of the OT. It is even better than the Jewish Tanakh and the Masoretic texts themselves that are not always in line with the Dead Sea Scrolls. The critical combination of the LXX and the Masoretic texts produce a version of the Old Testament of the quality used by Jews and certainly the apostles, at the time of Christ. The inclusion of all the books of the OT, including the \`controversial' books erroneously labelled the \`apocrypha' by Martin Luther during the reformation, is made on the bases that they are in the LXX (200 BC), the Vulgate (400 AD) and that the removal of them from the OT is a post-crucifixion event by Jews at Jamnia (Council of Jamnia) in 90 AD, again by Martin Luther in the Luther's bible of 1534 before finally being removed altogether by Protestant book publishers between 1825-27 after the Edinburgh Committee of the British and Foreign Bible Society decided simply not to print them anymore. Only the Catholic Church has regarded them as Old Testament with the Dead Sea Scrolls confirming this position (and it is not as if anyone had the right to canonize any other version of the bible after the Catholic Church did it at the Third Council of Carthage in 397 AD). Here they are again, and yes they do include the Books of Maccabees with \`prayers for the dead' in tact. The English writer J.R.R. Tolkien has his hand in the style of writing and we even have the insertion of the name \\"Yahweh\\" (I AM WHO I AM) for God in reading the Old Testament. The JB (1966) was written before the advent of inclusive language (something that the church believes alters the word of God) so we also have the added bonus of having this fantastic translation without the use of inclusive language. Since it is modern (note, not modernism) you can read it without having to study Shakespeare (as readers of the King James Bible would have to do, resulting in many doctrinal errors also) and come away with a fresh and accurate understanding of the Sacred Scriptures by only reading it once (slowly though I might add), still there is nothing like it in terms of quality, ease of use and correctness. Alexander Jones, who obviously had a firm understanding of what went wrong with other bible translations, has done what all others have failed to do. There are some very minor quibbles about its use of short text in some passages of the NT and so the JB was revised in 1985 by Henry Wansbrough and the new version was called The New Jerusalem Bible (NJB) but was rejected by the Holy See for its use of inclusive language (still the NJB is an amazing bible, but not for liturgical use). Even though the publication of the NJB was not approved, the NJB was widely circulated and had an impact on the JB to the point of putting it out of print. However recent demand for the originally approved JB has brought it back into circulation again, only not without what might be considered a shortcoming. All versions of the JB are photocopies of the 1966 version and have not been typeset again. Don't be disappointed to find the odd photocopied hair appearing across the page. However this is only cribbing, the text still looks as good as most bibles, just not perfect, and the fact that the JB has never been typeset means that you can not get a digital version of the JB. You can only own it on the printed page. The fact that it is not in digital has its disadvantages for serious bible scholars who like to run word searches, but at the same time this means that the JB can only be read in the way it was presented, on the printed page, in a bound hardcover book, and this is precisely how the JB should be read, and precisely how sacred scripture should be presented. Also the numbering system seems to disappear at times within the text, but this is in fact a method used by Jones to keep the original flow of sacred scripture. Sometimes the chapter number system actually broke the text in places where it should not have been, a bad tradition continued today because of this numbering system. Thus you will be reading chapters in the JB only to discover a small 5 instead of a big 5 like the 4 before it and the 6 after it. This method keeps the original chapter breaks of the books of bible that have long been lost to the numbering system. You have never read a bible like this one before. Quite simply I would deeply consider shelving all other bibles that you have and also getting a NJB for any quick double-checks that need to be made. Citing from the JB shows that you have (1) Understood the acumen involved in its translation, (2) a desire to ensure that everyone who doesn't speak Shakespeare can comprehend you and the Word of God and (3) want to keep the Canon of books that Christ and the Apostles used that was canonized at the Third Council of Carthage. Reading the JB is a miracle in itself. Never has our Justification through Faith in Jesus Christ because his forgiveness for our Sins by way of the Cross and Resurrection of the Body been made so absolute in print."},{"Title":"The Jerusalem Bible","review":"The Jerusalem Bible is THE BEST Bible translation in my opinion!

Its English was balanced and readable, both in silent devotion and public proclamation. When traveling in other English speaking countries it was the text used liturgically. The inevitable migration to inclusive language texts that sought to heal rifts in groups that felt marginalized created new communities that now felt the same. The re-issue of this translation goes a long way toward balancing this out and is a compassionate solution to a delicate problem. While no translation is timeless or perfect this one is durable enough and faithful enough to fulfill its function. I recomend this book not as a nostalgic journey into the past but as living link to a world experienced by millions."},{"Title":"The Jerusalem Bible","review":"The Jerusalem Bible I am reviewing is the burgundy cloth,hard covered edition from 1966 edited by Alexander Jones.J.R.R. Tolkien was on the committee that worked on this version.This is the original edition and it's becoming harder to find.This is not to be confused with the \\"reader's edition\\" or New Jerusalem Bible.A few negatives on this Bible:it is cumbersome to carry.It is thick!Approximately 2 3/4 inches thick.And heavy.Now a review of what's inside the covers.My understanding of this version is that it was commissioned by the Catholic Church and it was the first departure from the Latin Vulgate or another words; there was a lot of investigating/studying the Greek and Hebrew texts.This Bible uses the name \\"Yahweh\\" instead of titles like \\"God\\" or \\"Lord\\" in the OT.There are educational Introductions to each book in this Bible.The Jerusalem Bible has 7 more books than the KJV has.They are:1 Maccabees, 2Maccabees, Judith, Tobit, Baruch, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus.The footnotes are exhaustive and very helpful for study.For example a footnote on Isaiah 7:14 describes the subtle difference between Greek and Hebrew for the description of Immanuel's mother as a virgin(Greek) or maiden,young girl,or recently married woman(Hebrew).The JB uses \\"maiden\\" in that verse where I would argue that it was a prophecy of the \\"virgin\\" birth.Matthew 6:13 uses the wording \\"put us not to the test\\" rather than \\"lead us not into temptation\\"in the Lord's Prayer. This wording is more in line with James 1:13 \\"Never, when you have been tempted, say,'God sent the temptation';God cannot be tempted to do anything wrong,and he does not tempt anybody.\\"Another curious difference in text wording can be found in Rev.22:19.The KJV and older versions use the words \\"book of life\\".The Jerusalem Bible(and most modern Bibles) has \\"..God will cut off his share of the tree of life and the holy city...\\"There is a Chronological Table and Index of Biblical Themes at the end of this book.They are very helpful.The biggest value of the Jerusalem Bible is as a study Bible.The footnotes are excellent!I have found no doctrinal slant or bias in this Bible.It's a classic Bible and getting more difficult to find.It's a keeper in my library!"},{"Title":"The Jerusalem Bible","review":"I ordered my copy of the Jerusalem Bible over the objection of a previous reviewer who warned of a poor print job. Wow was he right! A 2 minute scan of the book reveals how miserable it would be to actually read it. Small font, light, uneven print. An abomination! It goes back today."},{"Title":"The Jerusalem Bible","review":"The content of this edition may be wonderful, but the printing quality is like a bad xerox. what a pity that the publisher didn't purchase a quality job. I'm sending back the copy I received today. Ex-printer."},{"Title":"The Jerusalem Bible","review":"Long ago, as a young child, I heard the Jerusalem Bible pronounced in Church, but never knew it. Eventually, as I began to study Liturgy and Scripture, I became aware of various translations, and finally picked myself up an old 1971 copy of the paperback 'Reader's Edition' of the JB. Of course, it sat on my shelf for quite some time.Picking it up recently, while working on a project to revise the Breviary of our Synod, I became captivated by the striking language and depth of meaning found in the JB, and decided I needed a slightly better copy for my own use.The Jerusalem Bible is quite simply the most poetic modern english translation of Scriptures that one will find. The depth and clarity with which the Word of God is conveyed within these covers is only rivaled (in places!) by the Revised English Bible's translation of the Duterocanonicals (specifically Ecclesiasticus).Sadly, this hardback 'Reader's Edition' appears to be nothing less than a (crummy) photographic reproduction (and shrunk at that) version of an earlier copy of the Reader's Edition. I am deeply troubled that Doubleday did not see fit to actually imprint this copy of the JB, simply to photocopy/shrink it. (Yes, I know there is more involved than photocopying, but you get my point.)While I highly recommend the Jerusalem Bible (it's my second favorite translation after the English Standard Version), I can't commend this print job.Here's hoping, along with others, that Doubleday might yet get it right."},{"Title":"The Jerusalem Bible","review":"Both the language and the format of this Bible make it one of the most beautiful and readable translations available. It is said that J.R.R. Tolkein was on the editorial board. Certainly the language and the style- particularly of the prophets and the psalms- convey a grandeur and beauty which is reminiscent of Tolkein's writing. The text is eminently understandable. My original 1968 edition was in tatters from use. I have ordered this hardback re-edition for several years for my middle and high school students. They find the text far easier to understand than the New American or the Revised Standard editions. The format is also very user- friendly. Prose passages are typed across the page as in normal books rather than in columns. The psalms, the prophecies and the canticles are indented and given ample white space on the page which not only makes them easier to understand but captures the poetic grandeur of the scripture. Topical headings make individual passages very easy to find without a concordance. All I could wish is that they would re-issue the paperback edition which was available from 1965-mid 80's. I have bought up every available used one I could find to give as presents. There is a certain weight and quality to the paper and the book itself which lends itself to prayer. I find this original Jerusalem Bible preferable to the New Jerusalem which followed it because of the layout and the language."},{"Title":"The Jerusalem Bible","review":"Looking at translation alone, this Bible is one of the best to be done in the 20th century. It is much easier to read than the older Douay-Rheims Catholic Bible, but its translation (particularly of the Psalms) is more flowing and beautiful than the New American Bible. The original Jerusalem Bible also does not contain the inclusive language added in the New Jerusalem Bible.Unfortunately, as several others have pointed out, the printing job is poor, and my copy (as well as the others I have seen) is bound extremely poorly, looking as though it could fall apart at any moment even in the store. I only wish the publisher would add some more introductions and footnotes, bind it better, and republish it as something better than this &quot;Reader's Edition.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Jerusalem Bible","review":"This bible was offered by gideons at several high priced hotels in the 70's.

I am racing for the finish for the prize to which God calls us upward to receive in Christ Jesus. Philippians 4:13-14These words from the Jerusalem Bible perfectly describe the Christian life. Perfection (being like Christ) is our goal but we are not there yet. The Christian life is like running a marathon. The rules allow us to walk but we must stay on course. If we give up or go off course then we loose. But if we simply \\"strain ahead\\" then eventually we reach the finish line.It is also nice that the Jerusalem Bible uses the divine name of God instead of LORD like most English translations."},{"Title":"The Jerusalem Bible","review":"The Jerusalem Bible is a Roman Catholic Bible , but if you are not an R.C.

IT TALKS LIKE TODAY BUT I KNOW THE WRITINGS ARE FROM THE HEBREW BIBLE SO IT IS AS CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL WORD AS YOUR GOING TO GET."},{"Title":"The Jerusalem Bible","review":"The Jerusalem Bible (1966) is a Roman Catholic edition produced by scholars in Great Britain. This was the first Catholic version in English drawn directly from the Greek and Hebrew texts instead of the Latin Vulgate, by virtue of Pope Pius XII's Divino Afflante Spiritu. The name, the introduction commentary, the footnote annotations, and some of the scriptural text are taken from a French version published the previous decade by the Dominican Biblical School in Jerusalem, who also based their work on Greek and Hebrew sources.I purchased this bible upon hearing it was the one Mother Angelica used on her EWTN broadcasts. I had also heard that it was a very literal, very Catholic translation, and that the commentary was based on solid Catholic exegesis. I really wanted to like it, but it's been a big disappointment. I think it could be subtitled \\"Farewell, Early Church Fathers; Hello, Modern Rationalists.\\" Looking back, the language decisions and the decidedly un-Catholic nature of some of the commentary contained in the Jerusalem Bible were harbingers of things to come, like the wretched NAB which would be published some 4 years later.If you're wanting to reinforce your Catholic Faith from scripture reading, your time might be better spent with offerings other than the Jerusalem Bible. For a volume that is very thick physically, it is spiritually very thin. I think it will confuse more than it will help Catholics.One yardstick I apply for any translation or commentary is Chapter 1 of Luke. The rendering of the Annunciation Catholics are familiar with is:\\"Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women.\\" (Luke 1:28)The Jerusalem bible removes an entire sentence, \\"Blessed art thou among women\\", without even bothering to note that many source documents include it. Also, the words \\"Hail, full of grace\\" are absolutely butchered not only in style but in meaning:\\"Rejoice, so highly favored! The Lord is with you.\\"Come again?Catholics believe Mary is in a state of sinless *grace*: her womb is the ark of the new covenant, Jesus Christ. Interpreting her as being \\"highly favored\\" is an order of magnitude change in meaning. I have a pair of comfy sweat socks that I could describe as \\"highly favored\\"; you couldn't apply the term \\"full of grace\\" to anything so ordinary. It has an intrinsic meaning that communicates absolutely the holiness of the Blessed Virgin. This is an awfully \\"un-Catholic\\" rendering of an important part of our Faith. A Catholic relying solely on this bible would not know that the \\"Hail Mary\\" prayer is thoroughly rooted in scripture.The introductions and commentary are full of modernist literary-critical scholarship, especially in the Old Testament. Given that, I suppose it's a good thing that the footnotes are in tiny, barely readable print - you can save time by squinting *and* wincing all at once. There is little teaching here for the Catholic - only explanations on dating texts to after the events they prophesy, because everyone knows people really can't predict future events. That would be miraculous - and we can't have people come away from the bible believing in miracles now, can we?Stylistically, this bible has drawn great praise primarily, I think, because J.R.R. Tolkien worked with the translators. For the most part, the language is ok - I really haven't come across anything I would call soaring or particularly inspiring. One unfortunate choice the translators made that hurts this version is the rendering of the Hebrew tetragrammaton as \\"Yahweh\\", instead of \\"LORD.\\" It's very difficult to mar the beauty of the Psalter, but this decision does change the literary character of these prayers. Psalm 23 (22 in the Douay), another benchmark I use to check a translation, reads as follows in the Jerusalem Bible:1 Yahweh is my shepherd,I lack nothing.2 In meadows of green grass he lets me lie.To the waters of repose he leads me;3 there he revives my soul.He guides me by paths of virtuefor the sake of his name.4 Though I pass through a gloomy valley,I fear no harm;beside me your rod and your staffare there, to hearten me.5 You prepare a table before meunder the eyes of my enemies;you anoint my head with oil,my cup brims over.6 Ah, how goodness and kindness pursue me,every day of my life;my home, the house of Yahweh,as long as I live!Maybe some think that's an improvement, but I wouldn't agree with them.Notice also, very importantly, that the LORD (Yahweh) is no longer \\"with\\" you in verse 4. This is not a trivial point about a superficial change of style; the translators have actually changed the image of the personal God. Gone is the shepherd who was formerly beside you even while you walked in the midst of the shadow of death. Now, sadly, only his rod and staff are there to hearten you. Maybe you could get them engraved: \\"I called on God for comfort, but all I got was the staff.\\"My comments on specific elements notwithstanding, all in all this is not a terrible bible; but I was hoping for something more. I suppose I'll continue to use it here and there, and maybe it will grow on me. Who knows, it may contain some good perspectives or wording that can help clarify meaning for a difficult verse, but I don't know how receptive I would be, considering how they've dropped the ball on the \\"easy\\" articles I mentioned above.I think you certainly have much better options as a Catholic. I would suggest:1. A Douay-Rheims with or without the Haydock notes. I have heard that the notes on the Haydock versions are tiny, so I print out a chapter's worth at a time from an online source and keep them in a binder after I'm done.2. A pre-1970 Confraternity Bible. They are out of print, so you'll have to find a used one, but don't be suckered into the NAB, which was authorized by the Board of Trustees of the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine.3. A Navarre Bible, but be prepared to spend some cash. In my opinion, they are very much worth it if you're looking for sound commentary."},{"Title":"The Jerusalem Bible","review":"This review is from the 1966 Doubleday printing, the General Editor Alexander Jones.This Bible translation uses God's name Yahweh throughout the Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament) consistently.At Exodus 3:14 it fails to translate \\"Ehyeh asher ehyeh\\" properly, they translate it \\"I am who I am\\" whereas Jehovah God was not affirming his existence but expanding on what he would become to the Israelites. The RSV (Revised Standard Version) shows in the footnote for this verse that one way to translate it to get the proper sense of the verb is \\"I will be what I will be\\" also Rotherham's translation renders it: \\"I Will Become whatsoever I please.\\" God's name Jehovah or Yahweh comes from the Hebrew verb ha*wah' meaning \\"become\\", God's name means \\"He Causes to Become\\". The footnote in the Jerusalem Bible gets into theological theories, explanation and even philosophy on this topic and verse ignoring that Yahweh or Jehovah is simply the proper name of God and is the most used name in the Bible about 7,000 times in the Hebrew Scriptures.In the Christian Greek Scriptures (New Testament) God's name does not appear in the main text. At Matthew 2:19 the footnote indentifies that it is the angel of Yahweh that appears to Joseph also at Acts 2:20, 21 the footnotes fails to indicate this is a quote from Joel 2:28-32 but the translator does bring out that this is the \`day of Yahweh.' There may be other footnotes along these same lines showing the importance of God's name to the first century Christians.The word Alleluia appears four times in the first six verses of Revelation chapter 19, there is no definition in the footnote or otherwise that this word means praise Jah a shortened form of Jehovah.As usual with many translations of John 1:1 the Greek grammar is ignored for this one verse leaving out the indefinite article and improperly translating \\"the Word was God.\\"At John 8:58 the Jerusalem Bible translates Jesus words to the Pharisees as \\"I Am\\" going farther then some who translate those words as \\"I am\\", notice the capitalization, both incorrect rather then correctly along the lines of \\"I existed before Abraham\\" or something similar. This is both in line with the context and Greek grammar and other translations such as; The Living Bible, 21st Century New Testament, Moffatt's Bible, Goodspeed's New Testament, and C.B. Williams' New Testament.As far as the extensive footnotes and introductions to various Bible books or sections, other reviewers noted the authority and depth to these two things, a word of caution some are good but some are bad and sometimes mixed. As an example the footnote for Matthew 24:3 brings out that the word \\"coming\\" is the Greek word parousia meaning presence and gives a good definition of this but then starts to try to explain this is some sort of technical term adopted by first century Christians, the explanation falls short of any easy understanding of the point trying to be made. And yet anyone can understand the difference between being in someone's presence and someone coming, on their way to you. Theological terms and high sounding explanations were never used by Christ.This Bible contains the apocrypha.Overall the use of God's name Yahweh (Jehovah) throughout the Hebrew Scriptures marks this as a good translation especially owing to the fact more and more new translation are removing God's Name and replacing it with the titles lord or god."},{"Title":"The Jerusalem Bible","review":"I am very happy with this purchase.

The overly theologically correct versions of scripture (New Revised something) used in the churches that I have been to lately seem much milder than the reading which I am likely to find most interesting, but I should avoid striking at differences in a scope of things which is this vast. A year ago, I appreciated this book most for containing an account of the death of Razis in 2 Maccabees 14: 37-46. I was reading a book by Nietzsche called DAYBREAK, and a close study of the notes in the back of that book will reveal the section of text in which Nietzsche raised the question of whether the entrails which Razis tore out and flung at the troops with both hands would be restored to his body at the time of the resurrection. One of the heroes of Chapter 14 of 2 Maccabees seems to be named Judas Maccabaeus, who became a friend of a former commander of the elephants after an arranged peace in which &quot;Judas married, settled down and led a normal life.&quot; (Verse 25) In a manner that has become all too common in the last 10,000 years, by verse 33 someone has gone to the temple and declared, &quot;If you do not hand Judas over to me as prisoner, I will raze this sanctuary of God to the ground, I will demolish the altar, and on this very spot I will erect a splendid temple to Dionysus.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Jerusalem Bible","review":"When I learned that this 1966 version of The Jerusalem Bible was Mother Angelica's favorite teaching Bible, I immediately purchased it. Although the translation is outstanding, the font is criminally and diabolically small. I do not know what the publishers were thinking when they published this Bible.I study the Bible for hours each day and was hoping that I could use this particular Bible to study from. But because the font is so microscopic in size, I have no use for it except to use it as a quick reference. Because of the size of the font, it simply is not possible to use it as a study Bible.I am so very disappointed because the translation itself is EXCELLENT. I wish that Doubleday would republish this 1966 version in the giant print font that is becoming increasingly popular among students of the Bible in both Catholic and Protestant circles. People are studying the Sacred Scriptures like never before. They need a Bible that contains a readable font, not something that requires the use of a magnifying glass.Sorry, Doubleday. Close....but no cigar!"},{"Title":"The Jerusalem Bible","review":"Before I begin, I think someone put it best when he said: \\"You really have to find the Bible that works the best for you.\\" The \\"Jerusalem\\" version is really popular in England, France, and Canada. I actually prefer the \\"Jerusalem\\" version over the \\"New Revised Standard\\" (which is the one we use in church). I am aware that both Catholic and Anglican churches use the \\"New Revised Standard.\\" (I suspect mostly because the \\"New Revised Standard\\" uses gender inclusive language.) I actually prefer the ORIGINAL \\"Revised Standard\\" over the new one. (But we won't go there.) While the \\"Jerusalem\\" version is a really impressive translation, it is NOT the most beginner friendly. (That wonderful honor belongs to the highly respectable \\"Good News\\" version.) The \\"Jerusalem\\" version is kind of an advanced version. Onto the subject at hand. The \\"Jerusalem\\" version has excellent introduction to pages to several books of the Old Testament. Another charming bonus is a few pages of Chronilogical tables. One of the first things you will probably notice in the Old Testament is that \\"Yahweh\\" (the Jewish name of God) is often used in the place of God. If you are looking for a Bible with the 'Deuterocanonicals' (or as some people call them the 'Apocryphal' Books), you will be happy to know that the \\"Jerusalem\\" version has these. The intro books on the New Testament are great as well. (Especially the introductions to Paul's letters and \\"Revelation.\\") Being perfectly honest, there are some verses where I prefer the translation in the ORIGINAL \\"Revised Standard.\\" The \\"Jerusalem\\" version simplifies the dream of Pilate's wife. (Matthew 27:19). In \\"Luke,\\" in the matter of the master who forgave a 500 coin debt a 50 coin debt, the \\"Jerusalem\\" version says the one who loved his master more was: \\"The one who was pardoned more\\" (Luke 7:43). The original \\"Revised Standard\\" puts it a little better: \\"The one, I suppose to whom he forgave more\\" (Luke 7:43). You'll probably also notice that in \\"Revelation,\\" the 4th Horsemen is referred to as Plague followed by Hades rather than Death followed by Hell. But in all honesty, no matter how good any translation is, there are always going to be some verses where you prefer the translation in another version. I'll conclude by saying that if you're a beginner as the Bible is concerned, the \\"Good News\\" is your best bet. I consider the original \\"Revised Standard\\" a strong contender for the most theologically accurate. And while I feel the \\"Revised Standard\\" puts some things better, the \\"Jerusalem\\" is a very impressive translation with excellent introduction notes as well as other guides."},{"Title":"The Jerusalem Bible","review":"I was required to buy this Bible for Theology classes in 1979 as a Freshman at Seattle University. I concur with Scripture Studier. They had a huge panel of experts comb through the best scholarship of the time to do the footnotes. I'll also add that the cross-references to other scriptures are extremely valuable. Of course, there are many New Testament passages that refer back to the Old Testament, but there are more cross-citations even just in the Old that one would imagine unless you see them. I was looking on Amazon, hoping to find an updated study Bible but nothing since comes close. I'd love it if an updated, online version would be commissioned. Then those footnotes and cross-references would just be a click! :-)I've read this Bible cover-to-cover a half dozen times, not to mention many times looking up something specific.

The re-issue of this translation goes a long way toward balancing this out and is a compassionate solution to a delicate problem.

While the New American Bible version is the most popular Catholic Bible in the US, the 1966 and more modern New Jerusalem Bible is the preferred translation with the worldwide Catholic (no redundancy here) following (used during liturgy and personal study) and also popular with the Anglican and Orthodox Christians.This version is translated directly from the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts and the only competitive translation is the Revised Standard Edition. I would recommend the newer and more modern New Jerusalem Bible or New Revised Standard Version.The Old Testament has introduction notes to its four main sections: The Pentateuch (the first 5 books; Mosaic texts), The Historical Books, The Wisdom Books, and The Prophets. The New Testament has introduction nots to the Synoptic Gospels (St. Matthew, Mark and Luke), Gospel and Letter of John, Acts of the Apostles, The Letters of Paul (pastoral epistles/letters), The Letters to All Christians (catholic/universal epistles/letters). The Supplemental notes include a Chronologic Table, charts and calendars, an Alphabetical table of the Major Footnotes, an Index of Persons (a great feature), and some great Color Maps.With the claim that J.R.R. Tolkien was one of the original translators and that this edition targets \\"the Christian and non-Christian, believer and skeptic audiences, and anyone who wishes to own a Bible independent of sectarian and confessional considerations\\" it would seem to be the ideal Bible to own. A note on this marketing strategy is that this version includes the Apocrypha (Old Testament Deutero-canonical books), and explanatory footnotes which are non-polemical but from a Catholic/Anglican theological perspective.What I like most about this Bible is is literary quality. Verses flow easily without numbering interruptions and the text really reads like the original recipients (e.g. the churches in Asia Minor) would have read it ... as a letter. The textual presentation is truly literary, such that poetical, liturgical, and prayers that Paul writes in his letters are formated uniquely and separately. The same is the case with the Psalms and Gospels. The verse numbers are listed to the right of the text, and verse separation is denoted by a dot (it was only in the 13th century when the original texts were numbered and divided into verses and subtitles added for ease of reference).As an evangelical Protestant, I am using this guide as a more comprehensive view of textual and historical hermeneutics, and a more reader-friendly textual literary format."},{"Title":"The Jerusalem Bible","review":"I received this Bible for my twentieth birthday, and I must say it is a true treasure to me.

For example, the introduction to the PENTATEUCH or TORAH which are the first five books of the Bible (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)explains why many bible scholars dispute the claim that Moses wrote these books. Scholars argue that different authors and traditions were edited or redacted by those who may have reconciled these traditions to give a presentable compilation of these books. Readers should know among the Ancient Hebrews and Jews, the TORAH is most important part of TANAK or Hebrew Bible or The Old Teatament for Christians.Father Jones gives readers intrductions to the other books of the entire Bible which inform the reader of the history, social background, and cultural mileau of each book. This helps readers understand what each book was trying to convey. In other words, these presentations clearly indicate that the books of the Bible were not written in a vaccum. There are also brief notes with each book of this bible to explain more precisely phrases and words that may seem unusal or obscure. The editor is honest enough to state that there are still uncertainties.There are nine useful maps at the end of this bible that assist readers in understanding where events and books of the Bible were written. This edition also has a surprisingly good chronological table which helps readers with a more detailed understanding events in \\"The Holy Land\\" and events within the Ancient Greek and Roman empires.This reviewer also has criticisms of THE JERUSALEM BIBLE:READERS EDITION. The translators made excessive use of the word Yahweh or a name for God or the Deity. This word for God is based on The Tetragrammaton or Sacred Four Letter Word for God. This may have been an error because this word,in Hebrew, was only to be used on special occassions by the early chief priests and later, the rabbis. The Ancient Hebrews substituted the word Adonoi which translates into English as Lord. The continued use of this word may be historically inaccurate.Other criticisms of this edition of the Bible are that it lacks a concordance and a bibliography. Even though this is not a \\"scholars'bible,\\" this edition should have at least contained these items. Some of these problems are mitigated by the fact that the margin notes and other notes at the bottom of the pages are useful.THE JERUSALEM BIBLE: READERS EDITION is still a good translation in spite of the above criticisms. Readers will be assited if they can get THE NEW JEROME BIBLE COMMENTARY. Father Graham's small book titled WHERE WE GOT THE BIBLE is also helpfu. Bernard Anderson's book titled UNDERSTANDING THE OLD TESTAMENT is very comprehensive and well written. A combination of these sources will give readers a solid understanding of THE JERUSALEM BIBLE: READER'S EDITION."},{"Title":"The Jerusalem Bible","review":"The Jerusalem Bible is a very literary translation, a joy to read a joy to read. It was the first modern bible for Catholics translated from the original languages into English. Done by Catholic scholars at the Ecole Biblique in Jerusalem, the Jerusalem Bible has had broad appeal across denominational lines. It has been particularly popular among Anglicans and Eastern Orthodox. Twenty years ago I saw an Anglican book that had a full year of Anglican lectionary readings from the Jerusalem Bible. Boy, I wish I could still find that! I remember 20 years ago when I first became involved with the Catholic Charismatic movement, many people chose the Jerusalem Bible. It is still the Bible used in English Liturgies outside of the US and Canada. It has often been quoted in Catholic teaching materials; for example, it is the version John Hardon, SJ uses in his classic explanation of the Catholic faith. Spiritual writers like Richard Rohr OFM quote the Jerusalem Bible. And of course, watchers of EWTN will know that it is Mother Angelica's favorite teaching Bible. Although the Jerusalem Bible was revised in 1985 and published as the New Jerusalem Bible, I enjoy the original quite a bit. Some may object to the use of Yahweh in the Old Testament. This usage may offend some of our orthodox Jewish brothers and sisters, and we Christians should certainly be sensitive to our Jewish friends, because Christians have not been through the centuries. But one can read \\"Lord\\" where Yahweh is, as the ancient Jews did. Some find the use of Yahweh appealing; it can help a sense of intimacy with a personal God. Also the use of Yahweh may help us remember the teaching of St. John Damascene, that when we read the word \\"God\\" in the bible, it is not speaking about the Essence of God, but the energies of God into history. By using Yahweh, The Jerusalem bible emphasizes that Yahweh represents the historical working of God among the Jewish people. There is yet a transcendent aspect of God, not wholly captured, but pointed to in the sacred text. The best thing I like about this particular edition is that it is single column. That was always an attractive feature for me, and I am somewhat disappointed that the New Jerusalem Bible edition that is similar to this has double column instead."},{"Title":"The Jerusalem Bible","review":"Well this is the first bible I have read, but I love it! Really easy to read and understand. I use it for my class once a week and it's a very good tool for people to learn the bible."},{"Title":"The Jerusalem Bible","review":"While I love the different verbage used in the Jerusalem Bible, I am greatly disappointed that the footnotes from the original version have been removed. I rely on footnotes to enhance my understanding. For a good Catholic Bible with great footnotes checkoutThe Catholic Study Bible Second Edition"},{"Title":"The Jerusalem Bible","review":"The Jerusalem Bible is a Roman Catholic denominational translation with a definitely theologically liberal slant, not unlike that of the New English Bible and the Revised Standard Version of the same era. However, like all those mentioned, it fore-dates the intrusion of political correctness and feminism into the translation of the Bible and so presents a more literary version without the annoying and distracting inclusive speech, say, of the New Jerusalem Bible or the New Revised Standard or even the English Standard Version. Whilst the Jerusalem Bible would not be any where near as reliable as my favourite - the New King James Version - it does have its merits, in places, if one knows how to use it, in giving different slants on the meaning of God's most holy, infallible and inspired Word."},{"Title":"The Jerusalem Bible","review":"I've had many bibles and this one has been the easiest to read. It's great for bible study or daily devotions. I bought my friend one too and she says the same. Mother Angelica uses this bible, enough said!"},{"Title":"The Jerusalem Bible","review":"I am pleased to see so many appreciative reviews of the Jerusalem Bible, a translation I have used for nearly twenty years. Despite occasional quirks in the translation I absolutely love this Bible. Believe me, I've tried several modern translations but this the best. The Word of God seems to leap up at you from the pages, which makes it an ideal Bible for use in prayer and meditation. I am willing to forgive the aforementioned quirks for the overall brilliance of the text. I have to say I object to the use of 'happy' in place of 'blessed', especially in the Beatitudes. There's a whole lot of difference between being blessed by God and feeling 'happy', which is an interior disposition. My only other gripe is the uneven quality of the psalms. They range from the sublime to the commonplace, which leads me to think that their translation was the work of several hands. One major advantage of the JB (and one which is rare in Bibles) is the text printed across the page instead of in two columns. This helps to make the Word of God 'flow' as you read it and is a big advantage when reading difficult passages - for example in Paul's letters.I'm sorry to hear about the poor print quality of the Doubleday Reader's Edition. If Doubleday can't be persuaded to re-issue the JB in an improved format, there are two solutions to you folks who want a decent copy. Firstly, the Catholic Truth Society in London have produced something called the 'The CTS New Catholic Bible' which has the JB text (with 'Lord' instead of 'Yahweh' in the Old Testament) and the Grail translation of the psalms in place of the JB psalms. This is a wonderful combination and matches the approved readings for the liturgy in the U.K., Ireland and some other countries (sadly soon to be supplanted by the awful NRSV in the revised missal). If anyone is interested in purchasing this Bible I recommend you avoid the pocket edition because of its miniscule print size. The Standard Edition measures 19 x 13 cm, has brief but punchy footnotes, useful appendices and maps. The British Reader's edition of the original 1966 JB, published by Darton, Longman & Todd is still available and has nice black print, although the binding is nothing special. Strictly speaking this is not available in the U.S.A. because the American imprint is with Doubleday."},{"Title":"The Jerusalem Bible","review":"The Jerusalem Bible is a GREAT Bible translation, rich, poetic and at the same time simple to read and to understand!I was used to read the Bible in Portuguese, but since I bought this edition I adopted It as my preferred fount, which I can read together with my usual Bible and compare the passages. Taking into account Its English is balanced and readable my Bible reading has become richer than before.The copy I received is definitely not a poorly printed material as commented by others, that's different from Brazilians traditional editions which are good ones too, but I can tell you that I really loved this edition, its cover, color as well as the paper quality.God bless all of you!"},{"Title":"The Jerusalem Bible","review":"Great translation, easy to understand. I bought it for my daughter because the translation is aesy to understand in modern english. Subtitles also help with the understanding of the text."},{"Title":"The Jerusalem Bible","review":"Somehow I wound up with the International Version of this book that states in the inside cover that is it to be sold in all countries but not to be sold to or in the United States. I see no difference in the actually English text used in either but the International version has the numbers in the text instead of on the side but the numbers are really really small. It does seem strange to see the tetragrammaton all over the place and I don't really feel like I am qualified to say that word so I replace it with \\"the Lord\\" when I read but I do know that it is the original word. Would be nice if someone would just not Romanize the word and leave it in Hebrew with \\"the Lord\\" in brackets next to it but that is for another Bible I guess."},{"Title":"Invisible helpers","review":"This book gives first-hand accounts of InvisibleHelpers--people who go to sleep at night, leave their bodies at home,and go out helping people. They really do exist, even if the idea sounds wild at first. Read the book.First, you should read &quot;The Work of Invisible Helpers,&quot; by Amber Tuttle, as it's a bigger book and explains a lot more. But C.W. Leadbeater's book is good too, just a lot shorter.Leadbeater, a famous theosophist/psychic who lived 90 years ago, talks about who Invisible Helpers are and what they do. It gives a different point of view. If you are interested in psychic powers and how they can be made useful to help people, check this title out."},{"Title":"Invisible helpers","review":"Ever wonder why you escaped from that near miss auto accident or why you suddenly receive information out of nowhere that solves a long standing problem?

The book had struck a special nerve in my memory, and led to my further study of Theosophy. When I learned I could get a copy from Quest, I was pleased, but even more so when it turned out to be an exact copy of the original book I had missed for so long.I have since ordered more old books from Quest. They do a fine service."},{"Title":"Invisible helpers","review":"Read it and it was good and informative however, when I purchased it I was hoping it would be about our helper Angels and it's not.

It's not particularly in-depth, but provides some useful introductory material."},{"Title":"Sidney's Comet","review":"I found this odd book on someone's favorite book list ... Since that person liked a lot of other books I liked, I figured I'd give it a look. What I found was one of the most bizarre futures (600 years hence) imaginable. I couldn't figure out if Herbert was trying to make a twisted anti-consumerism Brave New World or what, but all of a sudden I realized - this is a ... good story. The premise, about a \\"garbage comet\\", was really almost incidental to the story and should not be considered a negative."},{"Title":"Sidney's Comet","review":"This book is not only good and witty sci. fi., it is also aparody of the American obsessiopn with consumer's society and endlesscommercials. How would you like to live in a society where great majority of people has brain implants who emit signals for example of being itchy when there is a commercial for spray to ease itching, and symptoms subside as soon as you order the spray etc."},{"Title":"Sidney's Comet","review":"Why a publisher would choose to reissue this book is beyond me. I suppose it might have been more amusing in the mid \`80s when it first came out, but even back then I'm afraid I would have found its treatment of those with physical disabilities (\\"cappies\\", from \\"handicapped\\") just as offensive, even if intended as some further indictment of American society (to go along with the anti-consumerist slant throughout).Make no mistake: this is not science fiction. It's heavy-handed farce with some nifty neato gismos and a spaceship or two; a series of episodes from \\"The Jetsons\\" retold through a bad hangover.Read this one only if you want to see what Brian Herbert's style was like when he was only influenced by his father and had not yet fallen under the shadow of Kevin J. Anderson; back when, apparently, he could still write."},{"Title":"Writing Skills Activities for Special Children","review":"I am a special education teacher and this book is awesome! It is huge and has a TON of activities on writing words, sentences, and paragraphs. I got it along with \\"Let's Write!\\" by Cynthia M., M.Ed. Stowe, but if I had to choose one it would definitely be this one! This is the best book for a huge variety of writing practice pages that can easily be copied. This book makes writing so much easier for children! Don't think it can only be used for special education either! As a teacher, I have bought a lot of books to help me teach a variety of skills and this is easily in my top favorites!"},{"Title":"Writing Skills Activities for Special Children","review":"This book is EXACTLY what we need right now. With my younger son, who is now in 3rd grade and is a bit dyslexic and has some language processing difficulties, we are working our way through the very beginning of the book. Spelling is extremely difficult for him, and though I've been a long-time believer in phonics, the exercises for 100 \\"little words,\\" which are mostly sight-word spelling and usage, is right up his alley. For my son who is in 5th grade, we're about a quarter of the way through the book. He has an odd mix of strengths and weaknesses, and I'm using the book as a resource to analyze where he's lacking in his writing and basic English skills.Actually, this book really goes beyond simply writing skills: it covers some grammar, spelling, vocabulary, and other language skills, too -- especially in the earlier lessons.I am a homeschooling mother; we're in our 8th year homeschooling. Many resources that are written for classroom instruction do not work well in a homeschool setting, but this book is PERFECT. It has helpful, simple, yet thorough instruction to the teacher, and reproducible worksheets for the student."},{"Title":"Writing Skills Activities for Special Children","review":"Writing Skills Activities for Special Children is an excellent resource for teaching children who need extra focus on individual components of writing. Exercises range in level/focus from sentences, to paragraphs, to various longer composition styles, to other writing-related skills, such as note-taking.The book is designed as a supplemental resource book for focus on targeted skills, but the lessons are so nice to have that I sometimes wish it was expanded and formatted as a complete curriculum.I am using this with my special needs child in home school."},{"Title":"Writing Skills Activities for Special Children","review":"This is an awesome instructional tool for teachers. It breaks down the writing into manageable categories that are easily understood by the students.

Alex faces time as a prisoner, Wally continues in the unspeakable horror known as the Japanese P.O.W. camps and Bobbi struggles to keep her relationship with Richard alive as wounded soldiers pour in from the South Pacific theater. The reader is drawn so deeply into the lives of these characters they almost seem like family. Hughes, once again, has brilliantly triumphed in continuing to keep us so tuned in to the Thomases."},{"Title":"When We Meet Again (Children of the Promise)","review":"I'm very pleased with this book.

The entire series is great! I really enjoyed reading it. It makes you think about a couple of the things that happend a little bit differently. I love great World War II books and I was proud to read and add \\"When We Meet Again\\" to my collection. If you love a series filled with suspence, romance, action, adventure and heart ache, then read this book, and the entire series for that matter!"},{"Title":"When We Meet Again (Children of the Promise)","review":"Dean Hughes is the best. He has the talent of writing a story that immediately brings you into the thick of it. This is a series of WW2 novels, with 5 volumes being in the first series. You feel for what this family is going through as they try and cope with World War 2. Best of all, they are \\"clean\\" books. None of the smut and dirty language. Dean doesn't need any of that. He writes a great story!!!. I recommend this series plus his follow up series Hearts of the Children another great 5 volumes."},{"Title":"When We Meet Again (Children of the Promise)","review":"This was a gift for my sister.

She records a touchingly ordinary life of a typical 19th-century young woman; home life, going to school, her hopes and dreams. Truly interesting to historians should be her position as \\"teacher\\" for her grandfather's slaves, who were being prepared for their freedom. General Lee wanted them to be taught to read and write so they could make a living, and Miss Agnes and her beloved sister Annie (who died tragically of typhoid during the war) taught the classes. Agnes, like her sisters, never married although she had a hearbreaking love over with Orton Williams, whom the war turned into a hard-drinking man. She tearfully refused his proposal and never healed from her grief when he was hanged by Union troops. This is an invaluable resource for a young girl's life of the period. Highly recommend"},{"Title":"Growing Up in the 1850s: The Journal of Agnes Lee","review":"The Journal of Agnes Lee was written over a 5-year period while Agnes was between 12 and 17, and before the Civil War that would make her father such a legend. Don't expect breathtaking adventure here, but rather sit back and enjoy a view of this young girl coming of age in the 1850's. My strongest reaction to the book was, &quot;How I would have loved to know Agnes!&quot; She really does come alive here with exuberant spontaneity. Her writings provide many glimpses into the overall family life and way of thinking about her life. Agnes' love for her family is intense, and it can make the reader jealous of such closeness, rarely seen in today's society. I do recommend this book to those who want to know about General Lee's family life, and those who are interested in knowing more about this delightful girl, taken from the world by illness at age 32."},{"Title":"Growing Up in the 1850s: The Journal of Agnes Lee","review":"Eleanor Agnes Lee was the daughter of General Robert E. Lee, the famous Conferderate Commander in the War Between the States. This is the journal from her girlhood. I thoroughly enjoyed it. There are many books about Robert E. Lee, but there are very few about the rest of his family. This is one of the only sources on his third, beautiful daughter, Agnes, and lets us see better the life of the Lee family. It tells of her faith, her struggles, and her wonderful relationship with her family.

Given my prior success with learning techniques from this series, and my great desire to learn bead crochet (and, particularly, ropes or tubular crochet), I was literally counting down the days until the release of this book. Unfortunately, this book fell short in several key areas. As the book is primarily intended to instruct, it was upsetting to see the instructions for techniques were neither clearly described nor well-illustrated. In reviewing the projects, whose purpose is to provide opportunities to explore the techniques, several deficits existed. First, each project required that the reader back to the less-than-stellar instructions to which I previously referred. In addition, the projects were more focused on crochet and less on the addition of beads to the process. Finally, the projects presented by the author, quite frankly, were both bulky in size and gaudy in style. While jewelry and/or fiberarts of the style presented are considered &quot;art jewelry&quot;, the chaotic and hefty pieces presented seem to appeal to only a small population (including this reviewer).

(and does this woman have any idea of the conditions in ireland in the 1500's?) also, the continual references to christianity, probably thanks to her source, were off-putting, as well as inaccurate.okay, i'll stop the historical criticism, and get to the bits beadworkers want to hear about. no, one more comment--crochet did not generate income during the famine in ireland, since england didn't allow ireland a cash economy until later in the century. irish style crochet was a LATE 19th century development. i really will stop now, there are far to many other inaccuracies to tackle individually.another reviewer has mentioned the really poor directions. one example not mentioned specifically, tubular bead crochet, is not explained sufficiently in the opening chapters--in fact, not until the SECOND project is there any explanation of the massively important technique for keeping the bead on the outside of the tube. if anyone gets past the first tubular project, it will be only with incredible luck. this is inexcusable, as 'beadwork' magazine has published better directions for tubular crochet in more than one issue. i know this, since i used these articles to teach myself beaded tubular crochet.i objected to the inclusion of so many other techniques. the directions for peyote, etc., are fine if you already know what you're doing, but less than sketchy for new beaders. but, since this is supposed to be a book about bead crochet, why are other techniques incorporated?i, too, think the author's designs are unattractive. in fact, i think most of them are revolting.the best part of the book is the pictures of antique bead crochet items. now, these are inspiring! these are beautiful. these are varied. they are the only reason i will keep this book in my library."},{"Title":"Bead Crochet (Beadwork How-To)","review":"I greatly enjoy crocheting and was looking to expand beyond the typical granny square afghan.

I know enough to expect that the nicest looking project is usually on the cover, and that it's usually the most difficult.I started with the easier projects, but found the instructions hard to follow. The author states up front that it's not an introductory crochet book and that if you want to learn to crochet basic stitches look elsewhere. However, she spends a lot more time explaining how to do generic crochet than how to work with beads.I believe this book has reasonably interesting projects if you already know how to crochet with beads. What I found so difficult -- the openendedness of the directions -- would probably appeal to a more experienced and artistic bead crocheter.

I consider myself to be a novice crocheter. I was finally able to bead crochet using single crochet with Ms. Barry's book. which is a much better stitch to use and more secure. You do need to know something about crochet before tackling some of the projects. I disagree with some of the comments, on the focus on bead stringing. I absolutely love glass, and this is the book to get. I recently completed one of the projects, and I am so satisfied.

Mainly, because it wasn't strictly tubular bead crochet and wasn't much help in learning it. Although, I have to admit that every book helped a little.Now that I'm experienced with bead crochet I find her book refreshing because it's a little different. Crocheting spiral tubes has become a little confining for me and her book opens up some new worlds.I don't understand her use of a mandrel for working an entire tubular piece. Although, I find a wooden skewer, stiff shoelace, or other item placed in the center of the beginning chain a big help.

The inside jacket flap reads, &quot;Drawing on the diverse cooking traditions of America, Italy, France, India, Morocco, and the Middle East, the authors have assembed 184 recipes that include not only the classic examples of each cuisine, but also unsual dishes that provide surprising gastronomic rewards.&quot; It is an apt description.The book was published before roasted peppers, balsamic and other flavoured vinegars and gorgonzola cheese were as commonly used in the everyday North American kitchen as they are today. Since it focuses on soups, pastas and stews, with a few side dishes or accompaniments in a chapter at the back of the book, there is a huge variety. The soups range from the traditional, like borscht or mushroom, to chestnut soup with brandy and cream, or cream of lettuce. The stews, pastas, and salads have names that get your mouth watering: chicken tagine with prunes, onions, and almonds; braised short ribs with onions, mustard and white wine; lamb stew with rosemary and capers; penne with black olive pur&eacute;e and ricotta; Bibb, watercress, walnut, olive and Gruy&egrave;re salad with creamy walnut dressing, etc. The recipes combine ingredients with flair, and the results are delicious, a symphony of flavours and texture. Even their chili recipe includes red wine, coriander and chocolate.This book is one to be enjoyed when you love cooking and have the time to prepare meals. What is better than the aroma of a hearty soup or stew, simmering for hours on the stove on a wet autumn day? It is a great book for those who have a well-stocked spice rack, and who are not daunted by a long list of ingredients. The recipes are perfect for company, especially if your friends enjoy trying different dishes and ingredients.

It would be fantastic if his elegant theories worked for this industry, but they don't.Serious flaws:Authors: Care value should be measured by outcomes.Reality: This is the fundamental problem with the healthcare market is that even the end-user of cannot fully assess the outcome not to mention the medical interventions' contributions to that outcome. Diseases recur and response to medical treatment varies so greatly that doctors rarely agree on the simplest courses of treatment. Only for the most common disease states will there be consensus on intervention. The authors compare the healthcare consumer to the institutional purchaser of computer systems, people that are generally IT experts. This is akin to comparing all patients to nurses.Authors: Competition should exist at a national level.Reality: Patients are cured locally because sick, pregnant, working people, etc., do not want to travel to another city to get specialized care. In fact, Guy David's studies show that proximity of less than half a mile holds more sway for patients than expertise. One can't purchase healthcare over the internet. Nor can patients in the bottom 50% of wage-earners travel to another metropolitan area every month to see a field expert.Authors: Community-based hospitals repeatedly produce better outcomes than academic institutionsReality: Patients with difficult-to-treat medical conditions are referred to or self-refer to academic medical centers so the sample group is biased.It's no surprise that Porter missed some of the most obvious aspects of defining the problem. The acknowledgements section of the book contains few of the renowned experts in the field. The centers of knowledge do not lie in the management departments of Harvard or Darden. The authors seem to only have corroborated their theories with individuals from other industries, second-rate scholars, and politicians.It was frustrating to have to read 411 pages of repetitive and ignorant text. While Porter has created groundbreaking theories in management (specifically of manufacturing and less-specialized service industries) he is attempting to fit his famous theories where they do not fit.One must admire the attempt to write a comprehensive solution to the problem of the US healthcare system. However, it's an effort fraught with laziness and little introspection. The book, however, has a decent reference section. Either the authors did not read these papers themselves or chose to ignore the most salient points in the works of the field experts. If you want to real scoop, read Halvorson, Pauly, Danzon, Fisher, or anyone else who has studied this field for more than the authors' seven years.Halvorson's Health Care Reform Now is a far superior book because it provides actionable remedies for the health care problem. Furthermore, Halvorson has 30 years of healthcare experience (compared to Porter's 3 years when he wrote this book). In addition, Halvorson has actually implemented his suggestions. Also, he cites credible organizations and publications that actually support his suggestions (RAND, IOM) whereas Porter cites and collaborates with organizations merely willing to collaborate with him (Dartmouth and Harvard - two institutions with very little research and health care specialists).Halvorson's book may not have as thick a list of citations as Porter's; however, it makes its point more concisely and much more effectively than Porter's.In Porter's defense, since writing this book, he has become more knowledgeable about health care and his arguments are starting to make more sense. Redefining Healthcare proves the complexity of health care by demonstrating how difficult it is to apply basic theories of other industries to fix the health care system.Halvorson's book along with R. Lawton Burn's The Business of Healthcare Innovation are the two most valuable books on the American health care system. You can read them both in half the time it will take you to read Redefining Healthcare and you will be twice as knowledgeable."},{"Title":"Redefining Health Care: Creating Value-Based Competition on Results","review":"\\"Redefining Health Care\\" begins with data detailing the failures of America's \\"health system\\" - the highest and most rapidly rising costs among modern nations, combined with millions of uninsured, high error rates, and an average 17 years for the results of clinical trials to become standard clinical practice. Thus, the puzzle: \\"Why is competition failing in health care?\\"Porter and Teisberg's answer is that it focuses far too much on cost-reduction, increasing negotiating power, providing broad-lines of service, and cost-shifting, and instead should focus on long-term value (results vs. costs) for patients. Key to accomplishing this is the collection of standardized patient outcome data (preferably risk-adjusted) that are used to identify providers needing improvement and sources from which that improvement can be gleaned, as well as in guiding patient decision-making.\\"Redefining Health Care\\" also asserts that its recommendations are not just theories, but also supported by a number of cited examples.This book provides a clear vision of how the U.S. can reduce health care costs while improving patient outcomes - without increased complexity. It should be read by legislators at both the state and national level, as well as by health care providers."},{"Title":"Redefining Health Care: Creating Value-Based Competition on Results","review":"Health care reform is a critical issue. The authors are well-known, highly educated, and know their subject well. Unfortunately, they wrote a book whose redundancies, especially in the opening chapters, drives the reader to boredom.

Frankly, I set the book aside, planning on finishing it after more readable books have been read."},{"Title":"Redefining Health Care: Creating Value-Based Competition on Results","review":"This book by Porter and Teisberg contains the only new and untried model for health care in 70+ years. Conceptually, it is remarkably simple: regroup health care thinking and payment to providers by disease, what the authors call \\"medical condition.\\" Like PPOs in the 1980s, this essentially private solution can be put in place quickly. It requires no government action or legislation, as a legal matter is not insurance in key respects and thus is not limited to insurers and HMOs but can be implemented by a large variety of innovators, without state insurance regulation. Among its breakthroughs are its focus on health care results for patients, and its rejection of two conventional assumptions: that doctors and hospitals should be paid separately regardless of patient outcome and that health care is local.Their book makes America's health care system today like the horse and buggy industry in 1890 -- and it's a detailed guide to the automobile."},{"Title":"Redefining Health Care: Creating Value-Based Competition on Results","review":"Michael Porter, of value chain and competitive advantage fame, has taken on the US health care system.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Redefining Health Care: Creating Value-Based Competition on Results","review":"Those who have read Porter's previously published On Competition no doubt recall the excellent material on which he and Teisberg collaborated in Chapter 12, \\"Making Competition in Health Care Work,\\" originally published in Harvard Business Review (July/August 1994). They collaborate again on this volume in which they examine health care issues in three broad areas: \\"The first is the cost of and access to health insurance. The second is standards for coverage, or the types of care that should be covered by insurance versus being the responsibility of the individual. The third is the structure of health care delivery itself.\\" Porter and Teisberg explain why the only way to truly reform health care is to reform the nature of competition itself. More specifically, to transform health care by realigning competition with value for patients.\\"How to do so is the central focus of this book.\\"How to explain dysfunctional competition in health care? Porter and Teisberg suggest several which include \\"misaligned incentives and a series if understandable but unfortunate strategic, organizational, and regulatory choices by each participant in the system that feed on and exacerbate each other. All actors in the system share responsibility for the problem....The problem is that competition does not take place at the medical condition level, nor over the full care cycle. Competition is the current system is at the same time too broad, too narrow, and too local.\\"This year in the United States alone, at least $2 trillion will be spent on health care, and costs will continue to escalate. While conducting their research, Porter and Teisberg concluded that there should be no presumption that good quality of health care is more costly. On the contrary, they learned that \\"better providers are usually more efficient. Good quality is less costly because of more accurate diagnoses, fewer treatment errors, lower complication rates, faster recovery, less invasive treatment, and the minimization of the need for treatment. More broadly, better health is less expensive than illness. Better providers can often earn higher margins at the same or lower prices...so quality improvement does not require ever-escalating costs.\\"Porter and Teisberg have a convincing, indeed compelling argument in support of value-based competition on results in health care within a system which is \\"ripe for change\\"...and change for the better but not for the costlier if competition in health care is redefined and then conducted as Porter and Teisberg advocate. One of the most important benefits would be that the changes they propose would be self-reinforcing. \\"Changes by health plans and providers to compete on values will reinforce and magnify each other, and will spur innovation by suppliers. As consumers and employers adopt these principles, providers and health plans will be more motivated, and more able, to improve the value they deliver.\\"For these and other reasons, it is imperative to redefine health care by redefining the nature of health care competition. The alternatives and, especially, the implications and consequences of those alternatives are unacceptable. As noted earlier, \\"How to do so is the central focus of this book.\\""},{"Title":"Redefining Health Care: Creating Value-Based Competition on Results","review":"Porter's analysis of the health care system and its problems is right on yet his solutions could not be farther from the direction that the health care system must move to become a real system that serves all Americans. There are so many flaws in the logic of the book and it is so impractical in its recommendations that I am not concerned that anyone will see it as a route to solving the ills of the US healthcare system. Here are some of the main flaws.1) Most people have very limited choice of providers - specifically the uninsured, people in rural areas, people in managed care plans, people whose employers offer only a limited selection of plans/doctors/hospital. In order for \\"results\\" to drive increases in market share - one of Porter's main theses, people have to be able to choose where they will go for care.2) Competition related to outcomes will slow down progress in medical care dramatically. Hospitals and doctors, rather than rushing to share their newly discovered procedures with others - or share \\"best practices\\" for improving surgical outcomes will be incentivized to keep this \\"results\\" producing findings to themselves so they can publish better outcome statistics and attract more business. Is this what we want? Don't we want physicians and institutions to openly share best practices to help everyone achieve better outcomes?3) Porter believes that people should get care from the \\"best\\" specialists - even if this means travelling to another city or state for that care. Ridiculous! Once again this will increase the disparities in health outcomes between the rich and poor, the insured and the uninsured, people who have lots of medical knowledge and those who have little medical knowledge. People better equipped, educationally or financially or through insurance coverage may travel to places to get better outcomes while the others get inferior care. Is that what we want from our new health care system?Porter's logic is seriously flawed. It is the result of a profit-oriented mind trying to create solutions for a system that cannot be driven by profit but one which must be driven by concern for all Americans - a desire to achieve excellence wherever people go for care - and a need to raise the level of performance of all doctors and all health care institutions. Porter's solutions create an elitist model where care will improve for a very small number of people at the expense of the general population. It is a non-solution to a complex problem.If any proof is needed concerning how wrong Porter's model can be one must look at the data concerning the degree to which the poor and the uninsured go to hospitals doing low volumes of procedures and therefore, by implication, have worse outcomes. These are the very places where the uninsured, people of color and others of limited means get a majority of their care in urban areas. Just ask how Porter's solutions purport to help these underresourced institutions \\"compete\\" and as they loose resources to others, how they will maintain and improve the standard of services they now provide.If you read this book, think about these issues and ask yourself if these are real solutions that serve all Americans. I think you'll see what I mean."},{"Title":"Redefining Health Care: Creating Value-Based Competition on Results","review":"This book has received probably disproportionate attention due to Prof. Porter's notoriety as a strategic thinking theorist. There are better overall books on healthcare policy available. In particular I recommend the Bodenheimer/Grumbach books, one on healthcare policy and one on primary care, Dr. Arnold Relman's book, A Second Opinion, Strained Mercy, an outstanding and thorough analysis of healthcare economics with particular regard to Canada's healthcare system and Pricing the Priceless a more technically-oriented economic analysis by Prof. Joseph Newhouse, among other books.I find the analysis of the USA healthcare system by Profs. Porter and Teisberg to generally be excellent, although I find it wanting in regard to their disparagement of a single-payer/single-insurer system and to their description and analysis of healthcare systems outside the USA. From my perspective private health plans play only a net negative role in the system. The authors' analysis of how the health insurance market works is quite good. However their recommendation that a system of private insurers should persist is refuted by their own analysis! A single payer/insurer system will not cure many problems of the USA system, as they clearly point out, but it does remove the inherently dysfunctional characteristics of private insurance, not least of which is its failure to meet the needs of the uninsured - a very large number - and its inherent propensity to exclude the very people who need coverage and care. The authors rightly point out that mandatory health insurance along with risk-pooling among insurers to spread the costs of those insured individuals who generate the highest costs is a \\"solution\\" to the current non-functioning system, but the same result, at lower cost and with much greater simplicity, can be achieved through a single payer/insurer.The other key aspect of healthcare - how it is delivered - is ultimately more important than the financing/insurance side. The authors provide excellent analysis and recommendations in this regard. They correctly address the aspects of the healthcare market that prevent its functioning as a \\"competitive\\" market, specifically the abysmal lack of patient information on prices for services, on outcomes of actions by providers, comparative statistics on provider performance and similar. They also provide an interesting report by the Cleveland Clinic on outcomes, i.e. results, of the Clinic's heart surgery activity. They appropriately use this as an example of the kind of reporting that is needed.The authors' analysis of healthcare systems outside the USA is skimpy and inaccurate in my opinion. The authors underplay the demonstrated efficacy of government-funded systems that outperform the USA system almost across the board in gross measures of outcomes (infant mortality and longevity) and vastly outperform the US system in regard to cost. They gloss over the fact that per capita costs in the USA are 2.5 times! the average per capita costs in other OECD countries. It is not as though the costs are say 10% above the average with comparable outcomes. They are 150% higher with worse outcomes. Instead of noting this and analyzing it thoroughly, the authors assert that waiting times and rationing of care are significant problems in those countries, assertions which are simply not borne out by the facts. Also the fact that (mostly) single-payer/insurer systems function well universally does not fit the authors' main thesis, so rather than revise the thesis based on this evidence they choose to ignore the evidence.As a consequence of these limitations I rate the book with 4 stars rather than 5. Too bad, because most of the book is excellent."},{"Title":"Redefining Health Care: Creating Value-Based Competition on Results","review":"The world's leading guru of competitive strategy, Michael Porter, Ph.D., has turned his sights on explaining the fundamental cause of high costs, poor quality, consumer dissatisfaction, uneven access, and skyrocketing premiums in American health care.In Redefining Health Care, Dr. Porter and business innovation specialist Elizabeth Teisberg, Ph.D. provide a thoughtful, groundbreaking framework to use genuine, value-driven competition to drive dramatic increases in quality and cost effectiveness.Unlike many wonks who foolishly believe that health care is not a market, Drs. Porter and Teisberg see competition \\"of a sort\\" at work - namely, zero-sum competition that adds little value, fosters inefficiency and poor quality, and often harms patients. Why? Because the current competitive environment is dysfunctional; serves to \\"shift costs, accumulate bargaining power, and restrict services;\\" and is ultimately misplaced - focusing on the business dynamics of providers and health plans, rather than on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of illness.Focusing on how to move American health care to positive-sum competition based on economic and clinical value for patients, Redefining Health Care provides a series of specific recommendations for the key players - notably, providers, health plans, employers, and Medicare / Medicaid policy makers.Drs.

Countless scholars have attempted to suggest remedies for the country's ailing health care system and just about everyone has failed. This book is another example of a failed attempt to show 'what needs to be done.' This work is by no means a blueprint for health care reform.Neither author comes from the health care setting. Both professors are in fact scholars of economics and business strategy. Neither author has no true bearing of what it is like for patients to be in the acute care setting. For example, the text contains a contradiction as to the importance of the patient's self-awareness and involvement in his or her care. On page 246, the authors mention that the idea that \\"patients can or should become medical experts and direct their own care is misguided and unrealistic.\\" However, on pages 298, 299, and 436, the authors point out that being an \\"informed\\" patient not only requires \\"greater involvement and responsibility\\", but also that \\"patient responsibility\\" ... \\"enables treatment to succeed.\\"This text is truly a disappointment as it leaves out so many of the flaws in this health care system that really need to be revamped.

The growth of antibiotic-resistant strains of microbes have gotten seriously out of control necessitating the need for facilities to have single-occupancy patient rooms. There is no mention of the impact of the nursing shortage. Nurses have to fight for their wages, face heavy workloads, deal with understaffed settings, and live with an ongoing professional lack of respect. There is no mention of how unprepared hospital settings are for overcrowding or disasters. The demand for competent nursing has been so great that certifications such as pediatric advanced life support or advanced cardiac life support have been made far more easier to pass so that even ill-prepared workers may obtain such certifications. Sadly, despite the fact that individuals may want careers in nursing, clinical instructors at community colleges or universities are sorely lacking. Free market theories fail to apply to the nursing shortage dilemma because of the complexities of this broken health care market.Another contradiction exists with regard to a lack of a health care system coordinator. On pages 51 and 296, the notion that there is \\"piecemeal,\\" \\"disjointed,\\" or \\"fractured \\" care is evident in that \\"there is often no physician to help navigate the system and ensure follow through.\\" Yet on page 251, there is mention that nurses \\"specializing in the particular disease works with the patient to be sure that the information available is understood\\" and that on pages 247 and 250, nurse health advisers provides \\"outreach education to patients before and after hospitalization, guidance on health risk management, and health coaching and referral assistance\\" - patients are \\"guided through the process by a skilled nurse who not only supports the initial choice of provider but also becomes the adviser over the course of treatment.\\" Nursing, therefore, helps acclimate the patient into the system to coordinate care. Ideally, this is what nurses do. Not all nurses do this of course, but just like physicians, some nurses are better than others.I would have expected more from professors of the University of Virginia and of Harvard University. The authors even misspelled and left the 'r' out of the word \\"stroke\\" on page 118.I strongly disagree with the authors' notion that consumers should not be medical experts. People in general need to know how to take care of themselves. They need to exercise, eat right, be in health relationships, and to know how to manage stress. They need to see their physicians and take whatever medications their bodies require. It is a ludicrous argument that consumers or patients know which physician or hospital has the best outcomes. Physicians and hospital workers make mistakes. And \\"human\\" mistakes in hospitals or any health care setting will never cease to exist.Lastly, on page 359, the argument in support of specialty hospitals is a poor one. For example, far too often, patients that go sour in outpatient surgical centers need an inpatient admission into an acute care hospital. Costs increase due to the need for a facility to facility ambulance transfer as mandated by federal laws. Further, the need for staff well-versed in resuscitative methods demands hours of costly training that hospitals are forced to comply with.This book needs to go the the fiction section of the book store. The book ignores very expensive aspects of health care such as AIDS/HIV, psychiatric care, and ambulance diversion in the midst of emergency room overcrowding. Sadly, only in \\"Fantasy Land\\" will their theoretical notions and recommendations take hold."},{"Title":"Redefining Health Care: Creating Value-Based Competition on Results","review":"Having observed the healthcare industry for the last couple of decades, I would like to point out a flaw in the author's recommendations:Poor people are ignorant people. Ignorant people have no idea what are the appropriate \\"outcomes\\" in medicine. Telling a four hundred pound diabetic that the magic of good health can't start with making Big Macs disappear down his gullet, is the kind of strategy that produces massive and profound good \\"outcomes\\". Finding more efficient ways for the poor to avoid the consequences of this behavior and other truly stupid life choices is a way to more bad outcomes.Middle class people are moving into the poor people category where wishful thinking and immaturity reign supreme in large numbers. (if someone's giving things away, it's best to get in the head of the line, not the end) Telling someone that they have caused a health problem makes them angry and resentful rather than relieved. Logically, one should rejoice that if they caused a problem and can then solve the problem, they can save a whole lot of time, money, and worry. Instead, they doctor shop and demand more and costlier diagnostics/treatment to avoid facing a life-style choice. So we should find more ways to let them? And make them happier about it?Getting people to be happier with the healthcare industry means giving them more of what they don't need and hiding more of what they do; the truth.We moved recently from a major metropolitan area with a high population of upper income earners to a small, rural place with a high number of minority and welfare recipients. The local hospital, which is in the county seat, rates a consistently higher level of satisfaction among patients than the rich area.Richer people have far less time, desire, and need to use the facility than the poor. Richer people pay more of the bill and have a better idea of the real value as related to cost although even their understanding is truly pitiful in relation to what they should know. And there's more incentive to stay away from it; they have jobs taking up some part of the day. Poor people careen from one self-inflicted crisis to the next and have plenty of time to swamp the hospital resources.But more importantly, the hospital administration is hell bent on patient satisfaction surveys. In order to maintain their high rating, they are literally giving away health services to the poor (with taxpayer dollars, naturally). The more they give away to people, the more people line up to get it. Knowing that health care is being handed out more efficiently and with a smile is a recipe to put a bullet in the heart of the system now in place. Make it a silver bullet and promote a movie showing the gory end is the best way to get this whole thing settled, once and for all. But I don't think that's what the author intended.Just one example, although I could swamp this site with more and still not run out; patient is a chronic substance abuser well known to the community. He gets on a bike at two in the morning because the bars are closed. With no protective or reflective gear on, wearing dark clothes, biking along a route with minimal lighting, and sporting a blood alcohol four times the legal limit, he swerves into the street where a hapless motorist hits him.A few hundred thousand dollars and a week later, there's a disposition hearing at the hospital on what to do about a bum that is never going to pay this huge bill. Decision? Keep him in this acute care facility for the next thirty days so that the hospital can charge the state from its indigent fund.How does the bum like free room service and drugs. A+++When all is said and done, is our customer, the bum, well served by a facility providing for his every possible need? Just ask yourself how do you think he can afford to be a bum? (BTW, Mr. Bum turned down the motorist's auto insurance based settlement of $10,000. Even though the driver wasn't at fault, the company knows the cost of the nuisance lawsuit. But even that won't cut it nowadays for our liability lottery.)Give the bum a better deal? No. Give him the true deal; patient, heal thyself. Now that's a good (and cheap) outcome!"},{"Title":"Redefining Health Care: Creating Value-Based Competition on Results","review":"I respectfully disagree with the conclusions and recommendations outlined by Dr. Porter. He discusses the need to increase \\"value\\" in our healthcare delivery system. As one of the ways to achieve this goal he advocates bundled pricing and paying for outcomes, as opposed to paying for service. I couldn't disagree more.The best approach to increasing value in healthcare is to follow free market principles. We need to empower patients to make better choices by educating them and making prices more transparent. Healthcare is no different from any other product, and I can think of no other product where prices are based on outcomes, not service.Imagine if a mutual fund company was paid based on outcomes. It may be a terrific company with a dedicated crew of professionals, but investors may still lose money because the stock market is out of their control. Similarly, physicians may be dedicated professionals who genuinely try to help their patients, yet a patient's condition may not improve despite the best effort of those physicians.The problem, as I see it, is that currently patients have very little incentive to be value driven consumers. Most healthcare costs (approximately 85% according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid) are covered by private insurance or government funds. This is a dramatic change from 1960 when almost half of healthcare spending was out of pocket. It is no coincidence that healthcare costs have increased dramatically over this period. It is basic economics.By allowing consumers to have \\"more skin in the game\\" by paying more of their own money out of pocket, they will have an incentive to seek value, and market forces will take over from there. Health care providers will have to demonstrate quality and expertise to attract those consumers, and that will ensure that the market will set fair prices. Studies have also repeatedly shown that the more actively involved patients are in making healthcare decisions, the better their outcomes. It is a true win-win for the patient.If you are skeptical that the free market system will work in healthcare look no further than the Lasik vision correction procedure. Laser eye surgery has one of the highest patient satisfaction ratings of any surgery, it has been performed millions of times in the past decade, it is new, it is high-tech, it has gotten better over time and... it has fallen in price. This is exactly what you would expect if free market principles are allowed to work. Lasik is not covered by insurance, Medicaid or Medicare. Patients pay out of pocket. They have an incentive to seek value - the best combination of cost and quality. We need to expand this idea to all areas of medicine.The question may arise, \\"How can consumers afford to pay out of pocket since healthcare is so expensive?\\" The simple answer is that they are already paying for healthcare collectively, and doing so in a very inefficient manner through third parties.The true role of insurance is to serve as a hedge against catastrophe, not to pay for routine medical expenditures.If we go down the road advocated by Washington and Dr. Porter, I am confident that the end result will be much higher costs, budgetary crises, and ultimately government control of access and quality."},{"Title":"Redefining Health Care: Creating Value-Based Competition on Results","review":"Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg have presented a sentinel work in the field of healthcare management. American healthcare is capable of providing the very best skill, professional expertise, and technology the world has ever seen. What is failing in our healthcare system is the management and business organization required deliver value to the recipients of this expertise-- patients.In every other dynamic and robust business sector, delivery of value is a key concept. The brilliance of the work of Porter and Teisberg is that they have taken the same value concepts so critical to other businesses and translated them to the business of medicine. And make no mistake, medicine is a business, one that needs intensive redefinition. Many both in and out of healthcare rebel at the thought of medicine as business. In fact, medical schools have long taught students (either explicitly or implicitly) that it is not right to think of medicine in business terms. The strength of Porter and Teisberg's work is that it rationally and powerfully makes the case that only by redefining healthcare in business terms can the true function of healthcare providers--delivering value to all patients--be realized.Some have suggested that the problems in the current system prevent substantial reform. This is circular reasoning at its best. Redefining Healthcare presents a imminently practical strategy for departing from the failed system we currently exist in. Rather than reciting what can't be done, one only has to look around to see that the concepts of redefining healthcare on value-based competition are not only possible, but are being actualized as this is written. As a physician with twenty years of practice, I can without question state that this is the most optimistic, exciting work I have seen in my career. This book may well mark the true starting point for national healthcare reform."},{"Title":"Redefining Health Care: Creating Value-Based Competition on Results","review":"Received one of the first copies early in 2006.

There are a multitude of players and entities, and each one doesn't necessarily have goals and motivations that serve the greater good. Redefining Health Care: Creating Value-Based Competition on Results by Michael E. Porter and Elizabeth Olmsted Teisberg offer their take on how to overhaul the process and bring sanity back to healthcare.Contents: Introduction; Scoping the Problem; Identifying the Root Causes; How Reform Went Wrong; Principles of Value-Based Competition; Strategic Implications for Health Care Providers; Strategic Implications for Health Plans; Implications for Suppliers, Consumers, and Employers; Health Care Policy and Value-Based Competition - Implications for Government; Conclusion; Appendix A - Making Results Public - The Cleveland Clinic; Appendix B - The Care Delivery Value Chain; Notes; Bibliography; Index; About the AuthorsThe basic premise here is that the health care delivery system needs to shift to a value-based competition model. The effectiveness of providers over the entire cycle of care for an incident needs to be transparent, so that the best treatments and protocols can be determined. This would also allow those who get the best results to get more business, and those who can't make the grade will eventually be weeded out. The entire care cycle for an incident needs to be integrated, so that you're not getting treatment (and bills) from various providers over the life of your condition. For instance, a knee replacement currently involves separate groups (and billings) from hospitals, doctors, auxillary care, and various other entities. Since there's no real integration, it's far too easy to make mistakes or optimize a single process that suboptimizes the whole. The lack of transparency also means there is little hope to know pricing and make decisions based on the value received for the dollars paid. All the reforms over the years have led us to this point we're currently at, and the norm is making sure the care cycle is optimized for provider reimbursement, not for the best interests of the patient.I really liked the fact that the authors didn't rush down the conventional paths to reform, like single-payer systems. They make very good cases that, while solving a few problems, a single payor like the government would spawn a whole new set of complexities and inefficiencies. The proposed solution to shift the focus to delivering value over the care cycle, making results information transparent and available, and setting \\"single cost\\" pricing for care makes sense, but I can see how many of the current players would object. The mystique of the doctor knowing everything would be eliminated, and ineffectiveness could not be covered up. Bits and pieces of their proposed plan are starting to emerge in the market (like publishing hospital results for a set of particular conditions), but it's still largely voluntary and not necessarily standard across the board. To make this work well, you would need to plan on an implementation of a significant portion of the ideas at the same time, so that you don't end up spending time tweaking a partial implementation and straying from the overall destination.This book may not be the perfect answer to fixing the system, but it presents a compelling vision of how it could be changed to deliver on the demands made these days. It's not exactly an easy read, as there is a lot of detail that becomes a bit numbing at times. But if you're part of the overall health care system in America, you really do need to check out the ideas and determine if you can play a part in the solution."},{"Title":"Redefining Health Care: Creating Value-Based Competition on Results","review":"I'm a big fan of Porter, but I was somewhat disappointed by this book. Let me be frank. The first problem I have with the book is that the authors try to capture as large of an audience as possible, being careful not to place blame on certain providers within the health care system. That approach might get better reviews and sell more copies, but it is not delivering real value. One cannot escape mention of the realities of corruption and fraud by every player in health care and expect to address the problems.The second problem I have is that Porter fails to recognize that health care is distinct from any other industry in America because it is highly politically influenced. Much of the health care system is public (government funded). This is a main reason why competition in this industry is highly ineffective. How can you have a pure competitive environment when poor performing providers continue to receive government-funded contracts? How can you have full competition when Washington merely fines providers for fraud with no jail time? How can you have competition that creates value when Washington places the burden of increasing costs upon taxpayers, letting the industry charge what it needs to deliver earnings that Wall Street expects?Overall, by failing to address the harsh realities of politics and big money within America's health care industry, Porter's book is too idealistic and therefore falls short of offering a real solution. Regardless, it is a quality book and at least does what no other has in trying to approach the problems from a reasonable standpoint. I expected more from him, but clearly this book is a view from academia and is far detached from many realities of big industry in America. There are many good points in the book, but without addressing the main problems of a system whereby lobbyist groups who control health care policy, very little will change."},{"Title":"Redefining Health Care: Creating Value-Based Competition on Results","review":"Book ReviewRedefining Health Care by Michael PorterI am writing this review to help share some excellent ideas on the availability and quality of medical treatment in the United States and on the U.S. economy which is being dragged down by ever-increasing medical costs. The economic impact is not just on corporate profits and stock prices but also on U.S. employment because everything that raises costs makes it harder for U.S. manufacturers to compete with foreign suppliers and makes it harder for U.S. manufacturers to sell in foreign markets.Unfortunately, the book is long, turgid, and full of details, which help to substantiate his conclusions and also provide guidance on implementing improved policies. I am afraid the book does not appeal to executives, politicians, or doctors. It also proposes radical changes in all aspects of the medical system and its financing and operation. Dr. Porter proposes major changes on the part of all parties involved in delivering and paying for health care.The book begins with a review of health indexes and health care throughout the world and shows, while the U.S. has the greatest expenditures by any set of measurements, it does not have the best results.Then, Dr. Porter introduces his most important concept: that any medical treatment should be measured by its results; how much lost time and discomfort did the patient have, is he or she completely cured, or how much disability measured over the entire span of the illness or even the life of the patient. We tend to think of an operation as being successful if the patient left the hospital in good condition. But how much additional recovery time, disability, or reoccurrence was there? If the patient doesn't come back to see him, a doctor doesn't know whether he was cured by the treatment or if the patient was so dissatisfied he went to another doctor or simply gave up on a series of treatments. The goal is to develop a scoring system for each group of illnesses that can be compared with the cost of each individual's treatment and their results to determine what is the best set of procedures and the best doctor or group of doctors to do the work can be used to guide providers and treatments. Porter has some reason to believe that the best treatments are generally less costly even though the individual item costs may be more, the greater effectiveness and the less chance of complications reduces overall cost. Included in the overall cost should be lost wages, which is a reasonable proxy for the patient's time.The goal is to develop a health plan that pays for results not for treatments. In many cases, that would be a single payment to the provider for a whole series of treatments from diagnosis on through operations, post-operative care, and follow ups which could extend over a long period of time. This is a radical change from the present system which pays for treatments and tends to produce more treatments and does not have any effective means for either the insurers, or the employers, or the patients even to compare one treatment option with another. This is an extreme, radical change and would take a long time to implement, but there are pieces of the program in operation. A number of these are explained at length. Health insurance companies could hire these firms for their specialized expertise and would not have to do the work on their own. An example of what is done is how the firm studies the history of heart transplant patients and will give an insurance company a single payment for the entire course of treatment providing it is done in the manner and by people they specify. They would particularly focus on caregivers who have an outstanding record of success. It appears that for most illnesses, there are organizations that are substantially better than others and this program could be extended broadly.Another area of development would be to have counselors which would be part of the function of the insurer to advise a company's employees with a list of particularly well qualified doctors and suggest treatment elements.Government would seem to be poorly adapted to facilitating these changes because they are radically different from Medicare. Medicare seems to promote cheap, but not necessarily effective treatments and set arbitrary pay scales which do not allow the better providers to charge more for their services and thus encourage more providers to be in the high performance category. Companies that pay for the insurance are the ones that have to put pressure on the insurers to implement the above changes. This could not be done over a short period of time but would eliminate a lot of the wasted time that is now involved in the payments for each little step of the process and for each treatment step.Chapter 8 is a detailed discussion of how to implement the aforementioned concepts using modifications of Medicare and other laws. This is too complex to summarize here but it appears doable if Congress and the Executive are sufficiently motivated. It is likely that few people would understand what is happening, but the benefits to cost ratio is sufficiently great that the changes would probably be supported and accepted. On the other hand, the situation is so complex, it is questionable whether lawmakers and administrators would be willing to undertake the many complex tasks required. On the other hand, the downside risk appears quite small.Porter approaches the whole subject from the points of view of business strategy and the problems of decisions with very imperfect information. While the government frequently acts with very imperfect information, its strategy for doing so is not well developed and poorly applied.Redefining Health Care: Creating Value-Based Competition on Results"},{"Title":"Redefining Health Care: Creating Value-Based Competition on Results","review":"Overall the book is a very good essay on how our healthcare system needs to evolve.

These are some of the questions that authors Michael Porter of Harvard Business School and Elizabeth Teisberg of University of Virginia School of Business attempt to answer. The book paints an accurate portrait of the shortcomings of the US health care system, which fails to identify and scale up providers who provide the highest quality health care at the lowest cost.Health care providers, health plans, payers, and consumers are responsible for our low performing, high cost health care system. Real reform of the system has implications for all stakeholders and, optimistically, this reform is already underway. Improvements in health care quality reporting and access to these data by consumers and payers is increasing, providers are consolidating from solo private practices to medical groups wherein health plans are supporting transformations to patient center medical homes that actively manage patient health status through preventive care and case management. Employers are expecting that health plans augment their provider contracting discounts and claims processing with health and wellness programs, including disease management. Health care technology, including electronic medical records and telemedicine, are improving the portability of health information and enabling remote hospitals to instantly access medical specialists at nationally and internationally recognized hospital centers.The authors do an excellent job of highlighting the levers in the domains of each stakeholder that must be switched on for transformation to a value based market place to happen. I argue that it will happen out of economic and technological developments, as well as the influence of globalization, rather than via any significant policy changes, with the exception of a government mandate for individual health insurance coverage that has now been passed at the federal level.Even though I share the opinion of several other reviewers that the book is unnecessarily lengthly and redundant, I do recommend it for its broad viewpoints and substantial supporting case studies."},{"Title":"Redefining Health Care: Creating Value-Based Competition on Results","review":"Although somewhat idealistic, this book provides a good overview of an effective way of improving the value of healthcare and providing a way out of the dire situation that healthcare is currently in.

Take this for example on page 48- 'Most patients are actively discouraged from seeking and securing the best value care.'Reality is most patients do not seek best value. This coming from a third pary insurer who put up wbesite to compare prices. Insured members just don't use it. Most patients wouldn't be able to distuingish valuable care from punctuality of doctor or courtesy of office staff.Dr.Porter assumed that consumers and supplier behavior is similar as in other fields and has really erred over there.

You won't either.I have read The Seer, God Encounters and The Lost Art of Intercession all of these are great books. This book is the best. The Lost Art of Practicing His Presence."},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Practicing His Presence","review":"It looks like James Goll came out with another good book. It came out just in time for me, because I've been trying to enhance my prayer time, but didn't really know how. I heard of contemplative prayer from his other book called \\"The Seer\\", but he only touched on it lightly. So I was left wanting to know more. In this book, he goes into detail.He even has the \\"The Practice of the Presence of God\\" by Brother Lawrence in this book, which was right on time for me, again. It was on time, because I had read about Brother Lawrence's letters in e-Sword. I was reading it, but I prefer to read something like that in a book, instead of on the computer.This book really helped me understand what meditating on His Word meant. It also helped expose what's wrong with New Age beliefs and meditation. After reading this book, I'm now striving to create a habit of keeping my focus on the presence of God as often as I can. So, if you're someone that wants to acknowledge God in all your ways, this would be a good book to help you out."},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Practicing His Presence","review":"Let's start on the positive side. Jim Goll's teaching on contemplative prayer shows the best from Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant traditions. I have practiced quiet forms of prayer for about 20 years. I wish I had someone like Jim Goll 20 years ago to help me through the readings and practices. If you have never read much about contemplative prayer but would like to then this book would be an excellent place to start.On the negative side, and why I can't give more than 3 stars, is that I found at least two-thirds of this book to be from his earlier book \\"Wasted On Jesus.\\" The remaining one-third talks about some practical tips on how to take what you receive in contemplative prayer out into your life outside of your \\"prayer room.\\" There is also a modern paraphrase of the work of Brother Lawrence called \\"The Practice of the Presence of God.\\"But when I saw the title \\"The Lost Art of Practicing His Presence\\" I thought it would be more about what Brother Lawrence taught about prayer and it really isn't. Jim Goll seems to put the teachings of Madame Jeanne Guyon, Francois Fenelon, and Brother Lawrence all in one bag. Guyon and Fenelon talk about going into a quiet room, removing yourself from external distractions, and learning how to quiet yourself in God's presence. This is all good teaching and necessary in the beginning. But Brother Lawrence seems to teach how to be aware of God's presence with you all during the day no matter what activity your involved in. He does talk about the difficulties in doing this on a regular basis and what to do about it. Now it's only fair to say that Brother Lawrence did not write the book that bears his name. It was released by his abbot (religious superior) in the monastery after his death. But it seems to me that you have two different approaches to the same issue which is experiencing the presence of God in daily life.So, if you have never read much on contemplative prayer Jim Goll is an excellent teacher. But if you want to learn about Brother Lawrence then read his book and let the man speak for himself."},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Practicing His Presence","review":"This isn't the kind of book that I can read quickly. It has a lot of new information (to me anyway) and it needs to be digested slowly.There are such important truths in this book about intimacy with Christ. You don't want to miss this one!"},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Practicing His Presence","review":"This is a wonderful book in many aspects especially for the fundamental Christian who is fearful that practicing meditation will open him to some \\"non-Christian practice\\". The book clearly defines what is Christian meditation and what is not. Christianity did began in the East and meditation is Biblical.I like what Jim Goll says, that in exploring Christian mystical literature he often felt like an archaeologist who had just unearthed a long-vanished and pricelss artifact. He said that Christian meditative prayer is all but buried in the dust of history, virtually lost among believers today.I believe the intent of this book is to take the unknown and \\"spookiness\\" out of meditation for the Christian so that the empowerment and enlightenment that results from this spiritual discipline might be realized.Goll is a prolific writer who writes in a clear and concise way. This book is well researched quoting many contemporary authors and leaders as well as honored Christian mystics from history.I also highly recommend the book, \\"The Rest of the Gospel\\", by Dan Stone. For me, this book opened my understanding to the \\"unseen realm\\" and by accessing the unseen realm we can live out of a reality in God that's greater than the physical realm in which we live. It gave me the foundation I needed to embrace meditation and contemplative prayer. It's a book that I continually pick up and read from and has probably done more to transform my religious self-limiting thinking. I will never again feel \\"separated\\" from the God who lives within."},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Practicing His Presence","review":"I have thrououghly enjoyed reading this book (bought it on the Kindle). I appreciate Mr. Goll's treatment of contemplative prayer, quiet times and practicing the presence of God.I kept a copy of Brother Lawrence's \\"Practicing the Presence of God\\" next to me while I read this book. Reading through Brother Lawrence's 15 letters from his book while reading Mr. Goll's book provide a great insight into daily contemplative prayer and walking your whole day through with God always in your thoughts.I recommend this as a good place to start with a modern \\"mystic\\". Then I would suggest reading some of Richard Foster's work as well as Thomas Merton.Enjoy reading!"},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Practicing His Presence","review":"This is one of those books that you read at a very slow pace so that you can absorb everything written.

I highly recommend it to anyone who is trying to develop the art of being in His Presence."},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Practicing His Presence","review":"I am in the midst of a 4 month focus on being in God's presence. This book showed me how and I recommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Practicing His Presence","review":"I cannot say enough about this book. This book will take you to new depths in your walk with the Lord. If you don't know what practicing the presence means then you need to get this book."},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Practicing His Presence","review":"This is the first book I have read by Mr. Goll and it will be my last.I read the reader reviews before buying it and was not deterred by the numerous ones saying it was a rehash of a previous book. Since I had not read that previous book, I bought this one. I was shocked to read a published book that contained so much copied work by other writers. Granted, he does footnote extensively, but there can't be more than 10 percent original thoughts in this entire book. He copies pages from Foster, Guyon, Fenlon, and others. It was like reading a college term paper.I suspect this is another case of an author being contractually bound to produce a book so he simply copied one of his old ones and copied the rest from other writers. This seems to be getting more and more common with the authors who churn out book after book in the same general subject area.I am also concerned about all the great reviews this book received. I'm wondering if they are written by actual readers or if authors and publishers are writing them to bolster sales. I've noticed this quite a bit recently with other books: Great ratings and big disappointments after purchase.Shame on the author and the publisher for producing this."},{"Title":"The mystery of Mound Key","review":"I am Willie Royal jr and want to add a little about this book.I was very fortunate to have grown up with my father learning to scuba dive at the age of 9 years old. The most important thing he taught me was to never panic.I was diving with him in the early days exploring warm mineral springs and looking for the giant sharks teeth off Venice beach.I was resting in a raft while my father was looking for sharks teeth when he surfaced with a large nurse shark in his arms. I have come across many sharks in my diving and have never had a fear of them. I think any animal will smell fear.We traveled so many places looking for fossils and bones of long extinct animals.We once dug up a 12 foot mastadon tusk in little salt creek texas.I know first hand many of the stories in this book.He was a great man.Willie Royal"},{"Title":"The mystery of Mound Key","review":"The Man Who Rode Sharks was originally published in 1978 and is now republished by the Authors Guild Backinprint Editions through iUniverse.com, Inc. This book by Colonel William R. Royal (written with Robert F. Burgess) is about Royal's adventures and subsequent new discoveries in shark behavior and underwater archaeology. Actually, two stories in one, the first half of the book details Royal's work with sharks from the 1930s through the 1960s. He became fascinated with sharks from his first encounter with them in 1931 when he leaped into the water to catch a shark to feed his family during the Depression Years. During his travels in the military service he took up scuba diving and had more exciting encounters with them in the Pacific and Mediterranean Sea. After the war Royal was hired to capture sharks for a scientific laboratory. He became known as &quot;the man who rode sharks&quot; because that is what he did to capture them undamaged and alive. Usually he grabbed a nurse shark by the tail and let it drag him around until it tired (always making sure he stayed away from the head, of course). This enabled his catch to be loaded aboard a boat alive, a requirement requested by scientists doing research on squalene, a shark liver extract being investigated then as a possible cure for human cancer. The second half of the book is about Royal's most important contribution to science. When he moved to Florida in 1958, he became interested in Warm Mineral Springs and Little Salt Springs in the central part of the state. Up to this point no one had ventured very deep into these springs. Shortly after scuba gear became available in this country, Royal donned this equipment and started exploring these over 200-feet-deep springs. What he found there proved too unbelievable for the scientists of the day. Deep in Warm Mineral Spring beside prehistoric animal bones buried in mud on a forty-foot deep ledge, Royal found a human skull that carbon-dated to over 10,000 years old! And inside it was identifiable human brain material! Stalactites from the ceiling in the underwater spring indicated that this was once a dry cave, believed to date back to the last Ice Age. Since Early man was not thought to have been in Florida then, scientists of the day questioned the authenticity of these finds, especially since they had been made by an &quot;amateur.&quot; Royal spent much of his life trying to persuade qualified underwater archaeologists to come to the spring and do a proper archaeological investigation of the sites. Eventually they did and toward the end of his life, the scientific community properly recognized the pioneering part Bill Royal played in these discoveries. Written in a narrative style by Robert Burgess, who dived these sites with Royal to photograph and record details of his achievements, he details Royal's incredible narrow escapes from sharks, cave-ins and dangerous depths. His style enables readers to relive the excitement of these adventures of a truly unique underwater pioneer. Anyone who thrives on fast-paced true adventure action will find this book a real hair-raiser!"},{"Title":"The mystery of Mound Key","review":"This book is about many of the life stories of my step-father, Bill Royal, who was an amazing man, a self-taught underwater archeologist, and a walking library of information about diving and sharks. The book is of interest to scientists interested in underwater exploration, and to young people looking for an amazing true-life adventure. Bill (with the help of Mr. Burgess) tells about his early life and difficulties, his endless persuit of knowledge, and his love of diving, whether with sharks and to explore underwater archeological sites. Dr. Clark was a good friend, teacher and a diving partner to Bill. I am so gladd this book has been re-published as it will be of interest to a great many."},{"Title":"The mystery of Mound Key","review":"This is a book about one man who in the beginning years of scuba and a virgin ocean lived his life with a passion for knowledge of marine life.

For such an expensive work, I expected my family to be there!"},{"Title":"The American Gun Mystery","review":"The American Gun Mystery (1933) is among the earliest Ellery Queen stories. The murder of Buck Horne, an immensely popular star of early western silent films, occurs in full view of 20,000 rodeo fans in the Colosseum, New York's newest and greatest sports arena. Buck is leading forty cowboys around the arena in full gallop with guns held high firing blanks into the air when he falls from his horse and is trampled. His death is no accident; a small caliber bullet had entered his heart. As guests of the stadium's owner, Ellery and his father Inspector Queen had box office seats almost directly above where Buck Horne died.The setting seemed rather fanciful to me, a huge rodeo in New York in 1932, and yet I have since learned (by way of the Internet) that outdoor rodeos had been held for many years in Madison Square Garden. In 1926 the rodeo was moved indoors into the old Madison Square Garden and was called the World Series Rodeo. And, in the particular year 1932 Woodward Maurice \\"Tex Ritter\\" was the featured singer at the Madison Square Garden rodeo. The rodeo setting was indeed more authentic than I had imagined.Regardless, another aspect of The American Gun Mystery does require some suspension of belief. Inspector Queen orders a careful search of all 20,000 attendees for the missing murder weapon. Even Ellery himself comments that the search procedures were getting out of hand; earlier EQ stories had involved searching the patrons in a theatre, shoppers in a department store, and personnel, patients, and visitors in a hospital, but searching 20,000 rodeo fans is simply too much. Despite this Herculean effort, the murder weapon is not found.Two newer 1930s technologies - ballistics analysis and editing of newsreel films - play key roles and warrant separate chapters. The audience search (not to mention that of the cowboys themselves) had recovered more than a hundred weapons, and we learn how the science of ballistics matches a bullet to a particular gun. Likewise, recording live sporting events on celluloid film was still relatively new and the photographic capture of Buck Horne's death was quite a sensation. However, both promising technologies seem to provide only negative results: all the guns are eliminated and the film only details what is already known.Ellery Queen's summation (after his trademark Challenge to the Reader) is logically sound as always, and yet I found a key point, one dependent on a rather unlikely mistake made not by one individual, but by two, to be highly improbable. I do admit to missing entirely the key evidence that pointed Ellery in the right direction, although I did catch a critical secondary clue (and others as well). Nonetheless, once again I was no match for dazzling logic of Ellery Queen.My copy of The American Gun Mystery is a 1975 paperback reprint by Ballantine Books. This story is not easy to find, but fanciful or not, The American Gun Mystery compares favorably to other early Ellery Queen mysteries and is worth the effort it takes to locate a copy. I have not seen a copy, but apparently this story was published in a Mercury paperback edition in 1951 titled Death at the Rodeo."},{"Title":"Snatched from oblivion: A Cambridge memoir","review":"I picked this book on a whim while on vacation at the beach--I'd been having a tough time getting through entire books once the school year had ended (I teach college)--this book was a delightful antidote to all that-- The author's sense of humor and attention to telling detail in her evocation of family life in the early part of this century was interesting, entertaining and informative--The characters (from the famous scientist Pavlov to her father's maiden sisters who lived with the family and carved out careers when women did not do that)were people one would like to have met-I loved getting a picture of how Cambridge, Boston and Harvard were then as well as how a large, lively, eccentric and intellectual bunch of people lived their lives-- The drawings were fun, too!--A good old fashioned memoir which shines a positive light on its subject(s)!"},{"Title":"Lana: The Lady, the Legend, the Truth","review":"Although this book is jam-packed with lots of behind the scenes movie star action and photographs of this physically beautiful woman, this story is definitely a one-sided view of Lana's excuse for her often lurid life. It seems everyone in Hollywood was \\"out to get\\" Lana, and she desperately needed to marry (over and over) to rise above it all. She speaks glowingly of every husband, until they, too, turn out to be less than wonderful. It's a bit of a hoot that she becomes disenchanted with these fellows who she spent all of a week dating before saying \\"I do.\\" Regarding her career, she often talks about how professional and hardworking she was on the set, but I think about 90% of her hard work went into perfecting her nearly flawless appearance. It is no wonder that her make-up man played such a big role in her life. She explains that she was \\"horrified\\" at herself on the screen in her debut performance as a \\"sweater girl\\", as if she was unaware of her attributes as she flounced across the screen. Although Hollywood back in the 40's and 50's did contain alot of despicable characters, Lana did few selfless acts herself. She professes to loving her only child, but continuously leaves her in the care of her long-suffering mother while she jetsets around the globe with new lovers or new husbands. The reader can only assume that she's (1) incredibly naive or (2) incredibly stupid. She sums it all up to \\"love\\" or a \\"what's a girl to do?\\" attitude. I don't doubt that given her physical beauty such a lifestyle would be very easy to fall prey to in Hollywood. It's a shame she felt it necessary to drag a child through it with her with disastrous adults. When her daughter begins to act out, (you know, like stabbing Lana's mobster boyfriend) Lana wonders if maybe it's due to her many marriages, houses and lifestyle. Duh! But in the end, she takes credit when her stunning daughter turns out to be a \\"brillant businesswoman\\". And, just when you think all hope for redemption is lost, she devotes her last chapter to her devotion to God. Afterall, what's a girl to do?"},{"Title":"Lana: The Lady, the Legend, the Truth","review":"For quite some time, I didn't know what I thought about this book. It baffled me because it alternates between excruciating details about clothes, shoes, and hairstyles, and Lana's heartbreaking stories of love and betrayal. Lana Turner was married seven times. The reasons she gives for marrying each of her husbands are about as trivial as the reasons she gives for divorcing them. For instance, she was dating someone, and then Joan Crawford called her up and said he was HER man. So what does Lana do? She bumps into bandleader Artie Shaw at a party later in the evening, and MARRIES the guy-- THAT night. THEN, even though she had never even met him before their wedding day, she writes with genuine amazement that SHE didn't know he had been married twice before, or that he was abusive. She leaves him, finds out she is pregnant, and aborts the baby. Exit marriage one. Enter husband #2, Stephen Crane. She marries him on an impulse, finds out that he's still legally married to his first wife, and leaves him, angry and pregnant. She reluctantly goes back,(after alot of \\"fatherly persuasion\\" from her mentor, Louis B. Mayer, President of MGM Studios) has the baby,a daughter named Cheryl Christina Crane, who infamously stabbed her mother's abusive gang- tied lover to death in a trial that rocked 1950's Hollywood to its core. However, long before this incident, Lana had already discarded Cheryl's father, Stephen;so it's so long husband number two. HELLO husband #3: Millionare Bob Topping became her third husband, and she writes that she accepted his proposal because- get this- although she did not love him, and he was still married to someone else, \\"there's something awfully compelling about a big, diamond ring\\". To my utter bafflement, she actually leaves this husband,too. And on and on, right down to the last matrimonial drop- a \\"drip\\" which consisted of a charlatan Hollywood hypontist doctor,Dr. Dante, Lana's seventh and last groom. FYI: in a strange turn of events, this last husband dumped HER, via a memo he'd taped to her bathroom mirror. It said something to the effect that he just couldn't do \\"this\\" anymore, and, therefore, she would not be seeing him (or most of her money) again. He signed the note, \\"Love, Muggs\\". Upon reading it, Miss Turner fell to the floor in a dead faint; not because he left her high and dry, but because she \\"had no idea\\" his nick-name was \\"Muggs.\\" The only thing she writes about with poignancy is her various failed attempts at motherhood and her countless miscarriages. She writes about how badly she wanted each pregnancy, and she becomes pregnant by movie idol Tyrone Power (who-- gasp!- was still legally married to HIS first wife). I actually saw a glimmer of maturity and strength of character, because she told Tyrone, \\"D--- it!! NObody is going to take THIS baby away from me!\\" Tyrone Power left the decision entirely in Lana's perfectly-manicured hands,vowed to support any decision she made- then took the first thing smoking out of the country. Lana began to plot and scheme.... she even tried to formulate some plan whereupon she would fly away to some far away, private island, then come back after having the baby, giving the columnists that age old story of \\"adopting\\" the baby on the spur of the moment, due to said baby's cuteness, and her generous spirit. In the cooler light of reason (and in the harsh light of gradually realzing that Tyrone does not consider her either \\"wife\\" or \\"mother\\" material, she comes to accept the absurdity of her proposed plan- \\"How on earth\\", she scoffs on these pages, \\"could Lana Turner return from the islands with a baby that was the spittting image of Tyrone Power and claim she'd \\"found\\" it?\\" So, sadly (in her words) she came to the same conclusion she did when faced with the prospect of being Artie Shaw's \\"Baby-Mama\\". And Lana terminated the pregnancy, telling herself that she and \\"Ty\\" could always get married and have scads of children. It seems almost pointless to write that this dream never materialized, as upon returning to the states and visiting with Lana, Mr. Power informed her that not only was he done with HER, he planned on getting married to Lana's stand in; Linda Christian, who subsequently bore him three bouncing, healthy children. Good Grief. Ironically, I think Lana Turner wrote this book to prove that she wasn't as shallow as people thought she was. It was apparently lost on her that this book underlined that theory indefinitely."},{"Title":"Lana: The Lady, the Legend, the Truth","review":"That, in my opinion, is a good summary of Lana Turner's rise to fame. Lana Turner was one of the most beautiful and talented actresses of her time, with unforgettable performances in classics like \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\", \\"Homecoming\\", \\"Johnny Eager\\", and \\"The Bad and the Beautiful\\". This autobiography is very gripping and provides a very entertaining look at Hollywood as experienced by Lana during her long and impressive career. There are three sections of great photos which show how timeless her beauty was. I agree with the previous reviewers' comments about Lana's descriptions of her failed marriages and not-so-perfect relationship with her daughter, but after all, a Hollywood legend like Lana had to defend and preserve her character. She's very candid about many events and scandals, and her writing style makes the book impossible to put down. For a \\"no-spin\\" account of Lana Turner I recommend searching for a biography, but unfortunately there are not many. This book is a definite must for all Lana Turner fans!"},{"Title":"Lana: The Lady, the Legend, the Truth","review":"Perhaps that would have been a better title, as Lana Turner, otherwise known as \\"The Sweater Girl\\" (a moniker she detested), certainly glosses over the truth of her life, as well as scandals and her upbringing of her daughter, Cheryl Crane. It was for the sake of the latter that Turner was very discreet and careful in the way she discusses Cheryl and the Stompanato case. But at the same time, Lana presents herself as an emotionally immature, if likeably gullible woman who lived in the moment with little thought of the consequences. She fails to take responsibility for her actions, never mentioning when she talks about Cheryl's \\"deep-rooted emotional difficulties\\" that she herself was cause of the majority of the damaging problems that her only child suffered. Also, her claims that she and Frank Sinatra were never more than friends was disputed in later years by her close friend, Evie Wynn Johnson, who knew full well that Lana and Old Blue Eyes were romantically involved for some time. And she doesn't give her mother Mildred the credit that she deserved, as Millie without a doubt raised Cheryl (along with the hired help that came and went), while her movie queen daughter was off partying, making films, travelling and carousing.However, I cannot bring myself to dislike Lana, for she seems to have had the best of intentions, searched for love several times without satisfactory results, and had a true survivor instinct the enabled her to endure in both her career and private life. As a little girl, from when her con man father was found murdered, to all the men that would figure in her life, she was only looking for true love, albeit in mostly the wrong places. The one man she loved above all others she never got to the altar with. But she was able to re-establish a relationship with her daughter in adulthood, and achieved solace in her faith and the simple joys and pleasures of life. The photos in the book are also a plus. It is a enjoyable, if fluffy read, but if you want something a little closer to the truth, read Cheryl Crane's book \\"Detour: A Hollywood Story\\"."},{"Title":"Lana: The Lady, the Legend, the Truth","review":"I think Lana Turner wrote a wonderful autobiography.Her life was very complicated, interesting and glamorous.She covers everything in this book.She starts with her childhood, and talks about how she really was discovered.

If you buy a book about someone that is written by someone, they are not going to be putting themselves in a horrible picture. Could Ms. Turner have taken more blame? Of course. Will you realize that when reading this book? Of course. Does that make the book horrible? Nope! This book is going to teach you more about the woman than any other person or book possibly can. You delve into her mind and the reasoning behind each decision. For those saying that Ms. Turner could not carry another child to term, that is rubbish. She goes into her medical history with the reader and even had an abortion before having Cheryl. A woman came from nothing to become one of the biggest stars on the planet. You have to have a certain amount of respect for her because of that. To hold onto the fleeting admiration that is fame, Ms. Turner made some tough decisions. Having children out of wedlock was not one of them. Sadly, being active in her daughter's life as a child was also another thing that was tossed to the side, something Ms. Turner admits. Just take everything with a grain of salt and realize that people are not going to give you unbiased accounts of their own life and you should enjoy this smashing biography."},{"Title":"Lana: The Lady, the Legend, the Truth","review":"I found the book by Miss Lana turner to be so insightful, so many amazing details from the woman that was known as THE Sweater girl, the girl discovered at Schwabs sipping a soda, the girl groomed at M.G.M the BEST studio as was said \\"With more Stars than in the Heavens\\", she at 16 after her first check told her mother, \\"Momma you never have to work again\\" and that was true.She Very honestly tells what it was like working so much, so much responsibility, having a gorgeous daughter, and what it was like in a different era, dating, so public, living out lives the way the studios made the movies for mass consumption, I admire her and her life, I feel very similar to Miss Turner, I feel if it were I, back then, I don't know I would do so well.God Bless Lana Turner & her daughter Cheryl Crane."},{"Title":"Lana: The Lady, the Legend, the Truth","review":"I enjoyed this book very much.

There are six individual design motifs, from a mummy case to an ankh. There's also a nice stencils of the Egyptian god Anubis. These designs are perfect for school or home use. I would recommend this stencil booklet to anyone who loves all thing Egyptian. The price here is beautiful...I paid more than what it is here. Still it's well worth it."},{"Title":"Fun with Egyptian Stencils (Dover Stencils)","review":"I used these stencils in my Egyptian Halloween theme. Although there are only 3 stencils on the cover, there were more on the inside. They added a perfect touch when I used them on the candy pot I had on my display table. It was very challenging to find anything Egyptian themed that wasn't cartoony. I appreciated the quick shipment as well."},{"Title":"Fun with Egyptian Stencils (Dover Stencils)","review":"Bought every one of these little books that were available. They are small, about 1/4 the size of a standard sheet of paper. The inside is medium weight card stock and each page has one stencil. There are maybe 8 to 10 pages of stencils based on the book's theme in each book. Wouldn't use for a painting project, but I'm planning to turn them into fabric applique designs, and they will be perfect for that use."},{"Title":"Fun with Egyptian Stencils (Dover Stencils)","review":"these stencils are small (images are 2-3\\" square), but we have used them repeatedly for hours of \\"art fun\\".

A more literal and scholarly book than Barbara Stoler Miller's. He includes additional information from other classic Hindu writtings and transliteration of the sanskrit text. A very enjoyable read for those serious about philosophy and Hinduism."},{"Title":"The Bhagavad-Gita (Galaxy Books, 389)","review":"I have greatly enjoyed, and benefitted from, the late Professor R.C. Zaehner's wonderful translation of, and extensive commentary upon, The Bhagavad-Gita. The book was originally published in 1969, but is still in print (which is quite a testimonial in itself).I can't praise this book highly enough. The introduction alone is worth the price of the book, yet virtually every one of Dr. Zaehner's notes to his excellent translation brings a thrilling \\"Ah Ha!\\" of connection and understanding.I especially appreciate that, instead of interpreting the Gita in such a way as to buttress his own spiritual/religious point of view, Zaehner explores the deeper meaning of each chapter and verse of the Gita in reference to the rest of the text, and to the totality of the Mahabharata, and to the great commentators on the Gita, including Ramanuja and Shankara. His intention is to tease out what the Gita itself is trying to say, rather than imposing his own views upon it; I greatly respect that. And his commentary also benefits from his broad and deep understansing of Sanskrit and of the great spiritual teachings of India and Persia--and so, of course, his readers benefit as well.I am almost continually re-reading this book. Each time, I understand it a little more. It is a treasure."},{"Title":"The Bhagavad-Gita (Galaxy Books, 389)","review":"Not having Sanskrit myself, I am not really qualified to judge the quality of the translation; what is so attractive about this version is that the translator strives, in his own admission, for accuracy, rather than the flights of poetic fancy often favoured by earlier translations; and even more importantly, this translation has an extensive and outstanding scholarly apparatus, which is an essential aid to understanding this complex work."},{"Title":"The Bhagavad-Gita (Galaxy Books, 389)","review":"Robert Charles Zaehner does a nice job of translating the Sanskrit text. It's an in depth English translation."},{"Title":"The Bhagavad-Gita (Galaxy Books, 389)","review":"In terms of being readable and capturing the feeling of the original, this is not the best translation of the Gita. Such renderings as \\"athlete of the spirit\\" for Yogi and \\"contingent beings\\" for bhuta give the text a slightly crusty, academic flavor. Indeed, the translator was an Oxford don, Robert Charles Zaehner, whose \\"talent lay in seeing what to ask, rather than in how to answer.\\" The book has ample quotes not only from the two great commentators Shankara and Ramanuja but also from the Upanishads and earlier sacred literature. Like Radakrishnan, whom he succeeded at Oxford, Zaehner makes wide-ranging comparisons with Western religions and philosophies, as well as with various subcontinental traditions. His opinions and readings are frequently controversial or questionable and require verification, but he does know a lot about his material and presents stimulating points of view, often from contrasting perspectives. A very useful book for somebody who wants to explore the deeper implications of the Gita and the sources that influenced it."},{"Title":"The Bhagavad-Gita (Galaxy Books, 389)","review":"This is an excellent translation and commentary on the ancient and mysterious Bhagavad Gita. Transliteration of the original Sanskrit text provides scholarly readers a chance to understand the technique and direction of the translation. Drawing on the commentaries of Shankara, Ramanuja and Madhva, Zaehner helps the student and interested reader come to an understanding of the great work by interconnecting the major verses of the Gita. With help from some Upanisads, the author illumines the theistic intent of the Speaker, Sri Krishna, through references to numerous ancient theistic commentaries. Refuting the monism of Shankara, Zaehner establishes the clear meaning of the Gita, placing it as a the greatest Monotheistic work of India and, perhaps, of the world."},{"Title":"Pretense ... of Innocence","review":"I'm curious when a writer drops off the page after one novel. What gives? Do they hide out in another genre using a different pen name? So they just have the one story to tell? There is so little gay escapist fiction (mystery/adventure/romance) that I'm always sorry when it's a case of 'that's all he wrote.'Not that PRETENSE OF INNOCENCE is a good mystery novel . A kind of Who-is-Killing-the-Gay-Men-of-Shreveport, PRETENSE OF INNOCENCE breaks one of the supreme &quot;play fair with the reader&quot; rules (no, not that one--the other one). But it's not a totally bad mystery novel either. Shreveport, Louisiana makes a nice change from overused Los Angeles, the characters are distinct (from each other anyway), and there are a number of attention-getting subplots (in particular the romance of bookseller Charles and the fresh out of the closet book thief Brett). King intelligently handles issues of prejudice, infidelity, and self-acceptance, but the pacing is disjointed, clumsy: an example is the inexplicable declarations of love from both Brett and Charles (Did I miss something? One minute they're betraying each other to the cops, the next it's l'amour, l'amour).There are lots of rough patches. The peculiar thing is I did enjoy PRETENSE OF INNOCENCE. Story and characters stayed in my mind--along with all those unanswered questions. Chief among them is when is Atticus King going to take another stab at mystery writing?"},{"Title":"History of the Breast","review":"I found this to be an easy to read, informative book about how the west has viewed the breast in art, politics and medicine. As a researcher in the sociology of reproduction, I was impressed by her synthesis of wet nursing and breastfeeding in her chapters on the politics of the breast. I found her analyses compelling. The review of how the breast appeared in art was new to me and here I appreciated Yalom's writing style--accessible yet thorough. Her weakest chapters are the one on psychoanalytic treatment of the breast, and the one covering recent culture. I found her coverage and analysis of the psychoanalytic literature to be out of place and she didn't seem to integrate it as well as I'd have liked in the politics/art of the time. The final chapter on recent cultural attitudes and representations of the breast could have been an entire book, so I felt a bit cheated. It wasn't clear why she included some things and not others, and I think she gave short shrift to the current issues surrounding breastfeeding, esp. to characterizing La Leche League on the basis of one person's anecdotal quote. But overall, a great introduction to the breast and definitely a stimulus to reading more, especially about non-Western attitudes toward the breast. It might have been interesting to include a cross-cultural chapter... Finally, the photographs are numerous, interesting, and nicely complement her analysis."},{"Title":"History of the Breast","review":"With a wonderful blend of serious history and modern humor where appropriate, the author presents a thought provoking run down on the history over 25 centuries and the photos of Annie Sprinkles Bosom Ballet on page 268 made the purchase worth every cent.As the author wisely notes that Westerners assumptions about the breast is often wrong, and that Non western cultures have their own fetishes be it small feet in China, the nape of the neck in Japan, the buttocks in Africa and the Caribbean. That through out western history the breast has been viewed as good and bad, and by men mostly and religious men in particular.The book is excellent in showing how the breast has been used to depict power and justice be it in war posters (Bosoms For The Nation) or the lady of justice with one breast exposed. To breasts used to sell products or alas slaves. (The commercialized Breast) How the whole idea that breasts were owned according to some by the husband, or were considered babies domain. That it wasn't until the women's movement that women demanded that what was on their bodies belonged to them to do with as they wished, be it nipple piercing, nudity, no bra etc. (The liberated Breast)There are photos of mastectomy survivors and lord knows dozens of bare, exposed, all size breasts, which I assume the reader would expect in a serious book about the human breast.It is a book I am so glad I bought. Also check out her excellent History Of The Wife book."},{"Title":"History of the Breast","review":"Yalom's book meets the highest standards for careful academic work, and, as a source, will turn out to be the standard for investigation into the subject in the future. But the appeal is broad and will engage the general reader, the historian, the physician. In short it is a good history, a good cultural study, and a good read. Fine writing, intriguing illustrations dilated to include such diversity as the political breast, the surgical breast, the nursing breast, the pornographic breast. An excellent analysis."},{"Title":"History of the Breast","review":"Marilyn Yalom (her latest work, History of the Wife, is spectacular) shows her characteristic style of humor and scholarship in history of the breast. Relying on both art and personal accounts, Yalom goes era by era detailing various Western cultures' attitudes toward the female body and specifically the breast. She spends a great deal of effort detailing modern concerns like breast cancer treatment and breastfeeding controversies and with the background in the first half of the book, the reader is easily able to see how current attitudes have been shaped throughout history. An excellent book for the social historian, women's studies person, or art historian."},{"Title":"History of the Breast","review":"I first came across A History of the Breast while researching the evolution of the corset for a graduate term paper. Immediately intrigued by the straight-forward title and various brief reviews, I picked up the book with the intention of diving in at the earliest possible opportunity. Of course, that opportunity didn't seem to come until about 2.5 years later.Marilyn Yalom's A History of the Breast is a fascinating work focusing on, obviously, the cultural evolution of the perception of the breast. Yalom's text moves chronologically and pulls from any and all material available, from statues to literature and pamphlets, to advertisements and modern social movements. While I was personally most interested in her examination of the breast as it evolved from \\"The Sacred Breast\\" of ancient civilizations to \\"The Domestic Breast\\" of the Dutch, the text attempts to cover a wide range of subjects extending into politics, psychology, and commercialism.What I feel is an unfortunate flaw in Yalom's work is her assumptive attitude towards her reader; she assumes that her audience consists solely of other feminist scholars, and seems to be writing directly to them as opposed to a wider audience of scholars and enthusiasts. While very little of the work actually seems to rely on feminist theory and interpretation, Yalom's historical analysis at times appears to be overly-hostile to her subjects (specifically those of the Renaissance) while providing no academic basis for such hostility within this individual work. As a student and instructor of literature, I found her treatment of English literature particularly troubling; it seems to detract from the strength of the writing, as it reduces great works to rather shallow interpretations. Of course, feminist theory is an academically rich field in and of itself, and it's just as likely that my own ignorance of Yalom's field is as at fault for my discomfort as the text itself.Overall, I was very pleased with A History of the Breast and the wealth of information and insight it provided. Yalom's style is easy to read, and logically presented in such a way as to build the reader's understanding as the book progresses. For anyone interested in gender studies, women's history, breasts and breastfeeding, the female form in art and culture, or the evolution of women's clothing I would certainly recommend this book."},{"Title":"History of the Breast","review":"In nine chapters Marilyn Yalom covers European and American attitudes and use of the female breast from the earliest cities of the Near East to the end of the 20th century. The book is very Western in it's focus, so not a comprehensive history. However, if you know that then you will find a good solid historical approach to an symbol and a body part that has played a huge role in art, literature, politics, religion, and even economies. Generous use of images and quotations are helpful in demonstrating how historians reason and use evidence without making the book very appealing to those looking for a sexual thrill. Overall the book is arranged both thematically and chronologically when possible. This is a book I could have undergraduates read as a feasible example of how history can be interesting and still be focused on the discipline's methods."},{"Title":"History of the Breast","review":"Marilyn Yalom has a fascinating way of blending history, culture and personal stories in her new book. It reminds me of what Ken Burns has done in some of his documentaries, where you learn as much about life in the times as you do about the specific topic. The book is a wonderful and easy way to learn about the wife in different times, cultures and religions, and also the possibilities of what it might mean to be a wife in the future. Excellent reading."},{"Title":"Taj Mahal Lovers' Story","review":"Ms. Singh Devji serves as a tour guide through the generations of exotic characters who begot Emperor Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal. I could taste the dust and blood on the battlefields with Babar the Lion. Together with the Persian Princess and her female relatives, I explored the Meena Bazar and flirted demurely with the young noblemen. The author treated me like a member of the extended family as I witnessed the royal wedding, peeked in on the wedding night and watched the birth of the first princess, Jahanara.Ms. Devji described the labyrinth of politics within the medieval harem, the opulence of the royal family in every day life, and the cruel punishments meted out to anyone who dared to displease the Indian Royal Family.This book provides so much more than just the love story behind the construction of the Taj Mahal. The author takes us through thirteen decades of history from the steppes of Mongolia across Asia to Agra and Delhi. She filled the book with facts, and thankfully, a map, genealogy, and a glossary explaining Indian words and phrases. The only things missing on the tour were the cameras and tourist stands for souvenirs. However, Ms. Devji thought of that too. The book itself is a work of art-from the luxurious cover to the watercolor paintings of scenes depicting significant events.For history buffs, fans of romantic novels, or the reader who enjoys an adventure story, this story does it all. It also looks great on the bookshelf."},{"Title":"Taj Mahal Lovers' Story","review":"Not only is the art work in this book simply georgeous, but the story pulls you in. It is a story of kings; and all of the love, betrayl, polotics, and friendship that goes with that. A balanced story of the human condition and the grand wonders that become of it. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Taj Mahal Lovers' Story","review":"This book is by far the best and most engrossing description that I have read so far about the Taj. Many have tried to write about it but none with such consummateness. I couldn't put the book down once I got started. The descriptions are both colourful and vivid. The reader feels as if he/she is there witnessing the actual turn of events. All emotions of Shah Jahan have been captured perfectly - from his love to his grief. An atmosphere of the Mughals has been built slowly and the reader is captivated by its realism and beauty. The best scene in the book is without doubt the one in Meena Baazar. This beautiful and thrilling saga is a must read."},{"Title":"Taj Mahal Lovers' Story","review":"The Taj Mahal Lovers' Story recounts one of the greatest love stories of world in a style which is eminently lyrical,informative &amp; at the same time dramatic.With her magic pen,the author Mantoshe Singh Devji not only tells a love story, but her painstaking research is evident in the vivid details woven so well in the tapestry of the main story,so that each chapter is a delight to read.

In an age where love seems so rare, this is a historical and narrative account of one of the most famous love stories in the world that spawned one the seven wonders of the world. Love is not disposable, it cannot be killed, nor can it be erased, nor is a true love ever forgotten. There is a distinction between romantic delusions and a true enduring legacy etched on the heart. The love story behind the Taj Mahal exemplifies the later. When there is a heartbreak ... one of gifts of its tragedy are the legacies that are born inspired by the heart's most precious love ... and in the case of the Taj Mahal ... it was the memory of Queen Mumtaz Mahal to her widower. And the result was the architectural masterpiece now known centuries later as a testament to that love. So ... no ... you are not crazy to still be in love no matter how much time has passed. Upon Mumtaz Mahal's death Prince Jahal married again as he promised her.

I understand that this is a free version of a book, converted by volunteers, but that doesn't mean it HAS to be inferior to what it COULD be. If you believe your volunteer work can be substandard just because you're donating your time, maybe you should stick with paid work.The \\"community of volunteers\\" that \\"converted (this book) from its physical edition to the digital format\\" not only wasted their time by producing the Kindle version of this book, they have managed to waste the time of everyone who bothers to download this version. It is beyond me why anyone thinks it's worthwhile to publish only the text of a book that relies heavily on illustrations or photographs. Rather than continue to post these idiotic, frustrating versions of \\"FREE\\" illustrated books (minus the pictures) for the Kindle, it would be much better for Amazon to simply post a page that says, \\"Don't bother downloading this if you would like to see the images described by the text.\\"If you're interested, you can find the illustrations from this book in the HTLM .zip at Project Gutenberg. While I appreciate the efforts of the \\"community of volunteers\\", I wish they would quit posting books for the Kindle until it has been properly and fully converted -- including images -- in the form the author intended.I can't help but wonder how much Amazon has to do with publishing, or at least not discouraging, Kindle books like this (with necessary images not included.) They love to shout about the availability of \\"free books\\" in their Kindle ads, and allowing junk like this definitely adds to the number of free books."},{"Title":"WILD FLOWERS WORTH KNOWING","review":"I'm not knowledgeable enough to be able use this book, as there are no illustrations. I need some drawings to help identify the plants."},{"Title":"WILD FLOWERS WORTH KNOWING","review":"Wild Flowers Worth Knowing was published in 1917, a year before the author's death.

As you would guess for its (free Kindle) price, it lacks illustrations that would enhance the text very much.I don't believe that this book is a \\"waste for everyone\\" like another reviewer (see my comment under that review on deleting titles on the Kindle). If you look over the rest of my reviews, I am not averse to rating wastes of time - I have rated two, including an insect book, which I am partial to. But I AM a horticulturist, and ALL plant books hold some interest for me.This Kindle edition of September 1, 2005 is reasonably well edited and worth a skim (for me, at least). It is just very dry, especially without illustrations, so bear that in mind. I am not going to finish it, as I have many other, more readable flower books in my (hardback) book collection.

Joe is an actor who appears in commercials, which gives him plenty of free time to solve crimes. He's really more of a cactus man, but he enters the cutthroat (really!) world of orchids in order to find out who murdered a member of the local orchid society. It's not too difficult to guess whodunit, and the plot could be stronger, but this book is still a light and amusing read. I liked Joe's deadpan observations and wry sense of humor, and enjoyed learning about the differences between cactus and orchid lovers."},{"Title":"Death of an Orchid Lover","review":"I was happy to renew my acquaintance with Joe Portugal, cactus maven and amateur sleuth. This time he gets involved with killings among orchid enthusiasts. It's an off-beat mix of actors, plant smugglers, old loves, and one very nasty murderer. Joe's sense of humor had me chuckling throughout, despite the dangerous situations he keeps landing himself in. The main character comes across as a damaged person trying hard to be a decent human being. Joe just keeps getting more appealing and his lovelife couldn't be more complicated. Even if you're not a plant enthusiast yourself, you'll find it hard not to get interested. (Didja know that the term &quot;orchid&quot; comes from the Greek word for testicle?) Fascinating characters, tight plot, genuine humor--another quick read from Walpow."},{"Title":"Death of an Orchid Lover","review":"Forty-six-year-old Los Angeles resident Joe Portugal earns enough income from starring in commercials to keep his body and spirit nourished. He has finally accepted the reality that he will never be a great actor and enjoys spending time cultivating his succulent plants, treating them like his children. At a party given by orchid enthusiast Albert Oberg, Joe runs into fellow attendee Laura Astaire, a person he has not seen in fifteen years. Joe is surprised when Laura calls him the next day, begging him to help her. The police feel she murdered her boy friend Albert.Laura asks Joe to clear her name by finding the real killer. Joe agrees, but before he can start investigating, Laura dies. The police want to tie her death into a neat package labeled guilt leading to suicide, but Joe rejects the theory because of Laura's plea for him to prove her innocence. Joe begins inquiries into the two murders not yet realizing how dangerous a pastime amateur sleuthing can become.DEATH OF AN ORCHID LOVER is a refreshing, fast-paced novel filled with offbeat charcaters that beguile the audience into liking them in spite of their serious flaws. Horticulture details are cleverly interwoven into the story line by an author who obviously is an expert on plant life because he is an enthusiast himself. Joe's quirky sense of humor enables him to survive situations that would make many a person weep. Although this is only Joe's second appearance, author Nathan Walpow has a winning series that appears ready for a long run.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Death of an Orchid Lover","review":"DEATH OF AN ORCHID is the second title in Nathan Walpow's Joe Portugal Mystery Series. It's an interesting gardening series that takes place in Culver City, CA.It seems Joe Portugal and I have some things in common, the love of cactus and succulents and learning to live with the condition of CRS (for the meaning, you will have to read the book).Competitiveness can be found in just about every avenue in life, and most certainly in gardening, especially when it comes to wanting the best. This is just one of the possibilities Joe Portugal has to consider as he tries to help an old acting friend who has been accused of murdering the host of the Orchid Spring social. While he is sleuthing, Joe takes the time to try out for a commercial and to comfort Gina when life with her lover, Jill, gets shaky. Gina, being a good friend and old sweetheart of Joe's, puts on her sleuthing shoes and joins him on the path of murder and mayhem among some beautiful flora and disconcerting inhabitants.I think Mr. Walpow's sense of humor, along with his characters stood out the most.

Joe finds himself at the home of orchid lover Dr. Albert Oberg to attend the spring social of the Palisades Orchid Society. When Dr. Oberg winds up dead later in the evening, the prime suspect is an old acting friend of Joe's who asks him to find the real murderer. The mystery that follows is a good one, interspersed with lots of interesting gardening trivia about growing orchids and cacti.Author Walpow does a great job of setting the Los Angeles scene, and the characters are quirky and lovable. A very enjoyable aspect of the story is Joe's love life (or more exactly, his lack of a love life). I thoroughly enjoyed this story, and will definitely look for other mysteries by Mr. Walpow."},{"Title":"The Boiling Point: Will War Come in Europe?","review":"Re-reading books like this one from the years before World War II (which I enjoy doing from time to time) has two purposes. One is the curiosity value of judging via hindsight how well the author did forecasting the future. The second and more serious value is in assessing informed writers' mindset at the time, and how they interpreted current events. \\"The Boiling Point\\" is a worthwhile read for both purposes.Hubert Renfro Knickerbocker was a Pulitzer-prize winning journalist for United Press and the author of several well-regarded books published before and during World War II. In this book, Knickerbocker traveled throughout Europe, talking to key leaders and trying to find the answer to the question \\"Does Hitler mean war?\\" Although he seems to decide it's too early to tell, that's less of a cop-out than my summary might suggest. On the whole, this is a not-at-all bad summary of European leaders' opinions within twelve months of the Nazi ascendancy.And on the viewed-in-retrospect test? Knickerbocker didn't do too badly. He was very correct to point out that \\"If Dollfuss goes, the Nazis come\\" (p. 67), and curiously prescient in describing the Nazi president of the Danzig senate, Dr. Hermann Rauschning, as \\"a convincing friend of peace\\" (p. 5). Rauschning, as it turned out, broke with the Nazis in the mid-1930s and spent the next five years warning the West about the true nature of the National Socialist regime. There's also an interesting interview with Archduke Otto of Austria, and a long quotation from one of Churchill's Parliamentary speeches. Knickerbocker describes Churchill as \\"that British Demosthenes\\" (p. 255) -- not bad for 1933."},{"Title":"Holocaust Poetry","review":"Shiff prefaces this book with a verse from Job 16:18: &quot;Oh earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no resting place.&quot; This anthology gives voice to holocaust victims, it brings immediacy to the holocaust -- making it a current tragedy rather than a historical event. The poems are organized somewhat chronologically, in sections titled Alienation, Persecution, Destruction, Rescuers Bystanders &amp; Perpetrators, Afterwards, Second Generation, Lessons, and God. A variety of writers are represented, from the famous (Elie Wiesel, Primo Levi, Sylvia Plath), to the less famous (Pavel Friedman, a child inmate of Theresienstadt camp). An appendix includes fascinating biographical sketches information on each author, which adds an extra dimension to the poetry. Much of the poetry is very readable, accessible, not as esoteric as I had expected. The overall effect is highly disturbing, yet it's inspiring that many of the writers are able to find God or meaning in such horror."},{"Title":"Holocaust Poetry","review":"The Holocaust is undoubtedly the most horrific epoch of human violence mankind ever witnessed.Not much historical documentation was done about it because in the brutal act of murdering Six million Jews by the Nazi supportors almost an entire race got wiped out...the few that survived remained transfixed by the aftermath of that shattering experience of barbaric cruelity.The recorded facts were kept supressed for a long time.The Holocaust remained hidden like a Blackhole in the obscure labyrinths of history. Though we consider the Holocaust as a rudiment of the dead past,we still find the haunting echos even now.Just look back in retrospect even a short span of the bygone decade.There we find the demonic manifestations of the forgotten dead past!The list at random is alarming:ethnic strife in Rwanda,Cechnia,Croatians and Serbs,Jews and the Palestinens and above all Racial descrimination at different levels in almost all the continents.This is the price we pay for remaining oblivious to the lessons of the past.The dictum&quot;Those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it&quot; will hold true for ever.It is indeed our moral responsibility to at least remotely live through the pain and and agony...to empathise with the victims of the holocaust who suffered more by the deliberate acts of cruelity by their own fellow beings than by the stroke of fate.It will be a disdainful act if we choose to turn away from this imperious reality of the past! Hilda Schiff's compilation &quot;Holocaust Poetry&quot; addresses this fact with such immediacy of purpose.This is a very insightful compilation because Hilda Schiff has chosen to include as many variety of poems from different perspectives of the same reality than presenting a chosen few poets at length.This offers a panaromic insight into the holocaust in its entiriety!The poems compiled are arranged in an order that gives a graphical account of the plight of the victims.Nothing else could be a better example of Man's innate urge to destroy and above all Man's indomitable will to overcome..to eventually triumph against all odds.These poems give that rare insight into the complexity of the strange human predicament as well! Well,when striken stricken to the heart the Lion gives out his mightiest roar,smitten on the head the cobra rises it's hood...and the glory of the Self comes forth when a man is wounded to the depths!These verbal expressions form only a fractional account of the unsung saga of the holocaust victims,but they stand as the living testimony of a statement by the Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis&quot; Man's wings won't sprout until he reaches the brink of an abyss!&quot;"},{"Title":"Holocaust Poetry","review":"I really enjoyed reading your book of Holocaust Poetry.

However, I know it is going to be fantastic! The poems I have read are poignant and thought-provoking. I also quite like the way it is organized by themes-- isolation, persecution, etc. I would definitely recommend this for someone interested in poetry OR history/social studies."},{"Title":"Holocaust Poetry","review":"Holocaust Poetrycompiled by and introduced by Hilda Schiff is a collection of poetry dealing with World War II and the Holocaust. The compilation is divided into six sections: Alienation; Persecution; Rescuers, Bystanders, Perpetrators; Afterwards; Second Generation; and Lessons. There are well-known poems in this collection and poems from young children. A few of the poems in this collection already have been featured on Savvy Verse & Wit's Virtual Poetry Circle; check out \\"If\\" by Edward Bond and \\"The Butterfly\\" by Pavel Friedmann.Each poem in the collection uses all-too-familiar images to demonstrate connections with family, friends, and strangers. and as each poem unfolds readers feel the devastation and hopelessness of each narrator. Schiff says in the introduction, \\"The more or less contemporaneous literature of any period of history is not only an integral part of that period, but it also allows us to understand historical events and experiences better than the bare facts alone can do because they enable us to absorb them inwardly.\\" More or less, readers of poetry will find these observations valid, as will readers of fiction.However, there are moments of levity when narrators poke fun at the devastating events of Nazi Germany's actions.Beyond the poems in the collection depicting the horrors and the losses of persecuted people in Germany, the poems of bystanders, perpetrators, and others are surprising. They talk of how they stood by and did nothing, how they want to help even if they are too late. Despite the time for help being long passed, these narrators express not guilt so much as regret -- a deep regret at having been so paralyzed by fear that they did nothing or acted contrary to who they believed themselves to be.The poems selected for the \\"Second Generation\\" section will tug at readers heart strings, deepening the sense of loss. An emptiness is present in some of these poems. Short biographies are included at the back of the book for readers interested in the poets' lives and connections to WWII and the Holocaust.Holocaust Poetryis a collection that should be read in chunks rather than all at once. Readers may succumb to sorrow if they attempt to read the entire collection in once sitting, but even then, readers will fall into the darkness and emerge in the light. Overall, the collection is a must have for anyone interested in this time period and learning more about how WWII and the Holocaust impact individual lives and families."},{"Title":"A Prayer for Deliverance: An Angela Bivens Thriller","review":"In A Prayer for Deliverance, Christopher Chambers resumes where the debut novel, Sympathy For the Devil, ended. FBI agent, Angela Bivens, is back in action as an inspector called in to investigate the murders of prominent African American leaders. While her superiors think the murders are the work of a well-known hate group, we find Angela dallying in the supernatural to solve the murders and bring the true assassins to justice. Specifically, she is pulled into a dark underworld of Zulu \\"magick\\" to substantiate her theories and enlists the help of a rookie sidekick (and Wicca witch) to assist in the investigation. As in the first novel, she is both supported and hindered by the FBI staff and must deal with the political powers of the agency and the bureaucracy of the Washington elite. To complicate things further, she stumbles through a newfound romance while struggling to overcome the emotional scars from her last boyfriend, a psychotic sociopath who was the evil perpetrator of her last case.As one can imagine, this book is multi-dimensional and filled with numerous plot twists and turns. There are so many characters with ulterior motives that this reviewer literally had to keep notes on who was who, their relationships to one another, and their relationships within the FBI hierarchy.This novel is extremely well written and very well researched as evidenced in the passages about South African culture and politics. However, this reviewer felt that at times the plot tangents obscured the essence of the mystery. In an attempt to make this a well-rounded novel, the author repeatedly lost this reviewer in the minutia and the surreal, dreamlike episodes that were scattered throughout the book. Angela Bivens, earmarked as an FBI super sleuth, seemed bewildered and clueless at times which elongated the story and damaged her characterization as an ingenious, diehard super agent. There were some segments in which she appeared to be as much of a victim as the targets. Perhaps this was intentional, to show her vulnerabilities, however it came off as Angela being the luckiest detective alive instead of one of the sharpest. Nonetheless, this reviewer persevered to see how the novel would conclude and was not disappointed. Overall, this was a compelling mystery and proved to be entertaining.PhyllisAPOOO BookClub, Nubian Circle Book Club"},{"Title":"A Prayer for Deliverance: An Angela Bivens Thriller","review":"Whew! I liked Sympathy--it was a decent first mystery-thriller that seemed to follow the Thomas Harris Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon formula, and I read that the author's mentor was Harris. It was hard to follow some of the African American slang of the teenage victims, but it was a very intelligent and well-crafted, vivid read. In Deliverance, THIS GUY PULLS OUT ALL THE STOPS! From the beginning (where we find out Agent Bivens's TERRIBLE decision) to the very end on 9-11, he throws the kitche sink at you, but hey, you take and you LOVE Getting hit with it! So many levels to this book. I don't give 5 stars usually, but, as a former law enforcement officer, I give him the stars just for the testicular fortitude to craft something that mixes Stephen King with Tom Clancy with E.

For the most part the book works but there is just too much in it. The story goes off in so many directions it's like looking at a pot of spaghetti thrown against the wall. The heroine is essentially Cleopatra Jones with serious emotional issues and some of the stuff she does makes not a lick of sense but if you give this book time you'll find a pretty good read for a rainy afternoon."},{"Title":"A Prayer for Deliverance: An Angela Bivens Thriller","review":"I first have to say that this review may be a little skewed, because I am a personal friend of the author. Howevere, I have read both books, and I must say that they are excellent. I never read fiction, and to get me to read fiction is like pulling teeth.

Overall I will read another Angela Bivens novel by this author because I like mysteries."},{"Title":"A Prayer for Deliverance: An Angela Bivens Thriller","review":"Oft times a writer cannot repeat the success of the first novel. However, Christopher Chambers has continued the Angela Bivens series with another captivating and well-written thriller entitled A Prayer for Deliverance (APFD).We meet Angela in APFD relaxing and still recovering from injuries gained in Sympathy for Devil. Angela is summoned from her vacation to help with the investigation of a prominent Washington D.C doctor's murder. This murder is followed by more murders and the investigation takes the reader into the worlds of the supernatural, spells and African mysticism. We are reintroduced to some characters from Chambers' first novel, which adds to the continuity of the series. Additionally, Angela gets a new rogue partner, Nadia, who reminds Angela of herself as a rookie FBI agent. The reader is held captive by the book until the conclusion of this thriller.Chambers does an excellent job weaving his research into his novels. Readers who reside in the Baltimore-Washington corridor will be very familiar with the scenery in the novel. Angela Bivens is a remarkable heroine and I am looking forward to additional books from Chambers in this series.Reviewed by Robilyn HeathThe RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"A Prayer for Deliverance: An Angela Bivens Thriller","review":"I got about two chapters into this book before quitting in disgust.

The mutual antipathies and clashing interests of the Americans, their difference of governments, habitudes, and manners, indicate that they will have no center of union and no common interests. A disunited people to the end of time, suspicious and distrustful of each other, they will be divided and subdivided into little communities or principalities, according to natural boundaries, by great bays of the sea, and by vast rivers, lakes, and ridges of mountains.\\"George Washington said it was yet to be known whether the American Revolution had been a blessing or a curse. No one yet knew whether Americans had replaced the stable government of the British Empire, imperfect though it might be, with something worse.John Fiske vividly reminds us of just how fragile the United States was in the years after winning its independence:* That the states regarded themselves as sovereignties that thumbed their noses at the Articles of Confederation and were hostile to each other, even to the extent of embargoing each other's trade and waging border wars to drive out encroaching settlers from other states.* That the United States was surrounded by the empires of Britain, France, and Spain, then at the height of their powers, that were opportunistic in wanting to reincorporate American territories back into their empires.* That there were local politicians driven either by anarchist ideology or selfish ambition who wanted the states to declare their independence from each other and assume the full title of sovereign nations while abandoning the trans-Appalachian territories to the foreign powers* That only by very narrow margins did the men of broader vision such as Washington, Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison --- men who understood America's unique opportunity to secure liberty by federating as a single nation --- overcome the designs of lesser men to fragment the country into petty states.John Fiske captures the anarchist spirit of those times better than anyone with the possible exception of Dale Van Every, whose book ARK OF EMPIRE I have also reviewed. Anyone who reads either of these books will come to a full appreciation of how fortunate we are to live in the \\"United\\" States.If not for the greatness of our leaders in the 1780s and 1790s, and the patient wisdom of most of our people, the War Between the States would have started immediately following the American Revolution and gone on for decades. Instead of being a strong nation we would have followed the pattern of fragmentation, revolution, anarchy, and wars between petty states that held Latin America back for so long.Lucky indeed that we made the wise choices during the infancy of our nation that preserved and prosperted the United States of America. Fiske makes it clear what a close-run process it was."},{"Title":"Leonard Cohen: A Life in Art","review":"I am officially going through another Leonard Cohen phase (more on that later) and in looking for some books to read for a recent trip involving long flights, I came upon this little book.In \\"Leonard Cohen: A Life in Art\\" (160 pages; originally published in 1995), author Ira Nadel brings a short biography of Leonard Cohen. Keep in mind that the book was written mostly in 1994, just as Cohen had turned 60 and had then-recently scored a sizable commercial hit with his 1992 album \\"The Future\\". Let me state upfront that this is not your ordinary biography. It reads more like an academic dissertation, with multiple sidebars into the art (songs, poetry, and other) of Cohen. As is often the case, the most fascinating part are the early years. In fact, the book is divided almost to the page half in half between Cohen's life up to 1967 (release of his first album) and his life afterwards. The son of well-to-do Jewish immigrants in Montreal, Cohen defied his parents' expectations and after attending undergraduate at McGill and graduate at Columbia, decided to make a go of it as a poet. Becoming restless, Cohen visits London and then Greece, where he would continue to spend significant amounts of time for decades to come. The book does a tremendous job in putting matters into context, both from an artistic perspective, as well as a more personal one. The second half of the book is far less interesting, in particular as the years go on, as too many times it becomes a repetition of describing life on the road, tour after tour. Nevertheless, I would recommend this book for the insights provided in the first half of it.I saw Leonard Cohen recently live in concert for the first time, at the Coachella music festival, and what a delight that was. A thrilling set from start to finish. As a fan of Cohen for a long, long time, it was a dream come true to finally see him perform. It caused me to revisit some of his earlier albums, including the excellent 1979 live album \\"Field Commander Cohen\\", and of course also the just-released CD/DVD \\"Leonard Cohen Live in London\\"."},{"Title":"Vision and design (Meridian books)","review":"This is a &#34;must book&#34; for any serious artist.

I think I shall read it again now that I have found it."},{"Title":"Green mansions: A romance of the tropical forest","review":"JB Priestly wrote a book about time ('Man and Time') and in it he referred to a WH Hudson novel called 'A Crystal Age'. His couple of paragraphs about 'A Crystal Age' stimulated my interest but nowhere could I find the novel he referred to. However, I did find 'Green Mansions' and I have read it several times. It is a beautiful novel with an undertone of darkness (is death the darkness that we all live with during the beauty of life?). Perhaps 'Green Mansions' disappointed me a little after triggering my romantic nerve. I did, however, keep exploring the writings of WH Hudson - 'Long Ago and Far Away', 'The Purple Land', 'Idle Days in Patagonia' and the wonderful 'A Shepherd's Life'.On a recent trip to the States I visited a small specialist bookshop where it was suggested I might be able to get access to 'A Crystal Age' through abebooks.com. This was great advice. I have just finished reading 'A Crystal Age' and I concur with JB Priestley's assessment. 'A Crystal Age' is worth the effort of pursuing - it is a surprising first-person utopian novel in which Hudson's love of nature does not render him oblivious to the fact that there are downsides in all worlds - all imaginable worlds. Just like the dark shadows in 'Green Mansions'. The end of 'A Crystal Age' is so surprising - I believe very few readers would see what is coming - I certainly didn't as I rushed on towards it. There is a certain illogic to the ending, but there is also something that haunts me continuously. I hope the illogic has not been a contributing factor in this novel's failure to be reprinted. But why else has it not been picked up - I am sure there is a market.'A Crystal Age' is a stronger less romantic novel than 'Green Mansions', but it is also exceptional for many reasons. I don't hesitate in recommending 'Green Mansions' but I also urge readers to pursue 'A Crystal Age' - it is only a matter of time before I will be re-reading it myself. As for publishers who are looking for books from the past to reprint - give 'A Crystal Age' a look."},{"Title":"Green mansions: A romance of the tropical forest","review":"My mother having read this book sometime before I was born in the 50's, was so moved that she named me after Rima.

Mr. Abel is vulnerable to his new environment's treacherous heat, its indigenous wildlife, the cruelties (as well as the hospitality) of its native peoples, and suffers periods of disease and starvation.Mr. Abel falls in love with a strange, beautiful, and exceedingly elusive young woman, named Rima, who has a rare affinity with nature and its creatures. Rima, whose mysterious family background figures strongly in the plot, is raised by her grandfather, Nuflo, after her mother dies. Mr. Abel accuses Nuflo of hypocracy, but eventually comes to respect him. Mr. Abel, despite his background and personal attitudes, learns to adapt to and eventually to accept nature on its own terms.

I was intrigued by the book and ready for it's adventure. As I read the book despite my problems with suspending disbelief (I usually prefer non-fiction) I found myself wrapped up in it for several evenings. The story is absorbing and descriptions and writing excellent.Although one of the main characters is a mythical \\"bird woman\\", Rima, I continued on with the story, seduced by both her fragile beauty, her unusual history and predicament. I also enjoyed the enthusiasm and insight into the forest and it's people provided by the Abel the story's narrator and main character as he travels from the city on the coast to the interior of the continent and depths of Amazonia.Although this is a Victorian-era novel, it is not a difficult read, and it is a notable and well worthwhile book.

The protagonist, Abel, is not particularly likable -- which I don't believe was the author's intent -- and even allowing for the time period in which the book was written, Abel displays a surprising degree of condescension towards the natives and white men alike on whose hospitality he often depends. My general dislike for Abel made Green Mansions all the more difficult to stick with through its protracted longueur. The religious/eco-mystical aspects of the novel, however, are intriguing, and the writing is lush and evocative. I don't regret the time invested in reading Green Mansions, but it's extremely unlikely that I'll ever feel a need to revisit the book."},{"Title":"Green mansions: A romance of the tropical forest","review":"I am really shocked to see this book rated so highly and raved as a \\"classic\\", I find it incredibly boring and full of prejudice.For the record, around the same time, I also read W.H. Hudson's \\"Far away and Long ago\\" which I really like and will give a 5-star rating, but I must judge this book by its own merit and not by my opinion of the author.To start, the story in this book is rather boring. Nothing really happens. Our hero, Abel, because of some misfortunes ended up living with some native tribes (\\"Indians\\"). One day he wanders into a forest and heard some bird-like noise. Eventually he found out this to be from a pretty girl (Rima) the only survivor of a lost race. Abel accidentally reveals the girl's ancestral grounds and together with the girl's adopted \\"grandfather\\" they set out to go there. They got there but did not find the girl's people, confirming Abel's theory that they are extinct. Then the girl decides to go home first and was killed by the Indians (the tribe that Abel initially lived with). Abel finds another group of settlement people to wipe out the entire tribe of Indians, and carries the Rima's ashes to the coast.But really, there is nothing much happening here, especially between Abel and Rima, and the descriptions of Rima is all idealistic and superficial. What's more, the author's (Abel's, as the book was written in first-person from Abel's perspective) attitude towards Indians is full of prejudice -- they are indolent, lazy and devious. The author's attitude toward the girl's adopted grandfather is also very mean-spirited. As described in the book, the old man rescued Rima's mother, then brought up Rima, and did no evil deeds (although he may have had some in the past), which is really a remarkably noble act, yet Abel always looks down on him contemptuously and snobbishly. To avenge Rima's death, Abel's action is nothing short of ethnically cleansing (the entire tribe, which hosted and fed him, was completely wiped out). This is simply deplorable.Of course, I understand we cannot judge a book written more than 100 years ago by today's standard -- I fully understand that. But even by literary standards, I find this book severely flawed."},{"Title":"Green mansions: A romance of the tropical forest","review":"Those of you who have read Rand Johnson's &quot;Arcadia Falls - A Fable&quot; will find interesting parallels here, albeit in a Victorian idiom, as Hudson presents a moving and mysterious romance against a backdrop of great natural beauty, in this case the South American jungle."},{"Title":"Green mansions: A romance of the tropical forest","review":"The book is fine for reading, but a bit brittle and yellowed pages, stains.

Perhaps Hudson didn't know personally the area of the Venezuelan rainforest to the degree he knew Argentina and Uruguay, and used the findings of the early explorer von Thurm, who studied the many indigenous people of the Guianas. It came over as repetitive and a bit like watching a modern romantic film on jungle life.The famous film \\"Green Mansions\\" of the fifties with Audrey Hepburn and Anthony Perkins is decidedly agonisingly horrendous, but I would much rather read Hudson's naturalistic books on the pampas and the gauchos which belong to a historical reality, even though now seemingly romanticised."},{"Title":"Green mansions: A romance of the tropical forest","review":"Excellent book.

Themes of civilzation vs. savagery and the untouched beauty of the tropics vs. development are found throughout Green Mansions, but these issues are encased in a love story that holds notes of mystery, fantasy, and romanticism.While the novel provides a good introduction to the naturalist writings of this period (and a much easier read than most of the more scientific prose being written at the time), I thought that the ending was not as developed as the rest of the book, in addition to being highly unsatisfying. The novel does, however, offer wonderful descriptions of the wild forests of the region, and develops fantastical characters, particularly in the case of Rima, the primary female character."},{"Title":"Green mansions: A romance of the tropical forest","review":"William Henry Hudson's novel Green Mansions is an exotic romance that takes place in the South American rainforest. The novel is written from the perspective of Abel, a young man who had to leave the city he was living in for political reasons. During his time in the rainforest he meets Rima, who he describes as a bird-like girl, and her grandfather Nuflo. Despite these two, Abel mainly interacts with the Indians with whom he was living before he met Rima and Nuflo. The Indians are mostly referred to as savages.Green Mansions mainly focuses on the intimation of love and death, and the romanticism of nature versus the disturbing influences of civilization. However, Abel does not see any living creature during his stay in the rainforest as equal to him. He thinks of himself as superior to the Indians, Nuflo, and to Rima as well. He bases his sense of superiority on a better education, a greater intelligence, as well as a better physical condition. This sense of superiority is kept throughout the novel. However, his arrogance is one way to deal with his insecurity about many situations. Abel only seems to feel secure if he sees himself as superior to everybody else.

I dont often buy books, but this 1 is a keeper!!!"},{"Title":"Green mansions: A romance of the tropical forest","review":"William Henry Hudson's novel Green Mansions is an exotic romance that takes place in the South American rainforest. The novel is written from the perspective of Abel, a young man who had to leave the city he was living in for political reasons. During his time in the rainforest he meets Rima, who he describes as a bird-like girl, and her grandfather Nuflo. Despite these two, Abel mainly interacts with the Indians with whom he was living before he met Rima and Nuflo. The Indians are mostly referred to as savages.Green Mansions mainly focuses on the intimation of love and death, and the romanticism of nature versus the disturbing influences of civilization. However, Abel does not see any living creature during his stay in the rainforest as equal to him. He thinks of himself as superior to the Indians, Nuflo, and to Rima as well. He bases his sense of superiority on a better education, a greater intelligence, as well as a better physical condition. This sense of superiority is kept throughout the novel. However, his arrogance is one way to deal with his insecurity about many situations. Abel only seems to feel secure if he sees himself as superior to everybody else. This is the reason why he defines superiority based on the situation. Sometimes superiority is referred to as greater intelligence and in other cases as physical superiority. The way he uses superiority depends on the way it is easier for him to define himself as superior."},{"Title":"Green mansions: A romance of the tropical forest","review":"I think the story was beautifully written.

It's true that comments about televisions (When you next see Oliver Stone's Wall Street, check out the tv in Bud Fox's NYC penthouse...) and ranch houses are a bit dated, but the book shows that the craving for status and acceptance simply doesn't change. The book was published in 1949, and with a little imagination one can easily replaced dated status symbols with contemporary ones. The author's findings regarding ethnic and religious groups is interesting, too, but I won't spoil the surprise. Funny to view these observations 61 years after they were published. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Status Seekers","review":"I was not entirely startled by how important a role class played in the 50s (two decades before my birth) but this was eye-opening in some ways - it seems that status played a larger role in peoples' lives then. Packard does a wonderful job of documenting all of this and it is certainly more interesting than your average sociological research book. Some of it is quite dated, some is still relevant, but overall it presents a good look at how life was 40 years ago. Recommended, if you can track down a copy."},{"Title":"The Status Seekers","review":"The author explores the workings of American society's opportunity structure, specifically, how social class, status striving, and social mobility (upward, static, and downward) influence the behavior of people who live in and compete for resources in our stratified, free-market social system. The significance of, and impact of social class is not generally acknowledged in the U.S., thus Packard's book offers insights uncovered by way of surveys, polls, interviews, and in-depth investigations from various social science fields; in addition, for source material about the impact of class on social situations, he made several of his own informal, intensive investigations and brought together the findings of 150 American social scientists, primarily from the fields of sociology, psychology, and marketing research. In various parts of the book, he often refers to work done by the Lynds in their famous study, \\"Middletown,\\" and by sociologist William Foote Whyte. Some of the investigated social situations, and how they are influenced by social class, include the following: how class differences form an invisible wall; how one's family origins influence or determine one's life chances; conspicuous consumption as a status signifier; the significance of dress codes; interplay of class with race and gender; how religious and political persuasion influence voting propensities; how received imagery (such as today's slick political TV ads), rather than careful thought, determines voting decisions; how appearance and image, rather than construction quality, determine the value of a house; some societal sources of marriage and family stresses; wives are more class-conscious than husbands; clubs and other social organizations; impact of class on stress and mental illness; school and educational attainment; upper-class college students and the \\"gentleman's C\\"; the ideal of American individualism versus team-player reality; cliques and snobbery in school; the upper class; the diploma elite; the working class(es); social hierarchy in corporate bureaucracies; occupational prestige; and social factors which determine who are likely to be friends. Although there have been some fundamental cultural shifts since the late 1950s - such as the effects of deindustrialization - I think most of Packard's insightful findings involving social class, status-striving, job specialization, and the increasingly caste-like class stratification of American society are as applicable today, perhaps more so, as they were in the 1950s. The book is reader-friendly and should be suitable for high school students as well as adults."},{"Title":"The Status Seekers","review":"I read this because Tobias Wolff mentioned it in This Boy's Life. He was exactly right about it. It is a manual for changing your class.Since social class is basically a secret in the United States, it doesn't change very much -- the basic structure is pretty well intact since 1960. The list of prep schools he names, the hierarchy of religions; they're still valid.He has some pretty powerful inights. For example, he predicted that, in the future (today) the major qualification for wage jobs would be the ability to endure boredom. GOOD CALL.He says things about some groups (women, Jews...) that are a bit appalling in a modern context, but do paint a picture of the fifties that's worth pondering (this is not that long ago, after all).His observations about the changing nature of business are very interesting."},{"Title":"The Status Seekers","review":"I read this with interest not because it describes today's society, but it certainly gives some background to why things are the way they are in America today. I found the description of how the social side of playing the \\"game\\" in the military was particularly interesting. Easy reading and provocative in some chapters (e.g. being Jewish and being excluded)."},{"Title":"The Status Seekers","review":"A colleague of mine recently let me read a copy of this book, and how amazing of a book it is. It's astonishing to see the differences between the 1950s and now, but more astonishing were the similarities. Society is as stratified as it was back then, and although the status symbols themselves are different, the spirit of social division still remains. This book also shows the real reason why many never rise from the lower ranks to even the middle class, and why \\"rags to riches\\" is the exception and not the rule. Although some of the book is outdated (including some terminology), and we have made some progress since then (Federal Student Loans, the Civil Rights Act, and far less racial apartheid than existed in the 1950s), there is still much work to be done to give all people equal opportunities."},{"Title":"Families on the Move","review":"My husband and I have been in full-time Christian ministry for 18 years now with nearly 10 years overseas, and raising 4 resilient MKs who are a bit unorthodox (to some) but who still love Jesus. Having little prep help from our sending church or our previous organisation, God led us into working with leadership training and preparing of Australian missionary families who serve oveseas in parts of Asia, Africa & South America, as well as helping returning missionary families with re-entry. I WISH I had known of this book in our early days. Most resources, sad to say, tend to be American with a very American bent and little consideration to other Western cultures sending out. Marion's book written from both an American AND a UK understanding, helps us communicate to our trainees in a way they can relate. It deals with most issues missionary families face with a down-to-earth helpful honesty that is easy to read and doesn't come across as \\"having all the answers\\"--for we serve a creative God who likes to do things different on each of our individualized journeys of service for Him.Worth the investment."},{"Title":"Families on the Move","review":"This has been a nice resource to spur on conversation between our 11 and 13 year old boys as we prepare for a move overseas. It is written to parents and has some interesting points to consider that I had not thought about. We are about half-way though and reading a small portion each day to be able to talk about anticipation of the changes and feelings that we may have with such a big move. Although this author is from Britain and uses examples in cultural differences from that perspective it is easily understandable and translated to our own experience.Highlights of this book: Cartoon pictures depicting awkward/humorous situations of living overseasComments of real TCKs in a wide age rangeA good, honest, look at both the positives and negatives of a cross cultural move."},{"Title":"Families on the Move","review":"I am a missionary who has travelled extensively and have lived overseas for over 10 years now. I have a family of my own with two small children as well as work with 5 other families who also have children of various ages and one being an interracial/intercultural marriage. I bought this book as I thought it might be good for our resource library. After reading it I advise you to pass on this one and look for something better -- more well-written, more complete, more helpful.Overall, I found it to be poorly organized and written -- I had to force myself to finish it. It makes a lot of over-generalizations about 3rd-culture families and their experiences. Many of the specific examples given seem to be a forced fit to the point the author is trying to make. Perhaps the most troublesome aspect of the book is the author's constant question-asking -- questions to which answers are not given. Granted the questions could be useful if someone wishes to use them as a guideline and do some investigation in order to find answers. However, I imagine most people who would buy this book would do so because they were facing a move overseas and would prefer a book that answered more of the questions in its own text. In fact, they'd probably buy this book because they already have the same questions the author posits. Therefore the author's method would prove to be redundant for them at best...serve to reinforce their fears of the unknown at worst (i.e., if even this 'expert' doesn't know the answers to these questions...).Overall, it seems that this is a person with some experience in the subject matter who just decided to sit down one day and begin to whip out a book based on the questions that occurred to her as she wrote. Do yourself a favor and find a more thorough book that employs some good investigative journalism to back up its information and actually answers some of those questions."},{"Title":"To Marry Medusa","review":"This book is amazing, comparable to great science fiction works like the Hyperion and Dune series, and yet it captures their scope and literary beauty in a fraction of the pages. In only a few hundred pages an epic tale of conquest, brief (oh so brief) insurrection, and triumph unfolds. Sturgeon is one of those precious few science fiction writers that elevates the genre above the social stigma hoisted upon it, and he does it with style. This work is not just good science fiction, its great fiction period. His writing style is fluent and dignified. To Marry Medusa is science fiction condensed into its purest, most moving form, and trust me, I know my science fiction. Please, please pick up this book and give it a chance. If you like LeGuin, Blish, Bester or any of the founders of science fiction, you will love this book."},{"Title":"To Marry Medusa","review":"I read this book under its sensational alternate title, \\"The Cosmic Rape.\\"\\"Medusa,\\" a galaxy-spanning hive mind, seeks to extend its realm by seeding space with spores in the hopes that some will land on inhabited worlds. Containing a bit of \\"connected\\" living tissue, consumption of a spore by a local life form would intantly convert the planet's population to Medusa's way of thinking.When a spore falling to Earth is consumed by a alienated, raging derelict, he alone is converted. The book follows his/its efforts to find out why humanity is resistant to Medusa's sway.Meanwhile, we peek into the lives of others, leading typical human (and therefore, for many, unhappy) lives, who will soon play a part in a remarkable drama._To Marry Medusa_ is a sort of defiant, humanist reply to Arthur C. Clarke's _Childhood's End_. A sad and wonderful story."},{"Title":"To Marry Medusa","review":"Dan Gurlick is a pathetic human being, which is undoubtedly why nobody likes him. He has no identifiable positive personality traits, his motivations and desires are base, and he lacks the skills and knowledge to appropriately acquire the things he wants. Life suddenly changes for Gurlick when he accidentally ingests the spore of an alien hivemind named Medusa. Medusa has been all over the universe enfolding the collective minds of the species it finds. When Medusa becomes conscious on Earth, in Gurlick's mind, it's surprised to find that human brains are not connected. Perhaps humans have sensed Medusa's plan and have protected themselves by disorganizing. The hivemind plans to use Gurlick's limited brain to figure out how to put human minds back together so it can engulf them. To get Gurlick's cooperation, Medusa promises to give him whatever his nasty heart desires.Theodore Sturgeon's To Marry Medusa, originally published as the longer novel The Cosmic Rape in 1958, is a not just an exciting hivemind science fiction story, it's also a beautiful but frightening speculation about what life would be like if humans shared a collective consciousness. At first the idea is naturally horrifying, but Sturgeon makes us reconsider by interspersing humanity's response to Medusa with vignettes of several characters experiencing loneliness, loss, lust, jealousy, fear, or budding faith. A group mind could be a powerful thing, but if we all share the same mind, what is the value of one of us?I listened to Blackstone Audio's version of To Marry Medusa, narrated by Stefan Rudnicki who is the reason I chose to read this book in audio format. As always, he does a great job except that I think he said the word \\"unties\\" when he meant \\"unites\\" at one point, though perhaps it was a typo in the book. I wouldn't usually pick on something so seemingly trivial, but those two words have opposite meanings and, in this context, it confused me for a moment.For such an old SF hivemind story, To Marry Medusa is surprisingly fresh and deeply thought-provoking. I'm putting the rest of Theodore Sturgeon's work on my TBR list."},{"Title":"To Marry Medusa","review":"While it's always good to see authors push the limits of fiction, sometimes exceeding the limits can be trying. Sturgeon's novella, while grounded in interesting concepts and ideas, is hard to follow. Just as a reader becomes interested in a certain character, Sturgeon jumps to something completely new. At times, some of the characters's thoughts are presented in a repeating stream of thought that's completely cumbersome. Recommended with reservation."},{"Title":"To Marry Medusa","review":"If you're already a fan of Theodore Sturgeon, you need no coaxing from me buy this book. If you haven't read Sturgeon before, don't hesitate. He's one of the finest writers around and this book is a great introduction to his work."},{"Title":"To Marry Medusa","review":"Readers of \\"To Marry Medusa\\" (or \\"The Cosmic Rape\\" in its longer version) may be interested to learn that in chapter 63 of Kurt Vonnegut's last novel, \\"Timequake\\" (1997) a speech given to the character Kilgore Trout (Vonnegut's parody version of Theodore Sturgeon) was clearly borrowed from Chapter 29 of \\"To Marry Medusa\\" - a meditation on how the human eye and mind can travel from star to star faster than light."},{"Title":"Expanding Empires: Cultural Interaction and Exchange in World Societies from Ancient to Early Modern Times (The World Beat Series)","review":"The second volume in the outstanding Scholarly Resources &quot;World Beat&quot; series, Expanding Empires: Cultural Interaction And Exchange In World Societies From Ancient To Early Modern Times is a selection of profoundly insightful, expertly documented, scholarly essays concerning the changes and legacies that various empires contributed to world history ranging from the influence of Alexander the Great, to the first Imperial Unification of India, to the dynasties of China, and more.

Is genocide a necessary evil? Is love a self-defeating genetic side effect? These are a few of the questions that Patricia Anthony poses in her brilliantly subversive novel, Brother Termite.With breathtaking precision, and awesome subtlety, Patricia Anthony achieves the almost unthinkable; set fifty years in the future in a world where aliens walk freely among us, and seen through the eyes of an extraterrestrial Chief-of-Staff working in the White House, she tells a story of global proportions, and yet manages to keep intact all of the mystery, eeriness, and uncertainty that surrounds the modern UFO phenomenon. And at the same time, her story holds true to virtually all of the folklore and mythology of the contemporary UFO culture. Anthony has done much more than just passionately researched her topic, she has extrapolated upon it, philosophized it, and weaved it into a fascinating and provoking narrative.A novel of alien menace, flying saucers and underground bases, abductions and political intrigue, Brother Termite introduces us to a future that is both abysmally bleak, and at the same time full of hope. We are taken on a futile, yet somehow inspirational journey, and given a first hand look at the tremendous gears turning in Washington, out of sight, far beyond Middle American perception, beyond the common man's control. It is this particular theme, which we find the most innovative, the most horrific, and the most appealing. The fact that the common man is so far removed from the plot, so unaware of the political, Earth-changing, apocalyptic events that surround him and determine his very future. Anthony cleverly turns the tried and true &quot;Everyman&quot; theme on its ear; instead of imbuing a &quot;common man&quot; with heroic qualities, and thrusting him into the thick of predicament, she does the reverse. Anthony's characters are all larger than life, all heroes in their own rights; U.S. President Jeff Womack, alien Chief-of Staff Reen, FBI Director William Hopkins, and even the spirit of JFK. But as the story progresses, we begin to see their humanity, their commonality, exposed. One by one, Anthony's characters fall victim to their own humanistic natures, their own souls. One by one, we see each of these larger than life heroes transformed into Everyman.I highly recommend Brother Termite, not only for those involved in the UFO community, or even the science fiction community, but for anyone with a passion for the dramatic; anyone who seeks the answers to philosophical questions of the heart; or harbors a love of political espionage, or seeks to know what goes on behind the closed doors of the White House; anyone who loves a good mystery, a good thriller, or a good romance. Brother Termite weaves all of these various sub-genres and ideals flawlessly, seamlessly into an imaginative and engaging satire of a world we thought we knew, a world that some of us may have even suspected.I also recommend the novel for those who are interested in the UFO culture and phenomenon. Remarkably Brother Termite holds true to practically all of the mysteries, beliefs, theories, eccentricities, sensationalism and popular history of the UFO enigma. And perhaps even more remarkably, Brother Termite approaches the field with more intelligence and thoughtfulness than much of the non-fiction which has been published, of late. While we are certainly not espousing any hidden truth, or predictive qualities to the work, we do feel that Anthony has approached her topic, in a creative, literary sense, with more level-headed common sense, and comprehension, than many of the scholars, investigators and researchers currently working in the field. She has brought to the phenomenon a much needed breath of fresh air and introspection. Isn't that what art is all about?Masterfully, Anthony combines questions of metaphoric, philosophical, and hypothetical natures in a way that leaves us questioning not her story, but ourselves, and our world. Are we alone here on earth? If not, then what? In creating a world where we are not the only sentient, intelligent race on the planet, Anthony shows us all the more what it means to be human. Is it possible to both love and hate at the same time? Is it possible to commit an act that is at once both good and evil? Patricia Anthony shows us inarguably that the answer is yes, as she not only defines, but portrays, true ambivalence.-Scott C. CarrEditor &quot;The Flying Saucer Gazette&quot;"},{"Title":"BROTHER TERMITE.","review":"Great. It's 20 years I read Sf, maybe even more, but this was really something. Out of alien abduction/Roswell/etc. trash Anthony made a wonderful novel, a good read (once you start you simply cannot stop, not matter what you should do instead of reading) halfway between inspired Sf and well-crafted detective story. And what is really brilliant is the idea that yes, there is a conspiracy, but it's humans who are plotting against aliens--maybe.Do not miss this one. You won't regret the bucks you're going to spend. Wonderful dialogues, great plot, and a lot of action in a rather small space--the White House. You'll learn things about Eisenhower, JFK and Edgar J.

Whether you are a UFO buff or not, it is likely that you are familiar with the \`Greys' (little alien creatures purportedly from Zeta 2 Reticuli). Certainly, Whitley Strieber has gained much attention in his novels delving into alien abductions (Communion was made into a movie).In \`Brother Termite', Anthony explores a fictional account of an extraterrestrial alien society (\`Greys') who have infiltrated to the highest levels of government, and indeed, are the power behind the government (believe me, many people \`out there' believe this has already happened to a certain degree;-). What follows is more of a political thriller than science fiction, but it works nicely on both accounts.Anthony goes inside the alien mind and culture, and presents a fascinating look into the \`hive', their strengths and weaknesses. At stake is not only our government as we know it, but the human race as well. Quickly paced and well thought out, I hope it finds a place on your book shelf. Between 1 and 10, \`Brother Termite' gets a 7."},{"Title":"BROTHER TERMITE.","review":"I read &quot;God's Fire&quot; and &quot;Cold Allies&quot; and enjoyed the author's quirky but brilliant style, especially the way aliens are so epehemeral, on the edge, non-human. In this book, a work that includes humor, mystery and science fiction, she ruminates on politics, culture, the future. The further one delves, the more one understands and admires the hero,(Reen-ja) and his travails.The only word to describe character development (Ms. Anthony's forte) is awesome. The President journeys from pitiful rambling politician to tragic hero. Marian carefully plots the dangerous path that brings betrayal and heartbreak. Reen succumbs to that most human of emotions, love, though he cannot change his nature. A cosmic tragedy awaits the only two sentient races in the Galaxy - humans the termites. These humanoid aliens evolved from insects and as such are hive creatures with allegiance to their Brothers and Cousins. Their life is set at birth (an aside to much like the still-strong Indian caste system). Both termites and humans are losing the ability to reproduce. In the termites case, the vast majority are now born mindless workers.The termites have undertaken to fuse two races into one that will stand the test of time. Experiments begin and children are born. We encounter murder, kidnapping, torture, investigations and surprises. The humor is always present - some of it slapstick but always with an edge. In fact the entire story has a shadowy nervousness as if one were waiting for the other shoe to drop. The commentary on rituals, customs,what it means to be human, are insightful and thought-provoking.The incredible ending with Reen's final thoughts was not only tragic but triumphant, a classic case of martyrdom for our fellow man or in this case, fellow termite. The reader feels a deep sadness mixed with a sudden understanding as we grasp not only his shock but acceptance. The scene of his traitorous brother, attempting desperately to stop the sacrifice, remains with the reader long after the book was closed."},{"Title":"BROTHER TERMITE.","review":"In all the science fiction I ever read (and that's what I mainly read!), I cannot remember reading anything which resembles \\"Brother Termite\\". The plot is so surreal, yet is written with such talent that it totally seems plausible.As for the plot: somewhere in the middle of the 20th Century, Aliens - small, gray skinned with large eyes - have landed on Earth. Using treachery they have gained control of Earth. However, most people don't really realize that the President is really a puppet in the hand of the Aliens, as well as the CIA and the FBI. Most people don't realize that the aliens are also plotting genocide against the human race. The entire story is told from the perspective of Reen, the chief of staff of the white house, and the effective ruler of the planet. Reen is a \\"Cousin\\", which is the word the Aliens use when they refer to themselves. The time is roughly the end of the of the 20th Century, and there is great turmoil in the world. Humans hate the Cousins, and vice Versa. and everybody - Everybody has a secret agenda. It all starts when many \\"Cousins\\" start vanishing and dying. Something is going on, and Reen and his fellows can't understand what is happening. There is definitely a conspiracy, but who is behind it? the CIA? the FBI? other Aliens? You'll have to read the book to find out.I really couldn't put the book down from the moment I started, although I really had to concentrate to fully grasp what is going on. Not all the plot elements are explained, and much is discovered in stages. Many things happen constantly, many small details occur. That's what made the reading fun. It was also nice to see the way the author put real political figures into the plot (J. Edgar Hoover, John F. Kennedy).However, I have rarely encountered such a bleak, depressing book. I recommend science fiction fans who love politics to try this book - but be warned, this is far from light reading."},{"Title":"BROTHER TERMITE.","review":"Haven't read the book, but I can tell you that James (&quot;Terminator&quot;) Cameron bought the movie rights, and that John Sayles wrote a script for it several years ago..."},{"Title":"BROTHER TERMITE.","review":"Powerful aliens who conquer the world are a sci-fi staple.

It took me awhile to figure out that was what she was doing and then suddenly, just like that, it changed the entire way I was reading the book.That angle made me think about what was happening more keenly than I was doing so up to that moment and actually made me go back and start again.

You may enjoy them tremendously."},{"Title":"BROTHER TERMITE.","review":"In this surprising and polished work about politics and ethics, Patricia Anthony has written a book that deserves to be much more widely known and read than it appears to be. If you like smart fiction which plays with genre rules (rather than within them) then I suggest that you hurry and find a copy of Brother Termite.Brother Termite is a story about Reen, an overworked alien bureaucrat in the White House who has to contend with seemingly every problem in the world-- hidden agendas from practially everybody, unreliable friends and lovers, and the annoying ghost of John F. Kennedy. The aliens and humans are caught in a mesh of competing personalities and ethical priorities-- a knotty problem which seems like it could lead to a failure of diplomacy...Anthony has done a very clever thing and written a book which functions very well within both the Thriller and Science Fiction genres without ever actually losing its critical distance from either. It is a rare book that can be satisfying on stock levels (political whodunnit, alien anthropology) while still remaining a cool parody of the books that it is based on and the culture it comes from.Do not read Anthony looking for your typical space opera. Her books are strongly character-based and ultimately more interested in human issues than xenobiology or battles. If you like the work of Mary Doria Russell, Bruce Sterling, or Philip K. Dick then you are probably on the right page for Anthony.(I am sad to note, by the way, that her work seems to be out of print at the time of writing this review. I would stress that it is well worth the extra time and trouble to find copies while they are still available.)"},{"Title":"BROTHER TERMITE.","review":"More of a political and cultural allegorical tale then a straight shooting Sci-fi novel.

As recently as a few years ago, email fundraising appeals were seen as a type of nonprofit spam, even when supporters and list subscribers had opted in to receive communications. Several pioneering organizations have turned this on its head, and Madeline chronicles the experiences of nonprofits such as Human Rights Campaign, Humane Society of the United States, and Earthjustice, who have used passion, good writing, creative design and opportune timing to conduct successful financial appeals from supporters via email.Second, Madeline writes as an insider about many email fundraising campaigns that she has personally worked on. Madeline is the President of Donordigital, one of the leading firms that helps U.S. charities raise money online and mobilize constituents for progressive causes. Considering her day job, she really gives away the store in this book. The book is filled with specific nonprofit examples, real-world case studies, email and Website screen shots, strategy ideas, analytical techniques, and other professional insights.Unlike previous books that were edited compilations of articles from experts in the field, Madeline's book has a cohesive and linear narrative that leaves the reader with a clear roadmap to translate her insights into action.The one critique that I will permit myself is that all the examples in this book are from multi-million dollar nonprofits with communications staff. To Madeline's credit, she acknowledges this point repeatedly, and goes out of her way in the narrative to offer advice to smaller organizations on more limited budgets.Third, and most importantly, Madeline offers truly useful material on raising money online, built around real-world examples and screen shots to help illustrate her points.The chapter entitled \\"It's all about the list,\\" discusses how much online fundraising is really a numbers game, and covers five different strategies for growing an organization's list. The chapter entitled \\"It's all about the timing,\\" brings the numbers game into the real world. \\"If you take no other lesson from this book, remember this one,\\" writes Madeline. \\"To be successful with email fundraising, you must send the right message to the right person at the right time.\\" With the backdrop of September 11, the Asian tsunami and the Katrina hurricane, Madeline reinforces how important timing is when appealing for funds. Other chapters cover email subject lines, how to get through the clutter of supporter's inboxes, good writing, how to craft email fundraising campaigns, how to coordinate email appeal with direct mail and telemarketing, and how to mine email messaging data. At 100 pages, there's no wasted space, and you'll wonder how she packed it all in.Finally, the best thing about this book is how easy it is to read. This is not a technical book, it is not boring. It is filled with Madeline's verve and an infectious attitude that says, \\"here's how we've raised money online for charities across the country.\\"After you've read Madeline's book, you'll be convinced that you can do it too. What are you waiting for?"},{"Title":"The Mercifully Brief, Real World Guide to Raising Thousands (If Not Tens of Thousands) of Dollars With Email","review":"Madeline Stanionis' book delivers on its promise: a short, to-the-point, unpretentious, useful and FUN roadmap for online fundraisers.Online fundraising has been the subject of endless hype, magical thinking, and \\"sage wisdom\\" from authors who have never raised a nickel.

There is a clear path that you need to walk, but at each step you need to make decisions about what will be the best approach for your organization. Stanionis identifies these, gives examples, and stresses their importance. If you skip this extra level of thought, you'll still see results. But if you want real returns, you have to put some energy into it.I've learned this the hard way, and I'm still learning it. There's something to be said for getting in, getting your feet wet, and treading water until you're really ready to make online fundraising a higher priority in your organization. However, as the field matures, and we learn more about what works and what doesn't, you run the risk that your efforts will look amateurish next to those of other organizations. In addition, if you don't pay attention to the results of your efforts, and don't identify things that don't work with your audience, you run the risk of alienating the very folks you're trying to cultivate. Finally, internet time moves w-a-y faster than most non-profits are equipped to run, and if you're trying tomorrow with techniques that worked yesterday, your audience may be unreceptive.With that in mind, I look forward to annual updates from Stanionis on \\"the current state of the art.\\""},{"Title":"The Mercifully Brief, Real World Guide to Raising Thousands (If Not Tens of Thousands) of Dollars With Email","review":"Whether your nonprofit has dived headlong into email fundraising or is still getting its feet wet, this little book should be in the pool with you.Written by a fundraising pioneer who has helped nonprofits of all sizes build really strong email programs, really fast (including The Humane Society of the United States, where I work), the book focuses on results. What's the best way to get high-performing email names? What's a good subject line? Is there a \\"best time\\" to send emails? What are the key metrics to look at when evaluating how your emails are doing?Stanionis writes like she talks -- in a fresh, entertaining, and very direct way. She's peppered the book with screen shots of emails from many organizations to illustrate why a series of emails will outperform a single appeal, or how being creative and \\"speaking from the heart\\" can drive results, or what an integrated online-offline communications strategy can do to boost membership renewals.Best of all, you learn all this in about the time it would take you to read an email -- at least, one that doesn't honor Stanionis' advice to keep your copy \\"simple and short.\\" I'm exaggerating, of course, but just a little bit: This book, so chock full of practical advice, really is mercifully brief.

For a more summary review, and a concentration on the presidency, look elsewhere. Cleaves falls short in providing real personal insight, and in defining political impact of the Jacksonian continuance of the Harrison era. Not an easy read, and not as thought-provoking as one would hope."},{"Title":"Old Tippecanoe: William Henry Harrison and his time (The library of the presidents)","review":"Although only in office for one month as President of the United States, William Henry Harrison's life was filled with one fascinating adventure to the next. From his countless military campaigns, to his administrative experiences as governor of the Indiana Territory, to representative and Senator from Ohio his life touches on many pivotal moments in American history. He was not always revered as a military hero but deserved his accolades as the greatest general since George Washington. He mastered the little known tactics of mass and concentration to deliver a blow against the British and their Indian allies at several battles the most famous being Tippecanoe. Although suffering a set back at the Raisin River Basin, Tippecanoe as he was quickly being called pulled feats Indian diplomacy that showed compassion and forethought depriving Tecumseh of his followers and eventually a military strike at Prophetstown finished them. For those who want to see the western and frontier view of these years in American history this is a great place to start and well worth the time to learn about one of our little known presidents in American history."},{"Title":"Old Tippecanoe: William Henry Harrison and his time (The library of the presidents)","review":"Very thorough book. As Harrison had not much of a Presidency, the book is mostly about his military career. I found it very interesting. The book is well written and the author adds interesting bits of information along the way to keep the reader well entertained. I would recommend this book to anyone trying to get a chronological view of American History and the Presidency."},{"Title":"Old Tippecanoe: William Henry Harrison and his time (The library of the presidents)","review":"As part of our Chronological Read of American History Group, a great deal of discussion went into whether or not to include Harrison since his term was limited to one month after he died in office. I, for one, am gald we included his biography in our read. The main reason is that this read provided the most detailed account of Native American policy to date. This aspect was surprisingly lacking in Meacham's American Lion, yet Cleaves spends about 2/3 of his work on Harrisons involvement. This seems appropriate since Harrison began his work on this issue during Jefferson's administration and retained an important role through the Battle of Tippecanoe during Madison's administration. In addition to the well known military career, Harrison served as diplomat to Columbia and was elected to Congress before being elected President.This is a good overview of Harrison. With my limited knowledge on Harrison I appreciated the introduction. However, there were some infuriatingly weaknesses. This was definitely a broad overview of Harrison with no in-deph analysis of very imporant aspects of his political and personal life. My strongest critique comes with the abrupt ending. A biogrpahy on the first president to die in office deserves some time on succession to the office. There was absolutely nothing provided past Harrison's death. On a lesser note, the reader should be aware that the book was copyrighted in 1939; therefore, some terminology is used that would be seen as poltically incorrect today."},{"Title":"Old Tippecanoe: William Henry Harrison and his time (The library of the presidents)","review":"William Henry Harrison is an historical figure so shrouded in obscurity that beyond the phrase \\"Tippecanoe and Tyler, too\\" few people know anything about him. The author, Freeman Cleaves, undertook the challenge of revealing our eighth President, who served only one month in office. The book was written in 1969.Harrison, by the standard of the times, was an old man by the time he took office. At 68 years old, he was the oldest man to be elected to office until Ronald Reagan 140 years later. Harrison gained fame in presiding as the commanding general in the Black Hawk wars, which had mutated from the War of 1812. Although he was a creditable General, and a respected leader, his reputation was often called into question. One learns in reading of the early Presidencies, that the press was much more unaccountable and reckless than they are today.Harrison served in the Senate, but was dormant in politics for almost two decades before being resurrected as a Whig candidate to challenge an unpopular Martin Van Buren in the elections of 1836 and 1840. He and John tyler prevailed widely in 1840.He is described as a man of the people, who could reach out to many strata of society.Cleaves writing can be lofty, and sometimes slightly hard to follow, yet he has done history a favor by chronicling the life of our eighth President, as there is little documentation of his life or legacy.He also does an outstanding job in explaining the difficult times of Antebellum life and politics. Harrison suffered the loss of several children, was often financially strapped, and fought off the slings of innuendo, character assasination and diminishment of his accomplishments which was common for any public figure of the times.A worthwhile and interesting read."},{"Title":"Old Tippecanoe: William Henry Harrison and his time (The library of the presidents)","review":"I don't have a lot to add to the other reviews, so I will just say this this biography is pretty dated in writing style, devotes precious little space to Harrison's private life, is overly-adoring and a little dry. That having been said, it is the only full biography of Harrison I am aware of (at least, still in print) and, as such, it is well worth reading. But there is definitely an opportunity for an aspiring biographer to make his mark by writing a more modern biography of Harrison."},{"Title":"Old Tippecanoe: William Henry Harrison and his time (The library of the presidents)","review":"This book was quite informative. Of the 13 presidential biographies I have read so far, this one would rate right in the middle of the pack.I do not know though, if a better book on WHH exists.I would not mind reading this book again, and probably will do so in the future.The author is very PRO Harrison, and fails to outline any real faults with the President.I do recommend this book, but it isn't going to be as good as some of the other biographies that are out there for other presidents."},{"Title":"Old Tippecanoe: William Henry Harrison and his time (The library of the presidents)","review":"As others have said, this is about all that there is as a biography regarding WH Harrison. I found the style to be easy to read and while the accounts of Harrison's military experiences go into a lot of detail, the author keeps them interesting. I highly recommend this as a presidential biography of our shortest term President."},{"Title":"Old Tippecanoe: William Henry Harrison and his time (The library of the presidents)","review":"This bio was first published in 1939, so the style is a bit old. But it is still quite readable. As far as I know, it is the only non-juvenile biography of Harrison in print.The author has an excellent grasp of the details of Harrison's career as a general, governor of Indiana Territory, and Congressman. There is not much to say, of course, about his month-long administration, except for the distribution of the spoils.The biggest weakness of the book is the author's tendency to view everything Harrison did in a positive light. For example, Harrison made some major mistakes in his battles that cost lives, yet Cleaves glosses over these issues. Clay and Harrison also seem not to have gotten along well, yet Clay is the one at fault, according to Cleaves.Cleaves also does not clearly explain the turning point in Harrison's career--at age 62 after having left Congress years earlier and while working as a lowly common court clerk to pay off his debts, he somehow became a presidential candidate in the campaign to succeed Jackson. Cleaves attributes it to the widespread reprinting of a letter Harrison wrote defending his generalship during the War of 1812. But he overlooks the question of why it was so widely reprinted. Harrison must have had an organization to get the campaign going--I just can't see it as having been a \\"draft Harrison\\" campaign as he was so far from the political limelight. A fascinating question that Cleaves left untouched.This book contains good material regarding relations with the Indians in the Northwest Territory. Of course, it narrates a lot of tragedy and injustice, but it also gives a dynamic and somewhat sympathetic portrayal of the Indians with whom Harrison dealt. Cleaves describes the different strategies the Indians adopted, ranging from unswerving alliance with the Britith to assimilation into white society. Harrison comes across as sympathetic to the Indians but unwilling to rock the boat to protect them from injustice. I was surprised by the Indians's varying strategies regarding land. Some happily sold, others were pressured into it, and yet others fought to the death. It's not a pretty story and something I'm not proud of as an American, but it's also not the simple story of the white man stealing the Indians' land.Finally, Cleaves says that Harrison died not as a result of a sickness contracted during his inaugural address but as a result of walks in the cold and slush about three weeks later (something Chitwood confirms in his Tyler bio). This is the first time I have read this, but Cleaves has his point well documented. It would be interesting to read an analysis of the origin of this discrepancy.Overall, this book is a good (and probably the only serious) bio of Harrison. You won't really understand his personality or what drove him, but you will gain a good view of his career. And the writing is fairly good as well."},{"Title":"Old Tippecanoe: William Henry Harrison and his time (The library of the presidents)","review":"This book contained everything I could have reasonably hoped to expect from a presidential biography of the subject. Naurally the book tends to gravitate to the early history of Indiana as pertains to Harison, the military acheivements of General Harrison and the Native Americans he encountered. The presidential portion of Harrison's life, I feel was conveyed fully, since this portion of his life was so breif. I particularly appreciated the way the author expanded subjects of American history around Harrison in an effort to better explain the environment and circumstances from which Harrison would have perceived them."},{"Title":"Old Tippecanoe: William Henry Harrison and his time (The library of the presidents)","review":"I enjoyed this book. The majority of the book focuses on WHH's experience as Govenor of Indiana Territory, and as a commander in the war of 1812. The book was written in the 1930's. As is typical of many biographies of its era, little attention is paid to Harrison's family or his personal life. Some may find that a refreshing change from the psychologically based biographies of today. Others may feel that an important facet is missing."},{"Title":"Old Tippecanoe: William Henry Harrison and his time (The library of the presidents)","review":"I am currently reading a bio of every President in order. With the more obscure Presidents of the antebellum era, the task of finding a quality biography becomes a bit more difficult. For William Henry Harrison the choice is extremely easy, as I believe Freeman Cleaves' bio is the only non-juvenile one readily available (a new book about Harrison will be available in October called \\"Mr. Jefferson's Hammer\\", although it does not appear to be a full biography).With my task of selection made simple, I am pleased to say that Cleaves' biography is fully satisfactory and is recommendable beyond the fact that it has a monopoly on the subject. Freeman's biography of Harrison is easy to read, well organized, and is as comprehensive and detailed as I believe most readers will desire.Given that Harrison's Presidency lasted only a month, from the outset of this book I was concerned that I may not learn too much new information about American History. Thankfully, most of this book is dedicated to Harrison's life in Ohio and Indiana and I learned much about frontier life of the early nineteenth century, America's relationship and conflicts with the northwest Indian tribes, and the northern campaigns of the War of 1812 which had not been previously covered in other Presidential biographies that I have read.While Cleaves' bio is not exceptional enough to merit five stars, it is more than adequate for its task and exceeds reasonable expectations of a biography about an obscure President. I strongly recommend it to anyone with an interest in presidential biography or early nineteenth century American and Native American history."},{"Title":"Old Tippecanoe: William Henry Harrison and his time (The library of the presidents)","review":"Okay, the author isn't David McCullough; his writing style isn't THAT good. But very few biographers are, and this one is surprisingly readable especially given that he wrote in the 1930s. Also, he suffers slightly from a tendency to over-lionize his subject, but again, not nearly as much as many authors, particularly from that time period. But this biography's strong suit is that it provides a wealth of information about a president who most Americans know next to nothing about. Some might remember the campaign slogan, \\"Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too\\", and be able to extrapolate from that and the fact that his successor was John Tyler that Harrison's nickname was \\"Tippecanoe\\"; a very few might know that the Tippecanoe in question was a battle at which Harrison fought. A particularly knowledgeable layman might be able to remember or figure out that said battle was in the War of 1812, based on the timing of Harrison's presidency (before the Civil War, well after the Revolution). What I suspect most Americans who would admit to having ever heard of Harrison will remember is that he died of pneumonia 30 days after becoming president, as a result of giving a long inaugural speech in the cold without wearing a hat or an overcoat, and according to this biography, even this piece of information is partially inaccurate; he DID die of pneumonia 30 days after his inaugural, and he DID give a long speech while disdaining a coat or hat, but he didn't become ill for 2-3 weeks after that, so it is doubtful that there is a causal relationship between the two facts.There are biographies that I've read that were more informative and/or better written. But I have never read a biography that did a better job of increasing my knowledge of the subject, because my knowledge of this subject was so small coming in. That is why I give this book five stars rather than four."},{"Title":"Old Tippecanoe: William Henry Harrison and his time (The library of the presidents)","review":"If the reader is interested in a chronological presentation of Harrison's life, this biography may be fine. For those seeking an analysis of his life and times, Cleaves makes several factual errors and contextual omissions in his biography.Cleaves describes Tecumseh, Harrison's principal foe in several battles for control of the Ohio Valley, as a triplet and he claims that Tecumseh's mother was a Creek. Neither is true. Methotasa, born Cherokee, was captured and then adopted into the Shawnee tribe. She married Tecumseh's father in about 1753. Tecumseh was born in 1768, nearly three years before his mother gave birth to the triplets. In order of birth, they were Kumskaka, Sauwaseekau and Lowawluwaysica. It is the third triplet, later called Tenskwatawa the Prophet, and the circumstances of his birth, that Cleaves confuses with Tecumseh.Tecumseh is also described as the Shawnee war chief, which he was not nor ever claimed to be. The Shawnee Nation was divided into five \\"septs,\\" Maykujays, Packuwes, Thawegilas, Kispokothas and Chalahgawthas. Each sept had its specific charge. The Kispokothas were the warrior sept. Tecumseh was Chalahgawtha. Tecumseh, by tribal tradition, was of the wrong sept to ever be considered for the position.To understand Harrison's place in American history, a biography must include an analysis of Harrison's approach to western lands acquisition, his relationship with the several Indian nations and the the broader context of these events in American/European diplomacy.There is certainly a place for a new biography of Harrison."},{"Title":"Old Tippecanoe: William Henry Harrison and his time (The library of the presidents)","review":"Harrison is probably one of the least known presidents. Serving in office for only a month, very little is written about him, and this book was the only volume I was able to find on his life written for adults.It portrays his earlier career as an indian fighter in a very enlightening way, and lets the reader get a feel for the times that is often missed in more conventional biograhpies.I wish the author had spent a little more time on Harrison's home life with his wife and children, but the book does shatter many of the myths surrounding Harrison's life that were published about him during the election of 1840.The biography at times is a little slow, but overall is a good read and is an excllent insight into the 9th president of the United States."},{"Title":"Old Tippecanoe: William Henry Harrison and his time (The library of the presidents)","review":"Verbose, cumbersome, and hardly readable. Cleaves, like many authors of this period, must have felt compelled to overwrite this work so that it would appear \\"scholarly\\" to his contemporary readers. We have a new name for it in the 21st century: Bad. He repeatedly makes reference to characters not previously introduced. After page 200 or so he frequently lapses into what can best be described as listing, in no particular order, strings of otherwise unrelated facts. The only reason to read this book is that there are few if any complete biographies of Harrison's life available, so we must do with what we have. I can only hope that someone will produce a well written treatment of this very interesting figure in the future."},{"Title":"Old Tippecanoe: William Henry Harrison and his time (The library of the presidents)","review":"Though William Henry Harrison is remembered today mainly for the brevity of his presidency, this detail obscures what was in fact a long and varied career. Born to a distinguished Virginia dynasty, Harrison was forced by straitened family circumstances to give up on college and join the United States Army instead. There he enjoyed a meteoric rise, first in fighting in the territorial wars against the Native Americans, then in a series of political posts culminating in the territorial governorship of Indiana. Yet it was his success in the War of 1812 against both Tecumseh and British forces that would ensure his fame. In the years that followed, he won election to the Ohio State Senate and both houses of Congress before his ultimate electoral triumph in 1840.Harrison's life was filled with drama, and Freeman Cleaves's main achievement is in capturing this drama for the reader. He offers a narrative that reflects the excitement of an active career on the American frontier, making a persuasive case for the importance of Harrison's life even after setting aside the trivial nature of his presidency. Primarily a military historian, Cleaves's recounting of Harrison's campaigns are the highlight of the book, and he demonstrates both an eye for the telling quote and a gift for wry understatement that make this book an entertaining read as well as an informative one.Yet Cleaves's book suffers from a number of flaws. While his coverage of Harrison's military exploits is detailed and insightful, the same cannot be said for his depiction of Harrison's political career. Often details are offered with little explanatory analysis, leaving several key questions about his life unanswered. Moreover, the book suffers form the flaws of its age, particularly in its coverage of Harrison's interactions with Native Americans. While readers seeking to learn about this aspect of Harrison's career would be better served by picking upMr. Jefferson's Hammer: William Henry Harrison and the Origins of American Indian Policy, for a comprehensive account of the life of our nation's ninth president this remains the best book to read, largely for the absence of anything better."},{"Title":"Old Tippecanoe: William Henry Harrison and his time (The library of the presidents)","review":"Despite the memorable slogan \\"Tippecanoe and Tyler too\\" and the thirty-day presidency that will forever guarantee him immortality with those who love lists, William Henry Harrison's real importance lies in his service as first Governor of Indiana Territory and as Commander in Chief of the Army of the Northwest during the War of 1812. This well-researched (despite a few inevitable errors) book does a good job of explaining Harrison's contributions in both roles. Possibly Harrison's principal \\"legacy,\\" if that is the word, was the negotiated removal of the Indian tribes from much of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. Cleaves does a good job, borne out by my own reading of the surviving documents, in showing how genuinely sympathetic Harrison was to the plight of the tribes, without, however, ever succumbing to the modern temptation to romanticize them. Harrison was solicitous of the safety of friendly Indians, insisted that his soldiers show mercy to defeated enemies, and if there was anything that especially filled him with fury, it was the refusal of white juries to convict white murderers of Indians, whatever the evidence. Harrison was a hard negotiator, but, with the possible exception of an 1804 treaty at St. Louis made with some bewildered and unrepresentative Sauks, a fair one by the standards of the times. Cleaves makes the point, striking if true, that midwestern Indians who knew Harrison mourned his death soon after his succession to the presidency, since they believed that he would have been a \\"Great Father\\" whose word could be trusted. Coming so soon after the brutal Indian removal policies of Andrew Jackson, this hope may have been a reasonable one. Harrison paid for what he bought, and always prided himself on never having broken his word to an Indian. As a general, Harrison comes across as courageous but cautious, and Cleaves does a good job of describing the now almost unimaginable difficulties of terrain, weather, communications, and supply that bogged down Harrison's counter-offensive in northwestern Ohio during the last months of 1812. Harrison is universally admitted to have been loved and trusted by the soldiers who served under him, and his genuine concern for their welfare led him to devote a much higher proportion of his time to keeping them fed than to leading them onto glory, causing delays that subjected the General to much criticism in the overheated and scurrilous partisan politics of the time. Harrison, however, forever proved his courage in the hour of danger at Tippecanoe, when his camp was overrun just before dawn by attacking Indians, and the General moved calmly throughout the entire battlefield, rallying a still half-sleeping army and doing all that was needed to turn a potential massacre into a battle that was drawn at worst. The men who served under him in the Tippecanoe fight never forgot his heroism that day. Other reviews correctly note that Cleaves does not delve very deeply into Harrison's inner life, and the book is marked, for better or worse, by a refreshing absence of the speculative psycho-babble that disfigures so many modern biographies. Cleaves adopts the more old-fashioned, but perhaps more honest, course of letting the man be known by his deeds. Of the writing, let it only be said that Cleaves was no Macaulay: sentence fragments and run-on sentences abound. Nevertheless, he has an exciting story to tell about a crucial but forgotten era and the patient reader will learn even more about the times in which Harrison lived than about the General himself."},{"Title":"The Thought of Teilhard de Chardin","review":"Emile Rideau gives Teilhard his due in this in depth analysis of the great Jesuit's thought. Rideau, while obviously someone who favors Teilhard, does not get swept away in adulation. This book is a dissection of the entire corpus of work which does not at all shy away from disagreement, challenge, encouragement, comparison with other thinkers, etc. It is always refreshing to read a work so thoroughly objective in its criticism. It is what criticism should be. I gained much in my own understanding of Teilhard, and am grateful to Rideau. I recommend this work to anyone who wants to struggle with Teilhard's thought. This is not a superficial or easy work, but is very rewarding of the effort needed to absorb it.

Each stage of a person's life adds a new dimension to their identity and the experiences of Latino Immigrants contributes to the \\"Latino identity.\\" According to Trueba, Latinos as a whole are creating a new form of participation in US society that is based on the multiple identities that they have that gives them the ability to function in diverse situations.

Her quick wit and carefully-chosen details chronical well the feelings of isolation and observer-looking-in that seem to dog me wherever I land.This is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Killer Cronicas: Bilingual Memories (Writing in Latinidad)","review":"Killer Cr&oacute;nicas asks the following questions, among others:* What is the nature of the exquisitely ambiguous pleasure we experience in passing as members of the local community?* What are the costs of being identified as an insider, or outsider, by members of the communities in which we travel?* How might the experience of being at once inside and outside be specific to pan-Latin and Jewish post-holocaust cultural identity, without regard to location?* How to develop a language limited enough to connote specific geopolitical contexts, yet broad enough to denote the simultaneity in memory of related circumstances separated by distance and time?Killer Cr&oacute;nicas draws from multiple genres, such as the literature of travel in Spanish (cartas de exploraci&oacute;n, of discovery) and in English (here, the Anglo-American category of life-writing, which includes biography, autobiography, and letters, is helpful.) Particulary original is the sustained and studied attention to the traveler's status as a consumer. Underlying the internationalism and bilingualism of Ch&aacute;vez-Silverman's accomplishment is a creativity comparable to Latino performance artists such as Coco Fusco (author of English is Broken Here) Guillermo G&oacute;mez-Pe&ntilde;a, or code-switching poets such as Tino Villanueva.I personally find Gloria Anzaldua's work almost unreadable (there's no rhyme, reason, or inventiveness) while I think that Cherrie Moraga is good for her work's characters and dynamic. In Killer Cr&oacute;nicas what's original is how the writer focuses attention on the relation between what we say and how we say it in one or both languages, showing how the mind moves at the moment of the \\"switch.\\" This work demonstrates a mode of thought familiar to those of us who work in multiple cultural locations, reproducing the habit of thinking in multiple languages. This challenges the hegemonic attitudes about what constitutes linguistic propriety in either Spanish or English by pointing up the complexities of both languages. Also the mixture of languages legitimates a practice that is very widespread: the INVENTIVE use of multiple languages, registers. Read this very contemporary, brilliant book for the puns, for the writer's inspired, faux, alternative, and refused translations. Killer Cr&oacute;nicas is steeped in multiple literary traditions: Argentine, CalifAtzlan, On the Road-Trippers, but most of that incomparable Spanish-language genre that is so definitive in the New World: the Cr&oacute;nica. Let Susana Chavez-Silverman be your guide and you will travel far, far indeed."},{"Title":"Killer Cronicas: Bilingual Memories (Writing in Latinidad)","review":"A fantastic, funny, smart collection of memoirs. You have probably never read anything like it."},{"Title":"Changing Two: Drawings by Michael Leonard","review":"Perhaps it is the &quot;let's get it all in here&quot; mentality of this book of Michael Leonard's drawings that diminishes the overall impact of what could be an elegant homage to a fine artist. Or perhaps it is the scale of reproductions and quality of transfer that makes this inherently tender book seem sterile. But past these deficiencies there is much to savour. Leonard draws beautifully, celebrating the male form in his own vision of honesty of observation that leads to sensually satisfying images. He has been drawing and painting the male figure for years now and few can match his softly lighted men changing and stretching. Others in his class include Wade Reynolds, Paul Cadmus, Charles Beauchamp and Claudio Bravo - each with his signature style making it patently obvious that the time to return to the male nude has finally arrived."},{"Title":"Marriage in the Western Church: The Christianization of Marriage During the Patristic and Early Medieval Periods (Supplements to Vigiliae Christiana)","review":"Marriage is a hot topic right now. And there can be no doubt that marriage is changing--gay marriage, divorce, living together, and plunging fertility rates are all indications of the sweeping changes.It's a good time to consider how western society's beliefs about marriage grew. This book will tell you.The ancient world viewed marriage as existing \\"for the sake of the procreation and education of children\\" (p 15). Augustus, alarmed when the elite procreation rate plunged, taxed the unmarried, while giving a raft of goodies to those who had more than three legitimate children.Roman girls were married young, frequently before menses. Divorce was easy, adultery was viewed as morally indifferent for men, and abortion and infanticide common except among Jews.And then came Christianity. Christian regarded marriage as holy state by which two people could grow together toward God. Adultery? \\"The Latin Fathers...categorically rejected the double standard\\" (p 122) with regard to adultery, an extraordinary action in the ancient world. Some bishops were so rigorous they excommunicated adulterers, male or female.Christianity took marriage far more seriously than any of the ancient civilizations. Divorce was forbidden and so was remarriage. \\"Not only does a man who remarries after divorcing his wife commit adultery, Ambrose argues, but his crime is all the more serious because he has sought legal justification for his sin\\" (p 126). Tertullian even felt that the widows ought not to remarry.Christianity regarded marriage as a profound and important union. A man and woman entered into a covenant bond in marriage, not a relationship. God had invented marriage for the good of both the man and the woman. \\"Augustine's theory of the sacrament of marriage is the premise that marriage is indissoluble in the Church\\" (p 281). Marriage was regarded as honorable because it was a figure or type of Christ's union with the Church. Temporal marriage was a little version of the great union.There is a long and interesting chapter on the Matthean exception and the whole \\"porneia\\" problem, as well as a discussion of consummation and how it came to be regarded as integral to marriage. Status issues and questions about cousins marrying are also included."},{"Title":"When We Were Very Young","review":"I had to read this for a little while before I got to a poem I really liked. The first 10 or so poems just seemed incomplete to me. \\"Independence\\" caught my eye first. In very few words it pretty much tells us adults that our kids are going to do what they want, despite all the things we say. It's followed by the wonderful poem \\"Nursery Chairs\\" where a child pretends the chairs in his house are different things. Then after \\"Nursery Chairs\\" is another strong poem, \\"Market Square\\" where we learn that there are things all around us in nature that we don't need to get from the market.\\"Disobedience\\" is another interesting poem. It's kind of a role-reversal story about a kid whose mother disobeys his orders to stay away from the end of town, and she gets lost as the result of her disobedience.\\"Spring Morning\\" emphasizes the beauty of nature to us, saying, \\"It's awful fun to be born at all.\\" Next is \\"The Island\\" which has a wonderful closing message that screams, \\"God made it all - FOR US!\\" to me.And there are so many other joyous poems in this quick read too. There's \\"Jonathan Jo,\\" \\"Rice Pudding,\\" \\"The Wrong House,\\" \\"The Dormouse and the Doctor\\" (which has some terrific rhythm), a very touching \\"Little Bo-Peep and Little Boy Blue,\\" \\"The Invaders,\\" \\"If I Were King,\\" etc., etc.But perhaps my favorite poem in the collection is \\"Halfway Down\\" which is about nothing more than sitting on stairs. Man, if someone can take such a simple act and make it so astoundingly wondrous, then that person truly must be one of the greatest writers ever."},{"Title":"When We Were Very Young","review":"This is one very good book and can be enjoyed by people from 2 to 92.

With a font reminiscent of the original, and Ernest H. Shepard's gently colored illustrations similarly-placed amid the text, this book is a joy to handle and peruse. Of course, this volume lacks the pencil and crayon embellishments that my sisters and I added to our mother's original edition, but the soft and urgent messages - and all the pleasures - have been beautifully preserved for a new generation.

The real test of a reader's poetic prowess is A.A. Milne, the living room couch and a handful of kids waiting for your renderings of growling bears and timelessl human characters.It takes an extraordinary book to capture children's attention on the strength of words alone.It's not that there are no illustrations here, just that each poem has just one or two small, original ink drawings; delightful, but bowing appropriately to the genius of words that can hold children spellbound. For instance, Milne takes a subject like sidewalks and transforms it into the stuff of playacting in Lines and Squares - an irresistible cadence to chant on a walk (or a lumbering gait):And the masses of bearsWho wait at the corners all ready to eat the sillies who tread on the lines of the streetAnd I say to them, \\"BEARS.....Just look how I'm walking in ALL of the squares!\\"As I read I can now recall the precise inflection and finger-shaking combination from Disobedience that it took to elicit giggles from my sisters and me, now working its comedy on my four-year-old son:James James SAID to his mother, \\"Mother\\", he said, said he;\\"You Must Never Go Down To The End Of Town If You Don't Go Down With ME!\\"When We Were Very Young is a collection of poems for children, about childhood, and for those who wish to remember its special magic view on the world. This book is a beloved tradition in my family, starting with those cozy evenings on my Grandmother's couch as we all snuggled up to hear about the brownie that lives behind the curtain, Jonathan Jo (who had a mouth like an O), the three foxes and Christopher Robin, who couldn't stop his hoppity hop.

As I read my favourites to my son, I can almost hear Dad reading them to me.I am thrilled that my son asks for Christopher Robin as his bedtime stories and &quot;Hoppity&quot; and &quot;Market Square&quot; have become his favourites too.

This is not a book for the casual reader expecting romance and flowery words. This is a hardcore, in-your-face saga of a young man's difficult life."},{"Title":"Tattoo","review":"Earl Thompson's books are written to reach the slum and dirtyminded people of America. If he writes books like that it's probally'cause he thinks the same way about life sex and women. Acttually that is all he thinks about &quot;women&quot;. You can't go thru two pages of the book without bumping into some sexual explicit comment or thought. It's definitlly not a reading that I would recommend to anyone.Claudia Cox"},{"Title":"Tattoo","review":"&quot;Tatoo&quot; is the second book in Earl Thompson's sweeping tale of a young man coming of age in the underside of the 1940's. This is my favorite of all three, and the one that received the most media coverage in its first publishing.Thompson wasn't afraid to write of the people he knew, and the characters he created are never one-dimensional -- they eat, sleep, drink, fight, and indulge in sex. This is what life was really like for so many hard-working people during the WWII era, despite the rosy message musicals of that time force-fed the public.Steinbeck, Faulkner, and Dreiser are lauded as great novelists for their accurate display of human plight. Thompson is no less prolific and realistic, but because of his depiction of raw sex, I'd bet his novels will never be taught in any public school. The stark sexual themes -- including incest and rape -- will offend the masses but will never appeal to the &quot;Debbie Does Dallas&quot; set. Still,his protagonist is so real and the story so fun that this ranks high on my &quot;Top 10 read every year&quot; list."},{"Title":"Tattoo","review":"...that will touch all of your emotions. Written with a unique flair for exposing those rare nuggets of truth, Earl Thompson transcends generations and can easily be placed within this revviewer's list of the top fifty American authors of all time. While his subject matter may disconcert and jangle an individual's view of relationships, sex, military service and the odessy of living in America, one cannot help but be drawn in to Thompson's eloquence and story telling mastery. Whether on the far left, extreme right or just plain in the middle of the road, I strongly recommend you reward yourself with this fine read!"},{"Title":"Tattoo","review":"feel the hunger in your belly, have a sense of desperation in your soul. Not many novels alow me to let go and put myself in the place of the main character, but this one does.

A true tradgedy that Mr. Thompson is no longer with us. Highly recommended, but not for the prudish or politically correct. A must read."},{"Title":"Tattoo","review":"Earl Thompson writes about life, where the meat hits the street, and where skin hits the sheet. This is not a book for the high-brow panty-waist looking for intellectual enlightenment. This is one of the boldest american novels ever written. Thompson has been where his characters go, and he brings that bawdy existence, not just to the reader, but to a level of literature that outshines most of the crank that reaches the best seller lists today. Highly recommended, entertaining, thought provoking...a novel that drips with the juices of growing up in the USA."},{"Title":"Tattoo","review":"Having worked for many years in the navy, reading books has occupied a great deal of my time. The first occasion on which I read the book tattoo, I was struck by the sheer depth to the charachters that enabled these american individuals in an alien culture to my own, to be brought to life and appreciated by myself, an english sailor. I have read the book many times since and will continue to do so in the future. Along with Orwell's 1984, it is my favourite."},{"Title":"Tattoo","review":"I read this book in 1979...I'd been backpacking through Europe for a few weeks and I was poor and terribly lonely. I missed my home, and I missed having friends, I missed cheeseburgers and television and l missed speaking and reading the language. I saw the book in a kiosk, and anyone who read this edition will know why it caught my eye: the cover consisted of a hand bearing a navy tattoo upon its back, its middle finger upraised. I liked the brazenness of it, and in addition to that it was thick, and that meant for the price of one purchase I would have this as my companion for some time.I immediately discovered, however, that if I were looking for something that reminded me of my own home, or my own upbringing, I had made an error in judgement. Earl Thompson's novel was the story of a boy growing up in America, but it was a different America than the one in which I had grown up. And, just as quickly, I realized that this story of that boy, Jack Anderson, was unlike any other story I had ever read; it recounted a youth spent in squalor and decadence, nurtured by no one except a rundown whore in a rundown trailer with a rundown life.But oh, how \\"Tattoo\\" thrilled me--it was searing and squalid and frightening in its honesty, its unsparing portrait of a boy whose youth was a vessel so empty that he would let anything fill it, who was so eager to do anything that would matter, that would rescue him from his foul pre-WWII Kansas childhood, that even yearning to be a killing machine in the armed forces would be an improvement. THAT, at least, would be something. THAT would be leaving a mark.As brutal as this narrative can be at times, it was continually compelling. Reading this novel can startle you into realizing how much detail has been left out of other books you've read. For those who follow literary genres, file this one under Naturalism: the protagonist is struggling against an unfeeling universe that scarcely knows he's alive, and wouldn't care even if it did. Naturalistic stories are usually gritty, but this one is as blunt as they come.\\"Tattoo\\" is unsentimental and epic and hard-edged; while it might be said that there is almost nothing to admire about anyone in the novel, its tough, violent, unapologetic narrative portrait is almost impossible to ignore, like the scene of a crime, or an accident. You can't help but watch, and what you see will surely likely rattle you. You will find it almost impossible to be complacent about it.At close to 700 pages of dense type, it's a sweeping epic tale full of gritty realism, violence, rape, incest--it's hard to say that this protagonist is likeable, but after reading this amazing story, you can never say you don't understand him.This novel comprises the second of a narrative trilogy, with \\"A Garden of Sand\\" and \\"The Devil To Pay\\" as bookends, but you would have to look far and wide to find a book better written work than this one, one that is more honest, less clich&eacute;d, more intense.FYI: \\"A Garden of Sand\\" was nominated for the National Book Award, and deservedly so. But don't say I didn't warn you: \\"A Garden of Sand\\" is perhaps even more brutal, and as scathingly candid a book as you will ever read. It might some more pristine critics to realize that \\"Tattoo,\\" the second of the trilogy, was chosen for the Book of the Month Club (\\"The Devil To Pay\\" was published posthumously.) It's just a pity author Thompson was taken from us at such a young age: it is highly likely that his novels would be huge today were he to have kept turning them out. He died in 1976, three years before I discovered \\"Tattoo,\\" and even then I had never heard of him.Read his book, however, and you'll remember him forever."},{"Title":"Tattoo","review":"Simply put, this is one of the greatest novels ever written.

This is not a book for the high-brow panty-waist looking for intellectual enlightenment. This is one of the boldest american novels ever written. Thompson has been where his characters go, and he brings that bawdy existence, not just to the reader, but to a level of literature that outshines most of the crank that reaches the best seller lists today.

Thompson is not for the squeamish for he reports everything (and experiences it, too) in magnificent detail. In the liner bio he says he is &quot;of the people&quot; of whom he writes, and the stark sense of disenfranchisement and moral futility that permeates him and his &quot;people&quot; (and many of the rest of us) is apparent wherever Jack finds himself in his global journey. Without question, he captures the sense of being &quot;American&quot; without ever resorting to cheap parody or overblown historical contrivance.

I didn't expect to read anything special when I bought it, just the usual ET/UFO book. As soon as I started reading the book, I knew it wasn't your usual UFO book. I finished the book in about 2 days. Subsequently, I bought all of Tom Dongo's books, and overall, I thought Merging Dimensions was the best. Now I'm hooked on the subject.

I've spent dozens of hours reading about the topics of Ufology, psi, cryptozoology, etc., enough to know that these are much, much more than : imagination, hoax, alien encounter(s). I've seen three UFOs myself and I know I wasn't imagining them but I don't really understand what they 'are'. I've had psi related experiences my entire lifetime. (I've never seen a bigfoot or a mothman, but boy would I like to lol). \\"The Trickster and the Paranormal\\", George Hansen, discusses in depth what these phenomena are (and are not); \\"Merging Dimensions\\" gives the reader as close to a first-hand look as possible without actually being there. I found that I did NOT have to suspend belief one bit since I actually have educated myself regarding the nature of these phenomena. Some of the photographs are hard to decipher but WOW that \\"portal\\" is amazing. It reminded me of a screen against a wall in a dark room, the sort projectors used to view slides (back in the good old days before digital photography).That part of the book written by Tom Dongo presented his conjectures (at the time the book was written, 16 years ago) regarding the nature of these phenomena. I don't agree with some of what he says and there are explanations for other of his statements. Since we now know that consciousness can effect result in measurement on the quantum level, we can postulate that the same effect is seen on other levels. On page 104, Mr. Dongo says \\"However, the incredible light retreated quickly away from the group when one of the six people became hysterical with fear. Fear drives these lights, or life forms, away.\\" Fear disengages cognition, and it's contagious: if the man next to me becomes hysterical, I will react without control (it's a fight/flight mechanism, can't be reasoned away instantly) and, when that happens (when the other people's autonomic reactions kick in as a response to the hysterical man), cognition \\"flies out the window\\" and if our consciousness is in any way related to the phenomenon, without cognition it is rendered moot.One thing I do agree with is his following statement, \\"Reading and listening to everything of pertinence is the only way we can build a database for the internal guidance system to decide what is relevant and what isn't. Because of ignorance or a lack of information, some of the world's most entrenched beliefs and institutions were created thousands ofyears ago by a few who had in mind only power and profit. It's been proven that many of these beliefs have no verifiable historic record outside of the original document or decree itself. many of these dictums survive basically intact, even now.\\" Accurate analysis of so many strongly held belief systems; people seem incapable (and unwilling) to let go of them. This is pure fear, of the unknown, and of stepping away from the herd mentality.I don't fool easily and I AM no fool.

Although I'm not Chinese, I'm very closely related to a few Chinese people. The casual, popular bigotry on display in these pages is chilling. At the same time, the stories themselves are generally good. The author has a sort of covert admiration of the Chinese - especially Chinese women - that seems to drive him to write about them, but in a very prejudiced way. Looking past the throwback stereotypes, the stories are uneven. Some of the stories are startlingly good, containing a well-developed sense of irony.

This was not a smart place to put it. Not only that, but instead of using straightforward C code directly in the example, he all of a sudden wraps ODBC calls in a C++ class, which just serves to muddy the overall picture.

Perhaps today the editors would include more First Nations people among the writers. For me, as a schoolboy, the book didn't really start hopping till I read some of Bliss Carman and Archibald Lampman.

As to me"},{"Title":"Look Back in Anger","review":"You'll never meet a more unique character than Jimmy Porter, a 20-something British Archie Bunker. He's filled with rage at the absence of ... something ... and spews forth venom, sarcasm and utter misery relentlessly. Sounds horrible, right? Well, it's fascinating. I couldn't put it down, and I'd like to see the current revival of the play in NYC. I've seen a few people like Jimmy Porter, people who have so much potential, energy and creativity, yet for one reason or another it's all squandered. They fail to surround themselves with people of equal passion, and the result is that they hurt the ones around them, who are more at peace with themselves. The question is, how does someone so young get this way?"},{"Title":"Look Back in Anger","review":"Writer John Osborne presents in Look Back in Anger an antithesis to the \`drawing room dramas' of the period by writers such as Noel Coward which were popular in the 1950's. These dramas often featured polished and wealthy characters from the middle and upper classes, at their leisure within their homes and drawing rooms. Such plays fuelled what one newspaper reviewer from \`The Express' termed as the \`Illusion of Comfort' which pervaded the 50's.After reading or watching Osborne's play no one can argue that he was under such an \`illusion'. The play can be seen as a reaction both against the \`drawing room' dramas and the general society which they represent. Rather than a drawing room with wealthy characters, Osborne selected as his setting a cramped and dismal one attic apartment and filled it with rough down and out lower class characters that were in so0me cases seen as uncivil for the theatre. Their language was coarse, their setting was harsh but worst of all to the original audience of this play (which no doubt had drawing rooms of their own) these characters presented to them a world which was uncomfortably realistic. It is this realism which may account for the fact that many viewers initially did not like Osborne's play as they did not like the world that it presented.Jimmy Porter, the eternally angry young man who believes that he has life potential beyond being a sweets salesman is frustrated by the notion that he is never given the opportunity by society to fulfill this potential, he can never pull himself up from his social position, he is effectively \`stuck.' The sense of being trapped in a monotonous cycle that he cannot break free of is reflected in the setting of the play, the fact the entirety of the action occurs within the small and confining attic/ apartment, and that each of the three scenes opens in an identical fashion further underlines the notion of monotony, of being static. Jimmy (like most of a whole generation) where raised on socialist principles yet when this generation emerged into the real world, they frustratingly discovered that the class system was still intact. Look Back in Anger explores this frustration, the agony of being promised potential (through things such as Jimmy's university education) and then to have that potential snuffed out by a society which is not yet ready to let go of its class hierarchy.No doubt many readers will find this play disturbing or at the very least depressing, as the notion of being trapped in a dead end job or a situation where ones potential is not being fulfilled or even recognized is a common fear in modern society. Even though Look Back in Anger is very much so a play of its time, the themes that it traverses still has resonance in contemporary society, one only has to take note of the number of university educated waiters and barman to draw a modern analogy or parallel."},{"Title":"Look Back in Anger","review":"\\"Look Back in Anger\\", first performed at London's Royal Court Theatre in 1956, is often cited as marking a theatrical revolution. The British theatre of the early fifties, dominated by playwrights like Noel Coward and Terence Rattigan, was widely regarded as genteel, well-mannered and middle-class. John Osborne's play can be seen as a deliberate reaction against those values. Its plot is conventional enough. It centres around the stormy marriage of a young couple, Jimmy and Alison Porter, who separate after a series of quarrels. Unknown to Jimmy, Alison is pregnant at the time, and he starts a relationship with her best friend Helena, an actress. Six months later Alison, having lost her baby, returns, and Helena ends her affair with Jimmy so as to allow the couple to be reunited.What was shocking about the play was its social setting and the attitudes displayed by the characters, especially Jimmy. He is from a working-class family and, although he has a university degree, has turned his back on the sort of well-paid white-collar job that such an educational background would normally have led to in the fifties, working as a trader in the local market, running a sweet stall with his friend Cliff. He and Alison, with Cliff as a lodger, live in a dingy bed-sit in a large Midlands town. Alison herself is from the wealthy upper middle classes (her father is a retired Indian Army officer) and her family resent her marriage to Jimmy.It was in the late fifties that the term \\"Angry Young Man\\" was coined by the critics to describe not only writers such as Osborne, Kingsley Amis and John Braine, but also their characters such as Jimmy Porter and Amis's Lucky Jim, who were seen as the mouthpieces of their creators. Jimmy is, to borrow the title of a famous film of the period, a rebel without a cause.In another Osborne play from around the same period, \\"An Epitaph for George Dillon\\", the hero, himself a playwright, is advised by his agent to cut out the long speeches from his latest play, which are seen as being \\"too Bernard Shaw\\". This is not advice which Osborne took himself, although the passionate, emotional \\"Look Back in Anger\\" is very different in style to Shaw's plays, which at times can read like extracts from the proceedings of a debating society. Jimmy gives vent to his feelings in a series of long, angry speeches. (As Osborne himself was to point out, there is something formal about these speeches, which he likened to operatic recitative).In these speeches, Jimmy attacks the state of British society, and often takes the opportunity to have a go at Alison and her family (especially her mother) whom he sees as part of the traditional British ruling class. He is instinctively suspicious of any form of authority and of the establishment. He is hostile to religion and to the growing \\"never had it so good\\" conservatism of fifties Britain. He does not, however, himself really subscribe to any alternative system of values such as Communism or Socialism. A frequent theme of his complaints is that there are no longer any good causes to fight for; he envies his parents' generation who could fight the anti-fascist battles of the thirties and forties. (His father was a veteran of the Spanish Civil War).Jimmy's relationship with Alison is a complex one, perhaps best expressed by the clich&eacute; that they can neither live with one another nor without one another. On the one hand, the differences in their personalities and their social backgrounds is the cause of constant friction between them. On the other, they have a deep emotional need for one another, shown by their game of \\"bears and squirrels\\". To an outsider such as Helena this is mere sentimental whimsy; to them, it is a way of expressing their mutual love.One reviewer complains that Osborne had a \\"tin ear\\" for dialogue and quotes some of Helena's lines in support of this complaint. The problem lies not with the playwright's \\"tin ear\\" but rather with the fact that some people have tin voices. There are plenty of people in Britain, especially from Helena's upper-middle-class stratum of society who speak in precisely that stilted, formal tone of voice as a substitute for feeling. In the fifties there were probably even more.Although it had enthusiastic supporters such as the critics Kenneth Tynan and Harold Hobson, \\"Look Back\\" was highly controversial when it was first produced, being too shocking for many critics and theatregoers in the fifties. Today it has largely lost its power to shock, kitchen-sink realism, bad language and anti-establishment opinions having become commonplace in the theatre over the last fifty years. Nevertheless, when well produced its emotional power and sincerity mean that it can still be an impressively memorable experience in the theatre."},{"Title":"Look Back in Anger","review":"Osborne, the great so-called radical, grew to be a reactionary, full of ideas about 'England' and her past glories. He aged into the image of what his protagonist Jimmy Porter ranted against. Should we be surprised, or was Jimmy Porter headed in this direction? Everyone, according to Jimmy, is a fake, but who would embody the real thing if he were to come along? When were things better, if today is so bloody awful? Playwright David Hare created a female version of this type of nasty negativity in his play \\"Plenty,\\" about the sour ex-spy who couldn't adjust to post war life, also known as peace time. She had had the time of her life passing messages and getting knocked up on quick overnights to France. Too bad the war couldn't have been prolonged for her entertainment. Jimmy and Hare's Susan deserve each other. Most American parents have met this sort. At about 13 most kids get grouchy and start hating everything and everybody. It was brilliant of Osborne to have introduced the middle-aged tantrum-thrower to the theater, it must have been thrilling theater back in the day, but does it hold up? After five decades this sort of dim-witted, passive disgruntlement grows terribly stale. As for theater, my sense is that Noel Coward will fair better in the history books and, more importantly, on the stage. In fact, the sort of theater Osborne criticized has come back strong. The fact is that by growing into a caricature of himself, he only proved how witless and vapid his stage character has always been. He was a paralyzed blow-hard, a wind bag."},{"Title":"Look Back in Anger","review":"Saw the branagh/thompson/dench DVD version of this play at 24, and again just now at 44. It has not lost any of it's brutality for me, but a 20 year separation has made a vast difference in my view of it. The first time I couldn't really understand why Jimmy was so brutal, or why Allison was so withdrawn and passive. As far as these two go, the play isn't so much about social classes per se, as the way social class distinctions can cut us off from the empathy that we need to be able to give and receive. Jimmy and Allison's problem(s) are exactly the same problem. The end of the play proves it for me, and I could see the light bulb go on for each of them."},{"Title":"Look Back in Anger","review":"\\"Look Back in Anger\\" is about a young man, Jimmy, a working-class stiff/passionate philosopher. Jimmy treats his wife and best friend, Cliff, terribly, and in real life he would be insufferable, but on paper (and on stage, I'm sure) he's pretty engaging. His dialogue was well-written, but when it came to the other characters, author John Osborne has a real tin ear. Here's a young woman, Helena, advising Jimmy's wife to get out of the marriage:\\"Alison, listen to me. You've got to make up your mind what you're going to do. You're going to have a baby, and you have a new responsibility. Before, it was different--there was only yourself at stake. But you can't go on living in this way any longer.\\"Perhaps this would sound convincing in the hands of a skilled actress, but on paper it reads like a bad translation. The play is full of excerpts like this--Osborne is also one of those writers who clumsily inserts exposition into the mouths of his characters, often.The play is best and most shocking when Jimmy's brutality is on full display. I'm sure some readers see him as a romantic character, and this idealization may account for the play's acclaim. It is not bad, but I think it's overrated."},{"Title":"Look Back in Anger","review":"Look Back in Anger is an autobiographical play by John Osborne.

He has no redeeming characteristics at all (unless one wants to say he is \\"honest\\" with his feelings), and ranges from detestable to pathetic (his lame attempts at \\"bears and squirrels\\" cutesy talk with his wife, for example).Why is he so angry? How is it that such a person has not one but two women fall in love with him and leave all for his sake? What is the point of people sitting through this? Apparently, none of these questions require more than superficial explanation.A number of elements in the play feel contrived. I understand that for the stage you have limitations, but here we have a friend of the family hooking it up with Jimmy not five minutes after his wife leaves him. Sure, okay.Contrary to what many reviewers of Osborne's day claimed, The dialogue is sub-par and stilted. Every character continually shares his innermost feelings in a hostile environment where they are constantly belittled.Every character in the book is miserable on some level. No doubt this was extremely cathartic for Osborne, but it's just unpleasant for everybody else.NOT RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"Look Back in Anger","review":"This book is great.

I have only used Beckwith's book to explore two areas: the Emerald Creek garnet area up north, and the Silver City mining district down in the SE corner. I had mixed luck in both places, but mostly good. Generally, his information is standing the test of time fairly well.I had a hard time comparing Beckwith's old hand-drawn maps with the current realities on the ground, for example. I didn't find any cassiterite near Silver City, but there were so many nails in the gravel road we were fixing flats instead of panning Jordan Creek. Also, when touring several of the old mines there, I didn't collect any real good quartz crystals. I wonder if the area has just been picked over?Overall, Beckwith did a pretty good job. His field trip maps are the true value of the book. Some of the general discussion is just too vague for me, but that could just be me.

Viel Erfolg!"},{"Title":"Some Mountains Removed","review":"I've read this book about four or five times. And now I'm beginning to think I had the whole thing wrong when I started.Fanny Howe's blurb on the back of the book, I'm afraid, does Bouchard no favors. I don't see how the \\"rhetoric of new poetry (\\"Hades faces environmental crises\\") is at ease with both beauty and corruption\\"? How is that true in the case of the poems of SOME MOUNTAINS REMOVED? I don't remember a book less at ease with corruption, and hardly inured to beauty enough to be at ease with it. Probably I am misunderstanding Ms. Howe and maybe she is attacking the rhetoric of new poetry which she finds elsewhere.Rachel Blau DuPlessis is closer to the mark when she begins her blurb by accenting the \\"dynamic\\" of Bouchard's writing. \\"Melville tells us there is nothing/ more insignificant/ than having a book of poems published\\" is the way one of the poems starts out (\\"Christmas is Bombing\\"). Perhaps in the face of total war our publication records so fade into insignificance, but in the meantime sharp-eyed readers will notice and admire the line breaks after \\"nothing,\\" \\"insignificant\\" and \\"published,\\" in which the mood moves from a nihilism than to a questioning, and then to a transcendence above subpress's \\"delicious irony.\\" Many of Bouchard's forebears in the original American Renaissance, which we first noted in his 2000 volume DIMINUTIVE REVOLUTION, speak even more directly here, as though long apprenticeship to his ghosts has loosened his throat: Melville, Hawthorne, Poe, Emerson, Thoreau and Dickinson.To George W. Bush he offers this toast: \\"You should be/ Pitied like any puppet, one protected,/ Picked and placed into power, surrounded/ By power, lifted by the power of/ An activist court: a made power.\\" Sometimes the ferocity of Bouchard's direct speech goes astray, and there are perhaps one or two too many mournful poems about \\"fibrillating\\" New England landscapes, but he is never close to being the \\"boring sponge\\" he fears he is. There's a refusal in him that's like a lightning rod. Stern and steadfast, his poetry won't budge even in the shock and awe of a deceptive downeaster. \\"It must be quite a storm.\\""},{"Title":"Ready...Set...English! 225 Ready-to-Use Starter Activities for Grades 6-12","review":"What a great book!

With the the Book of Job as a framework, Martini considers suffering, various Christian responses to suffering, and how we can react to the trials of life. He alternatively probes Job's character, considers third world suffering and our response to it, ponders human knowledge about self and God, and helps us to follow Jesus's trials to live as did Jesus.Throughout the book, he ties together various others' analyses of the challenges that Job presents, referring to such diverse thinkers as Catholic liberation theologians and evangelical Protestants. A typical example of the depth of his meditations is his final one: He compares Job's &quot;unwearying search for divine justice ... and the way human beings can understand it&quot; with &quot;The Song of Songs's unwearying search for love ... and the joy [the presence of the beloved] brings.&quot; I'd never heard the two compared before, but I delighted in the parallels he revealed.In each chapter, Martini demonstrates miraculous wisdom and balance in considering difficult challenges in one's Christian life. His discussion of coping with a restless mind not only led me to better appreciate and balance Martini's continual emphasis on dialogue and an exchange of views with others, as evidenced by his Belief or Non-Belief? (written with Umberto Eco) or his thoughts about the role of doubt, but most important, it proved to be great pastoral advice for such people as me with a wandering mind.Throughout the book, Martini's comparisons with other biblical passages, from both Old and New Testaments, prove extraordinarily creative and dynamic. He considers Job from diverse perspectives, all with the aim to guide one's meditations on the Bible and to richen one's spiritual life."},{"Title":"Perseverance in Trials: Reflections on Job","review":"Like most of us I have experienced numerous trials in my life, some of them very difficult to endure. What has been tough is finding good written resources to help me meditate, put my troubles into perspective, and spiritually endure. Perseverance in Trials is such a resource. Carlo Maria Martini must have lived through some rough times to provide the insights I find in this book.Perseverance in Trials presents 137 pages of meditations and homilies given at a four day retreat for priests. Cardinal Martini provides meditations on scriptures in the book of Job, and applications that focus upon understanding and applying the lessons of Job to our lives.Martini provides a great many insights into the book of Job and human suffering in general. His advice and exercises are very helpful in dealing with our trials in this life. I am reluctant to attempt a review, however I must hope others share the Cardinal's insights. He offers three notions I will discuss: acceptance, submission, and perseverance.Cardinal Martini suggests that everyone faces trials. Suffering is part of human existence. Facing my trials can lead to a more peaceful life. He also indicates that how I react to unmerited suffering can reveal what I truly am. Carlo Maria Martini counsels that when I am in a situation of suffering, I usually first challenge the situation. \\"Why me LORD\\". \\"How can I possibly endure all this pain or grief?\\" Next I react with anger, sometimes becoming angry with others or with God. Then I question the situation \\"What does it mean\\" and \\"why do I continue to suffer?\\". Finally I may long for death. The book says that God expects these reactions and that historically Hebrews prayed songs of lament to express their feelings about their problems. Such lament helps process the suffering.I must learn to accept my trials. Acceptance appears to be a vital reaction for my spiritual growth. Initial acceptance is often not enough. Continued suffering can wear on my faith. Martini talks of a \\"mysterious submission\\" that with God's grace can sustain us in long suffering. As his troubles increase, Job clings to his trust in the LORD, but wonders if his trust in the LORD will remain.Martini advises that after accepting my life and submitting to any suffering I experience, I could encounter further difficulty. While still suffering with my problems, I may begin to reflect on my situation and encounter the \\"worst trial of all.\\" As long as the pain remains, I must continue to accept and submit day after day. This perseverance is very hard. I may realize that I gave my initial acceptance and submitted to this situation, however I am not in control. I must trust in my Lord and surrender to His control.Perseverance in Trials is an vital book. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Perseverance in Trials: Reflections on Job","review":"This is the third book that I have read by Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, and he is by far the most spirtually insightful writer I've found.His writing is often punctuated with short lists - two or three items where be reduces the essence of his exceptionally deep and well thoughtguidance. Each page of this book is a real nugget. It took me a few weeks to get through this - a couple pages at a time, even though it is ashort book. I learned from this book of the Philokalia and the Eastern Orthodox Desert fathers. I particularly remember Cardinal Martini usingthis as an example of deluding ourselves with our thinking in those pre-dawn minutes when we first awake and the mind plays many tricks anddelusions on our thinking. Cardinal Martini uses a beautiful and poetic prose in conveying very profound insights he has into our human lifesand temptations. He is an incredibly gifted spritual leader.My God bless Cardinal Martini - he passed away on Friday, August 31, 2012 at Aloisianum, a Jesuit institute in Gallarte, Varese province,Italy. His funeral will be Monday, September 3, 2012 at the Catherdral of Milan Italy. Approximately August 8, 2012, he gave his a finalinterview to reporters from Corriere della Sera, an Italian paper. In it he was quoted \\"[European and American] culture has aged, ourchurches are big and empty and the church bureaucracy rises up, our rituals and our cassocks are pompous. ... The Church has remained 200years behind the times. Why has it not been shaken up? Are we scared? Fear instead of courage?\\". He will be buried in his spiritual home,Jerusalem, Israel.

For those of you who are new to the field of modern Chinese history you may be interested in reading the articles of Rawski and Ho Ping-ti (He Pingdi) found in the Journal of Asian Studies, published in the mid-90's. The debate that was started by those articles is still of great importance to modern Chinese history, and it seems that although Rawski and others have presented a very strong case no one as of yet has been victorious. Many scholars still hold the views of Ho Ping-ti (or some version there of). Although, I suspect that over time Rawski's views will triumph. The argument, simply stated, is the question - to what extent where the &quot;conquest dynasties,&quot; especially the Qing (Manchu) Dynasty, sinicized? In the past, scholars (perhaps dominated by the sino-centric Chinese interpretation) have agreed that foreign powers who dominated the Chinese empire forsook their own cultures in favor of a Chinese identity. This included the adoption of the Confucian civil service tradition as well as the Chinese language and many other Chinese cultural traits and behavior patterns. In recent years however, scholars have given evidence to support a very different view of dynasties like the Qing. A certain level of sinicization is undeniable, and no one challenges the fact that the Manchu banner-elite adopted a very Chinese approach to governance and cultural issues, however they also held on tightly to their own culture and went to great efforts to distinguish themselves from the Han Chinese as a ruling elite. The Manchu language, which many scholars had previously considered irrelevant (when studying modern Chinese history) has here become increasingly important. Rawski goes to great lengths to demonstrate the ways in which the ruling elite of China did not adopt 'Chinese' cultural practices but instead tried to be all things to all people. For the Tibetans and the Mongols they adopted the identity of a ruling clergy of Tibetan Buddhism, for the Chinese they adopted the Confucian model of governance, and for the Manchus they held on to various animistic traditions of sacrifice and deity worship.This book is well written, except for a few minor stylistically uncomfortable passages, and really proves her point. Unfortunately, it does drag on a bit at times. Rawski gives an extremely detailed account of life in the upper echelons of Qing society focusing on the imperial household. There is a large body of work here and it will take several readings to truly imbibe all this book has to offer.If you are looking to deepen your knowledge of the field I recommend &quot;Manchus &amp; Han: Ethnic Relations and Political Power in Late Qing and Early Republican China, 1861-1928 &quot; by Edward Rhoads. It is a bit shorter and focuses on the ethnic and political divides between the ruling elite and the Han Chinese."},{"Title":"The Last Emperors: A Social History of Qing Imperial Institutions","review":"I had been taught in my high school history that &quot;Manchus conquered China on horseback but eventually they were assimilated by the Chinese, becoming more Chinese than the Chinese&quot;. After reading E.Rawski's book, I'm beginning to question what my history teachers taught me.E.Rawski's concentrated research on the Manchu royal family shows that the Manchus, particularly the elite did not lose their cultural heritage but in fact strove to maintain it.The book explains how the Manchu royal family differed from the Chinese dynasties in their various aspects of social life. As the book is divided in chapters, it's easy to follow and read.In my humble opinion, this book is for those who wish to study the Manchu monarchy in more detail."},{"Title":"The Last Emperors: A Social History of Qing Imperial Institutions","review":"This book beautifully describes the social fabric of life during the Qing Dynasty.

Shortney's &quot;How to live on Nothing&quot; back when it was first published in the early 1970's.Of course that was the era when books of this nature, on what we called &quot;back to nature&quot;, were more commonplace than they are now. I remember eagerly reading Shortney's chapter on making your own pair of moccasins,or clogs. She even gave you step by step directions on how to make home brewed dandelion wine! What made this book so interesting was that she weaved her practical applications along with her biography. I saw through her words the life of a fledgling journalist in pre war II New York CIty. I met the friends of her youth, the greek itinerant poet who lived on virtually nothing amidst the trees of Central Park, the old man in upstate New York who showed his debt ridden daughter's family how to forage for edible plants, and how to have fun without spending any money at all. Perhaps the most well thumbed chapter for me was the one on camping. Shortney lists this pastime as the one least expensive and most enjoyable. Again, she highlights equipment needed and best places to go, but she does so with her own memories of travelling across country with her husband, Bill, in their well worn station wagon. Although, her chapter on finding shelter is certainly outdated,(she is able to rent a house on Long Island for less than $100 a month), it is intriguing nonetheless,and appeals to my sense of nostalgia with a hint of practicality. My copy is carefully preserved in plastic wrap now, the pages falling away from the binding.

This phenomenal man went on to earn not one, nor two, but four college degrees including the doctorate in the field of social work.

Dr. Alexander was tormented and threatened by a vicious gang. Facing possible death, Dr. Alexander defended himself. Alexander landed into a corrupt criminal justice system.

As I read this book, I could not help but empathizes with what Dr. Alexander was going through. I was forced to question my own beliefs regarding the criminal justice system. I felt empowered by his strength to carry on.To Ascend Into the Shining World Again, is written in a style in which you feel as if Dr. Alexander is sitting right in front of you telling his story. He did not sugar coat what happened, he kept it real and told it how it was. He used language that was brusque yet it was the only way to relay this story realistically.Dr. Alexander's story also incorporates his strong family values and support.

Highly recommended as a stepping stone to more advanced retellings and eventually to Homer himself."},{"Title":"The Children's Homer: The adventures of Odysseus and the tale of Troy","review":"I'm reading this to our children (11,9,7) as part of our homeschool curriculum. I'm probably enjoying more than they are, but my oldest son is very interested in the characters and is retaining the information even though it isn't the writing style they are used to. I think they would be frustrated trying to read it on their own, but it's a good book to read to them."},{"Title":"The Children's Homer: The adventures of Odysseus and the tale of Troy","review":"This book was required reading for my son as the literature component of his study of Ancient Greece and Rome. It's a wonderful abridgment of the Iliad and the Odyssey, emphasizing brevity but maintaining an epic literary style. It'll serve as a great foundation for a child's future study of Homer's actual works, and has already inspired me to be reading the Iliad for myself. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Children's Homer: The adventures of Odysseus and the tale of Troy","review":"This book was a suggested reading in our History book - Mystery of History Vol I. I thought why not! It is written in an older style language that was a challenge to read aloud but sooo much fun. Trying to pronounce all the Greek names was a hoot! The story includes so much action - really keeps you clinging to find out what happens next. We did this as a read-aloud with the kids and it was great!"},{"Title":"The Children's Homer: The adventures of Odysseus and the tale of Troy","review":"I have a translation of Homer but was not able to finish it. I got the Kindle edition of the Children's Homer and I'm still reading it to my five-year-old. I've finished it myself. It is fairly easy to read once you get used to the thees and thous. Of course, the subject matter is violent but for boys who watch Transformers and Ben10, it is definitely acceptable. It is a good introduction to Greek gods and goddesses, to the ambiguities of war (eg how Helen sympathised with Hector) and even family values."},{"Title":"The Children's Homer: The adventures of Odysseus and the tale of Troy","review":"I have been reading this to my 9 year old son as a part of our 3rd grade homeschool curriculum. I obtained a pronounciation guide and character list off the internet to help with some of the difficult names and to help distinguish the characters. While it is a complicated story line to follow, it is a very vivid and interesting story!! Don't expect a small child to retain everything in this book, but enjoy and glean from the story what you can. Take time to pause and put into your own words what is happening. Also, have your child narrate back to you small parts in their own words. It is not important to remember everything, but to enjoy the story and build on it as the child progresses through school."},{"Title":"The Children's Homer: The adventures of Odysseus and the tale of Troy","review":"As a kid, I loved this book.As a young adult, I've gone to college and become a Classics major. Now I'm reading the Aeneid in Latin, and I've really begun to appreciate what a wonderful book this is!I have no way of judging this book's suitability for \\"kids in general.\\" For me, though, this book instilled a love of mythology and history that has stayed with me through my life so far. I strongly suggest it!"},{"Title":"The Children's Homer: The adventures of Odysseus and the tale of Troy","review":"I read this book to my second oldest child, who is an 11 year old girl. We homeschool and are using Sonlight's 6th grade program for her this year. This book was part of her history program. While I enjoyed it myself she definitely DID NOT. Some of the language was beyond her understanding, the plot was hard for her to follow because it switches back and forth so much between the past and the present, and she says it was just plain boring. I wish so much that we had read Rosemary Sutcliff's books, &quot;Black Ships Before Troy&quot; and &quot;The Wanderings of Oddyseus&quot; instead. They are much more interesting, easier to follow, and the artwork in them is GEORGEOUS. (Not much artwork in TCH.) Those books are much more suitable for yonger children and adults alike. Unfortunately I can't stop now and read them to my daughter or we will get all off track but I hope to work them in at a later date and when my younger three children do Sonlight 6 we will replace The Children's Homer with the Sutcliff books."},{"Title":"The Children's Homer: The adventures of Odysseus and the tale of Troy","review":"Three cheers: for Padraic Colum, who was a natural storyteller and interpreter of the ancient myths; for Dover Publications, who offers this reprint and other classics dirt cheap (Dover editions are generally five bucks or less); and for the parent who loves these stories and can read them intelligently to young children.Parents: there are many, many things in these kinds of stories that will not be self-evident to children if they are not explained: language, relationships, cause and effect, the Greek pantheon, etc. You must, as appropriate, stop and talk things over with your child. It will be a better reading experience for the both of you, and it will do wonders for your child.My son, knowing that Odysseus was finally going to confront the wooers of this wife Penelope, was besides himself with excitement as the tension mounted. He did not mind at all the side diversions into other stories--by this time he understands that the ancient Greeks told stories within stories within stories (they didn't have TV! or the Internet!). His patience paid off, and Colum's description of the final scene was most satisfying. This, together with Colum's telling of the legend of the Golden Fleece, Jason, and the Argonauts (available in another Dover edition--see my Amazon review), are highly recommended as a superb introduction to these classic tales."},{"Title":"The Children's Homer: The adventures of Odysseus and the tale of Troy","review":"I read this book more than ten years ago when I was 12. It transported me into a world full of heroes and wonderful stories and I loved every word. My brother, 19 years younger than I am, has just discovered this book and we are reading it together. He loves it as much as I did, and after reading it again after all these years I find it as magical as ever."},{"Title":"The Children's Homer: The adventures of Odysseus and the tale of Troy","review":"Our mom just finished reading The Children's Homer to us. It was interesting. The story is about people and adventures. We liked the part when someone sings a song about Odysseus building the horse. It's the children's homer and we think you should learn more about the journey of Odysseus. You will also learn about Achilles and some of the battles of Troy. We like that Odysseus was most wanting to get home to his family.Ages 10, 8, and 7."},{"Title":"The Children's Homer: The adventures of Odysseus and the tale of Troy","review":"My 7 and 10YO actually said, \\"Turn off Spongebob, Mom's going to read Homer!!\\"My kids have loved this book-- we are three chapters from the end, and they cannot wait to finish it out. We have read it at the pace of about two chapters per day, with the occasional third chapter tossed in after some begging to \\"please don't stop just yet\\" arose. I have been told that my 7YO has \\"comprehension problems,\\" yet as we read, he will comment on the action, the characters' feelings, and what they might be planning to do, right along with his brother.I do not believe that the younger one could have read this book to himself; my 10YO might have done so.The vocabulary, sentence structure, and storytelling in this book is fantastic and challenging, and that is part of the appeal. Kids get tired of books that talk down to them and don't challenge them. The language and rhythm of this book serve to draw them into the story, and the beautiful line drawings also serve to draw them into Ancient Greece, and into the plight of Odysseus, the beauty of Penelope, and the machinations of Athene. Yet the illustrations are scattered thinly through the book, so that they spark the imagination without overruling it.Many books that we have will be recycled back into second-hand shops, but this one will be a keeper-- I am sure both boys will, in time, pick it up on their own and re-read it, and then be better prepared to read a more literal translation of Homer's epic poems when they are older.Highly recommended family reading."},{"Title":"The Children's Homer: The adventures of Odysseus and the tale of Troy","review":"Although the language in this book is rather challenging, we still found it accessible and enjoyable. These classic stories can get too \\"watered-down\\" in the easier versions, which takes away the richness and depth that has made them classics in the first place. My 12 year old homeschooled son looked at these and Rosemary Sutcliff's Black Ships Before Troy and Wanderings of Odysseus and ultimately chose this one, but the Sutcliff books are a good alternative if the advanced language proves to be too much of a barrier. She has several good classic retellings. Either way, these stories should be a part of every child's education--they're wonderful!"},{"Title":"The Children's Homer: The adventures of Odysseus and the tale of Troy","review":"This is a very well-written book -- for its time. I find that the archaic language make it unsuited for reading to children. (It is filled with \\"thee\\", \\"thou,\\" \\"raiment,\\" etc.) I had to practically translate the conversations between the characters for my son. For example Achilles says: \\"Deem'st thou I grieve for ...\\"I still read it to my son (with plenty of translation and paraphrasing), and he still thoroughly enjoys the Homeric epic. But I think a more contemporary rendering would have been much better."},{"Title":"The Children's Homer: The adventures of Odysseus and the tale of Troy","review":"Directly from the inside of this book: \\"First we scanned the original rare book using a robot which automatically flipped and photographed each page. We automated the typing, proof reading and design of this book using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software on the scanned copy...\\"They basically copied pages into a computer, the computer translated it, and whatever the computer thought was the word was what ended up on the page. What this means is that there are many typos. There are mistakes and extraneous letters/symbols all over the place. The end result is a book that appears to be disorganized, sloppy and confusing. The formatting of the book is horrible and it looks like the whole story is crammed into a long, long chapter.Since I can't trust the words I'm reading to be the actual text of the book and not an OCR-related error, why bother reading this version of the book at all?Perhaps I hadn't read the description carefully enough or correctly interpreted what it meant before purchasing it, but I am very disappointed."},{"Title":"The Children's Homer: The adventures of Odysseus and the tale of Troy","review":"My second grade son, who is very into all things \\"Star Wars the Clone Wars\\" and Legos (like most 8 year olds his age!) is really getting immersed in the tale of Telemachus and his search for information about what happened to his dad Odysseus. The narrative is beautifully written and engaging. It is not too literary for him but also does not over simplify the story. I also apprieciate the illustrations, they are a good intoduction to classical greek line work! I am reading it aloud and it has been a joy to share with him."},{"Title":"The Children's Homer: The adventures of Odysseus and the tale of Troy","review":"I ordered this book for a school requirement for my 7th grader. I assumed that it would match the views given of the inside of the book. It did not! There were no chapter divisions, many misspelled words and sentences that had random letters throughout. Be careful when you order books from Amazon. I had to buy one from Barnes and Noble when this one was not very readable. Thankfully, Amazon did refund the cost of the book."},{"Title":"The Children's Homer: The adventures of Odysseus and the tale of Troy","review":"This book got me interested in mythology and the tale of Troy.

It is too thick to easily add to a history block of Ancient Civilizations around the world. The language is too dated. The narrations dwarfs the action. The standard, for good youth literature today, requires writers to SHOW the meaning and NOT TELL IT.Thankfully, author Geraldine McCaughrean wrote a wonderfully telling of GILGAMESH, so I turned around and ordered her retelling of Homer's THE ILLIAD and THE ODYSSEY which is titled, ODYSSEUS.Does anyone want my copy of Padric's version. The cover art is great."},{"Title":"The Children's Homer: The adventures of Odysseus and the tale of Troy","review":"This book goes into the hearts and minds of the ancient Greeks led by Odysseus and Achilles, who are guided by their gods. The Trojan War is brewing for the Greeks and thoughts of slaughtering their enemy, The Trojans are very strong. Can the Trojans survive? Will they all live to tell the tale of the Trojan War or will they all be killed? On both sides, it's life or death on their minds. Have you ever heard of the Trojan horse and the victory for Odysseus? This book includes the story of Odysseus and why his son set out to find his father. The journey of the ancient Greeks to the Trojan homeland is included. Will they return or will they lie in the blood stained desert of the Trojan homeland? The book also includes Odysseusis treacherous journey home past a six headed serpent and right across an evil king's door step. Will he survive?Personally I didn't like the book at all. The way it was written it didn't really pull the reader in very well and the battle sequences are O.K. but not the best. Personally I don't really enjoy some types of myths and legends. I think if you are just about to branch out and read Greek myths you shouldn't read this book first because it really turns you off to Greek myths in general, so don't think all Greek myth's are like this."},{"Title":"The Children's Homer: The adventures of Odysseus and the tale of Troy","review":"I hated.

THEY LOVED IT! A couple of brighter ones were particularly interested in Greek myths before I started, and they helped to spark the whole class, but they all were able to understand it. I checked with the class a number of times to see if they wanted me to continue, and it was always a unanimous YES! Knowing that the Odyssey and the Illiad are considered the greatest stories of all time, and such ancient, ancient stories, really hooked them in them. Padraic Colum's language is sophisticated, and the sentence structure is complex, but it is so lyrical and clean, the kids seemed caught in a spell listening to it. One of the lovely things about reading classics to children, is that they see how imbedded in our culture they are. For instance, they could recognize Homer's influence in cartoons and T.V. shows! When we finished, one of the rich discussion topics was how Homer's and the early Greeks' view of women affects our society today. A number of parents expressed gratitude and awe that I would read such sophisticated literature to young children, and were highly impressed with their children's interest in it."},{"Title":"The Children's Homer: The adventures of Odysseus and the tale of Troy","review":"The Children's Homer is a great book for older elementary children if they like adventure and are interested in learning about Greek society. It is an excellent book about the great Greek hero Odysseus and his son, Telemachus. When Telemachus is a baby his father, Odysseus, is called to go to war. When Telemachus grows older, the goddess Athene tells him to go seek his father. Telemachus obeys and great adventure begins. I personally thought that the names were hard to keep up with, but the book holds much magic and adventure. I also would have never wanted to read the book on my own, but I'm glad I got the chance in school. The book kept me interested just about all the time, and I always looked forward to reading more. My favorite character was Odysseus, because he was brave and wise. He would listen to advice given to him and was polite and thankful. I think I will always remember the story because it shows many good character traits that everyone needs."},{"Title":"The Children's Homer: The adventures of Odysseus and the tale of Troy","review":"As a homeschooled child, I read this book when I was eight and thoroughly enjoyed it; now, at fifteen, I have just finished reading the original Iliad and Odyssey for the second time. Reading them made me realize how much The Children's Homer helped me, both in exposing me to the epics and giving me a basic overview of the story. My only complaint was that it lacked the strength and beauty of the original, but that is understandable.I would also recommend The Greek Way (Edith Hamilton) as an excellent look into ancient Greek philosophy and philosophers. I read this in the same course as The Children's Homer and it has become my favorite history book-children will enjoy it, but parents had best let them read it to themselves; it is unfair for parents to monopolize children's books.Marion Doak, student"},{"Title":"The Children's Homer: The adventures of Odysseus and the tale of Troy","review":"This is a wonderful introduction to the world of Homer and the Greek heros of the Trojan war. As previous reviewers have mentioned this is a story combining The Illiad and Odyssey. By today standards the language could be archaic, but if you are teaching in the classical method I find it necessary to learn the prose of the past in order to read the classics of the ancient world. If nothing else it promotes thought and requires the reader to thoroughly pay attention.This book flows poetically and captivates your imagination. Your children will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Children's Homer: The adventures of Odysseus and the tale of Troy","review":"This book is a 1965 retelling of Homer's The Iliad and The Odyssey meant for children. The language is sophisticated and old-fashioned, with complex sentence structure. The vocabulary, including names of people and places, is very difficult. The storylines are intricate and challenging to follow, especially when read intermittently. While these qualities may capture the spirit of the original story, they also make for difficult reading for children. Furthermore, the 250-page length will daunt most young readers. Scattered throughout the text are simple black and white full-page line drawings; each chapter also begins with a small, illustrated head. The illustrations are static, but recall the style of classical Greek figured vases. While classical Greek mythology can be popular subject with children, this retelling does not significantly simplify the story or the language for young readers. Even read aloud, the complicated story lines may be challenging to follow. For reading in school, the book would be greatly enhanced with a glossary, guide to pronunciation, annotations, and maps. For leisure reading, I would recommend this book only for highly motivated children and young adults."},{"Title":"The Children's Homer: The adventures of Odysseus and the tale of Troy","review":"Padraic Colum (1881-1972) saw the need to introduce the classics to young children. In 1918 he published this book The Children's Homer which combines the retelling of both Homer's Illiad and Odyssey. It is obvious that his idea and his book has stood the test of time since this book is now in reprint for our children to learn from today. The few illustrations are by Willy Pogany and are well done.

Here we have an introduction to the way Greeks and Romans faced on humanity most ancient and perilous \\"game\\"...maybe battlefield is a more appropriate definition. We're talking about Love, sexual desire and the quest to obtain them (both or just one).This is an extraordinary anthology of Greek and Roman erotic verse. But much more than that, it is a fabulous introduction on ancient customs regarding sexual life and the classical views on how they regarded sex and roles.Form the Greek symposium where erastes tried to conquer their eromenos, to the much sought hetaeras where a man should look for pleasure (and not their wives). The comparative freedom women had in the Hellenistic world (compared to classical Greece), quite obvious in contemporary verses. To the living goddesses like Ovid's Corinna or Catullus's Lesbia, loved and hated at the same time.This book provides a solid footstep for further study, with excellent footnotes, suggested reading and representative examples of Greek and Roman erotic verse. Obviously you should study a little classical history and mythology before embarking on this journey; most verses have several references to myths, legend and history.From Greece you have short biographies and excerpts from (among others): Archilochus, Alkman, Mimnermos, Sappho, Ibycus, Anacreon, Theognis, Hipponax, Pindar, Bacchylides, Hermesianax, Asclepiades, Callimachus, Theocritus, Herodas, Machon, the Grenfell papirus, , Meleager.And from Rome you will find Bios and excerpts of: Catullus, Virgil, Horace, Tibullus, Sulpicia, Propertius, Ovid.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Rounds","review":"ROUNDS is a book that has been out of print for decades, which is unfortunate, not to mention sad, for serious readers of good fiction. Frederick Busch was a master at creating characters so real that by the end of the book you'd swear you've known some of these people. ROUNDS is no exception. Protagonist Dr. Eli Silver is the kind of committed and caring pediatrician you'd want for your own kids; but he's going through some very tough times, as his wife has fled following the death of their own child. Elizabeth Bean, a troubled professional with her own problems, becomes his salvation, at least for a time. Then there are the academics from the local college in rural upstate New York - Phil Sorenson and his wife Annie, who wander like aging hippies from one teaching position to the next, rehabbing old houses each time to fill their time as they hope for children. Their stories - and others - all intersect in the most surprising and tragic ways.I've been reading Fred Busch for nearly twenty years now, beginning with hisHarry and Catherine: A Love Story, thenGirls: A Novel (Ballantine Reader's Circle)(probably his best known book) and others. Busch wrote more than two dozen books, and every one of them is gem-like in its polished precision and perfection.

The exact same thing happened to the Aoike Yasuko whom made the Eroica manga; 7 year haiatus on book 19, now on book 33.Hopefully the series will extend beyond a 12th book & like Patalliro, get a second TV series to boot.

This marvelously articulate woman wrote with with razor-sharp perception, and the emotional states of her characters are fully detailed and examined. The reader will have to pay attention constantly while reading, or s/he will miss the richness of description, and maybe even some necessary subtle plot lines.

They read Pride and Predjudice, perhaps Austen's most well-liked novel, and maybe Sense and Senisbility, Emma, or Persuasion, and then consider themselves authorities on the Austen canon.Jane Austen: The Collected Novels allows readers and critics alike the opportunity to read all of Austen, not just her more popular works. One sees Austen's growth from a young, aspiring novelist who wrote Lady Susan, Sandition, and The Watsons, to the mature writer so many readers admire.This collection's importance cannot be stressed enough, because to truly appreciate and understand an author, one must be familiar with his or her canon.Now, with the publication of such a complete compilation, we have the chance to do just that."},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"I love Jane Austen and of course all the novels contained in this set are fantastic. However, if you really love Jane Austen I recommend just getting your favorite novels separately.

There's a biographical note in the beginning, followed by the novels beginning with Sense and Sensibility, Persuasion, Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Mansfield Park, and Northanger Abbey. There are also black and white line drawings by Hugh Thomson [1860-1920]. The paper quality if of good stock in an eggshell white and the font size appears to be about 10.

Truly, it's a delightful edition."},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"...this book includes all of the great Ladies novels, including the often overlooked, \\"Lady Susan\\". Modern readers approaching Austen for the first time are often underwhelmed by the events and the pace of the drama, not entirely difficult to understand given that we need to have our drama so upfront we can smell it these days! Equally just about anything goes in drama today.There are few taboos and drama reaches us in a multi media fashion. In Austen's time taboo and social order was a plenty and well structured, men and women had distinct roles as did the classes. Society was subtly cruel and unforgiving in it's snobbery and comment upon this was unwelcome. Place these novels in that context and you will love them for Austen is clever and subtle at her sending up and fun poking at this order. Her novels have a sense of justice in which the good triumph and the underhand and sly come undone, whatever their class or station. These kind of novel conclusions seem simple and ideal but it is how she sends up the social order of her time that is her true writIng gift, her tongue was always wedged firmly in her cheek and she can astound, even today, with her wry wit and biting sarcasm. An excellent book and representation of her career."},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"I received this book as a Christmas present a year ago.

Since the kindle has made it easier to get and read the classics, I have just started reading them. I will say the mobi versions are the best. This particular collection has just a few flaws but they are easy to overlook when you are engrossed in the story. I guess the biggest flaw is in Sense and Sensibility. When you get to an illustration, the description of the illustration is the starting line of the next page instead of at the bottom of the illustration, which makes you feel like you are reading a sentence again."},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"I have nothing against this collection of Jane Austin's works.

I mean reading actual books (not stuff on the internet, magazines, etc.). Getting back into the classics, my friend kept telling me to read Jane Austen. Back when I was a teenager my attempt to read Jane Austen totally fell flat (and unlike so many other reviewers, I was not ever required to read anything of Jane Austen (even up to my AP English Lit. class)...so fast forward to the present, where in my attempts to actually read and read classics...I decided to give her another shot. So I purchased the book because I love to have anthologies/omibuses as I get through books REALLY fast.The book is exactly what I paid for. It is a bit pricey for a paperback, but when you are really reading you tend to think about other stuff. The reviewer who has problems with the font (without having poor eyesight) made me a bit confused. I am 27, and I don't have the best eyesight but I can easily read this a bit over 12 feet away from my face as I love to read while reclining or with the book on my lap (it is pretty hefty to have it not rest on something after a while).

These novels are romantic, funny and touching, and instead of raising their eyebrows because you're reading romantic fiction written by a woman, parents and teachers will be pleased by your quality selection. Austen created characters that are believable in both their strengths and foibles and her heroines are ultimately sympathetic, and some how very modern. It is easy for a woman in our times to relate to them. Try these--you'll like them."},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"Austen novels, loved by girls everywhere and parents hoping for literate children, are charming and witty and not as melodramatic as other classic romances can tend to be.

And, of course, it is wonderful simply because it is a collection of novels from a light-hearted and intelligent author."},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"Jane Austen. Her name is practically synonymous with classic, understated romance, as well as comedies of manners with a subtle, sly sense of humor.And the Penguin Classics Deluxe edition of Austen's \\"The Complete Novels\\" brings together the full complement of Austen's finished novels, from the little-known \\"Lady Susan\\" to the classic bestseller \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" (and everything in between). This collection is flled with lovably flawed heroines, beautiful formal prose, and some rather unconventional love stories.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" become a problem when Elizabeth Bennett takes a dislike to the handsome, aloof Mr. Darcy -- and her prejudice against him builds after he sabotages her sister's love match, and the charming Wickham drops some shocking claims about Darcy's nastiness. But the facts are very different -- and when scandal hits the Bennett family, Darcy may be their only hope. And \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" clash when the two very different Dashwood sisters, smart Elinor and romantic Marianne, both fall in love -- one with a man she can't have, and the other with a guy who may be horribly unsuitable.Anne Elliott has a problem with \\"Persuasion,\\" since she was once engaged to the impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth, but was persuaded to break it off. Now he's returned from war as a wealthy hero... and Anne still loves him. \\"Mansfield Park\\" is the backdrop for shy Fanny's life with her rich relatives, who usually treat her as a servant -- except for her kindly cousin, Edmund. But when the flirtatious, fashionable Crawfords arrive in the neighborhood, it unbalances the lives of everyone at Mansfield Park.And \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a fitting location for Austen's spoof on gothic romances, in which the hyperimaginative Catherine Moreland is taken under the wing of the Tilney family, and especially handsome Henry -- and learns a lesson about the difference between fantasy and reality. \\"Emma\\" is a frothy romantic comedy about a rich, somewhat spoiled young lady who tries to arrange the lives of people around her so that everyone is happy. The problem is, life isn't that simple -- and neither is love. And as an addition to Austen's main body of work, this edition includes the novella \\"Lady Susan,\\" who is sort of the evil sociopathic twin of Emma -- a brilliant and manipulative widow who seduces, plots and schemes. Yummy stuff.The omnibus collection displays the range and depth of Austen's writing skill beautifully; though each story is very unique they're laced together by common themes. Except for \\"Lady Susan,\\" each story is a love story, tempered with some clever commentary on the society of Austen's day (example: entailment, which plays a part in several plots), and a biting, sharp-edged wit (the mockery of the toadying Mr. Collins and the obnoxious Elliott family).And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen painted her stories vividly -- there's a bit of roughness in \\"Lady Susan\\" and \\"Persuasion,\\" but nothing too dramatic. Each one has powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"), as well as deliciously witty dialogue (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But she also weaves in some intensely romantic moments as well (\\"Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman, that his love has an earlier death. I have loved none but you\\").Austen also had an interesting range of heroines -- quiet ones, melodramatic ones, intelligent ones, naive ones, and mildly spoiled ones who think they know best. But each one has a major character flaw that must be overcome before she can find true love and happiness And she has an equally fascinating range of love interests: the quiet shy Colonel Brandon, the sexy and clever Henry Tilney, the blunt Mr. Knightley, the generous and honest Edmund, and especially the smart, sexy Mr. Darcy (who has a flaw of his own to overcome alongside Lizzie).Jane Austen's \\"Complete Novels\\" draws together all her finished novels, and let readers explore the mannered society and obstacle-filled love lives of her heroines."},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"This book doesn't have an index so that you can scroll down and read Persuasion before you read Emma.

It's good to have a complete book of all her novels.

I loved Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, most recently; Mansfield park. I haven't read the rest of them yet but there are several stories, like Northanger Abbey and Emma, and Lady Susan. There's so much talent to her writing its hard to put it down. I've seen the films but I think the book can bring out a richer experience of the stories too. There's so much in her writing that really speaks to every girl and woman alike, from all sorts of generations, which only a classic can thrive and can stand the test of time.

She loves the novels and really loves having them all together in one book."},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"On vacation this summer we dined one night in a restaurant in Ciudad Acuna, Mexico. Hung upon the walls were several reproductions of paintings by the Mexican painter Frieda Kahlo. All except for one, as I recall, were the introspective above-the-chest self portraits for which she is known. The exception was a full-length portrait of herself with her husband, the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera, whose size, in comparison to his wife's, was massive. Rivera dwarfed Kahlo, just as his enormous murals, peopled by hundreds, dwarfed Kahlo's portraits of one. I suppose a person could read a good deal into that painting, but having read the Complete Novels of Jane Austen in June and July I was primed to see the painting as a categorization of artists and authors as either big picture types (Rivera, Dickens, Tolstoy), or small picture specialists (Kahlo, Austen). It would be tempting to see this as a male/female dichotomy, and as a general rule I suppose it is, but there are exceptions. George Eliot wrote Middlemarch, while William Blake was able to see the world in a grain of sand. So too could Jane Austen. From their confined, rural positions in the English society of the early 1800's her heroines experience the full gamut of thoughts and emotions life has to offer, each from a different perspective. And Austen's language is a joy, such a combination of thrift and wit, wisdom and poignancy. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"Great if you love her type of literature.

Austen's heroines are more than young ladies embarking on the marriage market; they are young ladies who must learn how to live and love within the confines of their world. While the naive exploits of Catherine Morland and Marianne Dashwood provide amusement and astonishment to the reader, heroines such as Anne Elliot and Elizabeth Darcy often exhibit grace under pressure. All of her heroines suffer from their own faults and inexperience, but they are willing to learn and grow. Her heroines are not perfect but they are real. In the end, in true bildungsroman style, they are rewarded for their newly discovered maturity. Aside from her heroines, Austen is probably best known for her comic creations. Who can find much fault with Emma Woodhouse when introduced to the society in which she lives? Characters such as Miss Bates and Mr. Woodhouse illustrate Austen at her best because they demonstrate her astuteness regarding human nature. These characters invite both laughter and sneers of contempt, as we recognize those traits in the people around us. This understanding of human nature has allowed Austen's novels to remain popular nearly 200 years after her death."},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"This review is for the Kindle edition of \\"The Complete Novels, Jane Austen (Author), Karen Joy Fowler (Introduction). Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition. ASIN: B001TMCF3S\\".I have a paper copy of this book (or rather another Penguin edition of it ISBN: 978-0141030173), but it's a bit bulky, so I bought the Kindle version of this book today. Only in a few minutes of browsing I found a couple of typos - a full-stop instead of space between words in the same sentence, a semi-colon where there should be a comma. Therefore I have returned it.I have also notified Amazon about these (using the \`Report Content Error' menu on Kindle); so perhaps these particular ones will be quickly fixed. But, I am sure, there will be others.I verified all these errors against the paper copy, especially the 'semi-colon in place of comma' error because it is somewhat hard to be sure about this specific one in a Jane Austen text as in some places she does make use of a good number of semi-colons to construct long sentences; and I think it is a literary artifact she consciously employs to convey the meaning in a particular way or set a certain pace for a stream of thought, etc. Hence it is very important that her text be of high quality.Here's the semi-colon error. Note the semi-colon after 'fancy'. This is somewhere towards the end of Chapter 9 of Pride & Prejudice.\\"And so ended his affection,\\" said Elizabeth impatiently. \\"There has been many a one, I fancy; overcome in the same way. I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!\\"A previous reviewer (Cynthia L. Gause, October 24, 2012) has also reported spelling mistakes. She is right about there being 'riot' in the text, where it should be 'not' - (\\" ... but I am an idle fellow, and though I have riot many, I have more than I ever look into.\\" - Ch. 8, Pride & Prejudice). But as to the other examples she gives (\\"chuse\\" into \\"choose\\", \\"shew\\" into \\"show\\", \\"ancle\\" into \\"ankle\\", and \\"stile\\" into \\"style\\"), I think she thought them to be typos only because she expected a modernized-spelling edition. These are spellings that Jane Auten used and it seems a very common practice to retain them in modern editions; unlike most modern editions of Shakespeare, say, where spellings are modernized. For example, Oxford World's Classics, Penguin, David M. Shapard's annotated editions from Anchor, all use these spellings instead of their modern equivalents.I have a number of Penguin's Kindle books (as also their paper equivalents in most cases) but I had not noticed quality problems before. I had always thought of Penguin, along with others like Oxford, as publishers whose text could be implicitly trusted to be of very high quality; maybe I am naive. But in this case Penguin has clearly not lived up to that high expectation.I wanted this Kindle book very much, and I am sorry I had to return it. If Penguin releases a well-proofed version in the future I am sure I shall buy it again.But, in the meanwhile, I just wanted to warn prospective buyers, and hopefully alert Penguin (if, that is, anybody there reads these reviews) so that they can think about scheduling a revision for this book; hence this (somewhat long) review."},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"The Jane Austen Collection: Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park, Emma, Northanger Abbey, Persuasion (Halcyon Classics)Pride and Prejudice was the first school text book that I enjoyed reading.

Here, collected in one volume, are all of her charming, vibrant and facinating characters from the arrogant yet lovable Mr. Darcy in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; to the adorably misguided but well meaning Emma in &quot;Emma&quot; There are no clunkers in this collection. Each of these novels is a joy to read and re-read. Austen's prose and character development are superior and her plots never disappoint. Villains are punished, heroines and heroes eventually triumph and romances work themselves out in humorous yet realistic fashion."},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"It was a long wait for this book since Amazon had trouble finding it for me, but it was very much worth the wait.

Her name is practically synonymous with classic, understated romance, as well as comedies of manners with a subtle, sly sense of humor.And Austen's \\"The Complete Novels\\" brings together the full complement of her finished novels, from the little-known \\"Lady Susan\\" to the classic bestseller \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" (and everything in between). This collection is flled with lovably flawed heroines, beautiful formal prose, and some rather unconventional love stories.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" become a problem when Elizabeth Bennett takes a dislike to the handsome, aloof Mr. Darcy -- and her prejudice against him builds after he sabotages her sister's love match, and the charming Wickham drops some shocking claims about Darcy's nastiness. But the facts are very different -- and when scandal hits the Bennett family, Darcy may be their only hope. And \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" clash when the two very different Dashwood sisters, smart Elinor and romantic Marianne, both fall in love -- one with a man she can't have, and the other with a guy who may be horribly unsuitable.Anne Elliott has a problem with \\"Persuasion,\\" since she was once engaged to the impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth, but was persuaded to break it off. Now he's returned from war as a wealthy hero... and Anne still loves him. \\"Mansfield Park\\" is the backdrop for shy Fanny's life with her rich relatives, who usually treat her as a servant -- except for her kindly cousin, Edmund. But when the flirtatious, fashionable Crawfords arrive in the neighborhood, it unbalances the lives of everyone at Mansfield Park.And \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a fitting location for Austen's spoof on gothic romances, in which the hyperimaginative Catherine Moreland is taken under the wing of the Tilney family, and especially handsome Henry -- and learns a lesson about the difference between fantasy and reality. \\"Emma\\" is a frothy romantic comedy about a rich, somewhat spoiled young lady who tries to arrange the lives of people around her so that everyone is happy. The problem is, life isn't that simple -- and neither is love. And as an addition to Austen's main body of work, this edition includes the novella \\"Lady Susan,\\" who is sort of the evil sociopathic twin of Emma -- a brilliant and manipulative widow who seduces, plots and schemes. Yummy stuff.The omnibus collection displays the range and depth of Austen's writing skill beautifully; though each story is very unique they're laced together by common themes. Except for \\"Lady Susan,\\" each story is a love story, tempered with some clever commentary on the society of Austen's day (example: entailment, which plays a part in several plots), and a biting, sharp-edged wit (the mockery of the toadying Mr. Collins and the obnoxious Elliott family).And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen painted her stories vividly -- there's a bit of roughness in \\"Lady Susan\\" and \\"Persuasion,\\" but nothing too dramatic. Each one has powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"), as well as deliciously witty dialogue (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But she also weaves in some intensely romantic moments as well (\\"Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman, that his love has an earlier death. I have loved none but you\\").Austen also had an interesting range of heroines -- quiet ones, melodramatic ones, intelligent ones, naive ones, and mildly spoiled ones who think they know best. But each one has a major character flaw that must be overcome before she can find true love and happiness And she has an equally fascinating range of love interests: the quiet shy Colonel Brandon, the sexy and clever Henry Tilney, the blunt Mr. Knightley, the generous and honest Edmund, and especially the smart, sexy Mr. Darcy (who has a flaw of his own to overcome alongside Lizzie).Jane Austen's \\"Complete Novels\\" draws together all her finished novels, and let readers explore the mannered society and obstacle-filled love lives of her heroines."},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"I have never owned a more beautiful book in my life.

It lays open in your hand, has nice paper and high-quality paperback binding and cover, and it has perfectly sized type and wide inside margins. Other than the substantial size and weight (though it is not nearly as inconvenient as quarto-sized complete editions, such as the classic Sherlock Holmes), it is a perfect volume for those who are more interested in reading Austen than admiring how she looks on the shelf.By contrast, the Modern Library hardcover edition (which I compared in person at the bookstore) has such a narrow inside margin that the reader must strain to read bent text or to force the binding to open more and the paper to lay flatter. Otherwise, it was a nice edition. For me, they ruined it by this simple mistake.The leather bound edition from the Library of Literary Classics is a nice idea, and I have not seen it in person. I did notice, however, that the table of contents shows how little space they manage to squeeze Austen's novels into. It has far fewer pages than the Penquin Classics Deluxe Edition. When previewing the pages of text, this seems apparent in the very small type. As I said, I have not seen it in person, so I may be wrong, but it looks like it might be a strain to read, whereas the Penguin is quite comfortable. Hopefully Penguin will provide preview images soon so potential buyers can \\"Look Inside\\" and compare for themselves.It is wonderful that there are so many editions of Austen to choose from. The choice is personal and subjective. I will spend many, many hours reading mine, so I chose the one that I thought would be the most comfortable. I do not want to fight the book -- I want it to disappear so that my imagination may wander unhindered with Jane's characters. I hope you enjoy the novels, whichever edition you choose."},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"This review is regarding the quality of the 1994 hardcover edition published by Grammercy. I ordered this edition several weeks ago and was extremely disappointed to find it was poor quality. The binding is acceptable when new but after a week of light use, I already noticed deterioration on the front binding. Actually the binding is so poor that, if not careful, you could easily tear some of the front pages out. The paper quality is cheap and is the same used for mass media paperbacks expect slightly thinner. Overall, I was so dissatisfied with this edition that I returned it.However, I would also like to make a recommendation. After returning the book, I was still looking for collection of Austen's works and happened to find a 1995 hardcover edition of this exact book by Grammercy. The edition costs five dollars more but the quality is ten times better. The book has a faux leather cover with gold trimmed pages and a ribbon bookmark. The paper quality in thin but polished, smoother and more refined. The binding is very durable and I have noticed no deterioration yet after a week of use.If I had to a chance to redo my purchases, I would have skipped this edition completely and ordered the 1995 edition.

Except for Sanditon, it contains all her novels, and it has a pleasing presentation.But there are some details in this book that can become quite bothering. As I read Pride and Prejudice, I noticed that an entire line of a dialog between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet (the main characters) is omitted, and frankly, it is difficult to follow the conversation without that particular line. There are also many other mistakes in the text (i.e. 'becausee'). If you are too particular about this kind of errors (like me), maybe you should choose another book. If you don't really care about these things, it is a good choice."},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"I appreciated rereading Austen's work over the summer, and it was a natural choice for me to get it on my new Kindle. The pages look great and the type is adjustable. The one drawback was the size of the illustrations. Condensed onto the Kindle's screen they were difficult to appreciate. The fact that the book in e-version is so light to carry made up for this. It also made a difference in that the Kindle helped me look up the word \\"eclaircissement\\" as I was reading it."},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"I highly recommend Jane Austen's delightful writing to one and all. Each one of her, unfortunately too few, novels are true classics in every sense of the word. She is witty and very readable. Her novels are deliciously addictive and you will enjoy rereading them over and over.I purchased this edition for my 17 y/o daughter so that I could keep MY own copy of this book available for myself...I am so envious! This is a lovely, expensive-looking book which sells for an amazingly low price. There are cheaper hardback copies but the extra $4.00 for this one is very much worth 3 times that small amount. The leather binding and original artwork make this an excellent bargain."},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"This was a great book for the price and everything. It is fantastically layed out, and the pages are thin but no so much that you fear they will tear every time you turn the page. I was hesitant with the five starts only because there are SEVERAL typos throughout the book, which worried me a little as to the correctness of other points. But it is a very attractive book that includes a bookmark and very well worth the price. I would highly recommend this anthology over many others. Be on guard for the typos, however."},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"I had a copy of the Complete Illustrated Novels of Jane Austen before I bought the Kindle. It was a pain to have to drag the 1200+ page book around with me. The book itself is easy to use, and it's great to have all the novels together. This was the first book I bought on the Kindle and I'm really happy with it. Thank you, Kindle, for lightening my purse considerably!"},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"I am a great Jane Austen fan, and was thrilled to find this book, which is a very good price. I like owning all 7 novels! The book is really surprisingly light, and not at all cumbersome, unless you want to carry it around. I do not find the print too small or close, either. If you are beginnning Jane Austen I recommend that you start with Emma or Persuasion. Emma is a delight to read- I am in the process of reading it for the first time now! Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility can be a liitle confusing and a more difficult read. I have not read Lady Susan, Mansfield Park, or Northanger Abbey yet. The only thing I could ask for is that they would have included Love and Friendship, which I have seen in other Complete Works editions."},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"I love Jane Austen. But this edition is full of spelling and text errors. Words that run together. Context that was not checked. These are annoying. The editor clearly didn't do his or her job. I was very disappointed."},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"Why do people still go on reading, quoting and making films about the novels of Jane Austen, a stay at home maiden lady who wrote her books almost two hundred years ago? An easy answer might be the romance and simplicity of the Austen age, where the most important news of the day was the arrival next door of a young, eligible bachelor. It was a world in which overheard conversations at a country dance, the imprudent behavior of a girl at a picnic, or a public snub in the village square would utterly change the course of your life. But this easy answer doesn't really explain the broad appeal of Jane Austen's novels. Her world is so unlike our own, that there simply must be more to it than romance. The fact is, that in spite of her limited experience, Jane Austen writes with tremendous wit, charm and perception. She appeals to the modern reader because she never minces words. She gets right into the heart of her characters, strips away the veneer of social grace, and makes shrewd observations about love, marriage, pride, snobbery, money and manners. Her opening sentences are a key to the clean, crisp writing you can expect from Austen. Take, for example, the character description that begins EMMA: &quot;Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence, and had lived nearly twenty one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.&quot; It is the brilliant use of the word 'seemed' that tips us off for the events that follow. In one sentence, Austen has given us a character who is spoiled, self assured and intelligent, and we can hardly wait to find out what is going to 'distress or vex her' in the following pages! Or what about the opening sentence of her most famous novel PRIDE AND PREJUDICE: &quot;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.&quot; What a marvelous assumption, and what delightful matchmaking schemes and foibles are about to unfold! Just picking one of Austen's novels at random gives you a wealth of charming observation. Take these thoughts on conversation, from NORTHANGER ABBEY: &quot;He shortly found himself arrived at politics, and from politics, it was an easy step to silence.&quot; ...and from &quot;SENSE AND SENSIBILITY &quot;Elinor agreed to it all, for she did not think he deserved the compliment of rational opposition.&quot; Or how about this wistful observation from PERSUASION: &quot;One does not love a place the less because one has suffered in it.&quot; You don't have to be a scholar to understand and appreciate Austen. Her novels will surprise and win over any first time reader, and they have an amazingly good shelf life - they can be read and reread. Here, in one volume you have a portrait of missed opportunity in the provocative novel PERSUASION; matchmaking gone awry in EMMA; masterful observations of two sisters and their different approaches to love in SENSE AND SENSIBILITY; snobbery and manners in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, and more. In short, Austen is a writer you never tire of. This is a must have in any collection, small or large!"},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"The book itself is gorgeous, and the novels are of the hard-to-put-down variety.

The illustrations were small, but showed up nicely and I had absolutely no issues with the format."},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"I'm so excited to have all of Jane Austen's Novels in one book. I've read through Sense and Sensibility and now I'm onto Pride and Prejudice. The print is a good readable size. I'm really enjoying this collection."},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"I was looking for an edition of Austen's collected works that fit well in my hands, and this fits the bill. The pages are crisp, clean and the typeset is quite handsome (rather easy on the eyes). It isn't too heavy or bulky and the pages don't unknowingly flail out of place--causing you to lose your spot. For the layperson, the introduction is an added benefit, but if you're smart you'll just skip right to desert and dive into Austen.On a side note: My copy has been through quite the beating. Several cherry danishes were inadvertently smashed into the pages, a glass of water was spilled and to top it all off: I dragged it all around the Americas while traveling this summer. So, believe it or not--it still looks brand new."},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"Mark Twain was not an admirer of Jane Austen's work as he once declared: \\"I often want to criticize Jane Austen, but her books madden me so that I can't conceal my frenzy from the reader; and therefore I have to stop every time I begin. Every time I read \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" I want to dig her up and beat her over the skull with her own shin-bone.\\"My first introduction to Austen's famous romances was \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Like Mark Twain, her writing style grated on my nerves so much I could not finish the book. While I believe in respecting the rest of the departed, I too was ready to get a shovel, disturb the author's grave and brutally pummel into dust what Mark Twain may have missed. Disappointed, I abandoned \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and eventually made a second attempt years later. By that time, I had hoped the chronological lapse would alter my prejudice against her style, forgive the pun, but it still had the same effect on my nerves, but at least I finished the book.Lo and behold, by some miraculous intervention I was persuaded to try again to see if I could appreciate her work, and this time not just with one novel, but to plough through all her famous books. If you cannot judge a book by its cover, surely we should not judge an author by one book alone? Especially Austen, someone who has withstood the test of time and has entered the history books as one of England's most famous authors. Would it be possible to overcome my prejudice that had become as unrelenting as Miss Elizabeth Bennet's towards the mysterious Mr. Darcy?To be honest, it was a struggle at first. I found myself flipping through the novels and wondering when would I get to the end. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" still stuck in this category for me, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" was also difficult, but after these two, I realized it was just the writing I disliked, get over it! Once I could turn a blind critical eye to her style and concentrate on the stories, the true talent of Austen began to shine through: her unique ability to portray the various characters of the landed gentry of the early 1800s in Regency Britannia, the plotting and scheming for social or monetary advancement, the love triangles, and how true love can over come all adversities even though life will always remain imperfect. Austen was gifted with a keen observation of human nature and possessed a refined sense of the satirical, a master at setting off events with the crash and collision of weak versus strong characters and how all things will settle themselves for better or worse depending on the choices each person makes.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" ~ After a death in the family, the once wealthy Dashwoods are reduced in their monetary means and are compelled by their change in circumstances to move to a humble cottage on the estate of a distant relative. Can the Dashwood sisters weather the trials of meagre living and find true love among the eligible men from the higher echelons of society now that they must suffer their reduced circumstances?\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" ~ Ah yes, the handsome Mr. Darcy, but out of misplaced pride he snubs Elizabeth Bennet on their introduction. Consequently she perceives him to be cold and aloof, sparking her prejudice against him despite his fortune and good looks. Will ever the twain meet?\\"Mansfield Park\\"~ Fanny Price, a girl from a poor family, is taken in as a ward by her wealthy uncle at Mansfield Park. Fanny is treated as a second class member of the household due to her charity status, but she valiantly suffers through the continual belittlement she suffers. However, an offer of marriage is made to her by someone she detests and the offer is forced upon her by her uncle as a fit match, her ward duly reminding her in so many words of her previous circumstances. As a charity case she could not expect to find anyone better. If she had not been raised in the elegant, refined setting of Mansfield, she would not find anyone in the social circles that mattered, and therefore should take what is on offer. Why, she should be grateful to accept someone who, knowing her former status, has condescended to take an interest in her, and whom he deems to be a fit spouse for her! Will shy, quiet Fanny have the courage to stand up for herself despite appearing ungrateful to her uncle?\\"Emma\\" ~ The delightful tale of a girl who thinks she knows everyone's heart and is ignorant of her own takes it upon herself to play matchmaker for her acquaintances to the amused chagrin of Mr. Knightly, a family friend. Poor Emma is in for a surprise when her games of love go awry. Will it all end as happily as she envisioned?\\"Northanger Abbey\\" ~ Catherine, the daughter of a clergyman, is invited by a family friend to visit the famous spa town of Bath with them. While there she meets a dashing young gentleman who soon catches her eye and her heart, however, another bachelor attempts to monopolize her time and keep her away from the attentions of anyone else. Can Catherine ditch the self-centred control freak and be allowed to pursue the man who mystifies her?\\"Persuasion\\" ~ Ah, young love! Anne has fallen in love with a captain in the navy, but is persuaded against the match by her aristocratic connections, reasons that all seemed good at the time. Years later, the lovers cross paths and Anne discovers her love is still very much alive. Can there be any hope when in earlier years there was much opposition to their match? More importantly, does he still feel the same way about her after she had rejected his offer?\\"Lady Susan\\" ~ an epistolary novel told through letters. Lady Susan is a devil-may-care socialite who has squandered her fortune makes life a misery for her family and friends. She continues to do so, scheming and plotting for her own ends and welfare. She is manipulative and cunning, and is especially cruel to her daughter Frederica because she is too much like her father and his family, whom she despises. Will Frederica find her true love, or be steered into marriage with a man she has no respect for?My personal favourites are \\"Northanger Abbey\\", \\"Lady Susan\\", and \\"Emma\\".\\"Northanger\\" is filled with colourful descriptions of the social life at Bath, and Austen's satire on the public's fascination with gothic novels was quite amusing indeed, a fun blend of gothic mystery with a humorous, bracing wake-up call to reality displaying the ambitious, greed-filled folly of human nature. \\"Lady Susan\\" and the depraved depths that vixen will go to deceive all around her for her own ends was a fascinating character study, so was \\"Emma\\" with her playful scheming to arrange the love lives of those closest to her, a capricious innocent tale in comparison with \\"Lady Susan\\"! One theme I find interesting in Austen's writings is the \`semi-outcast' family member who is treated harshly but manages to find happiness such as Anne in \\"Persuasion\\" and Fanny Price in \\"Mansfield Park\\". A second theme is \`toxic relationships' as seen with overbearing parents or guardians, for instance, Fanny's uncle in \\"Mansfield Park\\", \\"Lady Susan\\", and General Tilney in \\"Northanger Abbey\\". Obviously, Austen seemed to be fascinated with these topics and explored them in different settings.The final verdict: At long last, I can finally appreciate most of Austen's work, hurray! I am giving it the full five stars because her development of characters and social situations makes for fascinating reading when you get right down to it. I still have not quite warmed up to \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", but who knows? I promise to give it another chance, I may become the admiring convert, prejudice finally exchanged for undying appreciation.About the book itself, the edition I am referring to is printed by Wordsworth Library Collection, Wordsworth Editions Limited, (2007). ISBN 978-1-84022-556-3. This version is missing the novel \\"Sanditon\\", probably due to the fact Austen never finished it. I also heard that \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is missing a line in this edition, but as I am not an Austen expert, I do not know if this is true or not. For those of you who like footnotes, this book does not have them, so if you are looking for detailed historical explanations as you read, you will have to invest in another edition. I always find the Oxford World Classics editions very informative if you are inclined to learn more about the historical background of a book. As for the hardback quality, this particular edition is covered in cloth with gold etching for the title, and features a sticker with on the front for the image, not a embossed image printed directly into the cover. The pages are actually thin, the paper more suited for a pocketbook paperback, but if treated well, the book should not fall apart. It does present a pleasing presentation, and looks delightful on a collector's shelf. However, if you tend to be rough on books, you might want a more sturdy edition.E.A.

The 'leather' covers make it less susceptible to stains. The print is a comfortable size and the paper is thicker than I normally find in these collector type editions so they won't tear or wrinkle easily. The only negative (such a minor one at that) is that the novels are not broken down by volumes. Each of Austen's novels was originally published in 3 volumes.

Her name is practically synonymous with classic, understated romance, as well as comedies of manners with a subtle, sly sense of humor.And the Penguin Classics Deluxe edition of Austen's \\"The Complete Novels\\" brings together the full complement of Austen's finished novels, from the little-known \\"Lady Susan\\" to the classic bestseller \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" (and everything in between). This collection is flled with lovably flawed heroines, beautiful formal prose, and some rather unconventional love stories.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" become a problem when Elizabeth Bennett takes a dislike to the handsome, aloof Mr. Darcy -- and her prejudice against him builds after he sabotages her sister's love match, and the charming Wickham drops some shocking claims about Darcy's nastiness. But the facts are very different -- and when scandal hits the Bennett family, Darcy may be their only hope. And \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" clash when the two very different Dashwood sisters, smart Elinor and romantic Marianne, both fall in love -- one with a man she can't have, and the other with a guy who may be horribly unsuitable.Anne Elliott has a problem with \\"Persuasion,\\" since she was once engaged to the impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth, but was persuaded to break it off. Now he's returned from war as a wealthy hero... and Anne still loves him. \\"Mansfield Park\\" is the backdrop for shy Fanny's life with her rich relatives, who usually treat her as a servant -- except for her kindly cousin, Edmund. But when the flirtatious, fashionable Crawfords arrive in the neighborhood, it unbalances the lives of everyone at Mansfield Park.And \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a fitting location for Austen's spoof on gothic romances, in which the hyperimaginative Catherine Moreland is taken under the wing of the Tilney family, and especially handsome Henry -- and learns a lesson about the difference between fantasy and reality. \\"Emma\\" is a frothy romantic comedy about a rich, somewhat spoiled young lady who tries to arrange the lives of people around her so that everyone is happy. The problem is, life isn't that simple -- and neither is love. And as an addition to Austen's main body of work, this edition includes the novella \\"Lady Susan,\\" who is sort of the evil sociopathic twin of Emma -- a brilliant and manipulative widow who seduces, plots and schemes. Yummy stuff.The omnibus collection displays the range and depth of Austen's writing skill beautifully; though each story is very unique they're laced together by common themes. Except for \\"Lady Susan,\\" each story is a love story, tempered with some clever commentary on the society of Austen's day (example: entailment, which plays a part in several plots), and a biting, sharp-edged wit (the mockery of the toadying Mr. Collins and the obnoxious Elliott family).And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen painted her stories vividly -- there's a bit of roughness in \\"Lady Susan\\" and \\"Persuasion,\\" but nothing too dramatic. Each one has powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"), as well as deliciously witty dialogue (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But she also weaves in some intensely romantic moments as well (\\"Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman, that his love has an earlier death. I have loved none but you\\").Austen also had an interesting range of heroines -- quiet ones, melodramatic ones, intelligent ones, naive ones, and mildly spoiled ones who think they know best. But each one has a major character flaw that must be overcome before she can find true love and happiness And she has an equally fascinating range of love interests: the quiet shy Colonel Brandon, the sexy and clever Henry Tilney, the blunt Mr. Knightley, the generous and honest Edmund, and especially the smart, sexy Mr. Darcy (who has a flaw of his own to overcome alongside Lizzie).Jane Austen's \\"Complete Novels\\" draws together all her finished novels, and let readers explore the mannered society and obstacle-filled love lives of her heroines."},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"This is the second time I've ordered this book. Sadly, the first time they were unable to get the book for me. I tried again a year later, again there were delays but when the book finally arrived I was delighted. For years I've been looking for a nice library edition of Jane Austen novels for my own collection. This beautiful, cloth bound, gold-leaf engraved book is well worth the wait. As others have already described the book perfectly, I'll not be redundant. The size of the book is a bit larger than any of my Bibles, but remember there are seven books in this one volume. I expected it to be large and it is, but not too heavy. I also expected the print to be quite small and was delighted to find that the print was of average size and easily legible.

Good value!"},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"I personally love all of Austen's works so when I saw that they were all compiled together in this book and at such a great price I could not let the opportunity slip away. My personal favorite novel is Pride and Prejudice which along with Sense and Sensibility and Emma are some of her most famous works having been made into movies as well. However nothing is better than the novels themselves. As a young woman I cant say I can exactly relate to the characters in Austen's novels but I feel a connection with them because I am a young woman. Her novels depict a glimpse into the world of the young women of her time and though we live in very different times now, there are certain feelings that reamin exactly the same. I difinetly recommend all of these novels to any young woman out there because each of the protagonists in these novels is a heorine in her own right even if at times we find they are greatly flawed. It is their flaws that make them so human. This is a great collection to give a daughter or a niece or any young female in your life because it is something that was written by an intelligent woman about intellegant women."},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"I made the mistake of purchasing the paperback 8-in-1 Jane Austen book - what a mistake!

I found it too depressing and unpleasant to read, so I ordered this version, and I am so happy I did! What a gorgeous book, classy and elegant, with lovely illustrations, nice typeset, padded leather cover and gilt edges. And for only a few dollars more, it's a no-brainer decision to choose this version over the paperback. Even if you go with a used copy, it's still a far better bargain than the other one, and something you'll enjoy reading with pleasure for years to come. I will definitely look into the other classics in this series."},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"Ol' Jane comes in for a bit of stick, these days, what with pre-feminist theory and post-modern analysis: she's been seized by the acadmeics on one hand, and the romance-seeks on the other. So people tend to presume she has little to offer the non-specialist late twentieth century reader in terms of identification and insight. Well, au contraire, as they say down my local wine-bar! Ms Austen is a bitingly acerbic social commentator: few escape her acid observations - good characters and villains alike. Okay, so her world is small, but hey - so is Jackie Collins', Toni Morrisons's or any dozen other contemporary novelists' milieu. We all write what we know and, in a greater sense, if the writing is up to it, communicate on a level far deeper and more globally profound than the mere contrivancies of the plot and setting. I know it'sa early nineteen century England but, hey, do people change that much over time and space? I think not; the human condition is universal and tediously constant. From strong Emma in the eponymous novel, to quietly sardonic Anne in Persuasion and on through the entire Bennett family, Austen's characters transcend their era and make me laugh, cry and giggle at thjeir wit and observations. So the next time you go to turn your nose up at Austen as either too highbrow, too romancy or just too dasn out of date, give the lady a second chance, eh pal? Nearly two hundred years on and she can still write the pants off most twentieth century novelists."},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"...instead of the free ones. For a very cheap price, you get a table of contents and great navigation. It's a really nice compilation of Jane Austen's work for Kindle. The illustrations are very nice to see. I have had no problem with the illustrations like a few reported. I have the K3.This is the very first book I bought for my new Kindle. ^^"},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"This book is certainly not as advertised. The dust jacket AND cover clearly state that it contains the complete novels of Jane Austen. It enumerates all seven in both locations. It never gives any indication whatsoever that this might be the first volume of two. Indeed the first printed page declares that it is in one volume.Despite all this, the table of contents only lists the first four books from the cover. That is all that is contained within. No 'Persuasion.' No 'Lady Susan.' And most important to me, no 'Northanger Abbey' -- the book I was planning to read immediately. Amazing.Please be aware that the Bloomsbury Books edition (Under license from Penguin dated 1994) with the cover as shown on this page (with the customer image from Dilli) has these substantial defects.

The Complete Works of Jane Austen offers the reader novels of the trials and tribulations of a young lady stepping into her adulthood. Also explored is the self-realization of the heroine's true emotions concerning the one she loves and those she interacts with in her small yet vibrant English countryside society. Jane Austen only writes of which she understands, thus one never is permitted to overhear the converstion of two men unless a woman is present or is there ever an indepth discussion of business or politics. Having each novel's story be guided by a young heroine allows Jane Austen to critique the customs and manners of the countryside middle class. With wit and honesty she unveils many trivial and oppresssing social rituals, yet magnifies those personality characteristics which she finds honorable and useful. The novels of Jane Austen are delightful and beautifully written."},{"Title":"The complete novels of Jane Austen","review":"I have loved these books since junior high school and now with this beautiful edition I can have it all!

I purchased this book because it had all of Jane Austen's works and I wanted the convenience of having them all in a single set. This wasn't the book for me. First of all, it was HUGE- and made reading it uncomfortable. In addition, all 6 stories were present, but there was no differentiating them unless you wanted to look at the page numbers.

The story tells about what happened in 10,000 BC through the 1900's. In 10,000 BC people lived by hunting, fishing and gathering. This was important because they would have food to eat and they would use the animals' fur and hide for clothes and tents. These people were called nomads.8,000 years later in 2,000 BC, the first farmers learned how to grow crops. Growing crops was a new skill that was developed. Other skills they learned were pottery, cloth weaving and metal working. The people of 2000 BC believed that a goddess made their crops grow and they also believed in gods.1,400 years later in 600 BC people learned how to smelt iron. With the iron they could make better weapons and tools. The people could use the weapons to hunt and kill. They also could use the tools to construct huts to live in. Also a good plow was invented to help farm.In 100 AD the Roman Empire brought a new way of life. The new way of life was that their village became a town. The town had hundreds of people and a bridge had been built so that the people wouldn't have to ride on a boat to get across the river. A family that is rich lived in a domus and they made slaves do all of the hard work.In 600 AD invaders came to Europe and destroyed the new way of life. The life they lived was horrible. The invaders destroyed the people's homes, the fort, and piped water. They also destroyed the baths and toilets. The villagers ate wild boar, sheep and pigs. The fish traps provided the villagers with fresh fish.In 900 AD Barbarians settled in the village and became Christians. Different invaders were attacking the village. These invaders were called Viking Raiders. The Viking Raiders came to the village to find treasure and slaves. The people were scared and they tried to hide their treasure. Some people were killed and some people were taken away.In 1200 AD the ruler of the medieval village was called a lord. He built a castle to protect the people. The lord's son and his son's wife ran the village for the lord. The lord and his family lived a better life then the villagers. The village people lived in small houses.In the 1400's a trade for boats made a village grow into a town. Some people in the town had become very rich. People who were rich could afford high priced glass and toilets. The poor people from the town had to drink water from the dirty river. People in the town threw their trash in the street.In the 1500's a disease called Black Death came to Europe. Black Death was a disease that was carried by fleas and black rats. The disease killed most of the people in the town. People who died were taken in a death cart and were buried in a plague pit. The people tried to help themselves by burning sulfur in the street to get rid of the deadly infection.In the 1600's war broke out. The town was under attack by enemy soldiers. The enemy soldiers were fighting the town's people over religion and who should rule the country. The church, stone castle and Miller's house that had most of the lord's flour were burned down. Also many people died.In the 1700's peace had returned to the town and war had ended. Some houses were repaired after the war. The lord lived in a mansion. The poor people were cramped and lived together. Coffee was imported and became a drink. People sold fruit, flour and other goods. A mail coach was a type of transportation that carried passengers and mail from town to town.In the early 1800's coal was discovered. Air was bad from the smoke of the coal and conditions were also bad for the people. Factory wages were low and the town's people had to work long hours. Children also worked to earn money.In late 1800's the town had grown into a city. Conditions had improved. A new train carried people from towns to cities. A town hall was built to celebrate the wealth of the city. Steam engines were used to power boats and locomotives.In the 1900's to the new millennium an airplane is a new type of transportation. People have more time to have fun and they have more time to rest and play. Businesses replaced heavy industries because they didn't want waste in their surroundings. People now live in houses or apartments. The government protects ancient monuments and the people. The Street Through Time is a great, unique, and fantastic book to read and to learn about the past."},{"Title":"A Street Through Time","review":"While this book is wonderfully illustrated, I purchased it for an adult. This is definitely not adult material. I would purchase it for a child (up to 12 years of age)and should be labeled as such."},{"Title":"A Street Through Time","review":"I've had to buy a second copy of this wonderful book for my 14 year old son. He was deeply distressed when, thinking he'd outgrown it, I'd passed our first copy on to his school. The recommended age range is far too narrow, for adults have enjoyed it as a coffee table book as much as six year old visitors who find the transformation of years magical. My own children were impressed that civilizations do not always progress forward -- \\"The Invaders\\" and \\"The Plague Strikes\\" gave them a more dynamic sense of history. The fine illustrations pull the reader in, the rendering of characters give each of them full personality and interest. My kids generally have very limited interest in non-fiction; this one remains a favorite of their collection."},{"Title":"A Street Through Time","review":"I originally bought this book for my older child, but my 4 year old son keeps this book glued to his side! I love the wonderful, detailed illustrations as well as the fascinating historical content. It brings to life the changes that occurred in a city in a way that words sometimes find hard to express, with a humor that children and adults alike will find charming. It has become one of my favorite books!"},{"Title":"A Street Through Time","review":"This is not a history text; it will not give you factoids or dates. But it will enliven your appreciation of the passage of time and the continuity of human existence. This is a large but lightweight book. Each page is approximately 13 by 10 inches, and each of the fourteen depictions are shown in a two-page spread of about 26 inches by 10. The site depicted is an area near a waterway, presumably in the English midlands, and the eras shown are 10,000 BCE, showing a winter settlement of Stone Age hunters; 2000 BCE, an early farming settlement; 600 BCE, the Iron Age; AD 100, during Roman occupation; 600, after the collapse of Roman civilization to barbarian invaders; 900, after the Viking raids; 1200s, a medieval village; 1400s, a medieval town; 1500s, during the Bubonic Plague; 1600s, during a time of religious wars; 1700s, the Regency period; early 1800s, the beginning of industrialization; late 1800s, a thriving city; and finally, a modern city. In successive time periods we see objects and buildings from the last era in ruins or having been adapted for other uses. We see that some things never change (boating or imbibing, for example) while others change markedly (technology, cleanliness, etc.), and that to \\"progress\\" is not always to move forward.A fun book with lively cross-section watercolor drawings that will bring the concept of history to life, this book will lose some relevance for North American readers (who might also enjoy Gail Gibbons' FROM PATH TO HIGHWAY about the Boston Post Road through history), but it is still eminently worthwhile and enjoyable."},{"Title":"A Street Through Time","review":"&quot;A Street Through Time&quot; is a lovely, informative, child-friendly approach to history. My five year old adores it. We have probably read it 50 times. Great details, great jumping off spots for all kinds of different discussions with kids.I think the 9 - 12 age recommendation is too narrow. I think that inquisitive 4 and 5 year olds will love it too (and if they don't this year, they will soon!)"},{"Title":"A Street Through Time","review":"Though the age recommendation for this book is 9-12, our son got this book when he was only 4 years old and it has remained one of his favorites. Now, nearly two and a half years after he got it, it was taken into school just this week by him as \\"something special to show the class.\\" Adults as well as kids can learn a lot about history from this book. Each page is from a different period in time, supposedly on the same plot of land (presumably in Europe). It is a great springboard for exploring ANY historical time... and where it fits in with others. The illustrations are wonderful and search-and-find type information snippets written around the borders help bring some starting points for discussion. Couldn't recommend this book more!"},{"Title":"A Street Through Time","review":"This is one of those books with GREAT detailed images that children love to dwell on for ages. Although they are looking for the similaries/changes from age to age, and looking for the little man cleverly hidden in each image, they are unknowingly also learning a LOT, as evidenced by the many questions they will ask. The idea of history and \\"long ago times\\" is often a difficult concept for younger children to grapple with, but this book (and others like it) serve as a great tool for starting to understand these ideas while they have great fun at the same time. Steve Noon has an remarkable artist's eye for detail (and for conveying it) that reminds me of David MacCaulay's books, which I also highly recommend, ex: \\"Pyramid\\", \\"Mill\\", \\"Castle\\", \\"Cathredral\\", etc."},{"Title":"A Street Through Time","review":"My children greatly enjoy all the books in this series, and while Anne Millard does a great job with the facts it is the art of Steve Noon that really makes these books phenomenal. Easily understood information that is very interesting appears on each page, and with characters you can follow throughout the book you can spend a long time searching for them -- which allows you to really appreciate all the other historically accurate mini-scenes that play out all over. I will admit that I have been known to look through these books even when my children aren't around. This book, and all the others in this series, should be enjoyable for all children of all ages. Even those who aren't old enough to read will still love the pictures and learn something. Older children learn quite a bit, and keep coming back to the book because there is always something new to find. I highly recommend this book, and encourage any parent to add all of them to their collection!"},{"Title":"A Street Through Time","review":"This book presents a dozen historically significant dates and vignettes from the stone age to the present day. The realistic illustrations of the street, its buildings and inhabitants show a snapshot of each age plus lingering elements from earlier times. A scene from circa 1500 AD, for example, shows intimate details and panoramic views: a white cross marking the door of a quarantined house, the visible panic of a plague victim upon seeing the black pustules under his arm, a medieval windmill built on a prehistoric barrow, a castle built on the ruins of a Roman fort, etc. The drama and detail help history come alive for readers.Adults may not learn anything new from A Street Through Time but children glean a great deal of information from the labeled illustrations and interesting facts listed in the margins. My kids inspect this book repeatedly, paying special attention to the activities of their young counterparts down through the ages."},{"Title":"A Street Through Time","review":"This is a complete and utter thrill to read, both for me and my 7 year old son. We sit for hours looking over the book, discussing history from a more adult viewpoint. He has learned more from this book than he has from any other single educational document thus far.I will get this book for everyone I know, and recommend it to everyone I don't know...watch out...their might be a run on this book, so buy it now.We got it as a gift from a English friend who attended Oxford (full ride scholorship - a brillant guy). He loved it!!!"},{"Title":"A Street Through Time","review":"I would recommend this book to kids who are interested in history, because I love history and I loved this book.

I thought it was great."},{"Title":"A Street Through Time","review":"A Street Through TimeI purchased this book for my almost 9 year old grandson. Very different and unusual way to depict how every day activities and things have changed over the centuries. Excellent illustrations and text.

Highly recommend."},{"Title":"A Street Through Time","review":"I love this book and have worn out two copies.

You could take hours going through the pages of this book--Where's Waldo on a much more advanced level and history too. Any child over 8--and most adults--will treasure this and return to it again and again. A great grandparent gift."},{"Title":"A Street Through Time","review":"I saw this book in my oncologist office and it made the waiting time go fast. I ordered one copy and my son in law spent two weeks looking it over noticing every detail. I will be getting more for my other grandchildren. I love that you need to note every detail as something will show up in the coming years. For example the chest that is buried in one page but shows up as hidden treasure years later. I can't image that anyone would not enjoy this book and spend hours looking at it. Great for kids!"},{"Title":"A Street Through Time","review":"I'm in fourth grade and this book is really good because it makes history come to life. When I got the book I had to open it and I couldn't stop reading it - it is sooooo awesome! I liked that it didn't have many words and you can concentrate on the pictures. The pictures make you feel like you are inside the book and living with the people in the pictures. The pictures are very detailed and interesting. I could look at them for hours. My favorite part was seeing life then the plague strikes!"},{"Title":"A Street Through Time","review":"This book is not an in depth history book.

The pages are wonderfully imaginative and vivid, and the educational factor isn't so much in memorizing the dates and locations as it is simply gazing at a diorama of life, hundreds of years ago. I remember being shocked as a kid looking at the sudden decline of the Roman Empire depicted in this book, and years later reading about the Barbarians, I was able to put that knowledge in context. This book is a wonderful tool for all those interested in history."},{"Title":"A Street Through Time","review":"Kids love this book. Aside from the obvious, history & technology, it invites conversation about how language has grown & developed through time. I have used it as an introduction for discussion of spelling patterns found in Anglo-Saxon, Latin and Greek, in the English language. It provides a visual link for kids to grab onto and they keep going back for more."},{"Title":"A Street Through Time","review":"This book has fascinated every member of our family for nearly 10 years.

I want to purchase a few more just to give as gifts."},{"Title":"A Street Through Time","review":"There are few publishers putting out such consistent quality nonfiction as DK and this book is just one more fine example of this. The concept--showing the same small geographic site through time from Stone Age to contemporary--is brilliant. It lets the reader see in concise, concrete fashion the historic changes wrought by technology, warfare, agriculture, etc. It brings a very abstract and thus hard to grasp idea (especially for children) down to a manageable level.The times chosen are well-selected and include:Stone Age--nomadic lifestyle2000 BCE--agriculture, permanent livingIron Age--rise of iron tools, domestication of animalsRoman times--larger polished stone structures, trade ships600 A.D.--regression back to pre-Roman1200s--early Medieval village, shops1400's--the village has prospered, become a town--more trade (look for those ship rats!)1500s--grim plague year1600s--religious wars1700s--early 1800s--rise of industry and its huge impact, good and badlate 1800s--a full-size cityContemporaryThe text is clear and concise. The illustrations are wonderfully detailed, not just pictorially but culturally as well, showing changes in religion, food, clothing, class distinctions, farming, shipping technology etc. The plague year's horror is highlighted by being the only pages done at night. Beyond the history, kids will have lots of fun (akin to Where's Waldo) looking for particular characters mentioned in the text (\\"can you find the woman . . . \\") or just looking to see what each character is doing.Parents who don't want to introduce their children to some of humanity's more ugly aspects (we see war, killing, setting houses on fire, etc.) or nature's (plague, bodies floating in water) may want to skip this. If you are fine with that, I can't recommend the book enough. A good marriage of text and illustration, fun and educational, details that will provide literally hours of engagement--highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Street Through Time","review":"all the kids AND adults in our house are endlessly fascinated by this book. we always find something on every page that we hadn't noticed before. aside from the hundreds of historical details is the gorgeous artwork, placing the street/town in various times of day and seasons of the year. you can almost smell the fall air, the snow in winter. i've seen most of the \\"a ____ through time\\" books, and this is the best, in my opinion. the scale is not too big, and not too small. this a book that will be pored over for many years."},{"Title":"A Street Through Time","review":"It's informative even though it's short.(short and sweet)It's got great historically accurate town/village/city settings.It's wonderful for smart studious children."},{"Title":"A Street Through Time","review":"The illustrations really make this series. There are just no words to convey the amount of detail and since all illustrations are a complete double-page-spread, they fit a lot in. Each turn of the page offers a slightly later view of the (usually) same location, so it is easy to witness the growth of civilizations and cities and streets and cultures.Even kids who cannot read love these, since you almost forget that there are words at all. When they can read, they suddenly &#34;discover&#34; that there are, indeed, words and the text is limited to the basics, never detracting from the true story, which is in the illustrations themselves.Totally worth it and fascinating to girls and boys."},{"Title":"A Street Through Time","review":"We homeschool, and both my 7 and 5 year old have been studying history over the last two years, from early history, into Greek then Roman times, and now in the Middle Ages.

Excellent reference for messages and how Dephi handles them, and how you can handle them. Excellent reference on OOP implemented in Delphi (finding classes, components; Owning, parenting; Creating, Destroying). Many explanations on the techniques used throughout the Dephi source code.

This appears to be in contradiction to the message of Christian charity, and the condemnation which they consistently encounter appears to have little foundation in the original Scriptural sources.Father Shinnick, whose work with AIDS sufferers and others led to an award from the Australian state, presents a new approach from an RC viewpoint, arguing that the positive aspects of homosexuality are ignored in the tumult of condemnation to which it is subjected.Especially troubling is Fr Shinnick's association, illustrated by case-studies, of around thirty per cent of juvenile suicides with a growing awareness of a homosexual identity. His voice, an informed appeal for understanding and acceptance, is one which well deserves our attention. His work readily deserves to be read by both Catholics and non-Catholics concerned with matters of human nature and sexuality."},{"Title":"This Remarkable Gift: Being Gay & Catholic","review":"I met Fr.

He pioneered a pastoral program for people living with HIV/AIDS and is chaplain of ACCEPTANCE, an organization that supports gay and lesbian Catholics.His book is dedicated to his brother Frank who recently died of AIDS, \\"a brother of generosity, courage and integrity, 1932-1996\\".Significant is the the second quote under his brother's name: \\"The Bible contains six admonitions to homosexuals and three hundred and sixty-two admonitions to heterosexuals.

Why? Mainly because it contended that the Soviets had done an autopsy on Hitler's body and found he had had only one testicle. For many years, an entire industry grew up around this ridiculous myth. Authors swallowed the story hook, line, and sinker, and claimed that Hitler's monorchism (having one testicle), was the cause of his anti-semitism, anti-Bolshevism and all his other psychological traumas.Anyone should have known then that this Russian report was politically inspired and completely fabricated. When the Soviet Union finally toppled, in 1991, Bezymenskii admitted in several interviews that he was forced to invent the &quot;missing testicle&quot; story to avoid being sent to a Gulag. I guess that was motivation enough, but this idiotic fiction fooled many in the intervening thirty years.The book is dry, poorly translated and contains proven lies. There's no point in reading it unless you want a laugh or two."},{"Title":"The Death of Adolf Hitler Unknown Documents from Soviet Archives","review":"This book uncovers a wealth of Soviet information concerning the last hours of Adolf Hitler and what happened to his body. Not only is good, convincing data provided but rare photos of Hitler's body but also even one of Blondi (Hitler's dog whom was a guinea pig in a cynide effectiveness experiment). The book's only drawback was the author's over-the-top Soviet disposition and inclinations.

The book provides many solid ideas and honest discussions about successes other teachers have had exposing their classes to formal literature from the Epic of Gilgamesh to Kafka. There are no canned lesson plans here, a strength, I believe, as it allows the teacher to be creative and flexible.Each chapter is an essay by a teacher disucssing how they exposed their students to the stories or poems with examples of student's work. This appealed to me. The grades of students using the classics varied from elementary (4th and 5th grade) to seniors in high school) with a remarkable results. Certainly not every teaching method or idea will work for everyone - but the variety, approaches and voices of the teachers have something for everyone.In some cases reknowned scholars (such as Richard Lattimore) provided assistance in the classroom in dissecting and disucssing works, not always an option for teachers. (Hence the 4 stars). However there is plenty of material here for instructional support and to get students to be not only familar with but embrace and understand great writing.

Semmes pens a book perhaps more relevant today as when it was published in Februay 1996.One sentence seemingly encapsualtes the history of the industrial boom and the determining factors used by the various power brokers in locating factories and other facilities, \\"Blacks are overrepresented in 'high risk' occupations, which frequently expose them to toxic chemicals, and African-American communities are more likely than other communities to be located near dumping grounds for municipal refuse and toxic waste.\\"Go to any urban center throughout this country and you may see one or many more rusting factories, long-since abandoned, with soil so contaminated that property that should be worth hundreds of millions of dollars for redevelopment is worth next to nothing. And what population was living, working and raising families near the plants? Exactly.The chapter entitled, Emancipation and the Roots of Health, sets the foundation for tightly-packed explorations into a gamut of issues, including, Psychosocial Factors of Health, Environmental Toxicity and -the important - Contemporary Challenges to Health; Destabiliztion, Maladoptation and Consumer Manipulation.But there is also a message of hope. Semmes points to a new beginning, the opportunity to start picking up the pieces and building a real health-care system that will address the past wrongs of racism and deliver the care needed today & tomorrow in, Strategies for Change; Community Action and Public Policy.A society is doomed without proper health-care. Semmes does a great service in exposing the past for what it was and showing a path to care that will truly serve in a professional & affordable fashion."},{"Title":"Racism, Health, and Post-Industrialism: A Theory of African-American Health","review":"Dr. Semmes has written an excellent book about the underlying reasons for critical health issues among Blacks.

Secondly, they incorrectly state on the copyright page that the original edition was published by Knopf in 1895(!), not 1920. Third, and this is what really pisses me off, is that they simply reproduced the See Sharp Press edition type, while omitting the footnotes and the introductory publisher's note (the layout matches exactly, and there's even the same typo -- misplaced quotation mark -- in the second line of the first page of the text (p. 21).It's sad when a publisher tries to rip off another publisher, and poorly.

These things need to be addressed!It must be stated that Nietzsche hated Christianity, but if your faith can stand against his critcism, then you will be better off for having read this book.Even though some of Nietzsche's attacks against Christianity are true, it does seem that he sets up the religion as a straw man and as a scapegoat. If you look beyond this, and the fact that he wrote this right before he lost his marbles, you will find a benefit in reading this."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"With his diabolic polemic talent Friedrich Nietzsche fights a Homeric battle with his evil dragon, Christianity, its creed, its actions, its history and its ministers.Christianity in generalChristianity is the great innermost corruption, the mortal blemish of mankind.It has no contact with reality: imaginary causes (God, soul, unfree will), imaginary effects (sin, punishment, forgiveness, redemption, grace), imaginary psychology (presence of God, temptation by the devil), imaginary teleology (eternal life, Last Judgment).It is the religion of pity, the practice of nihilism. It conserves all that is miserable and is thus a prime instrument of decadence. It despises the body, thereby reducing mankind to a kind of self-violation.CreedThe theory that God sacrificed his son for the remission of sin is gruesome paganism: the sacrifice of the guiltless one for the sins of all the guilty.The immaculata conceptio dirties the origin of man.The Last Judgment and the immortality of the soul are instruments of torture, systems of cruelty. The doctrine of personal immortality places life\`s centre of gravity not in life, but in the \`beyond'.The concept of sin is a self-violation of man.Faith, priestsThe Christian is a domestic sick animal. Where the will to power is lacking, there is decline.Faith discredits reason, knowledge and inquiry, which are forbidden ways of investigation. Faith means closing one's eyes to oneself once and for all.The priest is a holy parasite. He is a professional negator, slanderer and poisoner of life. He rules through the invention of sin.UnacceptableNietzsche's slogan \`war not peace' and his fundamental contempt of the weak are unacceptable. So is his profound anti-democratic stance: \`the order of the castes is a sanction of a natural order, a natural lawfulness. The inequality of rights is the first condition for the existence of any rights at all.'With his anti-Kantian shout, \`every man has to invent his own categorical imperative', Friedrich Nietzsche wrote one of the most violent pamphlets of all time.A must read, critically."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"THE ANTICHRIST (1888) is Nietzsche's most coherent and well-organized work, in some ways a rhetorical masterpiece, yet at the same time a striking example of his infantile megalomania and insupportable presumption. He dedicates it to the man of tomorrow who can endure \\"my seriousness, my passion,\\" who is \\"accustomed to living on mountaintops--and to looking upon the wretched gabble of politics and nationalism as beneath him,\\" who moreover has \\"the courage for the forbidden, predestination for the labyrinth.\\" But very shortly he is writing as though that man of tomorrow had already arrived, multiplied and gathered around him in a cluster: \\"we ourselves, we free spirits, are already a transvaluation of all values... this higher type of man... we others, who have the courage for health and likewise for contempt...\\" This said by a puny, sickly and neglected ex-professor who takes drugs to go to the bathroom and to go to sleep. He rails against \\"the learned world of Germany, three-fourths of which is made up of the sons of preachers and teachers,\\" himself being the rebellious end-product of five generations of clergymen. He makes his famous pronouncement, that \\"there was only one Christian, and he died on the cross,\\" and characterizes Jesus as a revolutionary distorted by nineteen centuries of church obfuscation; then declares that only \\"we free spirits\\" can understand him, so that \\"one might actually call Jesus 'a free spirit.'\\" Thus while seeking to destroy the church, he provides a goad to its renewal, like Kierkegaard in his ATTACK UPON CHRISTENDOM (1855).Actually Nietzsche's attack is upon Paul, whom he sees as the inventor of Christianity, and upon the \\"slave mentality\\" of the Jews who found a psychological way to weaken and defeat their Roman masters--by injecting pity, guilt and heavenly judgement into their healthy minds and institutions. He glorifies the Roman Empire, which he misrepresents as the fulfillment of the Greek ideal, and anathematizes the \\"dirty Jew,\\" the \\"evil-smelling mess of Jewish rabbinism,\\" and the power-usurping logic of the Christian priesthood (\\"three times Jewish\\") as unspeakable filth, weakness and decadence. His re-evaluation is maximally blasphemous, but also inspired, insightful and thought-provoking, and must be read as cultural history, though it remains on the level of adolescent protest.The chief flaw in his attack is treating Christian history as stages in an unfolding conspiracy, as if Paul planned the Crusades and Luther intended to end the Renaissance. With equal or greater justice, one could claim that Nietzsche heralded the Third Reich, which embodied so many of his principles, such as \\"What is good?--Whatever augments the feeling of power, the will to power, power itself, in man.\\" (Section 2) And: \\"What is freedom?.. That one is prepared to sacrifice human beings for one's cause, not excluding oneself.\\" (TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS, section 38) His apologists want to write off his canonization by the Nazis as just an unfortunate episode, and indeed after the war he was adopted by the political left, as Allan Bloom has shown in THE CLOSING OF THE AMERICAN MIND (1987), but actually Nietzsche was simply a egotist with a bad temper and no political persuasion, an anarchist with delusions of grandeur, and any attempt to realize his ideas socially is certain to prove a disaster.The reason to read this version of THE ANTICHRIST is that H.L. Mencken, the famous journalist, turned Nietzsche's German into such direct, plain-spoken American English that it puts the haranguing philosopher right up in your face. Also Mencken, himself an Anti-Semite, brings out the strain of anti-Semitism in this work in all its ugly rancor, so that it cannot be mistaken, though elsewhere Nietzsche blasts anti-Semitism as well. He thought himself above judgement, and it is an anomaly of history that any grown-up ever took him seriously, but then he said the same thing about Saint Paul. Both were tormented geniuses who tranformed the world, and we must deal with the consequences."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"Although untrained in philosophy (as you will undoubtedly infer), I have read quite a bit on my own. Of course, while reading philosophy I often (usually) encounter writings which denigrate Christianity, often times with very solid argument. However, I have never been as captivated by a book which stands in such complete opposition to my own beliefs as I was by \\"The Antichrist.\\"Nietzsche's passion, rage, scorn and conviction are utterly compelling. Compared to such bland offerings like \\"Why I Am Not A Christian\\" by Bertrand Russell, this book really sparks (two different animals, I know). I sensed that, while writing this book, Nietzsche was simultaneously sinking into the depths of his madness AND thinking as clearly as he'd ever dared. He comes across as both complete loon and literary genius. Truly captivating reading!I will say that I disagree with almost all that Nietzsche writes in this book. As a Christian, I have the luxury of being able to call some things right and some things wrong without being tripped up by relativism. Nonetheless, it is a singularly powerful and captivating read, regardless of stance. I would recommend this book to anyone searching for passionate, vigorous and captivating philosophy."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"This book comes across with the bull-in-a-china-shop subtelty we've all learned to love in Nietzsche. But even if you've read all of his other books, nothing will prepare you for this. This is not as much an explanation - you'll find that in his &quot;A Geneology of Morals&quot; - of why Christianity is evil, but rather a fitting end to Nietzsche's career as an author. By far the most outspoken and direct book of his. A masterpiece, not only for the philosphical insights, but also for the prose."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"Anthony M. Ludovici is one of the first translators of Nietzsche's works into English. I have at least eight Nietzsche volumes translated by him, which also makes him one of the most prolific and accomplished. Ludovici was not only a master of German, he was a superb English stylist--a combination of skills lacked by Nietzsche's later translators. His rendition of THE ANTICHRIST is not only accurate, it is wonderful to read. I hope this is the first of many Ludovici reprints. I also heartily recommend Ludovici's own books."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"Is Nietzsche fair to Christianity? Of course he isn't. That isn't what he set out to do. Nietzsche set out to destroy Christianity. He adopted a take-no-prisoners approach. If Christianity can survive Nietzsche's onslaught, it can survive anything.Why is this book important? Because criticism is good; criticism is what advances knowledge. And let's face it: there is a side of Christianity that is open to some of Herr Nietzche's criticisms. Christianity, in some of its manifestations, can become maudlin in its humanitarianism and totalitarian in its political aspirations (keep in mind Dostoevsky's Grand Inquisitor!). In its zeal to comfort the afflicted, Christianity can end up doing harm to the higher type of man. Christians can avoid such dangerous excesses by giving this book a careful perusal. Nietzche's heady dose of castor oil criticism can only serve to strengthen Christianity by purging it of its sentimental weaknesses.There is another reason to read the book: even when at his most wrong-headed, Nietzsche still tosses out one brilliant insight after another. His remark, for instance, about the dishonesty of most philosophers is all too true. &quot;I except a few skeptics--the decent type in the history of philosophy,&quot; Nietzsche writes: &quot;the rest are simply unaware of the most basic requirements of intellectual honesty.&quot; Precisely! And for those who believe Nietzsche was a fascist brute who believed that superior men could stomp on their inferiors with impunity, consider the following stricture: &quot;When the exceptional human being treats the mediocre more tenderly than himself and his peers, this is not mere politeness of the heart--it is simply his duty.&quot; Recommended despite its unfairness to the Christian faith."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"I have loaned this out so many times I feel like I should start asking for a fee.

The theme of this book or perhaps extended essay is the criticism and/or condemnation of the Christian faith. I must admit I am surprised how many of Nietzsche's points are still very relevant today despite the fact this book was written 1888. I will address the former statement in a moment.I viewed this book more as critique, than some written abomination that should never see the light of day. I should state I am more of a spiritual person than a religious one, so I wasn't offended by Nietzsche's views. So for all you Christians out there before you become upset with this book just remember it is a man's opinion and everyone is entitled to have one.As I noted prior, many points presented in \\"The Antichrist\\" are still very relevant today. For instance, it speaks about how Christianity uses sin as a propaganda tool. Therefore followers of faith (Nietzsche states that faith is an \\"incurable falsity\\" because to shut one's eyes in order to avoid any suffering is ludicrous) must live their lives based on fear of breaking a sin. This then leads into stating that some \\"so called sins\\" are part of the human experience and allows a person to grow and learn. Christianity cripples this life experience. This is just the tip of the iceberg as far as Nietzsche's ideas go.Another idea I liked presented in this book was how Christianity promotes fundamental thinking, seeing things only in black and white. I believe this same notion can be transferred to politics. Nietzsche doesn't just spit off his opinion he does reference quotes and passages from the Bible. When he presents these quotes and then his views a strong argument is created. This makes the content in this book philosophy not just a glorified opinion.Although I respect Nietzsche critical presentation, I don't agree with all of it. Some of his notions went totally over my head. In addition to state that every person who practices Christianity is a warped individual is equivalent to every person who does practice Christianity has a heart of gold. On a final note, Nietzsche's father was a Lutheran pastor who died when Nietzsche was only four years old. It states in the introduction of this book that a bit of a void was left for Nietzsche after his father died. Perhaps this early experience might have been the foundation for his disgust towards religion. Which leaves us with the inquiry, aren't we all products of our environment?"},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"ONE ADVICE BEFORE READING OR MAKING A CRITICISM OF THIS GIANT MASTERPIECE: PLEASE BE HONEST TO YOURSELF AND THROW AWAY ANY OF YOUR PREJUDICES (if you would have any)!!!As to Nietzsche christianity (NOT JESUS OF NAZARETH !!) was the cause for the decline of the classic, antique civilisation and the most considerable \\"promotor\\" for the herd instinct, the spiritual levelling, for decadence.The \\"Antichrist\\" (1888) is written months before he fell mentally ill (NOT syphillis, as is told in the streets...) to death in 1900.

I WILL WRITE DOWN THIS ETERNAL CHARGE AGAINST CHRISTIANITY EVERYWHERE WHERE THERE ARE WALLS. I EVEN DISPOSE OF SPECIAL LETTERS TO EVEN MAKE THE BLIND SEE.\\".The reason for Nietzsche to do/write so, is because he found christianity, with Paul and the ancient fathers of the christian church in front GUILTY for the decline of the ANTIQUITY (RE: NOT the person of \\"Jesus\\", of \\"The Christ\\" as is SO OFTEN MISINTERPRETED!!). Christianity was the vampire of the IMPERIUM ROMANUM.

But the comments by 'Matthew Acheson' leave an opening for rebuttal.Now, I hold no claim on religion itself, so those rolling their eyes thinking I'm just another 'biased Christian' can throw that canned theory out of the window right now. I study both points, theological and scientific, and consider both to be viable, understandable viewpoints of the world.What I cannot stand, though, is a constant and bloody attack by pseudointellectuals on anything they consider below them. In this case, religion. Do they not realise that by their vicious assaults, they commit the SAME crime the Catholic church was guilty of in the Middle Ages? Do they believe the rules do not APPLY to them simply because they're on the opposing side? How quaint.On the other hand, I cannot stand theological morons who can only give me an elaborate version of &quot;Jesus is Lord&quot; for their beliefs. Can they not spare the brainpower to think, to EXPLORE their own religion? Must we as humans be so weak as to hop after whatever cause or following may appeal to our most base of senses at the moment?Matthew Acheson, your comments are, as such, very base. While I am not Christian, Jesus, whether the son of some God or no, was a brilliant philosopher, and appealed to nothing but sensibility and logic. There's no line in the Bible that attacks religion. In fact, read Genesis closely, about how and what we could eat at first, about WHERE we came from (Water, anyone), and they'll see it falls right into place. Do I believe the Bible was divinely inspired? I think the bigger question here should be- does it MATTER?As for every 'dunamentalist' religion asking for blind faith, I ask you to look at Proverbs 14:15, and for Buddhists, look at the Kalama Sutra. As someone who's gone through everything from pure atheist works, to full-fledged theological works such as the Bible and Samyutta and Digdha Nikayas, I can say that most atheists have as skewed an image of religion, as most religionists have about atheism.People, think for yourselves, please. We all follow something. Whether a God or philosophy, whether Christianity, Taoism, Atheism... does it really matter? Must we critique and insult another for it? Perhaps to you, 'survival of the fittest', Matthew Acheson, is something you would enjoy. Darwinism, perhaps. But remember- we tried Might makes Right once before in history. It was called the Dark Ages. It didn't turn out too well.For any that want an opposing view of this, especially on the points of somehow Christianity being responsible for the fall of Rome (Which any reasonable historian would laugh at), look at 'City of God', by Saint Augustine, who was alive when Rome fell.

At times he was able to check these faults. The works he produced at his best, like Beyond Good And Evil, which gives perhaps the best explanation of his opinions, are much less affected by these habitual faults than the work he produced at his worst.To my mind N.'s weaknesses make The Antichrist a wreck of what it might have been. It might have been a trenchant argument in favour of atheism, or at least a trenchant argument in favour of N.'s most important ideas. And it is neither. His characteristic weaknesses lie everywhere. First, in the book, he is often absurdly conceited.'We have discovered happiness, we know the way, we have found the exit out of the labyrinth of thousands of years.' [TA, 1]This evidently refers to N.'s own philosophy. He might have applied some of his criticisms of the arrogance of other philosophers to himself, and written with a stitch more modesty.Second, in the book he is often unnecessarily rude.'The good god and the devil--both abortions of decadence.' [TA, 17]Broadly speaking, there are two explanations of the universe that are made possible by the evidence we have--that something produced the universe; and that someone produced the universe. Either conclusion is a generalisation. So neither can be proven in such a way that the other is shown to be categorically false. Moreover, the universe is evidently in many ways a highly organised universe; it evidently appears, in many ways, as you would expect it to appear, if it had been made by someone not something. N. might have written more respectfully of a hypothesis he could only ever disprove (if it can be disproved) using probable arguments.Three, at times in the book N.'s scholarship is unspeakably bad.'The imperium Romanum which we know, which the history of the Roman provinces teaches us to know better and better, this most admirable work of art in the grand style was a beginning: its construction was designed to prove itself through thousands of years: until today nobody has built again like this, nobody has even dreamed of building in such proportions sub specie aeterni. This organisation was firm enough to withstand bad emporors: the accident of persons may not have anything to do with such matters--first principle of grand architecture. But it was not firm enough against the most corrupt kind of corruption, against the Christians.' [TA, 58]The idea that the Roman Empire fell chiefly because of Christianity is ridiculous. What about the weakness of the Senate? the ambition of those who were near the Emperor, and strong enough to challenge him? the power of the army? the disillusion with civic religion? the barbaric purges? the difficulties of adminstering an empire so large? the rebellions within and attacks from without?Perhaps the fault that is most damaging to The Antichrist, though, is N.'s disregard for evidence. You cannot criticise his argument, because he provides no argument, other than, perhaps, the nonsensical one that if you find a plausible explanation for a phenomenon, then it is the correct explanation of that phenomenon. N. offers the view that Christianity is adequately explained if it is taken as the product of selfish barbarism. Needless to say, this assertion he takes as sufficient reason to conclude that Christianity is only the product of selfish barbarism.'The Christian church has left nothing untouched by its corruption; it has turned every value into an un-value, every truth into a lie, every integrity into a vileness of the soul. Let anyone dare to speak to me of its \`humanitarian' blessings! To abolish any distress ran counter to its deepest advantages: it lived on distress, it created distress to eternalize itself.' [TA, 62]The Christianity N. attacks is, depending on the need of the moment, a Christianity that he has made up himself; or monastic Christianity; or the worst form of Christianity that exists. He does not do justice either to orthodox Christian doctrine, or to any good the Church has done.When you have to use this kind of reasoning, you show fairly clearly how little talent you have for marshalling evidence well, and weighing it impartially. It is worth contemplating N.'s open acknowledgement that his atheism was not adopted because of reasoning.'I have absolutely no knowledge of atheism as an outcome of reasoning, still less as an event: with me it is obvious by instinct.' [EH, \`Why I Am So Clever', 1]Evidently, not even N. himself fancied that his religious opinions had anything to do with reasoning carefully about worthwhile evidence."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"This brilliant man and I have much in common, at least on a cerebral level.

I look forward to reading more from this brilliant mind and I hope it all proves to be as entertaining as \\"The Anti Christ\\"."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"In Nietzsche's earlier works, he made several allusions to \\"The Anti-Christ,\\" a man Nietzsche hoped would eventually be born. Unlike the traditional religious connotation, however, Nietzsche's anti-christ is a man who has such a deep insight into the universe, so pure a skepticism, that he is able to see truth like none before him. Spun throughout Nietzsche's works are allusions to the characteristics which this individual would possess to deliver this great insight into the world.As one of his later works, I hoped this book would be that story. I had hoped that Nietzsche would bring together the threads of this new world view into a single poignant moment. Unfortunately, Nietzsche is never so forward and organized and an expectation otherwise was perhaps doomed to disappointment.Instead of this culmination of work, I found this book a trifle repetitive. Over the course of 90 pages, Nietzsche repeats many of the anti-religious themes embedded in his earlier works. For those interested in this aspect of his scholarship (or unfamiliar with his previous works), I imagine this would be an excellent collection of his thoughts. He uses numerous examples to clearly indicate his attitude towards the rise of Christ, in life, as an ideal to equal his favorite Hinduism. For most of the book, however, he tells the story of the fall of Christ, in death, to the selfish motives of his flock. He weaves a story of an ideal which was so beyond his followers to understand that it became a twisted message used to grasp power.Perhaps more important then the collection of thoughts is the success Nietzsche has in expressing his respect for Christ the man. Never before in Nietzsche's readings had I understood where he casts blame for the fall of Christianity. This makes the book especially accessible and well worth the read for people interested in his anti-organized religion attitudes."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"As Nietzche himself said, he is not a philosopher, he is dynamite.

I would recommend reading Nietzsche's other writings, especially Genealogy of Morals, to understand why he feels so critical toward Christianity.

The one thing that is disappointing is that Nietzsche writes with a tone that seems to enforce the typical \\"angry atheist\\" stereotype that many Christians love to cling to (of course, I suppose one could argue that every time anybody voices their opinions on religion in a less than flattering manner, Christians will slap that stereotype on them)."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"\\"The anti-christ\\" may be Nietzche's most radical work-Thats also why I love it so much.Its sad that you dont get books like these anymore, for Nietzsche takes upon him the subject of christianity and its ways,Showing us a side of religions and beliefs that is still much looked upon as \\"anti-religious\\" to this day-something that is also talked about in the book.Its a great read, and a fine way to start off your collection of Nietzsches works-and yes, it is much more easy ridden than his other works.If a person manages to read this book he will see that Nietzche did not think the jews were \\"evil\\" as being stated in a earlier juvenile review-He merely looked upon their past and commented on their change from a strong minded people to a \\"cuddle-cuddle\\" society based on what was \\"hot\\".And there also lie the only small flaw in this book-Since it is easier to read, many more \\"ignorant\\" people will read it-If i may be as bold to say so- and misunderstand it.It is like with all of Nietzshces books-Even though this one is much more straight-forward-It requires some thinking, not just mindless flapping of pages.Love it or hate it, its a must read anyhow."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"Before I begin, I would like to note that this review isn't meant to be something that focuses the wandering eye on the thoughts of many and many a philosophy class and its deductions. Instead, this is meant as a briefly conceived, introspective look into a work that I've had the pleasure of reading and am recommending to others in addition to earlier works that Nietzsche wrote. To me, it seems that people lose sight of the work itself in the dissection of the author and all the hidden connotations that are perhaps manifest within his works, and I hope that my commentary is received as something quickened by a different train-of-thought.Frederick Nietzsche the philosopher and his little known cohort, Frederick Nietzsche the comedian, seem to work hand in hand very well in most of his works and especially in his earlier editions, providing ideas that seem stunning in many rights because of the timeframe they were written within and because of the subject matters they wished to assail. Biting with dry snippets of wit and underlying humor, not to mention a perspective that was especially unique at the turn of the 20th century, Nietzsche managed to find himself ignored by many theologians in his own time only to be deservedly uplifted in later decades because of his keen insights into matters that people would rather have ignored. This fact is evident each and every time one reads how he wantonly flaunted his beliefs in front of an audience, pointing out the inherent flaws in the belief system that he perceived as a waste of time and in the ideological principles that find themselves within his philosophical crosshairs.Nietzsche the comedian took a backseat in this work, however, as he found himself focused upon something that filled his words with a seething, almost venomous, revile; that of a religious system he saw as corruptly based in both principle and in prophecy, unworthy of redemption in the thinking man's world. Still, as is oftentimes overlooked in many this work, it is the delivery system that the church itself adopted to further these trains of thought that is actually the vessel under assault here and not simply the philosophy itself, a fact denoted in a most scathing manner that takes ideas he presented in earlier volumes and furthering them. His commentary on men of the garb and on the ideals of \\"sin\\" and \\"forgiveness\\" support that assumption well, as do many other items covered herein, building a basis for the stones he casts with utter contempt again and again.It is also mistakenly understood by many a person that Nietzsche himself was against the teachings of the Christ figure when, in fact, he seemed to fill certain points of the book with reverence for Christ, citing him as someone that would have been a challenge to debate with because only Christ would have been able to defend his words. It was the term Christian that he seemed to deplore and the church that was built upon its shoreline, attacking Paul and the foundations of the monolith beast as well as its hypocritical understanding of the unknown and the fear used to further it.This is not to say that the book is without its flaws, because it is. There are statements that generalize and there are phrases that defame, but these are only portions of the piece and not the overall effect itself. This is also an angrier edition that is more straightforward and less of a work of prose, choosing to instead embrace the approach of a hammer and not as a dance of syllables. Personally I find that interesting, seeing the things that he had thought groundbreaking in their own right because they shed the fear of the metaphysical and the hatred harbored for anyone that spoke out against these things, holding up little tidbits of his life and his personal perceptions within them before a nation of naysayers. For this reason, I recommend this book as something to look into and enjoy, reading it only after other books have been first checked out."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"Read how the Christians try to fool us all.

His persistant use of the word &quot;instinct&quot; to explain things is nothing short of comical. Related concepts include phisiology, decadence, health etc. I realize that Nietzsche wanted to come up with a comprehensive philosophical response to the challenge from beyond the Channel. Unfortunately, he overreached his expertise, basic facts, and general human modesty. Nietzsche is not only anti-Christ, and anti-Christian, upon rereading the book I have no shadow of a doubt that he is an anti-Semite and almost a misanthrope, as well. Nietzsche shows disdain for people as a whole; only the elite is spared the wrath of his pseudo-scientific pseudo-prophetic outbursts.His interpretation of the character of Jesus is interesting and plausible. However, everyone else is treated unfairly in the book. His comments about the Jews, the new testament, and the modern world, show Nietzsche to be more disdainful and narrow-minded and that most Nietzsche commentators, even Nietzsche himself, have ever realized.

Of course they forgive themselves and others, no matter the crime!"},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"During any conversation among atheists, the name of Frederick Nietzsche is likely to be invoked at some point. So who was this man and what is his relationship to modern atheism?Friedrich Nietzsche (pronounced Free drik Nee cha), the son of a Lutheran pastor, was born in Rocken, Saxony, in 1844. His father died shortly thereafter and Nietzsche was raised by his devoutly religious mother and two maiden aunts. He went off to boarding school at age 14, then on to universities at Bonn and Leipzig. Establishing a brilliant record, he became a professor of Philology at Basel University by age 24. Unfortunately, as a college student he apparently contracted syphilis, which led to a gradual deterioration of his health, forcing him to retire from teaching at age 35. Thereafter, he devoted himself to writing until he was finally overcome by syphilitic psychosis at age 45. He was institutionalized until his death in 1900, at age 56.Note that his degree was not in philosophy, but philology, which today would probably go under the rubric of Comparative Linguistics with specialization in ancient Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit. Thus, his expertise was in literature, rather than philosophy or science, and his writing seems to be less concerned with clarity and logical development of thought than with their poetic expression. His most famous and coherent book was Thus Spake Zarathustra, imitating the oracular, biblical style of writing in order to satirize Christian doctrines while using the iconic founder of Zoroastrianism as a mouthpiece for his own philosophical lucubrations. I found the book moderately entertaining, but easier to put down than to pick up again.In his typically hyperbolic fashion, Nietzsche claimed this book to be the most important literary event in history. One of the few important people of his time who shared that view was Richard Strauss, who was inspired to write his famous Tone Poem by that name - better known today as the theme from the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey.Most of Nietzsche's other \\"books\\" are not really books at all, but unedited notebooks. They are collections of random thoughts, written in obscure aphoristic style, and in the characteristically German form of sentences that run on for half a page, filled with cryptic parenthetical allusions, and finally ending with a verb. He seems incapable of writing a simple declarative sentence. Everything was expressed in complex, metaphorical, periphrastic passive voice, filled with double and triple negatives, compounded by a very peculiar style of punctuation. So, English speaking readers must rewrite each sentence for themselves to fish out any glimmer of meaning. It is probably more profitable to read ABOUT Nietzsche than to struggle with his own words.Reading his work is very much like trying to make sense of the Bible; and like biblical hermeneutics, interpreting what Nietzsche may or may not have meant has become a cottage industry. His work is so ambiguous and self-contradictory that anyone can read into it anything they like. Thus, he has been championed by Nazis, Communists, Anarchists, Libertarians, Monarchists - every political stripe imaginable. Only among Christians is he unequivocally anathematized.He did make it fairly clear that he was disgusted by Prussian militarism and the anti-Semitism which was rampant at the time. But Nietzsche's early death left his sister as executor of his estate. She eventually became a Nazi sympathizer and redacted several of her brother's works to make them appear pro-Nazi. Probably Nietzsche's most famous concept was \\"The Will to Power,\\" adopted by the Nazis as a slogan to rationalize their conquest of other countries. There is even a book by that title with Nietzsche's name on it. But he did not write it; his sister did - by compiling a pastiche of his statements taken out of their original context.What Nietzsche really meant by the Will to Power was not the political power of one country dominating another, but is today recognized as the commonplace desire for individual \\"empowerment,\\" the desire to grow, the freedom to \\"Be all that you can be,\\" as the Army slogan says. But in religiously oppressive 19th century Germany, the \\"Need for Achievement\\" or \\"self-realization\\" was regarded as a sin. So his espousal of this concept as a primary motivation for human behavior, rather than simple hedonism, or obedience to authority and \\"fear of God,\\" was seen as a scandalous idea. George Bernard Shaw took a somewhat ambivalent view of how practical Nietzsche's ideas are, and wrote a comedy about how dismayed Victorian society was by these concepts in \\"Man and Superman.\\" In the playbill, Shaw explicated his interpretation of Nietzsche's philosophy in \\"The Revolutionists Handbook.\\"Throughout his poetic musings Nietzsche touches on many different subjects, but the one theme to which he always returns is the perversity of Christian doctrines. Toward the end of his career, he finally managed to focus his thoughts on this subject in The Anti-Christ.Most of his criticisms are nothing new to modern atheists, and more succinctly stated by other authors in recent years; but he was one of the first who dared commit them to paper - and survive.It goes without saying that his books were privately printed and sold only a few dozen copies at most. But Nietzsche regarded this contemporary scorn as a badge of honor and confirmation of his genius. Eventually mankind will evolve into der bermench, he said, a superior type of person among a society of similar freethinking rationalists, uninfected by the sickness of Christianity.He equated Christianity with nihilism because, he said, it is a cult of death, exalting a non-existent afterlife as more important than the here and now. Anything which was healthful and life-affirming was therefore condemned by Christians as sinful.The religion invented by Paul of Tarsus was based on resentment toward the rich and powerful - which meant the Roman Empire, as well as the Jewish establishment in Judea. The lower classes always despise the upper classes and wish to destroy them and everything they stand for - leading to the rapid spread of Christianity among the dispossessed of the Empire. Even Edward Gibbon agrees that it was not only the barbarian invasions that destroyed Rome, but the inner rot of self-absorbed Christians who dreamed of going to a Never-Never Land after death rather than exerting themselves to protect the greatest civilization the world had ever known.After collapse of the Empire, the Christians finally got what they wanted: an Age of Faith, devoid of advanced civilization, in which they slavishly groveled before an all powerful church. Science and democracy were Unforgivable Sins in Christian eyes.The only aspect of Nietzsche's critique which I found surprising is that he takes at face value the biography of Jesus as depicted by the four Gospels. He seems to have thought there really was a man named Jesus, who really did and said the things described therein (except for the miracles), and who willingly died on a Roman cross in order to demonstrate his pacifist ideals.Even in Nietzsche's day, most of the Bible was known to be fictitious. That's why Nietzsche famously said that \\"God is dead - and we have killed him.\\"A recent book by Robert Sheaffer, titled The Making of the Messiah builds a convincing case that the crucifixion never happened. The law of the land at that time specified that any criminal cases had to be tried by the Sanhedrin, and if the verdict required execution, then it must be carried out according to Jewish law. The law specified that the prisoner was to be stoned to death in the morning and then hanged in a tree as a warning to others. But the body must be taken down and buried before sunset. In fact some passages in the Gospels, overlooked by the redactors, do refer to Jesus being hanged.The image of a criminal hanging by the neck, however, did not make a very appealing logo for a mass movement. So the whole story of the Roman crucifixion was concocted by a band of rebellious Jews to arouse resentment against the Romans. The T shape of a Roman cross was modified to the simplified version of an Egyptian ankh, which was widely recognized as a symbol of eternal life. Thus, the whole crucifixion story was a hoax created for the propagandistic purpose of overthrowing the Roman establishment. This was an ancient story, stretching back to the fourth century, so it is surprising that Nietzsche ignores it.Instead, Nietzsche claimed there was only one true Christian - puerile as his pacifist philosophy may have been - but he died upon a cross for his principles. The religion created by Paul of Tarsus, on the other hand, was a complete reversal of Jesus' message - as Paul transformed it into blind faith in his doctrine of salvation through belief in the \\"atonement\\" of Jesus' self-sacrifice. Thus, this new religion changed from a non-violent way of life into a technique of totalitarian control through the enforcement of rigid ideology.One of Nietzsche's main concerns was how humanity should cope with the death of the old gods, since many intellectuals were in a state of nihilistic despair after Darwin and loss of faith in the Bible. The answer to this existential malaise, said Nietzsche, is to follow your own bliss, as Joseph Campbell would say; find out who you are, what your talents are, and then live that life joyfully, or with - as Paul Kurtz titles one of his books - Exuberance! This life is the only one we get, so enjoy it to the fullest and without fear of a non-existent Boogie Man.Nietzsche's influence has grown over the years, through people like Sigmund Freud, George Bernard Shaw, H.L. Menken, Martin Heidegger, and Jean Paul Sartre. Some say his ideas have even led to restructuring whole academic disciplines. Without his concept of \\"perspectivism,\\" they say, we might not have such departments as cultural anthropology, comparative religions, literary \\"deconstructionism,\\" or \\"situational ethics.\\" Other philosophers, such as Bertrand Russell, however, dismissed him as an insignificant crank.More than 100 years after his death, what would Nietzsche have thought of today's world? Certainly, his old nemeses the Christians are as entrenched as ever. But there are signs of hope. A large percentage of nations now realize the wisdom of keeping clerics out of state houses. But most importantly, I think he would take heart at the hundreds of atheist, Humanist, and freethought organizations springing up like wildflowers all over the world and gaining power through the Internet. I think he might feel that his glorious day of der bermench may eventually be realized.*******************************************************Milt Timmons is an author whose latest book is the science-fiction thriller, 2084: A Tale of Post America.

After reading the short book however, I am amazed that Nietzsche is given more than a cursory seat in history.The Anti-Christ is supposed to be a critique of Christianity. In effect it is a critique of Nietzsche. He rarely backs up his assertions in any way. At one point, he begins to talk about how Jews are corrupting the world, boldly assuming that it is common knowledge that Jews are inherently evil and deceitful people. Frankly, I am not interested in having someone tell me that \\"Jews are evil,\\" I want them to tell me why. Nietzsche does very little of this. In fact, the main arguments that he makes for his assertions are usually based on ad hominem libel. Essentially his writing has very little substance. It's like listening to 95% of the population tell you why they didn't vote for Kerry or didn't vote for Bush (Nietzsche could have written something like that). My final complaint is that Nietzsche's depth of analysis and understanding is very shallow. It's hard to fully explain what I mean by this in a short review but if you read the book you will understand (I hope). Most of his precepts are just very juvenile and can be thought away very quickly.In the case of the translation, I am also dissapointed. I have no problem with the fact that Mencken is just as deranged as Nietzsche (a statement akin to many of Nietzsche's), he just can't spell. This book is fraught with misspellings. In total honesty, I have never read any sort of published material that contained so many misspellings. After 20 misspellings you have to wonder about the quality of the book you are reading.If you want to know Nietzsche, The Anti-Christ is the place to start, but I cannot imagine why anyone would harbor any such desires. I should also say that it is possible that I am not one of the intellectual elite or \\"free spirits\\" that Nietzsche refers to in his works. It is possible that if Nietzsche spawned right in front of me today, he might inform me that I am just one of Earth's morons. In that case, kindly ignore this review because I am an idiot."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"Nietzche's &quot;The Anti-Christ&quot; was one of the last books Nietzsche wrote before the onset of his insanity in 1888. Unlike many of Nietzsche's other books, which raise tantalizing questions and examine experience from a variety of angles, some of them contradictory, &quot;The Anti-Christ&quot; is a relatively straightforward presentation of Nietzsche's critique of Christianity. Contrary to what many think, Nietzsche did not advocate the general abolition of Christianity. He thought it served the needs of the majority of people quite well, but believed it had psychologically destructive effects on the minority of people in a society who were most capable of intellectual, artistic, and other achievement.Mencken was one of the great American prose stylists of the Century, and, as one would expect, his translation of &quot;The Anti-Christ&quot; is an outstanding read. I happen to think it is a far better read than R.J. Hollingdale's translation, which is the one most often used by scholars and students. Whether it is more or less faithful to Nietzsche's original is a question I cannot answer, not being sufficiently fluent in German.In any event, it's great to see Mencken's much-neglected 1917 translation back in print."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"The book has truth in it. It is good but not the best. Lewis in An Encounter With A Prophet acknowledges all of the false teachings of the Christian Church but does not lose God in the process."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"Whether you agree with him or not, you gotta admit that Nietzsche had some very strong arguments about the validity of Christianity, and how he views it as a form of weakness posing as a strong institution. There is a section where he takes verses from the Bible itself and explains in a way on how it is evangelical and dictatorial. Nietzsche was a deep thinker, perhaps too deep because he got really sick shortly after this book, and he didn't seem like the type of guy to just ramble about a topic without knowing about it. Him quoting the Bible and many other religious texts porves that he well-researched Christianity and made enough valid points to defend his position on Christianity. I am not an antichrist myself, thoguh I more or less shun organized religion, but Nietzsche has some very thought-provoking concepts. Sure it is offensive to one devout to Christianity, and I'd probably be offended if I was a practicing Christian, but this is recommended for those who study religions and philosophy, or just a powerful book in general."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"This is Nietzsche's most vigorous work; it conains in little over one hundred pages, a summary of his later philosophy, and as such, should probably be read after all of his other works if one means to avoid misunderstanding what Nietzsche is saying. He portrays Christianity in gory detail as the religion of revenge, dishonesty, small-mindedness and pity which it is, and a leading cause of the west's descent into nihilism. (A reading of this book almost forms a mini spiritual biography of western civilisation of the last three centuries). The adherence to a religion like Christianity forms a sort of enslavement to an outdated meaning system thus causing anyone with a scrap of intellectual integrity to lie to theirselves as a means of supporting a bankrupt world-view and while appropriate for Zarathustra's &quot;last men&quot;, is death for all higher types, and had waged a bitter war against all manner of vitality, stregnth and honour which are the hallmarks of die ubermensche. He talks of the psychology of the priest and the natural hatred of science that they all possess as well as the slave morality and cowardice that Christianity promotes, but for all the vim that the book possesses, it is not a very scholarly work, and contains many errors. Nietzsche understandably finds it difficult to restrain himself, but this gives the work a sort of amateurish tone. Mencken has done a wonderful job here -- all the more because he had a deep appreciation for Nietzsche -- the man and his work. For those who cannot understand Nietzsche's &quot;hatred&quot; of Christianity, I would recommend a very thorough reading of the Geneology of Morals, which goes into much greater detail and is much more scholarly and will provide better insight into the anti-Chrsitian perspective. One of the jewels of modern literature."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"Please be aware that this refers ONLY to the Cosimo Classics edition of H.L. Mencken's translation of \\"The Anti-Christ,\\" not to any others.This is a slipshod ripoff of the 1999 See Sharp Press edition of \\"The Anti-Christ.\\" First, the \\"editors\\" at Cosimo Classics makes two gross errors on the copyright page: 1) They put the original publishing date of the Mencken translation at 1895, when in fact it was published in 1920; 2) They claim copyright of this work which is in the public domain. The kindest terms for these these things are incompetent and sleazy.Worse, Cosimo omitted the Publisher's Note from the See Sharp edition, which dealt with Mencken's anti-semitic comments in his Introduction. They also omitted ALL of the footnotes from the See Sharp edition, both those of the See Sharp editor and those of Mencken. The only reason for this that seems plausible is that they feared legal action and were too lazy to track down a copy of the original 1920 Knopf edition to check whose footnotes were whose. So, they chose to publish an incomplete version of Mencken's translation rather than go to such small bother.Their laziness runs so deep that they didn't even bother to scan in the See Sharp edition and then produce their own type. No, they simply reproduced the type from the See Sharp edition while stripping out the footnotes. (Compare the interior pages via \\"Look Inside the Book\\" -- they're identical. Same typeface, same line breaks, even the same typos.)Please buy any other edition of this very good book other than this very sleazy Cosimo Classics edition."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"A vigorous and courageous look at Christianity as it is practiced and the psychology of the people who practice it.

Rather than saying that this book is necessary only for those that disagree with organized religion, I say that it is more necessary for those that are active members of churches. After all, they (you?) are the people that Nietzsche had such a qualm with that he spent his life writing objections to such beliefs.Of course, for those of us out there that have always held a doubt about religion, this book will come as a comfortable assurance that you're not disordered, and you're definately not alone.After having read Beyond Good and Evil and the Genealogy of Morals, I think this is a harsher and more simplified book than the previous two. It also is a much easier read, for those that don't want to go through the mental exercises of rooting out the author's meanings. Well worth a sitting."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"The Great Philosopher certainly does not pull any punches! This is an assault on sanctimonious hypocrisy, make believe, ignorance, and the never ending peddling of superstition and myth by the few who reap the rewards of earthly rewards and wealth through their power over the weak, the illiterate and the credulous. Nietzsche proudly proclaims that ideas like faith, redemption, heaven, hell are all non provable cant, not fit for the mind of any thinking and rational person. Some of his Gospel quotes appear to prove his point. Intolerance and hatred have arisen along with love and charity, and Nietzsche, for all his ranting, makes his points as clear as day. This may be a bruising read for some, especially the unquestioning and close-minded, but if you can make it through this short tirade, you may find it difficult not to agree with many of the basis ideas here."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"While it is certainly true that Nietzsche makes several argumentative errors and is somewhat inconsistant at times, the Anti-Christ is a fantastic read. Although it ended his career, I think this book is a great way to be introduced to his work. The Anti-Christ may not be his best argued work, although it does contain some masterful indictments of the Christian ethos, but it is probably the work that best captures his spirit. This book is a must read for anyone interested in discovering what Nietzsche's true ideas concerning Christianity and religion are, and so that we can dispose of the simplistic garbage that paints him as a nihilist. A little dose of Nietzche's forthrightness, courage and honesty in the expression of ideas, however controversial or unpopular they might be, is just what our modern world needs."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"A coherent, if vehement essay into the damage done to mankind by reliance on religion as replacement for knowledge. Nietzsche clearly places the blame for suppression of knowledge and extension of suffering at the door of religion and lays bare the collusion of the Priesthood in the perpetuation of ignorance as a means to power. This lends further credence to the essays of Hitchens and Harris.Menken's introduction is priceless."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"Cowardice is being audacious enough to dismiss a book without so much as constructive criticism or an elementary analysis of what you're attempting to make a mockery of. Certainly a peurile stone-chucking review is easier to materialize than a meaningful analysis. It's becoming quite common these days to write off Nietzsche's thought as a satiating appetizer for rebellious teenagers, psuedo-intellectuals and the like and in fact i would agree that there is a whole plethora of idiots running around clutching \\"The Anti-Christ\\" against their bosom because of its appealing title but alas it's much easier to claim to have read and understood a book than to actually have read it. I'm surprised you didn't also dismiss Nietzsche because of his influence on the Nazi's; after all, Hitler reading the will to power exposes the shame that is Nietzsche. It's comforting to know that we don't all judge a book by those we want to associate it with. Grow up"},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"Considering that Nietzsche wrote &quot;The Anti-Christ&quot; in the late 1800's, I have to give Nietzsche, the seemingly archtype-philosopher, kudos. He does a plausible job at dissecting the doctrines of Chritianity as being anti-Nature. True, and unfortunately, God is not entirely taken out of the picture; but hey, it was a legitimate start for Nietzsche's time period. A better book, though, than &quot;The Anti-Christ,&quot; and a book that somes-up the God-Judeo-Christian-Semitic connection is the book &quot;Nature's Eternal Religion,&quot; by Ben Klassen. To those interested in studying philosophy and God, you can't go wrong with Klassen's book because it seems to be a natural continuation of &quot;The Anti-Christ.&quot;"},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"For me this read more as one man's take on Christianity's digression from religion to power center instead of as a philosophical examination of the reason and proof for its existence. That said there is much in his thinking that will force the reader to re-examine her own view on religion and Christianity.Great translation - perfectly brings Neitzche's manic style of writing to English.In terms of philosophical writing this is about as clear and clean as it gets, even though at times it is a tangled jungle of words and ideas. Still, for the most part, the writing clearly conveys what Neitzche was trying to communicate.Though written as a denouncement of Christianity it is not anti-religous. Neitzsche was not the anitchrist he is just a man expressing and examining a subject on a personal level. If you are incapable of tolerance avoid this book. If you seek outside opinions as a way to make a more perfect personal philosophy then read this book; it will make you think (and smile on occasion)."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"Nietzche is one of my favorite philosophers, probably because I disagree with him on half of his beliefs. What I really love is his passion, however misguided. He grew up in a strict household where the rules of Christianity were taught more than the love of Christ and this probably resulted in his scathing critiques and dialogues. Nietzche is incredible. Not only is he a great philosopher, but his sarcastic humor makes him a truly modern wit to be reckoned with.

I personally do not recommend to read this before you read some other works of the author, such as 'Genealogy of Morals', Thus Spoke Zarathustra', and 'Beyond Good and Evil' - even one of those alone will definitely help. The Anti-Christ, is short because it's only a conclusion and a final verdict to Christianity, rather than development of the argument."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"I'd recommend this book only for those who feel that Nietzsche was the inspired prophet of the death of Christianity. If you feel that way you'll love this book, since it presents his anti-christian ideas in their most vehement form.

I had heard of \\"will to power\\" before reading this but this is the first time I understood exactly what it means. As a result of this book I now consider myself an immoralist. What a great Christmas present for that preachy aunt who gets on your nerves... well, perhaps Christmas isn't the most respectful time. One part that struck me as a little inaccurate is when he says \\"One loses force when one pities\\". I have to disagree with this. Without pity or sympathy you have a psychopath, and that psychopath won't get far, he'll be either killed, imprisoned or institutionalized. We have acquired the ability to \\"pity\\", but make no mistake, it's because it helps us gain power by forming an alliance with the rest of the human race.

However, this does not change the fact that this is simply a rant about christianity from a selfish, arrogant, petty man, who reckoned himself to be one of the greatest thinkers, when in fact he is not. Not only does he say that compassion towards our fellow humans is immoral, but he says that all humans are unequal (he sees himself as one of the more superior humans, unsurprisingly) and he also claims that the pursuit of power is the moral action. Right from the start he claims that feeling for another's misfortune is weak and weakness is immoral. Then he goes on to rip apart christianity, granted, he makes a couple of valid points, but most of what he says is complete trash, bases on lies. I'm not exactly the biggest fan of christianity, but some of the arguments presented here are absurd to say the least. Nietzsche is not a genious, he is an idiot. This book contains a few contradictions and not just little ones, there is certianly a very big one. I wonder if anyone else noticed it?

Nietzsche, who was a pastor's son, might have given his own assumptions a look or two before writing this, keeping what he liked and discarding what didn't nourish him.

The most important thing Nietzsche proves in this book is the intensity of his density. In rejecting all aspects of the modern human, the plain man, of women, and religion, and other philosophers as well, Nietzsche becomes the all perfect being who only knows the true philosophy of mankind, and who the perfect man will be, and he will of course reject religion. I believe anyone in this modern day and age can agree that humans are all too flawed, but if we listen to Nietzsche, there accordingly must be a perfect man.Nietzsche's books prove time and time again, the only thing driving him to create philosophy, was his massive ego, and his lack of ever having to lift a hand, or do any sort of physical work.

Values and categorical imperatives arise from a resentment of weak man towards the reality and life, so Christianity is characterized by the humility's virtue ( that is unconfessed hate against the powerful people and the not so secret will to subject them) and by value of pity (that is in antagonism to all the self-preserving instincts.The phylosopher deplores Christian morals also because it represents the highest intellectual values as sinful, as misleading, as full of temptation. according to N, only Protestant theologians, defined by Nietzsche \\"hemiplegic paralysis of Christianity and of reason\\", could take Kant under their patronage and accept the pernicious idea of a virtue which has its roots in mere respect for the concept of \\"virtue\\". Kant's categorical imperative is, for Nietzsche, a dangerous abstraction. It is the idea, developed by a Nihilist embedded in the fumes Christian dogmatism, that regards \\"pleasure as an objection\\".By sharing or not the Nietzsche's ideas, the reader greatly will enjoy the lively style of this excellent writer, \\"the first immoralist\\", who all in all had a liking for The Galilean, considered as \\"heiliger Anarchist\\" and one and only Christian."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"It's great to see Mencken's translation back in print. All considerations about \\"The Anti-Christ\\" aside, this translation is a relic of sorts seeing as how it was the first american translation. Though perhaps not the best (i.e., most scholarly) translation, the only great flaw I see in it, taking the book for what it is - a translation by an aficionado-, is the publisher's handling of it.Mr. Bufe encumbered himself with dumbing down Mencken's introduction and parts of the translation. As he himslef admits in the publisher's note, he translates all french words to english. And for what reason? Apparently they made the text incomprehensible. Poor Mr. Bufe seems to underestimate the readers: it's quite obvious that anyone that has the brains to read this book can easily overcome the language barrier posed by a few words (not to mention the fact that they might know how to speak another language).\\"I translated them because they were impediments to comprehension, and because there is no real point to having untranslated French terms in an English text; its only purpose is to make those who can read French feel like members of an elite club.\\" This seems like a rather biased statement. If Mencken and Nietzsche used French words (or any other non-English words), it wasn't to be snobish; it was their style, just like so many other authors. For someone who says he admires Mencken's work (inspite of his \\"clear signs of anti-semitism\\"), it's a rather blatant sign of disrespect of the translators work to edit his style in such a way. Were he around, I'm sure that H.L. Mencken would not stand for such a thing.So again, it's not that he makes the text any less inteligible with the edits, but rather that he takes away from the richness of it, diminishing somewhat the experience of reading such a work."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"I am a committed atheist and have found satisfaction in reading the works and essays of greater minds than mine. In this respect the Christopher Hitchins book &#34;Portable Atheist&#34; is a good read. This book is somewhat harder to read and in many respects reminds of the Thomas Paine book &#34;Age of Reason&#34;, in that they are both a strong argument, mixed with contempt, of the established church. Both books were revolutionary in their time but are a little passe now, but maybe worth the effort. I still think Hitchins has the better book though."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"This item is what it was represented to be, and I am most appreciative of the fact that I received what I paid for."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"Nietzsche's final work, published in 1895 posits his position upon the state of Christianity and his opinion of Christendom for the masses. This is not to be confused with an attack upon the religion, it's true practices and benefits before the taint, manipulation and debasement by the human hand, for there is a noted difference.Christianity, seen as a conspiracy impeding the progress of mankind, reserved for the corpus of ignorant men (95-96%) and full of lofty \`moral' ideals which, in purpose, turn weaknesses into strength. To glorify timidity, cowardice and general weakness, making these types of people \\"The Chosen\\" is completely juxtaposed with the concept of the \`ubermensch' (Superman) and any thinking man's \`Will to Power' (that alone which makes one feel good).Further, Christianity glorifies \`faith' - which basically translates to \`ask no questions and follow blindly' establishing a loss of instinct and reaction.In regards to the apostles and other men of the cloth: \`Whoever has theological blood in his veins is shifty and dishonorable in all things'. \`Virtue' and \`morality' are human contrivances and coupled with religion create misconceptualizations based upon imaginary cause and effect (being philanthropic gets you into heaven). This lie is seen as an escapist tactic, and who wants to escape reality except those that suffer because of it?The priest, the most revered man of the cloth, Nietzsche sees as a human parasite designed to speak on behalf of, represent and take penance for God - the primary bastion, champion on earth, of upholding weakness, false morality and the undermining force behind the \`Will to Power'.In speaking of the true Christian, not the frauds he's attacked through the bulk of the work, Nietzsche states that true Christianity is lived, borne witness through acts and avoidance of acts. It's experienced and suffered. \`The kingdom of Heaven is a state of the heart.'A few of Nietzsche's aphorisms and essential thoughts that indicate the tone of the work:- \`Great intellects are skeptical.'- \`Men of convictions are prisoners.'- Science is the first, original sin. To want to know is to be faithless it indicates a desire to be Godlike.- At the root of the Christian belief exists Nihilism, the desire to destroy everything. To live a life of ignorance, to have \`faith', to buy into \`immortality' suggest that nothing in this life is worthwhile, thusly - why partake? Simply count down the days until your \`salvation' arrives and fail to live the life you could."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"This awesome book details, in the narrative form of a crime novel, how Christianity came to dominate the world. I would urge caution with some of the alternatives to Christianity, however, especially the Social Darwinism that has gained traction in some sections of the atheist community.The idea Nietzsche had of using Darwinism as a kind of intellectual dynamite to blast away religious edifices was always going to be fraught with a hit or miss dimension, since as Nietzsche himself knew, science itself, in its objectivity that stands apart from human subjective mores, cannot give us a system of values. Rather, it is the necessary for philosophers to interpret science in a way that makes it relate somehow to human subjective values -- or in more exact Nietzschean terms, science needs philosophy to give it its purpose.Darwinism, depending on its interpretation, could mean a great deal socially speaking, or nothing, in terms of its bolstering the atheist's position. There are creationists who consider that human biological evolution could have been a guided one, under the auspices of a superior power.This notion of some of the more sophisticated religionists is, at least, on no worse an epistemological footing than conventional social darwinism -- which also goes way beyond the evidence that is materially available to us, in proposing hidden mechanisms that drive things (which we are expected to accept without the evidence to back it up.) Both positions are ideological, and entail an element of explanation that is occult (hidden) from scientific investigation. Social darwinistic thinking, with its conceptualisations of natural superiority and might makes right, is far from proven as a theory that supports the facts of human existence and the nature of social formation beyond any reasonable doubt.As a sytem of faith, like religion, it shares to much in common with some of the crudest and most anti-humanistic forms of religion (such as fundamentalism) in order to really be in a position to oppose this kind of religion as such. \\"Many are called but few are chosen\\" articulates the position of Social Darwinists exceedingly well. As they inherit the predominant ideological pattern from their religious forefathers, this is no accident.Many will no doubt recognize this ideology as expressing a principle beloved of those influenced by Calvinistic strains of religiosity. These are the most punitive and joyless strands of Christianity, which asserted that by your success in the world or not, you would come to know retrospectively, whether you had been chosen by the Lord to be forgiven and blessed. Social Darwinists obtain their self esteem on the same basis of whether they just happen to receive more material blessings, and to experience more affluence than their brothers and sisters in the third world who work just as hard as they do, if not more so.Such are the mystifications of Social Darwinism, which reflect its religious origins."},{"Title":"The antichrist (Borzoi pocket books)","review":"I don't need to comment on the content of this book, because everyone knows it's a work of a genius.This translation is by far my favorite. Kaufman annoys me with his bias and unnecessary notes he leaves in his translations (Like how in The Gay Science he asserts that Nietzsche merely disliked Luther because of the fact that he was German, whereas if you actually read the full quote from Nietzsche he makes it clear that he doesn't like Luther because he feels that Luther didn't rebel against the church, he reinstated it.)and I didn't much care for the Penguin Classics translation.Here's a quote from the Penguin Classics translation:\\"the Christian Church, in contrast to the 'nation of saints', renounces all claim to originality. For precisely this reason the Jews are the most fateful nation in world history; their after-effect has falsified mankind to such an extent that today the Christian is able to feel anti-Jewish without realizing he is the ultimate consequence of the Jews.\\"Now, let's take a look at that same quote from this translation:\\"the Christian Church as compared with the \\"chosen people,\\" lacks all claim to originality. Precisely on this account the Jews are the most fatal people in the history of the world: their ultimate influence has falsified mankind to such an extent that even to this day the Christian can be anti-Semitic in spirit, without comprehending that he himself is the final consequence of Judaism.\\"That sets the tone for both of the books, as you can see, this translation of Nietzsche's work flows much more smoothly than the other."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"This is a typical Matt Reilly with lots of bad guys and the good guys win out but not without plenty of how are they going to do it now."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Excellent reading.. keeps you on the edge wanting more like all the other scarecrow books.... waiting for the next oneanxiously..."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Area 7 is a killer tale about a rogue agent gone straight who is tasked with avenging the death of his best mate and defending a target of utmost importance...

He writes a good story. In this one, the thrills take place in what is really area 51. His set pieces are very complicated and on the verge of impossible. Yet his heroes prevail in the end.My only beef with him is his overuse of exclamation marks and he tends to make the American government the bad guys in all of his novels. I can't remember if that's the case with this one as I read it a while back and somehow forgot to review it back then. I still remember this was a great ride and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"i was so exited to read this book, and it was awesome and action-packed, but is had dirty words in it like on every page, so i did not finish the book.

If you're willing to completely suspend your disbelief and just go along for the ride, they're a great time.It seems that, in each novel, Reilly raises the stakes a bit. More daring escapes, more gunplay, more impossible situations. Possible spoiler ahead: This book includes improbable escapes from water, air, biohazards, and space. A few of these escapes were a little hard to swallow, even with the brain in auto-mode.The books are written in near-screenplay style. The writing style would improve quite a bit if he would just stop using italics in every other sentence. We all know they're meant to show emphasis; but in an action novel, it's pretty obvious where the emphasis belongs. The italics get quite annoying after a while.Reilly's books are not great literature. That's ok. He's not trying for great literature. He's going for your basic mindless action-movie book. Escapes, explosions, gun battles, winning against impossible odds. If you're looking for a fun read, try Reilly."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Don't think about the plot too much and just enjoy the ride. If you are a fan of Jerry Bruckheimer movies, like to play Counterstrike, and hate &quot;unnecessary&quot; dialogue, then this book is a must-read.Tom Clancy sets up his books for about 800 pages, then has 100 pages of action at the end. If you take that last 100 pages of Clancy's books, and extend it throughout the whole story, you've got Matt Reilly!Overall, Matt's latest offering is right on par with the rest of his books (Ice Station, Temple, Contest).

However, Area 7 is an absolute mess. The plot is the result of mixing the worst elements of a Stephan Seagal movie, The Transporter, and one of those C movies on at about 2 am on Sci-Fi. It has all the cliche elements of an action story, but with absolutely no subtly:1) The been there, done that hero2) The romantic interest3) The bad guy with an overly elaborate plot4) His minions5) The pencil pushing commander with no experience6) A handful of good hearted cannon fodder7) Plot twists that are supposed to be \\"twists\\" but are more of \\"Oh, God, why did he have to go there?\\" moments.8) Impossible stunts that, even with suspended disbelief, are still hard to believe.Another thing that really grates on me for some reason is Reilly's insistence on elite teams having \\"signature weapons.\\" Seriously, a soldier, SEAL, Marine, etc, is going to be given any equipment needed to complete their mission. The whole \\"signature weapon\\" thing is very video game like. I don't know if that's what he was going for, but to me, it's kind of idiotic.All in all, a good effort that falls short in both fact checking and both character and storyline development."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"First, this was a non-stop action thriller, and there are some interesting descriptions of weapons and weapons systems that were interesting. The book is so off the wall that it became zany and not even close to anything approaching reality. Maybe that wasn't the objective. It's roughly 150 pages too long.

I was surprised to find out that it was a sequel to another forgettable book I'd read -- Ice Station. I am usually pretty good about authors but while I only retained plot bits from that first novel I certainly remembered the laughable \\"and then he saw it\\" line, also used several times in that one.The author is a horrible writer, but a decent storyteller. Both books have read like first treatments of a Die Hard movie. I was never bored, but also never taken much with his \\"craft\\" of writing.

Using tons of high-tech, most of it involving bio-warfare tested on condemned criminals, Area-7 scientists develop cures for diseases engineered by America's enemies.Unfortunately, \\"Caesar\\" Russel, a supposedly executed USAF general, seizes Area-7 and locks everybody in - including the President and his marine contingent. Russel has implanted a microscopic transmitter on the president's heart connecting the unwitting chief to nuclear warheads placed across America which will detonate should Caesar's troopers get the president. Also, the \\"football\\" - the president's nuclear-war trigger - will signal the bombs unless the president keys in his palm print every 90 minutes. With his special shock troops, Caesar can easily kill the Chief, but he needs the President to suffer the humiliation deserved by all politicians. Unbeknownst to Russell, Area-7's chief bio-chemist has his own plans now that he's developed a cure for a Chinese bio-engineered disease. Unknown to him, some of Ceasar's own men have gone into business themselves - with the Chinese. Unexpected by them is the role to be played by Area-7's residents - the vilest criminals in America. And a nasty shock to everybody is \\"Scarecrow\\" Schofield - the world's toughest Marine and the novel's hero.\\"Area-7\\" is action-packed to the exclusion of everything else, including some stuff that even action-packed novels need to make us appreciate the action. I wasn't looking for literature - deep characters, a complex plot, irony - yet \\"Area 7\\" not only tosses character development, he practically junks the idea characters. Each character is a walking mannequin never deviating from their dossier. (\\"Area\\" starts off with Schofield's nominal superior being described as a cowardly careerist; a civilian presidential aide is from page 1 one of those politically connected, vapid and craven morons who populate failed sitcoms. By the climactic end of \\"Area 7\\", Schofield's boss is still a martinet, while the civilian reaction to Russell's plan is a desperate call his stockbroker - \\"sell dollars!!!\\" he pleads).\\"Area-7\\" isn't literature, but it's no fun either - it's far too unoriginal. Reilly fans like to compare Schofield to Indiana Jones, but he's more like one of those forgotten Indy-clones who romped countless botched \\"Raiders\\" rip-offs. The story is largely a string of clumsily choreographed action scenes, all weighed down with unnecessary detail about the toys involved and by Reilly's practically telegraphing all of Schoefield's actions before he does them. The threadbare plot sounds like an overglorified first-person shooter game like \\"Half-Life\\". (Underground fortress; hide around corners, watch-out for the enemy, kill, steal their ammo, rinse and repeat.) Reilly's idea of using a heart as a fail-safe isn't new either (read Nance's \\"Medusa's Child\\"; see the movie \\"Spawn\\") while Caesar looks like any of the disgruntled post-Cold War hawks of early 1990's novels and movies.As for the action, Reilly crams so much in so small a space, it's almost laughable. In the space of a few pages, Schofield hijacks a space shuttle, blasts into orbit, downs a Chinese shuttle, lands near Area-7 intact and escapes the spaceship before Caesar's men destroy it, picking up right where he left off. (The joke is that this entire sequence, including how short it is, matches a scene involving spaceships in \\"Life of Brian\\"). \\"Area-7\\" is less of a story for a book than some high-powered 3D computer game - which would be okay if it came with the gorgeous graphics and sound and characters empowered with AI. (Reading \\"Area\\" probably approximates watching somebody else play a video game with every possible cheat enabled.) Instead, the narrative falls back on Reilly's prose which are both action-packed and an action-suckage loaded down with over-blown verbiage and irrelevant technical detail. Nobody just carries a semiautomatic pistol or assault rifle - we get the make and model of every gun in the book, (even though the way they're used seems to make each as good as the other), its nationality and, where applicable, whether the weapon is nickel-plated or whether the magazine is curved or straight. Unfortunately, Reilly needs specifics like that because without them \\"Area-7\\" would have been a mercifully shorter book, and it would have lacked have enough technical data for Reilly to write sentences like \\"what many people don't realize is that....\\" while winning praise for exhaustive research and \\"chilling plausibility\\". The enemy characters have less AI than you'd get in \\"Half-Life\\" - especially in there choice of weapons, rooted in a love of high-tech rather than common sense (having trapped our heroes inside of a hangared AWACS jet, Caesar's commandos assault it with a guided-missiles, even though missiles can't be trusted against the plane's electronics; simply shooting the tires and its engines doesn't occur to anybody). Our heroes seem to be expert at just about anything they come across (with the marines capable of flying helicopters and navigating the electronics and cockpits of the Air Force E-3) and always seem to come out on top (shooting down a Sidewinder missile with a machine gun?). If you want non-stop action that's actually fun, pick up a Dirk Pitt Novel (I recommend \\"Cyclops\\")."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"SEVERAL times while reading this book, I found myself laughing out loud at the unbelievable scenes.

Hats off to Reilly for once again allowing me to be free with my imagination with the help of his work.

Yes. But this IS a work of fiction that involves fantastic elements to put you in a *whoa* mood. I've yet to pick up a book that would do to me what Reilly has.Why not a 5-star rating? Well, in all honesty, Reilly's attempt at the romance between Scarecrow and Fox fizzles and dies before it even begins. It's possible for him to be in a relationship, but the chemistry between him and Fox isn't even \\"warm\\".

It picked up pace quite explosive in the final fifty or so pages, and it was a quick read throughout, but a dissappointing novel.Not really a good one for the new Reilly fan, but if you are already familiar with his work, you should get this one.

Admittedly fast-paced, Reilly's book pays far little attention to technical detail, and instead spends more time describing 7 fight scenes with imaginative outcomes.For a $4 bargain book, I wasn't too dissapointed, but this book will be forgotten within a week.This is garage sale fiction at its finest."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"It's clear from reading so many one-star reviews of this book that a lot of people just don't get Matthew Reilly. He is about one thing and one thing only: Action. And what glorious action it is -- inasane, unbelievable, wildly over-the-top action that doesn't quit for a single page. This book has more shootouts, fistfights, explosions and general all-around mayhem and destruction than a dozen ordinary action books combined! This is probably the fastest paced book I have ever read and I have read a lot. In short, this book ROCKS!!!With that said, if you're looking for well developed characters or deep meaning, you won't find it here. This is just pure escapist fun at its absolute best. Everyone who has complained about the lack of realism or character development needs to lighten up and just enjoy this book for what it is: pure, unadulterated FUN! And if you like this book, check out his other novels. They all ROCK just as much. I can't wait for his next book, Scarecrow, due out soon. LONG LIVE MATTHEW REILLY!!!!!"},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"I've seen others say that Reilly's books are written to be Hollywood movies, and I can't say I disagree. But does it matter? I kept turning pages, I was entertained, and I didn't feel like it was a waste of time.I guess my one complaint would be that the book is littered with diagrams and drawings, and they can keep you from your own view of what scenes and objects look like.That said, I did really like this book. But it won't trigger a life-changing epiphany. I would read Reilly again when I'm looking for a light read."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"After reading Reilly's \\"Ice Station\\" and \\"Temple,\\" I didn't think he could keep up the pace. Ha! Was I wrong! There is SO MUCH going on in this book, you feel like you're riding a roller coaster at warp speed! As in any Reilly book, the characterizations are secondary to the action. And this book has tons of it. I like the characters (at least the heroes) very much. The villains----wow...there are enough here to populate a dozen books! Suffice to say, you're in for a real exhausting read on this one. Bears, kimodo dragons, crazed prisoners, South African hitmen, Air Force traitors, resurrected dead men, you name it---it's here. If you like a thrill a minute in your books, this one is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"If you are a fan of pure adreneline soaked action, this book is for you. If you want strong macho figures in do or die, no holds bar combat, this book is for you. If you like a plot that is remotely believable or if you want a story that has multiple layers that makes an enjoyable read, then this book is not for you.Area 7 is built around the idea that the military has a super-secret installation that it uses for biowarfare research. Inside this base and it's sister base, Area 8, are technological wonders that we read about in Popular Science, wonders that just might be possible.Matt Reilly takes all of the internet conspiracy theories and rolls them into the background of his book. Then he throws in the President and his Secret Service and US Marine protective details, a psychopathic Air Force general bent on a military coup. Throw in a rogue black ops team, a secret South African society bent on killing all the blacks in the world, the Chinese and a serial killer and you have, well, way too many bad guys. It is a good yarn for what it is, a non-stop action book. It has too much action and not enough real substantive story.In my opinion, the premise of a secret society in the Air Force that would plan to assassinate the President and take over the Us Government was a good idea, but the bad guy came off as too much of a comic book bad guy to be believable, the Evil Genius Bent on World Domination that has way to much exposition."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"If you can completely suspend logic and put your brain into &quot;park&quot;, then this is the novel for you. Poorly written in comic book style, there is no lack of action...except none of it is believable. The characters are shallow, the plot is so silly as to almost be amusing, and the exploits of the characters makes the good guys able to dodge bullets and other assorted nasties while the bad guys clumsily get themselves eliminated. If you can understand the rationale for the plot you get to go to the &quot;head of the class&quot;. This is a perfect book to read in front of a fireplace on a cold winter evening...in fact it is a perfect book to use to light the fireplace, hopefully before you waste too much time reading it."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Matthew Reilly has become the self-appointed master of italicized fiction. When he writes something that even he, the author, can't quite believe, he puts it in italics. It's kind of the equivalent of the WHAM, BAM, POW of the old Batman TV series. The problem is, with \\"Area 7,\\" about 90 percent of the text should be italicized. Is it fun? Yes. Is it a \\"Guilty Pleasure?\\" Absolutely. Is it believable? Holy Gullibility, Batman! Not even close.\\"Area 7\\" brings back Shane \\"Scarecrow\\" Schofield from Reilly's \\"Ice Station.\\" This time he's part of a group protecting the President on a trip to a highly secretive military base in Utah. The base turns out to be a scientific enclave searching for a virus to protect all non-asian peoples from a killer \\"Sino-Virus\\" developed by the Chinese to kill all on earth not blessed with asian DNA. Add to that a demented Air Force General (who has been executed, but does not let that stop him), who wants to kill the President and take over the United States, making it a haven for skinheads and white separatists. Toss in a gaggle of serial killers, Komodo Dragons, Bears, Space Shuttles, a huge arsenal of small and not-so-small arms, crop dusters, X-Rail vehicles and a small boy named Kevin. Stir vigorously and watch the whole thing boil over.You want action? No lack of that here. But the non-stop, race against the clock fury gets in the way of really understanding (or more important, caring about) what's going on. \\"Area 7\\" at times reminded me of a Tomb Raider game set to prose. Secret pick-ups, a myriad of levels, and mindless enemies Schofield manages to dispatch even after taking unbelievable damage himself. The problem is Lara Croft is a much better developed and believable character than anyone in this book.So why give it even 2 stars? Despite everything, it is a quick read, and can be fun. I have said before (about \\"Temple\\", Reilly's previous effort), that Matthew Reilly is perhaps the most enthusiastic writer out there (italics on the word \\"enthusiastic\\"). I bet he had a ball writing this. And this young man has real talent. I just wish he would take a breath (and a pill), and develop his characters and plots with the energy he displays in the POW! WHAM! and BLAT! of the action."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Story:Welcome to a place that does not exist outside of the highest levels of the government or the military. The research conducted at the mysterious Area 7 and Area 8 is the stuff of conspiracy theories and nightmares. The last thing that many who enter this place will see is the giant blast doors closing behind them, sealing their fate.This day is different though, for there has been a breakthrough that has a chance to save millions or devastate half the world if were to fall into the wrong hands. The President of the United States wants to see evidence of this for his self and schedules a trip to tour the facility. With him as ever is a contingent of Secret Service agents, military personnel, and White House Staff.This time though there are special guests among the marines that are traveling with the President. Shane \\"Scarecrow\\" Schofield and his fellow marines are the survivors of a previous mission, Ice Station, that ended up going terribly wrong; with total disaster being averted only by the actions of Scarecrow and his crew. In order to let things cool down and keep the press from harassing them they were assigned to what they hoped would be a simple guard assignment to one of the most secure research stations in the country.Unknown to them they are flying into a whirlwind of betrayal, greed, and violence that will once again test their skills to the limit.---------If you ever want to read how a video game plays this is your chance. The story takes a couple of chapters to set up and then takes off into one non-stop action sequence that doesn't stop till the end. The author himself states that he is going for the feel of a big budget action movie and it shows. There is not too much character building other than a few references to the previous book and a couple of quotes in the front that set the tone for why the bad guys do what they do.Also like most action movies, the characters dialogue often takes a back seat to all the explosions going on and can often seem a little wooden, so don't expect any rousing speeches out of them. All in all I liked this book because it really does capture the craziness of a summer blockbuster or an action oriented video game. I really wanted to keep going to see what crazy set piece was coming up next. If you like stories that have a lot of action and not a lot of room for talking this might be one for you. Or if your just looking for a good story that lets you turn your brain off and enjoy the ride take a look at this one and you probably won't be disappointed.m.a.c"},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"The second book in Matt Reilly's Scarecrow series is AWESOME. Reilly is a true master of action choreography and surprising plot-twists. If you're a fan of 24, you can think of Reilly's character Scarecrow as Jack Bauer on speed! Pick up this book today!"},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"For starters, I really like Matthew Reilly. I've read Contest, Ice Station, and Temple. Now if you thought Temple was over the top, wait til you get a hold of Area 7.My wife is a huge fan of Reilly, but about 50 pages into the book (I don't believe that this is a spoiler, but tread lightly) when the main antagonist reveals his plans, I remember saying to my wife how ludicrous the plot was. And it is ludicrous. And some of the action sequences are so ludicrous that you will literally roll your eyes when they happen. Still, Reilly is a decent writer and a good storyteller - you just have go beyond a basic suspension of belief for this one."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"If you enjoy this genre than you'll love this book...whether it's plausible or not. Tons of high octane action. Which makes it unbelievable but so what???? People need to lighten up and read books for the fun of it. However...the Kindle edition....this book has many diagrams and charts etc. and these do not come through digitally. They are important to the story but you won't see them on your Kindle."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Have to admit, I liked this book. The reason it's strange to admit that, is the fact that the storyline was so absurd that it was actually good. There were so many wierd twists and plots, but Mr. Reilly was able to knit them together pretty well."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Typical of all the Matthew Reilly books I have read, you don't get a moments peace. The action starts practically at the first page. I don't believe so much happens within such a short amount of time. Loved it."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"In a secret base in the Utah desert is a place that is called Area 7. The US president is visiting but there are enemies waiting for him... this is the \\"hook\\" of this book. I love most Matthew Reilly books but Area 7 is by far one of his best ones (I liked it more than Ice Station, Contest and Temple). This is a book that you cannot put down once you are past page 20. For those of you who like really fast-paced action thrillers, this is a definite thumbs up."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Another excellent adventure -- you suspect all will turn out right in the end, but the author keeps you wondering!"},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"If you like action books, then you will like this author. The best part of the book is the nature of the main character. I just wish that the action would stop long enough to catch your breath. But at the end of the day, I liked the book."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Scarecrow returns and he does not dissapoint. As expected he must save the world - well actually the president which is as equally important. Trapped in the secret military base known as Area 7. Schofield and his team must protect the president from terrorists and murderous prisoners as they try to escape!With an abundance of action and violence, what more would you want?"},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"This book like the other ones I have read by this author just grabs you and sucks you in. I also like the little diagrams that they make for you to better picture the situation these people are in. When I read I always try to see where the people are and this book is very good for that, plus the non stop action kept me going and going."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"I don't really care that much about the story's believability.

Hey, I just wanted to see whether or not Mother made it out alive!!!!!"},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"one of the best books for a long timeand very easy to read you donot have to be a rocket expert"},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"This book SHOULD be read only if you are waiting in the airport to catch a long-delayed flight, or while pursuing some other (similar) pursuit. This book is undoubtedly rather difficult to part-with while in the middle of reading, but it stretches the border of incredulity to such an extreme point that the whole thing becomes pointless at the end. With multiple conspiring groups trying to prove something/steal something/kill something (i.e. someone, who is, incidentally, the President of the U.S.A) etc. etc. and Reilly's hero Scarecrow and his team trying to save the world (i.e. the President), and the whole thing taking place at a speed faster than anything conceivable, the book is bound to receive some expletives after the end of reading, question is: would they be positive, or negative?"},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"This is an O.K. read. This was a bit over the top: someone should disable the author's exclamation point key because he uses it far too often. Otherwise, if you like a bit of make-believe ala James Bond, this is good."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Somewhat of a disappointment. This story wasn't half as good as Reilly's first book, Ice Station. However, I noticed a lot of similarities between Area 7 and Ice Station which likely therefore didn't make for much excitement for me. Like Ice Station, the setting takes place in a secret underground multi-story facility. There is a bunch of gun battles and fighting between the good guys and the mercenaries. And, everyone is out to obtain or protect a secret prized possession hidden within the depths of the facility. Throw the President of the United States into the mix and you have another whirlwind action sequence thriller that never seems to end, but seemingly gets lost in a bunch of grenades, bullets, and explosives."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Shane Schofield is back in another action packed adventure (this time at a secret military facility called Area 7). The product description on this page explains the plot for this novel very thoroughly (maybe a little too thoroughly), therefore, I won't go into great detail here. As with his previous Scarecrow novel \\"Ice Station\\" the action level is off the charts. The heroes are superhumanly brave, smart, and escape death more times than many other authors' characters combined (and that's just in the first quarter of the novel!). The villians are over-the-top with crazy motivations (more along the lines of a James Bond villian). With all that being said, I found this novel to be very entertaining. I love how Matthew Reilly stages an action scene and ties in the main plot with the various subplots. I found myself reading much longer than I initially planned (the cliffhangers are addictive). I literally couldn't put this book down.So why 4 stars instead of 5? This has nothing to do with the over-the-top action (if you can't suspend your belief with Matthew Reilly's work then you'll just hate his novels). It has more to do with the character dialog than anything else (the character development was pretty good but as Reilly has often admitted action is the main thing, character development is second). I found some of the dialog between some of the characters to be a little clunky. Some the comments by the characters seemed inappropriate for the situation (some of it works, some of it doesn't). This was mainly a problem for me at the beginning of the novel (about a third of the way through the book when the story gets fleshed out more it becomes less of an issue). I found \\"Ice Station\\" to be more fluid with the characterizations.Overall, if you liked \\"Ice Station\\" (which I encourage you to read first in order to get to know the main characters) then you'll like \\"Area 7.\\" The action is still great, the villians are just as numerous and evil, and Schofield is just flat out awesome!"},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"I don't know how I got this book, but I've read it probably 4 times. This last time I wasn't sure if I was going to want to, because after all, I know what happens, but it just sucked me right in again. It's just fun to read! Yes, it's fantastically unbelievable, but sometimes you just need to escape reality for a while. It may not be the most eloquently written thing, but for the subject matter, his style works. The only thing that bugs me is when he italicizes things for emphasis \\"coming right at them!\\", etc, but it does make me smile. It's like you can see his enthusiasm right there on the page. (Reminds me of my brother drawing battle scenes when he was young and making the sound effects as he drew.) As for character development, I guess some of the characters aren't too filled out, but I must not be the critical type, because it just doesn't bother me. I feel like their actions speak pretty clearly about who they are, and I draw my own conclusions about their character when I need to. I would love to see how this would work as a movie, it would fit right in with our over-the-top Hollywood action thrillers. I recommended it to a coworker and she loved it too. It even inspired us to buy/read Ice Station. Good stuff!"},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"While \\"Area 7\\" stands perfectly alone as an extremely intense military novel, it works even better as a companion piece to Matt Reilly's earlier novel, \\"Ice Station\\". Both of the survivors from Capt. \\"Scarecrow\\" Schofield's Marine unit from \\"Ice Station\\" days (Sgt. \\"Fox\\" Gant and Sgt. \\"Mother\\" Newman) are present for the action that takes place at Area 7.In this novel, Schofield has his Marine unit on hand to help protect the President during his visit to a secret military base hidden away in Utah and known only as Area 7. What the President, his Secret Service and the Marines don't realize until too late is that Area 7 just happens to be the home base for a secret plot to overthrow the government. This uprising is led by a courtmartialed Air Force officer who calls himself \\"Caesar\\" and heads up a radical Air Force group known as \\"The Brotherhood\\". Schofield and his unit soon find themselves in the fight of their lives.What takes place during the next 300+ pages is totally unbelievable (just like the the plots from Reilly's other two books) but filled with action and zooms along at a frenetic pace. Not that there's anything wrong with that - it's just that it's almost comic-bookish in that sense. One can almost visualize the \\"Bam\\", \\"Oof\\", and \\"Kaboom\\" dialogue balloons used so effectively by the old Batman television show in the background of some of Reilly's scenes. And of course, as found in Reilly's other novels, there's plenty of blood flowing and more dead bodies than a Schwarzenegger movie. Descriptions of real (and unreal) military hardware abound to impress the techo-geek in all of us! If the reader will just suspend his or her powers of disbelief for a while then he or she will find \\"Area 7\\" an enjoyable experience.The only reason that I gave \\"Area 7\\" four stars was because there was a little too much similarity to \\"Ice Station\\" for my liking. I would have liked to have seen some new ground covered and a few more characters developed. That probably won't be a problem for most Reilly fans, and especially shouldn't be an issue if this is the first book by Reilly that the reader tries.RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Lock the doors, disengage brain, and have the time of your life. So, it's not great writting. The characters don't live long enough to worry about development. Its just action, action and more action.So, like the rest of Reilly's books get it and enjoy."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"What the hell are all of those negative people thinking? Matt Reilly's plots and characters may not be believable, but is anything James Bond realistic? NO! So what if MR makes up some stuff, his books are thoroughly researched and extremely captivating. If you are looking for a fantastic book, pick up this one. I caution you however, there is a great deal of dirty language and explicit descriptions of violence."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Reilly delivers action like no other author. His books read like screenplays (perhaps they are that rather than literature). &quot;Area 7&quot; isn't quite as good as &quot;Ice Station&quot; or &quot;Temple&quot; but it's a fun ride nonetheless. I found that having read &quot;Ice Station&quot; helped with knowing the characters a little better. (Reilly is not big on character development) If Shane &quot;Scarecrow&quot; Schofield and his platoon don't show up in the movies someday, I will be highly disapointed. For a pure adrenaline rush and escapism of the highest degree, read this book!"},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"I fully understand that authors trying to be everything to everyone simply fail...so if you are looking for an action novel that has the ring of truth to every page, look elsewhere than Matthew Reilly. However, IF you are looking to escape life for a little while and you want action, and I mean A-C-T-I-O-N the likes of which you have NEVER experienced before (unless you have read Mr. Reilly in the past), check out 'Area 7' ASAP.Just attempting to detail the speed with which Reilly writes is a difficult task. His writing is like captured energy that, once started, virtually takes off like a Tomahawk Missle on a course that NOBODY can stop. If you don't believe me, give one of his novels a try. 'Area 7' is just another story -- scratch that, NOTHING that Reilly writes is 'just another' ANYTHING, 'Area 7' is a vehicle for an imagination that is hyped on speed and the only outlet is the written page. This story begins as the newly elected President is on one of those military base tours when trouble finds its way into his life. Never fear...with Mr. Reilly firmly in control, it won't take long for the plot to unfold at a blistering pace. Somebody wants the Prez dead, and they want to do it in a really spectacular fashion -- with the entire country keeping tabs on his progress, or lack thereof. One wickedly twisted ex-military Colonel takes over Area 7 with the goal of not just killing the President, but there are a few other objectives he intends to pull off along the way, ALL of which are quite horrific. Add to that the world's first Laboratory-Created Ethnic Virus genetically engineered to kill based on RACE, and for good measure the Chinese have a Space Shuttle which factors into the mix with some rather thrilling results. Is there absolutely ANYTHING within the pages of this (or any) Reilly adventure that can be believed? NOPE. B-u-u-u-t, if you can successfully suspend your belief from page 1 onward and just sit back and enjoy this for the mindless fun it was intended to be, well then you are in for a REAL treat.If you have read Reilly's 'Ice Station' then you will welcome the return of Shane 'Scarecrow' Schofield in this tale. Action piled on top of thrills & chills and even some escaped convicts factor into this Warp-Speed action/adventure that is almost (but not quite) as fun as Reilly's previous gem, 'Temple' (which I just LOVED). In short, if you crave a tale with the scope of Clive Cussler, but with a plot that moves at literally the speed of sound, give Matthew Reilly a few minutes of your time and you will end up adding another author to your growing list of 'GOTTA READS'. Absolutely positively mindless entertainment which succeeds on a grand scale. CAUTION: NOT for those who nit-pik the plausibility of everything."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"I have just recently finished Area 7 and was just as impressed with it as I have been with his other two novels. Its escapism at its best. His characters tend to be a little on the superhuman side but then so do the Indiana Jones types. One good thing about Reilly's books is that my son enjoys reading them as much as I do so it gives us something to talk about which if you have teenagers you know common subjects are extremely rare. I have been on the lookout for his first book &quot;Contest&quot; but can't seem to find it anywhere. Probably never published in U.S.. One thing that always puzzled me about his writing is why an Australian would choose American characters as his heroes without at least someone being from Australia."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Whew!! What a ride this book was. It starts off with the usual character intros, setting the seen, etc, then BAM!!!!, it turns into a super roller-coaster ride all the way to the end with no interuptions. This is the type of story you want out of an action movie. You finally think Schofield and team are about to resolve something but KAPOW!!, they start flying headlong into another of the many twists in the story. Easily read, this takes the best out of a Cussler novel and an action movie and seamlessly melds them together. Please, everyone, do yourself a favour, let your mind go, and purchase this book - you won't regret it. RECOMMENDED!!!!!"},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Wow. He did it again, and made it faster and more furious than any of his other books to date. Incredible. Matt Reilly continues to stretch the boundaries of plausable situations while delivering heart-stopping, adrenaline-fueled scenes that will leave you breathless. Regardless of the minor quibbles readers might have with his style or scenarios, Matt Reilly will give you the quick-fix you need when it comes to action-filled entertainment, WITHOUT wasting the A.D.D. reader's time by endless stretches of description &amp; development.Reilly's novels are like marshmallows - they might not have a lot of &quot;literary&quot; nutrition, but they sure satisfy your craving for some SWEET scenes. Keep it up, Matt. - Kevin"},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Non-stop action with never a pause for food, drinking water or rest. I was exhausted just reading it. The rest of the world seems to stand still while the president is held hostage. No mobilization of the national guard or any of the services delegated to protect the president. It is all left up to a small group of invincibles to save the day. I was particularly intrigued with the Maghook and its use in saving Schofield. He attached it to a helicopter and pulled himself up and inside the aircraft. Now, if memory serves, magnets are attracted to iron and steel, not aluminum, particularly the skin of an aluminum aircraft. After the Maghook incident on the helicopter I sort of lost some of my interest in continuing on although I did eventually finish the book."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"I can tolerate some level of unrealistic aspects. I'm a huge fan of the redundant Clive Cussler beach reads, so I'm used to things happening that probably couldn't.This pushed it, though.It wasn't simply the action. Unrealistic action maybe I could tolerate. Maybe. The characters, though... ouch.I'll put it this way - at one point a man turns to the main character and asks what happened to his father. &quot;Well, he was hung upside down, lowered into a pool, and eaten by killer whales.&quot; &quot;Oh, thanks, the military wouldn't tell me,&quot; the young man responds. Only in Matthew Reilly's world could someone find out his father wasn't simply killed in action but used as a giant worm in killer whale fishing - fed alive to the huge beasts head first - and not bat an eye.People fall hundreds of feet, &quot;faster, faster, faster&quot; only to be stopped by a solid rope without so much as a dislocated shoulder. Little boys eerily know the future. Too many different factions and useless plot twists, such as a brief trip to space.It just seems like Reilly was busy playing Half Life while watching Con Air and decided it could all be made into an interesting novel wrapped around the president.It failed. Just try to read this without throwing it out the window. Everything is too convenient, nothing is realistic, and half the dialogue would sound better in a comic book aimed at 12 year olds. Only worth reading if you pick it up used."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Just before the fourth of July, the President of the United States tours top-secret desert military complex Area 7, where some of America's best germ-warfare experts have discovered a cure to China's ultimate weapon: the Sino-virus, which quickly kills everyone it comes into contact with except those of Asian genetic makeup. What the president doesn't know is that former Air Force General Caesar Russell - supposedly executed for high treason, months ago - has commandeered Area 7, to stage a bizarre and lethal game in commemoration of America's birthday: Russell has managed to secure a monitoring device to the president's heart, which sends a signal to an orbiting satellite; should his heart stop, the satellite will transmit a destruct signal to a number of plasma bombs secreted in America's key airports. Caesar has also gained possession of the president's \\"football\\" - the laptop computer containing the country's nuclear arsenal launch codes - and programmed it to require the president's handprint scan every ninety minutes, or the same devastation will result. What the president has to do, along with his Secret Service and personal Marine bodyguard of Captain Shane Schofield and Co., is survive the onslaught of Caesar's genetically engineered stormtroopers in a fight to the death - with the survivor gaining control of the United States.If you can buy that much of the premise, you'll enjoy this book. A number of even harder to believe complications arise before the end of the story, including assault by Kodiak bears and Komodo dragons, escaped psychotic criminals, elite Afrikaan commandos and a Chinese space shuttle squad. Much of the book's enjoyment requires a healthy suspension of disbelief, and an ability to frequently \\"fill in the blanks\\" as to how, for instance, a renegade (and supposedly dead) Air Force general can manage to raise the support of what amounts to a small army, all without anyone in Washington or the Pentagon any the wiser.There's a great suspense novelist hiding somewhere inside Matt Reilly, and one day maybe he'll get out and write some truly top-notch action-adventure stories. For the moment, Reilly is too enamored of over-the-top movie action, which literally goes on for several chapters on end, is grossly improbable and at times simply impossible to follow, contributing nothing to the plot - he is actually easier to read by skipping forty or fifty pages in some of these sections, filling in the blank with \\"...and they got the better of the bad guys in a firefight.\\" Action like this performs great on a movie screen, but swiftly grows tedious to read.In comparison to Reilly's other books, this one is not as good as Ice Station (to which it is a sequel), but is much better than Temple. It's a pretty good read, but you have to forgive its failings along the way."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"You want action. You need action. There it is. The sequel to Ice Station.

There are several characters with colorful nicknames that you never really get to know making it difficult to figure out what drives these folks to their heroics. There are some annoying inaccuracies too like calling the yoke of a Boeing 707 the collective. Airplanes don't have collectives, helicopters do.

I didn't rush through this book because the plot was gripping, it was educational, or because I was emotionally attached to the characters. I ripped through it because I wanted to know how it ended! As far as I'm concerned, if a book makes me want to get to the end quickly, then I'm happy with it because it means that it got my attention and held my attention! (But what can you expect when you have unheard of military weapons, killer komodo dragons, empathic genetically engineered kids, beyond studly marines, and a little splash of romance?!)He might not be the best writer technically speaking, but Matt Reilly does know how to spin a good yarn.Read this book if you want to spend a few hours involved in mind-blowing non-stop action. In fact, if you're bored read this instead of going to a movie because it reads like an action flick and it will last longer. After reading it, when you're bored again read the first book, \\"Ice Station.\\" Since there is really no character development (who cares!) it doesn't matter which one you read first!I'll be waiting for the 3rd book eagerly (hear that, Matt Reilly? - get writing!!)."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"I read this book in two days, still got the bags under my eyes!

For those who want to get straight to the action this is the book for you. Right off the bat a man gets executed, then brought back to life in the vehicle supposed to be taking him to the morgue.This book is one of the most amazing books I have ever read. For those of you squirmish readers, don't even think of stepping within a hundred yards of this book. Mind-boggling descriptions of the killing and battles leave a clear picture.Included in the book are diagrams of the building with important objects. These are very helpful for those who have trouble remembering the immense ammounts of detail. Reilly's other two books are equally amazing and should be read by anyone who considers themselves a fan of action. If your still not sure try buying a used one, or getting from a library, I'll bet you will go out and get one just for the sake of having a new copy. I couldn't put this book down.

The plot and pace are always full steam ahead with his books and thats all fine and good, but I just wish he would really buckle down and get into more of a storyline and character building and I think with age he will do this, and thus his Magnus opus will be written as all writers do sooner or later.

His vivid imagination is cute at first but his shortcomings quickly get annoying.Matthew Reilly has written the same book four times now, only varying the location and sometimes the characters, if you can call those zero-dimensional stick figures &quot;characters&quot;. The basic element is the same - a fight to the death with high tech weaponry in an enclosed area. The McGuffin is never original - the basic idea in &quot;Contest&quot; originated in a classic science fiction story called &quot;Arena&quot; and has since been done to death by everything from Star Trek downwards. Similarly, the alien spaceship trapped in polar ice is ripped straight out of &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot;.But the most annoying this about Reilly is his juvenile writing style. He can't seem to go more than a few paragraphs without: &quot;And then - SHOCKINGLY - the man's head exploded&quot;. He freely invents weapons and gadgets that defy every law of physics, and thinks he can make them sound plausible just by stringing random numbers and letters in front of them: &quot;A type-240 quasi-nuclear plasma bomb&quot;, &quot;an MH-12 Maghook&quot; which turns the hero Shane Schofield into the poor man's Spiderman, etc.If you just want to switch off your brain and wallow in totally mindless escapism, you might enjoy this book.

I recently read the book at an island holiday resort, and the only reason I didn't throw it in the rubbish (as I eventually did when I returned to the mainland) was that I had nothing else to read on the beach. Reilly develops his characters such that you frankly don't care who lives or dies. His plots are inane, and considering the research he claims to have done, they contain numerous technical impossibilities. Frankly, the book reads like it was written by a 12 year old. Someone should also disable the italics function on Reilly's word processor. Not only are italics grossly overused, they often just don't make sense.

Along with Shane, the other marines and the secret service must try to protect the president. They are also greatly out number. If the president dies, then his heart stops beating.

He packs in so much action that you can't put down the book for a second. One after another things keep coming and never stop till the end. This is a real page turner. Matthew Reilly throws out stuff at you that you never saw coming. I also love he style. He would start an incredible event and then soon another. There would be more then one thing happening at once.

Matt Reilly just simply puts the imagination on the fast track and gives the reader a thrill ride he'll never forget! Inaccuracies? Comic book like quality? Hardly! Come on people! Books are meant to entertain and stretch the imagination! And this book IS entertaining and will leave you breatheless. Shane Schofield is just not some marine grunt who shoots people and says really cliche catchphrases: He's smart, and in the book you actually feel the gears turning in his mind as he outruns, outthinks, outshoots, and outsmarts his foes that seem to come from every which way! Also in the novel even the minor characters have major parts in the book! Shane is a hero that actually isn't superhuman, and that shows lots of human emotion in the novel. And to top it all off it's not just your regular &quot;everybody survives in the end&quot; kind of action novel. Characters will die in this novel, and there are a lot of unexpected twists and turns that will keep you thinking and reading and wondering what will happen next! Reilly keeps things quick and fast, and you as the reader will be smiling at the end of the very last sentence, still feeling the rush of the action....and of course you'll be reading it again! If you liked Area 7 and you plan on reading Ice Station, pick up Scarecrow too! It is a must!"},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"I needed and interesing book for a long flight.

The comic strip Beetle Bailey is more militarily accurate (and frankly, more mature too).Not only does it seem to have been written by a team of apes with crayons, it's also unnecessarily vulgar. I don't have any problem with gritty language in a book aimed at mature readers; but this book's plot is aimed at pre-teen level, and much of the language used is pretty foul.If you're interested in military thrillers, try elsewhere. Tom Clancy, for instance. As for this lump of trash I can only recommend it as good kindling."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Another excellent book by Matt Reilly. However, as much as I enjoyed it, I have to say I didn't like it quite as much as Ice Station. (That's a small \\"quite\\" though - I still loved it.)Why? Because of the President character. In Ice Station, each of the characters was interesting in their own right. But the President in Area 7 isn't actually all that interesting, beyond the fact that he's the President of the US of A. He rarely has anything humorous or iconic to say, unlike Scarecrow Schofield or Fox, who are decent characters, given the limitations of the genre.A number of reviewers have commented on Reilly's action scenes being a little far-fetched. Or, unconvincing. And this is a definite minus: I find myself swinging along best when I am at least a little bit convinced of the action: that is, nothing jars too hard. But occasionally there's a solid lump or two which I can't help stumbling over - the outer space scene in Area 7 is a little far-fetched, for example.Overall, however, I think Reilly does a wonderful job of walking the fine line between overblown and plausible. And the way the action never lets up till the very end of the book definitely keeps you turning the pages. It's quite easy to suspend your disbelief for the majority of the book, as long as you're not expecting something which the action genre isn't going to give you - and that would be a stern adherence to reality and whole chapters devoted to subtle character development. Overall this is a great read if you're a fan of fast-paced action novels with a slightly futuristic edge."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":". . . Matthew Reilly owns the franchise.I may end up sounding just a bit schizophrenic here; after all, I'm a guy who used the term &quot;gratuitous action&quot; (the first time I am aware of its use) to describe Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Yet I like Matthew Reilly--who throws a ton more action sequences into his fiction than even Jerry Bruckheimer--and didn't like Temple of Doom.Why? First of all, Indiana Jones was never JUST about action--the Harrison Ford Character was a cool, noirish thirties dude, nothing like Shane &quot;Scarecrow&quot; Schofield, Reilly's hero--in the way that a Matthew Reilly novel IS just about action. When they turned the Indiana Jones series that direction with the second installment, a delicate balance between character, sensibility, and action was upset (and never fully recovered, although The Last Crusade was a good corrective). Second, Reilly really is a master of the action thriller in a way that those who made Temple of Doom aren't. Third--and this seems a little counter-intuitive, but I think it's right--pure action works better in a book than on the screen, for two reasons, I think: In a book, you can describe and depict things that would probably be impossible to pull off, or at least would come off seeming implausible or contrived on the screen. Second, if one were to make a film of Area 7, it would either be so frenetically paced as to be unwatchable, or would be substantially altered to make it play on the screen.Overall, I'm a Reilly fan. I like his singlemindedness. I like Scarecrow Schofield. I (generally) like the way he sets up his scenes and pulls them off. I like the amount of jeopardy he packs into his books. And I like his high concept.I would've given this book five stars, except, for me, two things drag it down. I thought the racial angle was a cliche, and I thought he went over the top with the release of the condemned killers and the animals from their cells. I do generally like the way he manufactures mayhem, but these two things just didn't work for me.As for other criticisms noted at this site, I don't read this kind of fiction for rounded characters, for emotional realism, or even for plausibility. There is a cartoonish aspect to any Reilly thriller, but I at least don't expect or ask for anything else. So long as he pulls it off. Which I think he does.4 and 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Area 7 By: Matthew Reilly IBSN: 0-312-98322-0 kentucky fried pandaExplosions Galore!Are you afraid of biological war? Or, are you afraid of diabolical government scandals that deal with the destruction of minorities in certain countries? If you answered yes to either of these questions you would have a distinct like for the book Area 7 by Matthew Reilly.Area 7 is about a lone American soldier who is assigned to guard the president in a top secret intelligence mission. His name is Shane Scofield call sign: Scarecrow. At the base the president learns that his hired scientists have created a biological weapon that specifically targets people with certain skin pigments. That means that they created a literal racist weapon. When all seems to be a routine tour, it turns for the worse. The president finds out that every major airport in America has been planted with a thermonuclear plasma warhead which is set to explode upon his death. The story continues as he is pursued by rogue Air Force soldiers and Chinese commandos. Somehow, Scarecrow must protect the president against all odds. This book is definitely a science fiction story.I liked this book because of its fast pace action and ever developing storyline. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about government conspiracies and nuclear war technology. Because of my recommendations though, People of a higher age group should read it. If you would like your child to read it take heed that it contains graphic scenes and \\"swear words\\"This book was a page turner because of the extreme pace of the action. The story unfolds during the action instead of after it.It was very easy to pay attention to this book because it constantly delivered action.The plot was a tad unbelievable because it employs the total treason of 50 air force soldiers.

Every few pages some wholly unbelievable action takes place *just as* something else equally unlikely *almost* kills, maims, or somehow incapacitates our hero. Reilly sees fit to italicize how close they are to danger, as indicated by my asterisks above, not just once, not just twice, but repeatedly and far beyond any level of acceptability.Reilly gives the reader a lackluster plot incorporating all the worst elements of a Seagal or van Damme ego-booster. Far from a page-turner, I found no trouble setting Reilly's work down to listen to the flight attendant \\"go over the safety features of this Airbus A320.\\" It was far more interesting than the book -- a shame it only lasted a couple of minutes."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Before I begin I must say this...AREA 7 is completely and totally unbelievable, is basically an insult to anyone's intelligence over the age of 5 and alot of tripe.But, having said that, if you turn your brain to \\"off Mode\\" then you will find this book a wild ride.The unbelievable plots and action will not disappoint Reiily fans. They are all so unbelievable that it is impossible to take them seriously. Readers who expect even a minute dose of realism will hate AREA 7 but Reilly fans will find it to be in the same mold (no pun intended) as his earlier ICE STATION & TEMPLE.The surviving characters from ICE STATION are back (guess they couldn't get out of their contracts) but Reilly has \\"developed\\" them more this time out. There's the typical plot with twisting sub-plots, a quick space shuttle ride and the usual \\"you're gonna hate 'em\\" villians.Throw in a few Kodiak bears, komodo dragons, elite racist commando units, a 250 mph rocket sled ride, a genetically-engineered orphan (really!) a serial killer, a gutsy U.S. president (a message here?)a nuclear blast and you have AREA 7.Remember, turn your brain to \\"off\\" before reading which Matt Reily fans do automatically.Just one question...why does the main character always wear sunglasses even in the pitch dark and 90 feet underwater?"},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"If you're interested in quality action scenes, and a story that twists and develops non-stop; look no further than Area 7. Matthew Reilly continues with his hero from Ice Station, pitting the daring Schofield and the President of the USA in a showdown with multiple enemies. Ranging from elite special forces armed with the best of weaponry, to runaway fugitives, Area 7 is in no short supply of the bad guys. Area 7, located deep in the Utah desert, known only as a secret military institution, gets a visit from the President and his security escorts. Among his escorts, belongs a marine, whos eyes hide legendary combat experience; in short this guy can kick ..., his name is Schofield, call-sign Scarecrow. The book houses page after page of intense action involving foreign special forces, and corrupt military members. Matthew Reilly, utilizes his characters, story, and setting effectively to compile a story that is relatively exciting for those that are interested in STRICTLY action. The book does not belong in a \\"What does that word mean?\\" category, the lack of advanced vocabulary, did at times really diminished my attitude towards the book. Note that while Reilly, is effective at his descriptive action scenes, lacks a sense of sophistication in the writing, good or bad is up to ones own preferences. As most readers will observe, the amount of unrealistic page turning scenes adds up, and can have a detrimental effect on your overall liking of the book over time. Though I must give credit to a creatively constructed story line, I would still have to conclusively state that this book is really made for readers, that appreciate suspense and bone-chilling combat scenes, over minimal rationality. If you are more turned on by books that depict realistic scenes, and portray an ultimate image of complexity, this book may be one that stands in your bookshelf, partially untouched. None the less, if your looking to take a break from Tom Clancy's style, this ones a definate candidate."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Reilly's foray into his second Schofield adventure takes us deep into the Arizona desert and to a place called Area 7. In much the same vein as Contest we are placed in a sealed environment with several groups of people bent on killing each other under the guise of a \`game'. The novel throws in even more action and adventure to the point at which several gears are missed as Reilly throttles it up to maximum power and keeps it jammed wide open for the entire novel. There are two interlinked yet nonsensical plots: the first - the American president has a transmitter attached to his heart and unless can avoid some steroided 7th squadron army personnel bent on murdering him and ensure he handprints a \`football' every ninety minutes lest it set of mini nuclear explosions in fourteen major airports and generally survive he'll be responsible for the death of the US as he knows it. The second - the Chinese have created a lethal virus that only targets non-Asians, created through a genetically created child called Kevin, that an ex-South African military elite unit, turned mercenary organisation, are after.Amongst all this Schofield - callsign Scarecrow - is part of the presidential detail caught up who need to rescue the boy, the president, kill the baddies in as spectacular fashion as possible and save the day. A multitude of assorted characters are with and against him, from the deranged and resurrected Caesar Russell (terribly cliched), the five 7th squadron teams and a bunch of criminal medical subjects on the bad side to Brainiac, Gant, Book II (son of Book who ended up on the casualty list in Ice Station), Mother and Elvis on the good - to name a few.So, our erstwhile hero drives the watery canyons (in a manner that Reilly somehow manages to make bigger and better in the latest \`Temple'), flies helicopters, crashes AWACs down enormous elevator shafts, (scenes in elevators is a favorite for our author) kills what seems like more people that were originally in the opening cast, manages a trip into low earth orbit in a X38 (a space shuttle with missiles) and eventually saves the day, the boy, the President and manages to arrange a second date with Gant.I think this is probably the weakest of Reilly's novels to date. Even for one prepared to take it all with a major pinch of salt and totally suspend reality it got a little out of hand. Nevertheless if you like over-the-top all action novels then this is not one to miss."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"This is the third book I've read by this author and probably the best of the bunch, which isn't really saying much. The general plot of the story is very intriguing, but he never develops it. There were so many different ways he could have gone, but he decides on creating 3 or 4 subplots and that's it. The story ends up being somewhat confusing (who's the bad guy in THIS chapter?). If you're just in it for the action and have time to kill, this book serves its purpose. But if you're looking for something half way plausible, with more than just a dash of character development, you might want to look elsewhere (like anything by Vince Flynn)."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Adventure and excitement right from the beginning.

I picked Ice Station up in Australia and was about a third of the way into it when I bought Reilly's other books, it was so good. Now I don't want to sound like I have no ability to suspend my disbelief, as Ice Station was a flash-bang ride which would realitically kill even a superhuman, but Area 7 was a little too much to be believed. The hero is inhumanly fast, strong and tough, with the endurance of the Terminator. I have no problem with this, I know it's not a non-fiction book. At the same time, a few of the feats Scarecrow does are SO impossible that they defied even my ability to suspend my own disbelief. That said, it was a fun read, just not what I'd hoped in the follow-up to the magnificent Ice Station. I understand Reilly is working on a third Scarecrow book. Can't imagine where he'll get sent next, or what he'll have to survive, but I'll get it regardless."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Area-7 - an underground fortress in SW America - is one of the most secure military installations on Earth. Using tons of high-tech, most of it involving bio-warfare tested on condemned criminals, Area-7 scientists develop cures for diseases engineered by America's enemies. Unfortunately, \\"Caesar\\" Russel, a disgraced and supposedly executed former USAF general, seizes Area-7 and locks everybody - including the President and his loyal marine contingent - inside. Russel has implanted a microscopic transmitter on the president's heart connecting the unwitting chief to nuclear warheads placed in every major northern city. All will explode should Caesar's troopers locate and kill the president. Also, the \\"football\\" - the president's nuclear-war trigger - will signal the bombs unless the president keys in his palm print every 90 minutes. With his special shock troops, Caesar can easily kill the President, but he needs the Chief to suffer the humiliation deserved by all politicians. Unbeknownst to Russell, Area-7's South African chief bio-chemist has his own plans now that he's developed a cure for a Chinese bio-engineered disease. Unknown to him, some of Ceasar's own men have gone into business themselves - with the Chinese. Unexpected by them is the role to be played by Area-7's residents - the vilest criminals in America. And a nasty shock to them all is \\"Scarecrow\\" Schofield - the world's toughest Marine and the novel's hero.I wasn't looking for literature - deep characters, a complex plot, irony - yet \\"Area 7\\" still left me hungry. Reilly not only tosses character development, he practically junks the idea characters - each is a walking mannequin who knows his dossier and never deviates. (The book starts off with Schofield's nominal superior being described as a cowardly careerist; a civilian presidential aide is from page 1 one of those politically connected, vapid and craven morons who populate failed sitcoms. By the climactic end of \\"Area 7\\", Schofield's boss is still a martinet, while the civilian faces Russell's plan with a desperate call his stockbroker - sell dollars!!!).\\"Area-7\\" isn't literature, but it's no fun either - it's far too unoriginal. Reilly fans like to compare Schofield to Indiana Jones, but he's more like one of those forgotten Indy-clones who romped countless botched \\"Raiders\\" rip-offs. The story is largely a string of clumsily choreographed action scenes, none of which will surprise to anybody who's watched late-night cable or straight-to-video movies or played computer games like \\"Half-Life\\". (Underground fortress; hide around corners, watch-out for the special troops, kill, steal their ammo, rinse and repeat.) Reilly's idea of using a heart as a fail-safe isn't new either (read Nance's \\"Medusa's Child\\"; see the movie \\"Spawn\\") while Caesar looks like any of the disgruntled post-Cold War hawks of early 1990's novels and movies. Reilly crams so much action in so small a space, it's almost laughable - as if his books were oversized screenplays in search of a producer, but I can't even imagine Steven Segal giving \\"Area 7\\" a serious look. In the space of a few pages, Schofield hijacks a space shuttle, blasts into orbit, downs a Chinese shuttle, lands intact and escapes the spaceship before Caesar's men destroy it. \\"Area-7\\" is less of a story for a book than some high-powered 3D computer game - which would be okay if it came with the gorgeous graphics and sound and characters empowered with AI. (Reading \\"Area\\" probably approximates watching somebody else play a video game with every possible cheat enabled.) Instead, the narrative falls back on Reilly's prose which are both action-packed and an action-suckage loaded down with over-blown verbiage and irrelevant technical detail. Nobody just carries a semiautomatic pistol or assault rifle - we get the make and model of every gun in the book, (even though the way they're used seems to make each as good as the other), its nationality and, where applicable, whether the weapon is nickel-plated or whether the magazine is curved or straight. Unfortunately, Reilly needs specifics like that because without them he wouldn't have enough to fill up his action scenes; nor would \\"Area 7\\" have enough technical data for its author to write sentences like \\"what many people don't realize is that....\\" and win praise for exhaustive research and \\"chilling plausibility\\". The enemy characters have less AI than you'd get in \\"Half-Life\\" - especially in there choice of weapons, rooted in a love of high-tech rather than common sense (having trapped our heroes inside of a hangared AWACS jet, Caesar's commandos assault it with a guided-missiles, even though missiles can't be trusted against the plane's electronics; simply shooting the tires and its engines doesn't occur to anybody). Our heroes seem to be expert at just about anything they come across (with the marines capable of flying helicopters and navigating the electronics and cockpits of the Air Force E-3) and always seem to come out on top (shooting down a Sidewinder missile with a machine gun?). If you want non-stop action that's actually fun, pick up a Dirk Pitt Novel (I recommend \\"Cyclops\\")."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"&quot;Area 7&quot; is a thriller containing an incredible amount of high-octane action. This huge amount of action, and the lack of realism in many of the things that happen, requires a great deal of suspension of disbelief on your part if you want to enjoy the book.But there's more to &quot;Area 7&quot; than just page after page of action.True, most of the book consists of action scenes with bullets flying everywhere and things exploding and a fantastic line-up of various groups of really nasty bad guys who are all out kill the good guys (and each other) in the most violent and horrifying way possible.It's also true that the story is not particularly believable, nor are the characters very well developed. The bad guys in particular are nothing more than cardboard figures, and the good guys aren't much better when it comes to resembling real people.But Matthew Reilly keeps you reading despite these weaknesses because he has a couple of tricks up his sleeve.The plot is actually pretty interesting (despite being unrealistic), and there are a large number of imaginative plot elements and very creative twists and turns. Several times after you thought you'd worked out what's going on you discover that things are more complicated and the bad guys are more devious than you realized.I especially liked the start of the book, where the leading bad guy, U.S. Air Force General Charles &quot;Caesar&quot; Russell, is executed in Leavenworth prison for treason and murder. But the execution doesn't &quot;take&quot; - as soon as his dead body is delivered to his Air Force cohorts they revive him! And at the same time we're informed that the newly inaugurated President of the USA has some kind of super-miniature electronic device implanted on his heart!From there on the book goes somewhat downhill until around the middle, where the plot becomes better fleshed out and we realize that things aren't as simple-minded as we originally thought. It's because of these clever developments in the story line that I'm giving &quot;Area 7&quot; four stars instead of the three that I'd been planning for most of the book.I'm also giving plus points for the many drawings and maps that make it more interesting to follow the action. And I like the fact that several of the good &quot;guys&quot; are actually good gals, and that they're just as tough and ingenious as their male comrades.At the end of the book there's a seven-page interview with Matthew Reilly, and I must admit that I like this sort of thing because I like reading about how authors go about creating the books they write.In conclusion, if you like imaginative (albeit unrealistic) thrillers with lots of action, action, action, and are willing to almost totally suspend your disbelief, then &quot;Area 7&quot; should entertain you.Rennie Petersen"},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"In the UK we got this some months ago and it ain't bad if you understand what you are buying. This is written in the style of an Indianna Jones film, if you pause to think about it then it might spoil your enjoyment, this is a one sitting roller coaster of a book.The scenario is interesting (i.e Area 7 itself) but the background and plot does not bear much thinking about. The action is non stop and features some of the characters from the rather good Ice Station. I personally think it is wrong to liken this to Clancy or others because it does lack a plot, but that is not to say it is a bad book!If you like non stop action, this is for you. If you like plot driven action then perhaps you might want to pass on this one."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Reilly delivers another fast paced, action packed race against time in Area 7. The story hooks you from the start and it's impossible to put the book down after that. It was great to see the book continuing the same characters from 'Ice Station' and even adding a touch of romance to their relationships.It all begins with the President of the USA visiting Area 7, a secret Air Force base, only to find that he and his secret service agents are being hunted down by rogue Air Force units. Schofield and his crew have to protect the President and a secret virus antidote from their pursuers (also including a group of violent criminals) and prevent the ultimate destruction of Area 7. The plot moves the characters throught the base, an underground railroad, the canals of Lake Powell, even up into space, carrying the reader along for the ride.I recommend this book to every keen reader. Don't expect realism, but you can expect an action packed, edge of your seat ride that'll leave you dying for more Matthew Reilly!"},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"I enjoyed \\"Temple\\" but this book was just awful. Reilly's books are full of amazing, improbable but fun action scenes. You spend a few hours suspending common sense but having a good time. In this book however there were two elements that were just so bad that they ruined the rest of the adventure. 1) The career Marine captain has a romance with an NCO who reports to him. and 2)There was a bear family that played a key role in the story - mama bear, baby bear and papa bear. Right. The only place you will fine a papa bear in a bear family is in Goldylocks.Read \\"Temple\\" instead."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"I started reading this book with trepidation as i was told its a guys book, well that may be true but from start to finish it took me six hours to read and i loved every minute of the wild ride i took with Schofield and co.The storyline caused me some minor ? in places as some things didn't quiet add up, and the characters were only developed enough to just be able to id good gugs, bad guys and idiots but not for one moment was i bored nor did the book slow at all from its fast paced adventure.My final comment would be that the characters were developed enough to allow me to use my imagination for the rest and the storyline while being a little out their (what was ET if not out their) was interesting, busy and unique with out losing me for one moment. So unless you want to learn about thermonuclear physics or some such other thing my advice would be to read and enjoy the ride. (I loaned this to my sister and she enjoyed the book also so you be your own judge)"},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Ok, so maybe I'm a bit bias. Matt Reilly is my favorite author, I have read Ice Station and Temple more times than i care to count and they're my two favorite books of all time.Now...a basic summary of the plot is fairly decently given on this page anyway..and giving anymore away would be a crime, suffice to say expect twists galore.Above all else, this is a sequel to Ice Station, so reading that first will make Area 7 make more sense and be more fulfilling. The characters of Shane Schofield, Libby Gant, and &quot;mother&quot; return.As with any other Reilly book, those seeking truth and absolute believability should look elsewhere, but those seeking out action have come to the right place. This book brims with action and with Reilly's unique writing style, you can't put it down. I read it in less than 24 hours(about 18 hours of which were devoted to school and sleep, the other 6 more or less to Area 7.)Basically, if you want kickass action, adventure, and white knuckle excitement, then I'd reccomend anything by Reilly in a heartbet, but those who come out of a movie or finish a book and go &quot;Yeah, right, like that could ever happen&quot; may not have the right mindset for this book.On a scale of 1-10, I'd say a 9.5 or so."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"I'D GIVE THIS BOOK FIVE STARS FOR ACTION, AND 0NE STAR FOR BELIEVABILITY.

GREAT BOOK FOR A PLANE RIDE, OR VACATION."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"This could be the dumbest plot ever written. Mad general survives execution, plants nukes in major cities, traps President in secret facility, tripwires nukes on both President's heart AND the nuclear code &quot;football.&quot; In the supersecret facility where the Pres has been trapped, of course, are rogue teams of elite, steroid-enhanced killer Air Force -- yes, USAF -- commandos POTUS hunting. Why, I ask, would any criminal mastermind create this kind of game?Throw in a super-virulent, Chinese, racist virus, a cellblock of criminal psychopaths used for biological testing, idiotic plot twists, physical impossibilities -- a WWI biplane that flies at 190MPH -- and you have the worst piece of adventure fiction since Jon Land. The only person who would touch this would be Steven Segal. The author should be horse-whipped."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Reilly followed up a fairly decent action tale called Ice Station with this way overdone tale involving Shane Schofield, Libby Gant and Mother from the first book and adding a few new characters. It seems like the author is trying to outdo the makers of the Die Hard movies.It just seems that wherever Schofield goes he is caught in the midst of corrupt military and competing corrupt foreign powers. He escapes from one impossible situation after another, some of which are insults to the reader.I would have rated this book lower but the three main characters are highly likable and the reader hopes that something may develop between Schofield and Gant."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Capt. Shane Schofield is settled into his new assignment, after his Ice Station adventures, as head of the President's Marine Corp escort when the poopy hits the fan again...and the reader is pulled along into another rip roaring, action packed Reilly thriller.Readers of Ice Station will be happy to see that Schofield is joined by Mother and Fox along with the almost return of Book. Together they must defend the President, the country and the world for that matter, from a renegade group of Air Force personnel. If the Prez's heart should stop beating it all goes to hell. Though out-numbered, out-gunned and taken almost completely by surprise, Scarecrow and his crew make a game of it. Reilly strength is in his descriptions of combat. There is a firefight that lasts about 70 pages. Taking place on several fronts and different levels you won't welcome interuptions. Sure Reilly's books break the laws of military strategy, physics, gravity and logic but so what. You pick up books like this to be entertained and if you aren't too much of a stickler for details you will be."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"All I can say is with Reilly you can expect one heck of a ride.In this latest non-stop adventure, Shane Scofield is back (previous outing was in \`Ice Station'). When the President decides to visit a top-secret base in the desert, known as Area 7, he stumbles upon some secrets he didn't even know about. Basically what happens is a large group of military soldiers from an elite squad in the Air Force take over Area 7 and kill almost everyone who is in charge of protecting the president. The mastermind behind this wants the president dead and has created a little game in which the president stands little chance of winning. Once the presidents heart stops beating, a device that was implanted, unknowingly, in his heart years ago, will cause a series of explosions (blast plasma warheads) at many of the busiest airports around the country. Needless to say, Scofield is one of the few survivors after the initial onslaught.Matthew Reilly was quoted as saying that he likes to write \\"about action, thrills and adventure, and if developing characters slows down the action, then developing characters gets the chop\\". This is it in a nutshell. First suspend your beliefs, because when you get a hold of this relentlessly paced book it won't let up. It even comes with illustrations in case you don't have time to think. From chases in space to chases in lake Powell to the idea of racial viruses, it's a tremendously fun mindless read.Highly recommended strictly for fun."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Area 7 is the latest book from one of Australia's best new thriller authors. Tom Clancy may have lost a few steps, but Matthew Reilly is there to take his place!Area 7 has a very clever plot centered around one of Reilly's recurring characters, Shane Scofield. The President of the USA has a transmitter on his heart. If his heart stops, then terror will be unleashed on the world. It's up to Scofield to protect the President and save the world.The book never lets up. From the first sentence, the characters are off and running. Reilly has a very good writing style and he can maintain the level and pace of action with seemingly very little effort.It's been a while since a thriller has captivated me quite like Area 7. It combines the best elements of a Tom Clancy thriller with the action level of a Michael Crichton novel.An A+ all around"},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"This book stinks. It should never have gone to press, but then you can never underestimate bad taste. I'd never heard of Matt Reilly and was hoping for a techno-thriller with a strong basis in fact -- something in the tradition of Larry Bond, Tom Clancy, Stephen Hunter, et al. Instead, I got a novelized version of a video game, complete with \\"gaseous explosions\\" of hollow-point bullets (sensational and utterly false), American military personnel speaking Australian slang and equipped with a bizarre collection of non-standard weaponry including the FN P90 submachine gun, repeatedly and erroneously referred to as an \\"assault rifle\\" capable of \\"spewing thousands of rounds per minute.\\" The worst part of the book is its portrayal of American military personnel as amoral, bloodthirsty, racist, and dedicated to the violent overthrow of the US government. This book is truly garbage."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"This book is totally absurd. Yeah, it's got a lot of action, but if it's not supposed to be science fiction, then it should touch base with reality occasionally, and it doesn't. However, if utterly ridiculous plots, hair-raising, unbelievable, nick-of-time escapes from death and destruction, and burning incense to feminism are your thing, then by all means get this book. But if you like your action stories to be semi-believable and rational, then avoid this book like....like....like....the Sinovirus......"},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"And I do mean REALLY STUPID. Like a previous reviewer, I bought this to keep me occupied on a long flight. When, within the first 20 or so pages, the author introduces two made-up gimmicks that are central to the plot, I knew I was in trouble. First up is a liquid nuclear explosive. Yeah, right. Anyone who even slept through high school physics would know that's a crock. Then there is the super oxygen carrying blood transfusion that gets the major bad guy through an execution. In a science fiction story, the spare use of such gimmicks might be ok. But here the author uses them because he just isn't bright enough to come up with a good story otherwise.Had I been on a train trip, this book would have gone right out the train window. However, they frown on opening windows on airplanes so I just left it on the plane. I probably should have taken it off with me and tossed it in the trash to save the next passanger in my seat from having to deal with this."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"After 50 pages, I had to give it up!! The plot was simply too unbelievable. I had no desire to find out \\"what happens next\\" because I knew that it would be ridiculous."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"I thought Reilly had pushed the limits of silliness with &quot;Ice Station.&quot; At least, the level of annoyance among readers would surely prevent any further publications by this author. Alas, this was not to be. The author returns with yet another offering of acceptable literary skill combined with a total lack of research and common sense. I will say only that any reader possessing any brain activity whatever should spend their book money elsewhere. There are many excellent authors and worthy stories to entertain everyone out there. This book, like other Reilly stories, will likely leave only a bad taste among readers, and regret at time wasted reading it."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Mr. Reilly requires only one thing of a reader...the ability to ignore fact and absolutely suspend belief. If you can accomplish that, his books will in fact keep you involved. If, however, you require even a modicum of reality in your stories, this will be as disappointing as 'Ice Station', if no more so. It will probably appeal to the PS2 and X-box crowd, but if you seek a military style techno-thriller that you can read without stopping every two pages to wonder at the inaccuracies, try Tom Clancy or Harold Coyle."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"I enjoy Matthew Reilly's books. This is the 5th I've read, and I've learned to not read two in a row because it's just too much action for a person to take. You need to take a breather in between.Oh, I should mention that I'm a girl, and testosterone is not a requirement to enjoy MR's books. It may enhance the experience, but it's not needed.Once again, Mr. Reilly starts with bullets and explosions and doesn't let up 'til the end. All sorts of implausible actions takes place (space shuttle?) and various bad things are stopped at the last second. Well, in once case, there were actually 2 seconds left...Before you shout SPOILERS!!! remember what this book is - an action adventure story. You know that the main character is going to make it through to the end and save the day. MR truly writes like a roller coaster - you're safe and it all works out in the end, but there are a lot of loops and twists to scare the STUFF out of you. And you might have to stay awake an extra hour or three to find out how it ends.Hence - don't read MR's books one after the other if you have to get up for work in the morning on a regular basis. Give your body a break. Read a little Jane Austen or something in between. (The one with zombies is especially poignant.)This is a sequel to Ice Station, which I liked better. This is fun, but Ice Station is just better. Or maybe I'm getting used to all the violence and I need more to get the same 'high'. Mother is back (LOVE HER!) Schofield (duh - main character) and Gant are back too. Everyone seems to have a Call Sign, which cracks me up. There's an interview with the author at the end, which is always fun. He even jokes about his penchant for killing characters off. (Hint - don't get emotionally invested in anyone!)If you like your action ridiculously insane and implausible, sort of Indiana Jones-ish with less basis in reality, Matthew Reilly is the author for you. Just remember to suspend all sense of disbelief, go with the flow, lean into the turns, and try to get to sleep before your alarm goes off in the morning."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"This is a somewhat inferior sequel to Reilly's \\"Ice Station\\" and features USMC Shane Schofield, Mother, and Libby Gant (now Shane's girlfriend) from that book. The setting is predominantly the American Southwest and the plot hinges on keeping the President of the United States alive in order to foil a terrorist attack that will literally set the U.S. back a couple hundred years.Reilly's character development is almost nil and this is problematic because we can't root for the heroes if we don't know their real motivations behind their actions. Also, there's a crucial plot twist in the next novel in the Schofield series, \\"Scarecrow\\", that isn't quite justified simply because we don't know much about the characters. I think the plot twist helped the novel, but at the same time, I wondered if I should care about someone I knew so little about.Reilly, however, is a master of action and his scenes don't disappoint. Gunfights in airline hangars as well as a flooded pit filled with Komodo dragons (yes, really) factor into the novel as well, and they're the prime reason I love his books: the off-the-wall action. It's like Indiana Jones/James Bond/Jason Bourne on meth.Reilly does raise a few points on treason and traitors in this novel. What does it mean to betray your country? What if you feel that your country has betrayed you? I thought it was well handled, especially given the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 as well as the many state militias who openly declare their mistrust or outright hatred of the United States government. Reilly's novels make it clear that you don't always know who you can (or should) trust.This obviously isn't Great Literature (TM) and certainly won't be compared to Chekhov or Shakespeare, but he does give Clive Cussler and Tom Clancy a run for their money."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"The Scarecrow has two things to juggle this time, keeping a President alive, and keeping the nuclear 'football' out of harm's way and from making a big, nasty explosion.Throw in a nasty villain, a choice between sharks and the chop, a whole bunch of just released killers, and a really big plane to have some of the action in and around, and you get an entertaining covert team thriller."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Shane Schofeild: If he had a nickle for every time he saved the world, he'd have.... fifteen cents. But that's still a lot.Area 7, the second of the Schofeild novels, finds our intrepid (if slightly two dimensional) hero in the middle of a US Airforce base/research facility, acting as a body guard to the President of the United States. With him are some friends from the previous Schofield novel, also guarding the commander in chief. The base, called Area 7, is the home of the United States' must cutting-edge biological weapon research. More specifically, the scientists at the base are working round the clock to find a vaccine to a Chineese biological weapon called the Sinovirus, which targets only non-Aisian people (via their specific pigmentation). Well, they've finally developed a vaccine, but guess what? The fifty well-armed, highly trained, ultra-elite soldiers guarding the base are actually traitors, intent on killing the Prez and stealing the vaccine! To make matters worse, they've attached a satelite transmitter to the President's heart, which will denotate nuclear weapons in major cities all over America if the POTUS's heart stops beating. In other words, if Mr. President dies, so does the country. It's up to Schofeild and friends to defeat the bad guys and save the day!But in a Reilly novel, its never that simple. Matthew incorporates a series of plot twists into his relatively straightforward narrative, including a racist military conspiracy, a corrupt South-African general, a plot to take over America, a thermonuclear weapon, escaped convicts, and a trip into outer space. Admit it, you're just drooling over this novel, aren't you?Now, I'll admit, Area 7 is not going to change your life (besides getting you hooked on Reilly novels). The characters tend to be one sided and cliched. The ending is the predictable happy one, where the hero gets the girl, the little kid isn't harmed, and all the fuzzy little animals are safe..... but its an action thriller. Are you really looking for powerful moral statements and thought provoking subject matter in an action thriller? No. You're looking for a lightening-fast plot, explosions, gunfights, chases, and lots of violence. And that's exactly what you're going to get."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Matt Reilly's novels are not for everyone. Readers with a discerning palate expecting thought-provoking characterization and literary depth should most certainly turn elsewhere. On the other hand, those seeking non-stop thrills, jaw-dropping action, and an extremely fast narrative will be highly entertained by Reilly's books. Suspension of disbelief is a must when tackling one of his works. Sit back, relax, and simply enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"I'm a huge fan of military book whether they be fiction or nonfiction. I'm also a big fan of tactical action games, so it's no surprise I enjoyed this book very much. I actually read it before Ice Station (the first Scarecrow novel), but enough background information is given to easily follow along. Although the character development is a bit under par, the amount of action more then makes up for it. Not a very deep, but a very good read."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"How many times do you read on the cover of a book all those promises of excitement adventure and action only to be disappointed at the end? This book has no comparison in the extreme action adventure and suspense novel. If I turned the pages any faster the book would catch light. The characters are absolutely superb and I would like to see Lucas or Spielberg bring this to the big screen or in fact any of his novels.The only disappointment came when one realises they have finished the book. Come on Mr Reilly write another as I cant hold my breath much longer."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"this book is just flat-out exciting, sure it unrealistic. But after all that not why I read it. If you looking for something that could happen, this book is not for you. This reads just like an action movie. If you like those type of things this book is for you."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"&quot;Area 7&quot; is Matthew Reilly's third novel to be published in the U.S. and his fourth overall novel. &quot;Contest&quot;, his first published novel has just recently been published in the U.S. Like his prior novels &quot;Ice Station&quot; and &quot;Temple&quot;, there is little character development, but plenty of non-stop, highly inconceivable action.&quot;Area 7&quot; begins with a trip to a secret underground military/testing facility by the President of the United States. In addition to a large group of Secret Service agents, Scarecrow Scofield and most of the surviving members of his team from &quot;Ice Station&quot; are along for the ride as well. Once they arrive, they learn the facility is in the hands of a madman who has planned a world-changing event for a number of years. What ensues is a race against the clock to prevent the destruction of a number of U.S. cities. The key to the survival of the U.S. is the survival of the President. Scarecrow and his team are tasked with ensuring both happen.The novel hits the ground running and doesn't let up. The elements of Reilly's previous books are here -- commandos, deadly animals, madmen, etc. Although very similar in structure to his other works, if you enjoyed either &quot;Ice Station&quot; or &quot;Temple&quot;, you will enjoy this one as well. The reason behind keeping the President alive is a bit farfetched in addition to a number of the action scenes in which the heroes avoid being killed, but overall if you can overlook the unreality of such events, &quot;Area 7&quot; will prove to be an entertaining read."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"I must admit I was very dissappointed in Ice Station. That book had so many plot twists and improbabilities that it just galled me to read it. Picked this one up by mistake.Reilly still is fond of the deus ex machina plot device. Things just seem to pop up just when the characters neeed them most. Same goes for the story line, as such. Need some weapons? No problem, let's put a bunch on Marine 1 (although I note in Mr. Reilly's defense, he does state in the forward that he took many liberties with the facts) and let the characters find them when they need them. Let's put some Komodo dragons into the mix so we have some excitement there. Add stuff as it's needed and justify it as you go along.While the book seems to have been written by a teenager who is making things up without regard to accuracy, it is a fast read.Don't expect to find any great American novel here. Just mindless action with no regard for facts. Not much character developement either, as another reviewer has noted. Just understand this, the book reads like a James Bond movie watches. If you've seen a Bond movie, you know what I'm talking about. No &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; there, but fun and mindless.Ditto for this book. Fun and mindless. Add a star if you don't care about facts or believability.A nice winter storm read."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"This is the first book of Matthew Reilly's I've read, and it's very thrilling. To me, it seemed to combine the intensity of a halo novel by Eric Nylund/William C. Dietz and complexity of an Agatha Cristie mystery, you get an extremely fun-to-read book. I never wanted to set this book down as I was reading it, because it was so thrilling, and I was also curious, as reading a mystery, as to what would happen next. Brilliantly written!"},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Area 7 by Matthew Reilly definatly earned its place on my top five favorite books. I can not explain how vivid the imagery is, how much action is packed per page and is still retains a phenomenal plot without spoiling due to the constant action. On the critical side, the book's plot is incredible. It TRULY makes you sit back and say, woah... that COULD happen. On the entertainment side. The book is better, yes BETTER than watching a modern fight movie as far as the wonderful descriptions etc. Overall, I would give this book a 9.9 out of ten... and that's ONLY because nothing is perfect ;-)"},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"Don't get caught up in how plausible the plot is....or the character development. If you like action - I mean heart-pounding, breath-taking action - you gotta read this book!"},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"If you want to see how fast you can read a 500 page book, then Area 7 is the book for you. As with all of Matt Reilly's books, it is non-stop action from the first to last page. The excitement never lets up. I had to force myself to put it down so I could get some sleep. Even then, I managed to finish it in 2 days. I would definately recommend this book as a must read to anyone who likes action/adventure books."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"I wish it were possible to give a zero star rating. On many occasions I almost threw this book in the bin. But that wouldn't be honouring the trees that went into making it so I finished it for their sakes. What a waste of time."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"I have to admit, I've read Reilly's other novels. They were overly done and worse than most comic books or James Bond wannabes. Their plot ideas, though, were pretty interesting, though totally impossible in every way. Area 7, though, has no plot, just comic book action that would make Superman wince with embarassment.The plot is just too idiotic to be believed. For no reason, an Air Force general and hundreds of military personel want to destroy 14 of America's largest cities. Look out, Dr. Evil, you have competition, no matter how inept it is. The general decides to do that by killing the president, but I'm not going to bother explaining the plot. The ensuing action is directly from the imagination of a 6 year old pretending to be a Mighty Morphin Power Ranger (even their plots were more believable).Super-computers, super-soldiers, super-machine guns and super-helicopters, what more could a thriller need? How about komodo dragons, grizzly bears, secret bio-weapons, and South Afrikaan assassins?The hero even crashes a 737 into the bottom of a 100' shaft, smashing the cockpit flat, and walks away! Reilly did no research for this book. It was obvious that he was distracted most of the time and didn't realize how badly he was messing up.FORGET THIS BOOK! Hopefully, Reilly will some day go to writing school and learn to actually create plots and character that we won't laugh out loud at."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"A literary equivalent of those dumb [...] action films. Sadly it couldn't get by on fun scenery chewing acting from the bad guys or the charisma of a leading actor. These films work because they are over in less than a couple of hours and don't give you time to realize the implausibilities of the plot until later and by then you have aready enjoyed the experience.Sadly a book nearly 600 pages long cannot do this no matter how fast a read it is (and this book is fast) give the reader plenty of time to realize that grenades thrown by the bad guys seems to have 20 minute fuses (the grenades used by the brave minor hero sacrificing himself for the greater good explode immediately though, of course)and that when falling 200 feet , you do not have time to unholster your batclaw prime, aim and fire it before going splat!George W Bush gets to act like a bad [...] though exchanging bullets with the bad guys, taking over space shuttles at gun point and even helping to destroy evil Chinese spaceships... I wish I was kidding!Avoid!"},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"I don't know what book the other reviews read that gave low to average ratings, but it certainly wasn't this one in my opinion. I've read books in the hundreds and this one had no trouble keeping my attention, wanting to read what happened next. There was plenty of action, adventure, science, and even some romance in this story, all tied together very well. If someone feels that some parts were less than believable, then I think they need to question their imagination, not the book or author. Many of the ideas presented are really not that far-fetched, if at all. It is a classic tale of good versus evil with many twists and turns. A quick reader could predict some of the events and outcome, but overall I was very satisfied with this book and immediately began to look for other Matthew Reily books to read. If you're looking for a good action / adventure touching on biowarfare, government / military conspiracy, and truely good and evil characters, give this book a shot. I don't think you'll regret it."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"I very much enjoyed the authors original book Ice Station. This endeavor had a lot of interesting concepts: A group of rogue air force officers plan a coup d' etat when the President visits a top secret base in Utah where an antidote is being developed against a sinovirus,a virus developed by the Chinese to kill non-Asians. A group of South Africans have been recruited to work on the project. Their motive is to retake Africa and restore white power. They plan on stealing and using the antidote to the virus. Marine Captain Shane Schofield returns as the books hero. My problem with this writing is that I like action scenes and hero characters to seem to be realistic or at least close to being believable. The battles and confrontations here were virtually all just too over the top for my taste. I had a hard time finishing this read. Area 7 seemed to me to move into the realm of more science fiction as opposed to being a straight ahead thriller."},{"Title":"Area 7","review":"This book is one worth staying up all night reading for. And even if you don't think you it is worth that, it is just what you will do when you think, &quot;I'll just start this book off...&quot; you will end up finishing it in the proccess. Matthew Reilly, who is also a excellent public speaker is one of the best authors I have had the pleasure of reading his books. I look forward to his next book Scarecrow and hope and am sure that it will keep up with the pattern of getting more exciting with each page. Scarecrow is the perfect hero, and the continuence of his presence in this book continued from Ice Station makes us even more in awe of Reilly's ability to bring someone to life, through words."},{"Title":"Expanding Empires: Cultural Interaction and Exchange in World Societies from Ancient to Early Modern Times (The World Beat Series)","review":"The second volume in the outstanding Scholarly Resources &quot;World Beat&quot; series, Expanding Empires: Cultural Interaction And Exchange In World Societies From Ancient To Early Modern Times is a selection of profoundly insightful, expertly documented, scholarly essays concerning the changes and legacies that various empires contributed to world history ranging from the influence of Alexander the Great, to the first Imperial Unification of India, to the dynasties of China, and more.

This book scripturally guides you into speaking out the attributes of God, the works of God, our relationship to God and others, and the character of God we want to cultivate in our lives. There is nothing better than planting the seed of God's word in your life..allowing God to water it through His Word..and seeing it grow..seeing it change and transform us into His image. This book scripturally helps you to also plant seeds in God's garden...by blessing Him, telling Him how wonderful He is, but loving Him, and telling Him how grateful we are.If you have ever had trouble knowing where to start in prayer...or if you are a seasoned prayer..this book, taken directly from the Word of God will enable you to speak out the life-giving, life-changing seed of the Word of Almighty God."},{"Title":"Face to Face: Praying the Scriptures for Spiritual Growth","review":"As a newly &quot;re-found&quot; Christian, I found this book a great source to learning how to pray again. I didn't want to call on God only from desperate need, nor did I want to thank Him only when things were going great. This book is a terrific guide to a daily time of purposeful prayer with God. It takes us step-by-step through Praise, Confession, Renewal, and Intercession,(among others), using scripture verses right from the Bible. The premise is that by praying God's own promises and glories as written in the Bible, we can more align ourselves with His will and more fully realize Him in our lives. On the same vein, I really appreciate &quot;Praying the Bible for your Marriage&quot; by David &amp; Heather Kopp."},{"Title":"Face to Face: Praying the Scriptures for Spiritual Growth","review":"I have a very difficult time keeping my focus while I am praying. This book has helped me so much to direct my prayers and keep them in a Scriptural context. It not only leads the reader in daily prayers of Adoration, Confession, Renewal (Scriptural reminders), Petition, Intercession, Affirmation, Thanksgiving, and closing prayers, but also has a weekly schedule of praying for yourself and others such as your church, your family, and world missions. The Scriptures are well-chosen for their subjects, as well as not chopped up so as to make them out-of-context. This book is for morning devotions, and there is a companion evening devotion book which is excellent as well."},{"Title":"Face to Face: Praying the Scriptures for Spiritual Growth","review":"The idea for this excellent compilation of personalized Scripture couldn't be more natural. \\"Praying the Scripture for spiritual growth,\\" as the subtitle says it, can nurture a person's faith like no teacher's commentary can.Author Ken Boa has advocated meditating on and personalizing Scripture for many years. In this book, he offers his own translation of many Bible verses, adapting them into a first person or second person perspective. In this way, a reader dwells on the Words of God offered as direct praise. Instead of reading, \\"Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one. You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might\\" (Deut. 6:4-5 ESV), he reads, \\"O Lord my God, You are one. I want to love You, Lord my God, with all my heart and with all my soul and with all my strength.\\" Instead of reading, perhaps passively, these words from Proverbs 23:4-5, \\"Do not toil to acquire wealth; be discerning enough to desist. When your eyes light on it, it is gone, for suddenly it sprouts wings, flying like an eagle toward heaven\\" (ESV), Boa urges the reader to dwell on its personal application: \\"I will not wear myself out to get rich; I will have the understanding to cease. I will not set my desire on what flies away, for wealth surely sprouts wings and flies into the heavens like an eagle.\\"For devotional use, the book offers Scripture meditations in five categories for each day of a three month period. The categories are \\"The Attributes of God,\\" \\"The Works of God,\\" \\"My Relationship to God,\\" \\"The Character I Want to Cultivate,\\" and \\"My Relationship to Others.\\" With a couple mediations in each topic, Boa encourages the reader to follow a 93-day pattern of thoughtful consideration and prayer, praising God with His own words and being confronted by His demands on our character.That's the first half of the book. The second half is a topical guide to Scripture's affirmations of God's character and the Holy Spirit's work in us. Divided into the same categories listed above, this guide lists many more verses than are printed in the devotional section, which could facilitate longer meditation on God's glorious character and His teaching. For someone in the habit of reading through the Psalms and Proverbs every month, this book or it's companion, Face to Face: Praying the Scriptures for Intimate Worship, would be a great alternative."},{"Title":"Face to Face: Praying the Scriptures for Spiritual Growth","review":"I have gone through this devotional guide several times and each one is a rewarding experience. Boa helps you to personalize the Scriptures to your individual needs. My copy is well-marked with thoughts, dates, and locations. Any tool that helps an individual grow in his or her relationship with God the Father through Jesus is to be commended. Prayer is two-way communication with God. There is a place for answered prayers in the back of this book. Both the Old and New Testaments are included in the readings. Intercessory prayer is part of the experience, i.e., he references Scriptures that pertain to praying for other people, including those in leadership. Jesus said the law is summed up in two principles, to love God with all your heart, mind, and soul and to love your neighbor as you love yourself. This book helps a person to do that on a consistent basis by getting one's thoughts aligned with God's Word and will."},{"Title":"Face to Face: Praying the Scriptures for Spiritual Growth","review":"I use this book and the Volume One for my daily devotions. Kenneth Boa makes the scriptures come to life. Volume Two is so personal, after reading the passages for the day I can think back to them, when I need to, during my day.

This textbook is nicely organized and is written in a simple, straight-forward way."},{"Title":"Racial and Ethnic Groups, 6th Edition","review":"No wonder Enron and Arthur Anderson cooked their books. Business people of today graduated college not with lessons on how to behave in business, but rather this extreme leftist spin which can be summarized in five words: \\"whites bad, everyone else good.\\" In fact, those words, in one way or another, made up the introductions and conclusions to nearly every paper I wrote in this required class, and my final score was an \\"A.\\"Schaefer obviously suffered some trauma or another at the hands of white-Anglo-Saxon-Protestant capitalists and he vents his frustrations in typical liberal style - by skewing facts and spouting rhetoric at every turn. This should be required reading for a critical thinking class, as nearly every sentence violates some fallacy or another. His book is a classic example of revisionist history at its finest (or worst, depending upon one's viewpoint).I could write volumes debunking his \\"fallacy by omission\\" techniques which continue, page-after-page, like some anti-white propaganda paper from The Bizzarro Klu Klux Klan. Instead, I'll point out a few key \\"facts\\" Mr. Schaefer tries to pass off on unsuspecting college students, already primed for such drivel by the U.S. public education system.Mr. Schafer: Blacks earn lower incomes than whites because of racism and discrimination.Omitted facts: Blacks suffer a much higher rate of teen pregnancy than whites, significantly lowering average earning wages because young mothers have fewer educational opportunities and mobilities. Blacks who have earned doctorates are primarily in the field of education, a low-paying career path, whereas whites tend to gravitate toward law, science, medicine, and other high-paying jobs. Schaefer also neglects to mention that Japanese Americans - once greatly discriminated against in this country - generally earn higher than whites. Using Schaefer's argument of racism vs. earnings, there must be some serious antiwhite, pro-Asian discrimination going on in this country. In fact, Chinese and Japanese Americans are so consistent in their higher earnings that Schaefer had to \\"dumb them down\\" by lumping these two groups into into a category known as \\"Asians and pacific islanders.\\"Mr. Schaefer: IQ tests are culturally biased in favor of whites, resulting in lower IQ scores for blacks and hispanics. Schaefer's argument: a particular question may ask the test taker to compare objects, such as a regatta and oars, to some other set of objects. Clearly, an underprivileged black or Hispanic child has never heard of a regatta.Omitted facts: for over a generation, IQ tests have done away with standard objects, and replaced them with nonsense words, such as a sploible and a fluggum. These words have no English definition, and thus cannot be racially biased.For people such as Mr. Schaefer the only possible solution to lower income, poor scores on standardized tests, and every other conceivable woe regarding \\"subordinate\\" groups is discrimination, so let's throw more money at the problem.There is big business in lawsuits when a \\"subordinate\\" can shakedown a financial institute, lender, government agency, or employer for millions over discrimination. Schaefer helps proliferate such lawsuits in this book. The sad thing is that you and I pay for this. Whether its tax money, or increased prices for consumers to offset the millions lost by Denny's restaurants when some black customers got their food late, we all lose.Thanks Schaefer."},{"Title":"Racial and Ethnic Groups, 6th Edition","review":"Racial and Ethnic Groups is extremely well researched, informative and entertaining.

The only occasion when a White racial identity emerges is momentarily when Whites fill out a form asking for self-designation of a race or one of those occasions when they are culturally or socially surrounded by people who are not White.

His effortless ability to engulf you in the crimes and chase of his books, is uncanny. He is detailed and precise in his delivery, thus, you feel as if you are the central character or the prey, being chased.The protagonist, Luther Green, is believable and authentic, his mannerisms, attitude and belief, that he has left his old life behind, is challenged, when he is forced to do what he was trained to do, despite his underlying gut, that alarms him that something is amiss, in this current mission.He faces a formidable opponent, in that of his mentor, Alex Deavers, whom has been more than a teacher, but that of a friend.He consciously decides to uncover the real truth behind his mission, while stopping on the way to protect his family and a long lost love. Luther is oblivious to the revelations, occuring within himself, that regardless, of how far you stray, you still have a level of allegiance to those you love.The plot delivers crime, espionage, politics, strategies, violence, and urban life, while carrying you from one continent to the next. The shady characters, he and Deavers encounter, are realistic, and plausible, while igniting action and uncertainty, to the pace of the novel.The story line is masterful, in that it encourages readers to go further in their knowledge, of political structures, government processes and politics. It's refreshing to see an author that believes in the intelligence of his readers enough to go beyond, the standard; boy meets girl, they fall in love, someone cheats, blah, blah blah rhetoric, which I have grown overly tired of reading.Do yourself a favor, and pick up any one of Gary Hardwick's mystery novels, sit back, relax and allow yourself to be transported into a crime."},{"Title":"The Executioner's Game","review":"The U.S. Secretary of Commerce and other government officials have been sent to identify the level of economic aid needed to help in the devastation left by the AIDS virus in Central and Southern Africa. A staff of bodyguards and military are on hand to ensure their safety. Among the entourage is Alex Deavers, and as they are headed back home with a deadly secret sold to the secretary in their possession, their truck explodes. Deavers narrowly escapes death, but not before grabbing the suitcase. This leaves him on the run for his life and on a mission to gather the additional information needed to complete the puzzle and right a wrong. However, it wasn't in the plans for Deavers to escape the explosion and now he's been identified as a rogue agent.Luther Green is a trained assassin hired out by E-1, a secret department of the U.S. government. Though no one acknowledges its existence, E-1 originated in the CIA. Their primary mission is to rid the world of bad guys - particularly those who threaten the security of the United States. Luther has been called in to take on the hardest case of his life. He must kill Deavers, who just happens to be the man who taught him everything he knows. He's given the mission and sets out to accomplish it, despite his personal feelings for his friend and mentor. Through the cat and mouse chase that occurs once he tracks Deavers, Luther begins to question not only his capability in catching his former trainer, but he also begins to question his own humanity and realizes he has given up the possibility of a normal life to serve as an assassin. Deavers manages to stay ahead of him, but leaves clues along the way which plant seeds of doubt as to the full validity and scope of the mission Luther has been assigned.Finding out who he really is deep inside and battling with the rule book of his chosen profession are constant obstacles for Luther. When he is lead to his hometown of Detroit, he is faced with the safety of his family who become pawns in the operation. With high-speed chases throughout various major cities, hand-to-hand combat, the good guy back-up when things get sticky, and a host of weapons and gadgets, Gary Hardwick's newest thriller, THE EXECUTIONER'S GAME is without a doubt a page-to-page thrill ride. The scenes are vivid, the characters are intense, and suspense surrounds every movement of the characters. The ending was completely unexpected and speaks to the racial injustices prevalent in society, including the government.Hardwick has clearly used his expertise as a film director and screenwriter to pen a novel displaying an extra level of intensity that a lot of authors are incapable of pulling off. I enjoyed THE EXECUTIONER'S GAME and look forward to seeing it on the big screen and can already see the intended lead, Jamie Foxx, playing the role of Luther Green.Reviewed by Tee C.

It explores the area of espionnage with a twist.I love Hardwick's down to earth and thoroughly readable style of writing. I am not a huge fan of espionnage books, but Hardwick made me literally devour this book. He writes humble and human characters and his plots are always a whodunnit til the end.I still prefer to read Hardwick's police stuff, but this book was a nice change of pace.Great, great."},{"Title":"The Executioner's Game","review":"Gary Hardwick fans won't be disappointed with his latest, The Executioner's Game. Using select rules from his main character's E-1 Operations Missions Manual, Hardwick sets a riveting stage for readers to be fully immersed into a well written spy-thriller that not only entertains, but stimulates thoughts about race and crime of the inner city and how the two are perceived by law enforcement. This novel clearly establishes Hardwick as a daring storyteller with the kind of verve and energy that will keep old fans wanting more and newfans seeking out his other works. A great read to kick off the New Year (due to be released on or before January 1, 2005)!"},{"Title":"The Executioner's Game","review":"I really enjoyed the characters in this journey of the governmental backwashers. The storyline and premise are fictional--or are they? The secretive governmental assassin program is purely fictional--right? And what about the conspiracy in the Motherland that describes events 1,000 times worse than Hitler's genocide; that is pure fiction--isn't it? Let me put it like this, if the author of this book is NOT under governmental surveilance,well......The main character is a cold, calculating, patriotic governmental assassin who is 100% willing to sacrifice EVERYTHING and EVERYONE to complete his mission; that is, until he starts to uncover truths left by his \\"rogue\\" mentor that are beginning to make him analyze his loyalty and the government \\"brass\\" issuing the missions.It's non-stop action from beginning to end! I highly recommend this author's work. He has the ability to transport you into the scenery and have your pulse quickening thru-out the action scenes. It's not too long or too short. He don't waste pages and pages of reduntant backstory stuff; gives U just enough to keep it rollin'.If you enjoy suspense, conspiracy, assassins, honor and code type of stories, U better add this one to your collection mannnn!!--BnHereB4"},{"Title":"The Executioner's Game","review":"I'm not usually a big fan of books like this but I like Hardwicks others books.

Some novels should be read just for the fun of it. I do have a problem when the author pays no attention to detail, apparently writing in a hurry.For example, the protagonist, Luther Green, attended a prep school in Detroit, then went to high school. Let's suppose he was 17 or 18 at this time. He went to West Point and graduated with honors, a four year program. He intended to become an Army Ranger but instead got recruited to become an assasin for a secret department of the U.S. goverment and spent three years learning the trade. Okay, but then the author wrote that Luther Green was 21 years old when he was finally approved as an assasin and sent on his first assignment. New math? I could go on with further details, but you get the drift. Whatever happened to book editors who actually read the book?"},{"Title":"The Executioner's Game","review":"Assassin Luther Green is a patriot. He serves his country in the way he knows best--by following orders and by killing those who are deemed a threat to the nation. When he's called back to headquarters, he knows this won't be a routine kill. Still, he's startled to learn that his next assignment is the man who brought him into E-1, the secret agency responsible for America's ultimate sanctions. Alex had trained him, inspired him, but now he's a threat to the country--and Luther knows how to follow orders. The only problem is, something about this particular job stinks.It doesn't take Luther long to realize that he's following a trail that Alex has carefully laid down. Alex is trying to teach Luther something, show him something about E-1 that would prove that the Agency has gone off-wire. Luther isn't buying, and even if he did, he's been assigned a job and he intends to complete it.Alex's trail takes him through the inner cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia, and finally Detroit--cities where drugs and guns cheapen life to the point where professional assassins fit right in. Alex's message is getting through, but Luther has sacrificed his entire life to his country and isn't about to be stopped. Only when the true coverup becomes known can Luther confront the real enemy.Author Gary Hardwick delivers an exciting story of assassination, martial arts action, and inner-city drama. Making Luther a black protagonist in a profession dominated by whites adds to the conflict--and heightens his sense of betrayal when the secrets are finally revealed.Hardwick's writing is occasionally clunky, but mostly workmanlike, moving the story along while deepening the reader's interest and buy-in to the characters. Overall, THE EXECUTIONER'S GAME is definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"The Executioner's Game","review":"Gary kept my attention throughout the book. I dug the non-stop action, tight dialogue and unpredictable plot. Nice job.Marcus Love, author of Chameleon Lover"},{"Title":"The Executioner's Game","review":"Luther Green is a government assassin working for an agency known as E-1. Luther is called off his current mission from somewhere overseas and brought back to America. The director of E-1 personally assigns him to a new assignment--find and kill the man who trained Luther as an agent, Alex Deaver.Although Luther accepts the task, he finds that the director's behavior and the assignment odd. Deaver leads Luther on a cat and mouse chase that takes the reluctant assassin back to hometown, Detroit. It places Luther at a disadvantage because he has family and friends living in the city. Deaver's knows this and is willing to place Luther's family in the line of fire if he has to.Deaver's leaves clues for Luther to discover while they play their Executioner's Game. And soon Luther finds that everything at E-1 is not what it appears to be.Gary Hardwick's 'The Executioner's Game' is an exciting, fast-pace read, with interesting characters and a government assassin with a style all his own. Well worth the read.[...]Lost Hours[...]"},{"Title":"The Executioner's Game","review":"I made it to page 210 out of the 251, then didn't bother to finish. I couldn't muster up enough interest to care about what happens at the end. It had been slow going from the beginning and the only reason I continued was to find out the \\"big coverup.\\" Once that was revealed, and it was shockingly underwhelming, I was through wasting my time.If the back cover hadn't revealed that the writer was a screenwriter, I probably could have guessed. The major problem with the book is its inconsistent inclusion of descriptive detail. The only character thoroughly described and developed is a peripheral one. The two leads are little more that stock characters who get a couple of lines descibing them (compared to the couple of paragraphs for that peripheral one). The main supporting characters are practically stick figures.The author takes great pains to describe the music Luther listens to (the movie soundtrack), yet just about every other detail is glossed over. There was one 3 or so page passage that felt like part of a novel - Alex reliving the explosion. It's too bad there weren't more like it. I think this story would have been more enjoyable if it had been a screenplay/script rather than badly masquerading as a novel."},{"Title":"The Executioner's Game","review":"I enjoyed the straight forward story and although I pretty much could see everything coming I still enjoyed the book's mysteries as they unfolded. The book is ultra-violent in places and I consider that a good thing. It was definately a page turner and I got through it very quickly. I've since read three other Hardwick books and consider this one of the better ones."},{"Title":"The managerial choice: To be efficient and to be human","review":"This is a must for leaders and managers.

Learn the correct way to do your weight training."},{"Title":"Essential Chest and Shoulders: An Intense 6-Week Program (Men's Health Peak Conditioning Guides)","review":"I have read a few body-building books and think this one, along with the other books in the same series (arms, legs, abs, etc), are the best to date.One reason for this is the insistence upon good form. Like a lot of people, I have in the past gotten carried away with adding more weight and not paying attention to form. This is still a temptation but the message on good form presented in this book is finally starting to stick. I especially was impressed by his argument for paying attention to the negative part of the exercise.Another STRONG point of the book is that it provides you with lots of routines. After finishing the books 6 week course,you are supplied with an additional 4 or 5 good routines for future use. As the author states, it is important to change routines often, so that your muscles do not get too used to a given exercise (and you dont get bored). However,I am very lazy about putting together routines and tend to stick to one. Thanks to this book this is no longer a problem, because it does it for me; I now have complete sets of routines that I can follow and am beginning to see important gains as a result.The book also does a good job of covering the basics of good nutrition, rest and, for all of you gym rats who would ignore it,aerobics (ever see those pudgy cro-magnon loking guys in the gym who claim their bloated tummies are muscle)!!!! He doesn't cover supplements though and that is understandable given the controversy and hype surrounding so many of them."},{"Title":"Essential Chest and Shoulders: An Intense 6-Week Program (Men's Health Peak Conditioning Guides)","review":"This is the 2nd book on weight lifting I've read. The first one being \\"Muscle Logic\\" which was both difficult to grasp as a beginner, and also a very unrealistic program to actually accomplish (read it and you'll see why you couldn't do this unless you owned your own gym).But essential chest and shoulders is not like that at all. It is written for guys like me who knew virtually nothing regarind weight training. It gives excellent introductory material regarding the muscle groups and strategies and general fitness information.The program that it gives is a 3-day a week program, 2 focusing on chest and shoulders, and the 3rd day on other muscle groups. The program is easy to follow, starts simple and gets more in depth as the time goes. But not overwhelming for beginners.The program does focus on chest and shoulders, so if you were interested in lower-body, abs, or arms, you may want to look at another book (which the men's health publisher makes virtually identical books for both arms and abs).Most of the exercises are performed with dumbells. And the book is designed for someone who is just getting started, and can be performed solo if you don't have a partner (its a lot easier to escape dumbell bech presses at an early level than a bar if you don't have a spotter, but its good to have a spotter).The plan is again, fairly simple and designed for beginners. Experienced weightlifters will not gain anything from this book. If you're looking for a starting point, this is for you."},{"Title":"Essential Chest and Shoulders: An Intense 6-Week Program (Men's Health Peak Conditioning Guides)","review":"This book is simply a program to improve strength in your shoulders and chest. I have followed it for the prescribed 6 weeks with very good results. I can see better defenition in my chest and shoulders and I've increased the amount of weight i can lift considerable. However, this is mainly because i had not lifted in a year. It is very basic and anyone who follows a workout plan already would have most of the excercises given in this book. I would reccomend buying it only if you are a true beginner."},{"Title":"Essential Chest and Shoulders: An Intense 6-Week Program (Men's Health Peak Conditioning Guides)","review":"i started the program from this book not even 7 days before and i can feel the stress on my muscles which is an indication of success. I learned some very useful concepts about weight training for beginners e.g. Dumbell presses instead of bench press and more, which is really true and fantastic. This book mainly focuses on chest and shoulders but emphasizes on legs and abs also. The designed program is very friendly yet intense. There is no exercise for biceps in this book. I recommend anyone to buy this book along with Kurt's &quot;Essential Arms&quot; and &quot;The complete book of abs&quot;. I cant wait to see the results and to give 5 stars to this book. Last words: DEDICATION &amp; DETERMINATION will help you make any weight training book useful otherwise FORGET ABOUT IT."},{"Title":"Essential Chest and Shoulders: An Intense 6-Week Program (Men's Health Peak Conditioning Guides)","review":"I have never before posted a review or returned an item to amazon, however I am doing both with this book.It really is only for beginners: and in fact in that regard could be regarded as quite a good book (although I think the mix of exercises in weeks 5 and 6 of the program could cause injury to someone who hasn't been lifting for,say, 3 months at least.)The author DOES show how to do exercises with perfect form. I had assumed from the fact that it was one whole book just focusing on chest/shoulders that there would be a number of different programs given: this assumption being given weight by one of the other reviews here which states that there are 'lots of different programs' included: but these are of a different type: for strenght training etc. None of them were prgrams that I would follow: I think Nate Green's book does a better job by giving one four different programs to follow.One of the issues I have with some of these books (this applies to Built for Show by Nate Green as well) is that they can look good on the page but be difficult to apply in real life. For example in Nate's book you alternate between a wide-grip seated row and a dumbbell press in the Fall program, but in a busy commercial gym the minute you get off one machine to head to the free weights section that machine (often at the other end of the gym) will be taken by someone else, making it difficult to stick to the rest times specificed by the author: I wish alternatives were given based on this possibility (for example why not does a bent over row followed by pdumbbell press etc). In fairness though, I was quite dubious about Nate's program until I did it in the gym this week and I was impressed."},{"Title":"Essential Chest and Shoulders: An Intense 6-Week Program (Men's Health Peak Conditioning Guides)","review":"The book delivers what it promises: An Intense Six-week program to completely train your Chest, Shoulders and as a bonus the Back. Yes the book title doesn't mention the Back at all, but the programs include exercises for the \\"latissimus dorsi\\" or just \\"lats\\" as they are usually call in gym jargon. This alone makes this a complete upper body exercise program, since the \\"latissimus dorsi\\" is what gives the upper body its V-shape, and is the largest upper-body muscle, so large that the core training program hits it from three different ways.But this book is more than just an upper-body workout, it is a small, handy and complete reference with useful information that includes: essential physiology, aerobics, flexibility stretches, and essential principles and techniques.If you are interested in similarly practical and complete exercises programs for the rest of your body, you may also want to consider \\"Essential ABS\\", \\"Essential Arms\\", and \\"The complete Butt and Legs\\" by the same authors."},{"Title":"Essential Chest and Shoulders: An Intense 6-Week Program (Men's Health Peak Conditioning Guides)","review":"I have found this book to be very informative.

For example, the long-running detective show Broadway's My Beat is not listed. Some of the alphabetical entries provide scant information, while others provide names not easily found elsewhere. It is obvious that this book was published prematurely, but there is still a wealth of information. There is almost no narrative. Maybe Dragnet's Sgt. Friday told them, \\"Just the facts!\\" There are many newer reference works available, including John Dunning's Encyclopedia of Old Time Radio."},{"Title":"Radio's golden age: The programs and the personalities","review":"Pages and pages of data detail on the cast, writers, etc. but very little on the personalities or good stuff on the shows. There's nothing here to tell why this is radio's \\"Golden Age,\\" so I promptly donated this book to my local library. The other books on radio from Amazon are a lot more satisfying. And I grew up listening to radio shows and music, so I used my imagination far more than when TV shows came along."},{"Title":"Water Monsters (Unsolved Mysteries)","review":"The book was great!

Sachse is a master bladesmith/blacksmith in the highest sense. Not only can this man make beautiful and varied styles of damascus steel, most makers seem to stick to one or two particular styles, but he has meticulously researched the history of both the patterns and how they were made. In many cases he has remade the historical styles himself. Also the book is filled with rare and colorfull pictures of damascus, and wootz steel objects. This includes everything from, what you would expect to find, like knives, guns, and swords to more unusual objects like armour and jewelry. The information in this book is helpfull whether or not you are an expert or a novice. Get ahold of this book if you can - It'll change your life!"},{"Title":"The Clean Water Act 20 Years Later","review":"CWA literature is overwhelming, dense, and confusing. This book is a refreshing change - the progress under the Clean Water Act is presented in a very simple manner. Good for basic technical and legal understanding of the subject. EPA and state-level programs and reports are brilliantly critiqued (no wonder, the book is produced by NRDC!). The text is supported by excellent research of legislative history of the CWA.Only Chapter 2 (out of 8 chapters) is a little dull. In Chapter 2, the figures could have been more illustrative, and the discussion of numbers could have been livelier. Overall, the most interesting and understandable book on CWA."},{"Title":"The Clean Water Act 20 Years Later","review":"The Clean Water Act is a landmark of environmental regulation in the United States. Though it is hardly perfect legislation, because of the CWA the Great Lakes, the Potomac River, and many other famous waters are no longer cesspools.The authors of this book know this but prefer to give us a \\"Chicken Little\\" story in which disaster is always coming around the corner. No law, apparently, is good enough to meet the dangers of water pollution that we face.For example, they present evidence that water pollution from industrial (point) sources has declined while the major increases in pollution come from nonpoint agricultural sources. This seems to me a straightforward argument for being satisfied with the provisions of the CWA while bemoaning the fact that it did not address agricultural sources. Instead, the authors would rather be disappointed in all of the results.There's a lot of good information in this book, as my example suggests, but the author's attitude toward the successes of the CWA make the tone of the book frustrating. The raw materials of a balanced assessment can be found in this book but the editorialization insists that the sky is falling."},{"Title":"The ministry of the word (Studies in ministry and worship)","review":"I have not read anything better on preaching in terms of what goes into trusting in the power of the Spirit vrs. ingenuity."},{"Title":"Je Ne Suis Pas Sortie De Ma Nuit (Folio) (French Edition)","review":"Alzheimer's is a cruel disease for those who have it and even more cruel for those who know the sufferers. Everyone who knows someone who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's should read this book to prepare themselves for the experiences ahead. You'll need all of your strength and preparation!The title is the last sentence the author's mother wrote before she died. One of the frightening aspects of the disease is watching the person discover the loss of faculties, as they occur. Soon, you are not recognized, and the person can lose all of their possessions. They may have to be tied down to keep them from wandering off and getting hurt. Physical deterioration is often not far behind.The book is a series of notes the author made on occasions when she was with her mother from January 1984 through April 1986, and includes a few days after her mother's death.You will find a lot of pain here. The author finds that she is revolted by the affliction, at how her mother changes, by the memories she has of things she should not have done, and in her own reactions to her mother's changes. As a result, there's a lot of guilt and remorse to deal with. By reading how Ms. Ernaux went through this, you may have an easier time forgiving yourself if you are subject to the same feelings in the future.The book is filled with pretty direct stories and references to things that can be upsetting: People exposing themselves, getting sores in private places, human excretion, unpleasant smells and sights, and rough language. You will hear, see, feel, smell, and taste what the author experienced. In this area, I found the translation a little strange at times. Several crude words would be used, then a reference would be made that seemed to be employing a euphemism for a more direct word. Is the translation more or less crude than the author intended? I don't know.The reason I did not give the book five stars is that it could really use a little more perspective than just the notes. Apparently, the experience was so painful that the author decided to let the notes speak for themselves. Perhaps in the future, Ms. Ernaux will choose to revisit this work, and put it into more context.Is this work contrived by a fine writer, or is it simple human drama? I'm inclined to think it is the latter. Few would portray themselves and their mother this way simply to entertain readers. I could feel the searing pain as I read the entries. I think you will, too."},{"Title":"The Allegheny River: Watershed of the Nation (A Keystone Book)","review":"I recently purchased this work in a used book store and, if you have that opportunity, I strongly suggest you do the same. The pictures are done in four color format, follow the text, and are of high quality. I would have preferred more detailed maps, but this is a small quibble.The text is endlessly entertaining and extremely well written for persons of all ages. The format is a bit unusual in that the tour of the river begins at its end in Pittsburgh, where it meets the Monongahela to form the Ohio River, and runs upstream to the source. Many interviews with persons familiar with the river and its history form a great deal of the text, and the factual development is very well done.The Allegheny is the northeasternmost tributary of the Mississippi River system and the only one that drains part of New York State. It was the pathway for many who moved west of the Appalachians. Many persons who traversed this route when they were young explored the West as they grew older, and theis connection is excellently demonstrated in a fascinating, seamless manner. The Allegheny almost drowned George Washington as a young man, became one of our first industrially-used rivers, and is now in the process of being restored as a clean stream. In short, the Allegheny, almost more than any other river, reflects the history of the development of our country.I believe you will find this coffee-table sized book a fascinating, useful addition to your library, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Allegheny River: Watershed of the Nation (A Keystone Book)","review":"M Sanja is a field Outdoor editor-Nature &amp; Fishing PSU Press just published Art Parker's &quot;Monongahela River&quot; It is unique to compare both watersheds, since these rivers converge to form the Ohio River."},{"Title":"The Allegheny River: Watershed of the Nation (A Keystone Book)","review":"i thought your book was terrible. it was so bad and had no information at all. it was so bad, i almost threw up. dont ever read this book, cause it sucks."},{"Title":"Candytown (Sticker Stories)","review":"My four year old daughters love to play with this book.

And no guns. It provides the little stressors that Disney doesn't, so that the effect is genuine - real anxiety, and real relief at the point of resolution.

This is not just about China, this is about the human condition. Someone with an imagination should have worked on the title and given it a bit more excitement. I almost skipped reading the book because the title seemed so dry.I read this book twice and will probably read it, again. The author's presentation is simply masterful. Step by step, he recreates the setting and background for the book's creation and utilization. In fact, he walks the reader through about 2000 years of 'uses' that people found for the book. According to Cullen, this classic was probably a gift to a Chinese emperor and then dumped in a back room for 200 years. It was only when political circumstances changed and an 'old' book might be valuable that it was 'rediscovered' and rendered useful.For anyone interested in the practice of ancient astronomy, Cullen goes into great detail on the tools and practice of Chinese astronomers from about 3000 BC to the arrival of Jesuits in 1600. For anyone interested in Chinese political history, Cullen explores imperial Chinese history in a way that simply makes one want to read much, much more. For anyone interested in ancient Chinese record keeping, Cullen offers practical advice on what to make of the 'documents' we moderns discover.I hope they make this a paperback so that it can get wider circulation. What is commonly called 'the history of math' is often embarrassingly western (ethno-centric). This book offers a means of correcting that unfortunate state of affairs."},{"Title":"Astronomy and Mathematics in Ancient China: The 'Zhou Bi Suan Jing' (Needham Research Institute Studies)","review":"An eminently readable, entertaining, and fascinating look at a premier text of ancient Chinese science.

This poor earl, when all he needs is some peace and some time with his precious pig, &quot;the empress of blandings&quot;, is always dragged into family affairs, which are of no interest to him by his ever dominant &quot;sisters&quot;. This book has one of the best stories about Blandings Castle, &quot;Crime wave at Blandings&quot;. You will split your sides laughing with this story. All the other stories are equally good and &quot;The Efficient Baxter&quot;, secretary to Lord Emsworth makes a comeback here. This book is an absolute must to any Wodehouse fan and absolutely the most recommended book for readers new to Wodehouse. This was the first book I read of Wodehouse and I read it 20 times before putting it aside. A book definitely worth collecting."},{"Title":"LORD EMSWORTH And Others.","review":"This collection of short stories begins with one about the title character, Lord Emsworth, a constantly befuddled old man who only wants to putter away his time if only his energetic relatives would let him. Though not my favorite Emsworth saga, this one is excellently written and endlessly hilarious. All the other stories are similarly well done, but they all begin to meld together somehow. I would have preferred more variety in the approach. If you read this (and you should!), I recommend one story at a time, and allow some good space between stories. Use an episode perhaps as a palate cleanser between each of those long lugubrious novels you insist on reading. That way you'll get the max out of the book, and every story will remain distinctive."},{"Title":"LORD EMSWORTH And Others.","review":"This is an exceptional collection of Wodehouse's short stories. He hits a grand slam immediately with \\"Crime Wave at Blandings,\\" which tells the hilarious tale of what happens when a senior citizen with a tendency toward nostalgia gets his hands on an air gun for the first time since his childhood. Wodehouse is the greatest when it comes to light-hearted stories that poke gentle fun at our human foibles. If you want to laugh out loud, buy this book!"},{"Title":"LORD EMSWORTH And Others.","review":"Mix yourself a hot Scotch and lemon and dive in. Emsworth is at his finest when confronted with the horrific possibility that he may be forced to take The Efficient Baxter on as his secretary again. Also there is a Mulliner tale, 3 golf stories as related by the the Oldest Member and 3 Ukridge stories. Stanley Featherstonehaugh Ukridge has as usual tried everything to raise a few quid -- including renting his aunt's house while she is away in Hollywood, training Battling Billson the prize-fighter and pawning his aunt's diamond brooch. The funniest is the Emsworth story, while the others seem more like unfinished sketches that Master Plum (Wodehouse) was toying with."},{"Title":"LORD EMSWORTH And Others.","review":"I love P.G. Wodehouse. His detail, humour, so much fun! One of my favorite readers of books on tape is Nigel Lambert, he is a master voice actor. Although I am fond of Jonathan Cecil's readings of Jeeves and Wooster, Nigel Lambert manages to hold his own here. Lambert brings out the droll wit of Wodehouse, and makes me feel like I am right there with Lord Emsworth popping old Baxter with the air rifle. What a great romp!"},{"Title":"LORD EMSWORTH And Others.","review":"A great collection of stories that do not involve my perennial favorites Bertie and Jeeves.

It combines the sentimental with the absurd, uniting them in language which is a luxury to read. Although tecnically speaking it is comic literature, it expresses a touching view of getting older which many others have tried and failed to achieve with supposed serious writing. I strongly recomend this story as a perfect introduction to the wonderful world of Wodehouse and especially the unique brilliance of the Blandings Castle series. Pip! Pip!"},{"Title":"LORD EMSWORTH And Others.","review":"While the \\"Wooster and Jeeves\\" collections are perhaps best known, some of the most enjoyable and funny Wodehouse \\"tales of woe and mirth\\" are contained in this collection.

The poor soul is overwhelmed by most everything in life and yearns only to be left alone so he can garden and nurture his pride and joy; The Empress of Blandings, a quite large pig. Sadly, he is tormented by his sisters to behave in a manner befitting his title, a task of which he is incapable. You will find yourself empathizing and sympathizing with this poor soul as he is thrust into situations he simply has no ability to control or cope with.

Great thing he wrote so many wonderful books like this one for use to read, and read over and over.Lord Emsworth is a wonder, and you'll enjoy every minute with him!I just read another great but less known Wodehouse book that I really loved, and laughed out loud on each page, as the wit and satire was powerful, called the Indiscretions of Archie - its well recommended too!Indiscretions Of Archie: A British Humor Classic"},{"Title":"Balance Point","review":"Balance Point -- Searching for a Spiritual Missing LinkJoseph Jenkins, 2000\\"We are spiritually balanced when we live in harmony with the greater whole - with each other, with all of life, and with the Earth mother.\\" EduardoIt was particularly significant to me that I received and was immediately drawn to Balance Point just two weeks after 9/11. As stunned as I was by 9/11 and as emotionally devastating as it was and is, I was also immensely grateful that over 6000 souls would agree to leave in such horrific circumstances in order to force our awareness that there is no them, there is only us. I found a similar theme in the Balance Point story regarding the environment. Jenkins teaches us that there is \\"no away\\" when we throw out the trash, there is only somewhere else. Joe Jenkins, along with his immediate family, the inimitable Aunt Lucy, Eduardo the Shaman, and the Circle of Sisters lead us on a spiritual quest from Halifax to Montana to Peru. Think James Redfield. Think page turner that you simply cannot put down. Jenkins adventure teaches us as much about our true spiritual connection to the ecology of our Earth Mother as Redfield taught us about our spiritual energy dynamics.In an interview with Joseph Jenkins after reading this engaging book, I asked him just how much of the story was fiction and how much was fact. His response was \\"The story is a blending of fact and fiction.... I have been asked by many readers exactly which is the fact and which is the fiction...all of the ecological issues are factual.\\" Jenkins leaves it to us to decide whether we care about the details of the story or the state of the ecology of the earth. If we are willing to step outside ourselves, even for just a moment, the adventure becomes significant only because of the passion and point with which the story is told. Jenkins shows us how quickly our eco-systems are dying out and does not allow us to walk away unchanged.Balance Point is one of the most well written and beautifully produced self-published books I have had the pleasure of reviewing. The cover is lusciously printed with the gorgeous colors of Mother Earth - deep brown, mellow gold, royal purple. The typeface is easy to read and the chapter graphics are terrific. Joseph Jenkins has compiled an impressive list of resources and short blurbs on how you can begin to change your behavior today and how you can continue to make a difference in all your tomorrows. Jenkins reminds us that in finishing the story we should consider the next step the beginning of our individual mission of symbiotic living. This is a great pass along book! Read it and pass along the good news!*****************************************************************Kathryn Lanier lives in Colorado with her nine year old twins.

This is one such book.One of the hardest things we, as human beings, have to do is to face the man in the mirror. Too many of us have been successfully avoiding it for years. Balance Point makes continuing to do so very difficult. While some may be surprised at the theories presented, one would also be hard pressed to deny the facts behind them.The message this book sends to the world is not new - we're in trouble and running out of time - but rarely have I seen someone hit the mark so precisely when it comes to characterizing and illustrating the responsibility of the human race for our present dilemmas. The only thing sadder than the fact that we are like a cancer killing it's host [the earth] is that continuing to ignore our mirrors will be our ultimate demise.Balance Point is a fascinating, eye-opening, educating RED FLAG that should be required reading in junior and high school curriculums world-wide."},{"Title":"Balance Point","review":"Balance Point is a fantastic read! An eye opening book with adventure and of ecological importance. I for one would recomend it to all high schools as a must read with a strong discussion following. The publication opens the mind, drawing the reader to desire to go further."},{"Title":"Balance Point","review":"A semi-documentary mystery, voyage of self-discovery, and social critique, Balance Point contends that materialist civilization is a runaway train, and that we have little time left for throwing on the brakes. As it happens, I completely agree, which makes it difficult to review the book objectively.Indeed, I found the story a bit transparent at first. I felt I knew what Jenkins was driving at, and I figured I knew where he was going with it. Before long, though, I was fully absorbed in what is, if nothing else, a great yarn, and eager to get to the Big Secret behind the title.If for no other reason than this, the book works-but it's a multi-faceted work, and for me it worked on all of its many levels. Shades of Carlos Castenada scarcely gave me cause for pause.The central message is simple and profound, both an answer and a challenge. Where the book leaves off, the reader must embark on a journey of their own. This reader was heartened and inspired."},{"Title":"Balance Point","review":"I just finished this book, it was a difficult book to put down. Once you start reading you just need to know where Joe's aunt is leading him to. From meeting some women and doing a sweat lodge to his travels to Peru to meet with a &quot;witch doctor&quot;, and along the way the reader learns a valuable lesson for our time and a need to start conserving our resources, through out our daily lives. A wonderful book that I will recommend to all my friends.Well done Joe."},{"Title":"Balance Point","review":"Ever speculate the future? This book is certain to color and frame your preview. The title fits the content as much as the story line; where science and spirituality meet on equal ground. Bound to contain some of your favorite reading, the author has amply spun spirituality, science, and culture into a living work. A &quot;must-read&quot; for the fiction and non-fiction reader alike.I found this to be one of those books &quot;you just can't put down&quot;. It's seemingly retrousse' chapters are full of twists, turns, and zestful characters, including the author himself. And the anecdotes are easily believable. It is adventurous and intuitive in likeness to James Redfields' Celestine series, yet with a more personal and pointed message. Both educational and entertaining, its' many punch lines may be as disturbing as they are enlightening.Jenkins has done his homework, literally. Providing not only sound research, there is evidence that he gives credence and practice toward what he writes. He leaves the reader with a feeling of here and now, and compels self-examination. Fortunately, as with all of Jenkins' publications, he provides a wealth of follow-up ideas and information; very tasteful and helpful pointers as to &quot;where to go from here&quot;.Easily &quot;Two thumbs up!&quot;"},{"Title":"Balance Point","review":"Once in a while, a book comes along at just the right time. This is how Balance Point affected me. I had long felt a conflict between the material and the spiritual realities. I'd continuously oscillate between the two, all-or-nothing style. Joseph Jenkins' new book showed me that my conflict was both misplaced and unnecessary. A better approach is to find one's &quot;balance point.&quot; Better written than The Celestine Prophecy, the message here is at least as important. Jenkins takes his readers on an entertaining worldwide voyage of personal discovery ... and tells us how to save the planet while we're at it. Fun to read with exotic (but convincing) settings and characters, this excellent first novel is inspiring at the same time. Oh, and for anyone who still needs to know the difference between religion and spirituality, several passages in Chapter 24 define the differences with lucidity."},{"Title":"Balance Point","review":"After reading Balance Point, I find myself torn between stating &quot;One Hell of a story!&quot; and &quot;One Hell of a warning!&quot; This is a truly spell-binding adventure tale with an incredibly important message. Usually, I find such books to be lacking in either entertainment value or in proper research. That is not the case with Balance Point. Joe's characters are as real as my next-door neighbor, and his premise is quite plausible. All considered, I find Balance Point to be the best book I've read this year. I hope Joe will crank out another book soon."},{"Title":"Balance Point","review":"Joseph Jenkin's book is absolutely wonderful! As an environmental educator for over 10 years, reading this book was like a breath of fresh air. The book is written with such creative style that the reader's interest is captured on the very first page. The book is very entertaining, as well as extremely informative. It is perhaps the best environmental book I have ever read. This book allows the reader to be a part of an adventure that has crucial importance for everyone and everything living on this planet. As a Christian, I have struggled for years with the priorities of organized religion. At least from my experiences, the church seems to all but ignore our responsibility of being stewards of God's creation. However, this book challenges the reader to a different way of thinking. For the first time, I am aware of the difference between religion and spirituality. As pointed out in the book, a person can be extremely religious, yet spiritually lost. The &quot;balance point&quot; refers to a balanced awarenesss. It happens when we &quot;realize we're actually a real part of a greater Being and we adjust our consciousness to accomodate a more humble position in the web of life&quot;. This book explains in a very clear way the importance of the web of life. The reader is challenged to look beyond ourselves and to realize how everything we do affects everything else. I feel that this book has a very motivational effect on the reader. The publication of this book comes at a much needed time, when political leaders and our society as a whole are in complete denial of the peril of our environment. Reading this book can be a life-changing event. I hope it will be read by many people, who will then pass it on to others. With Christmas just around the corner, I know what everyone on my list is receiving from me!"},{"Title":"Balance Point","review":"The award-winning author of The Humanure Handbook and The Slate Roof Bible, Joseph Jenkins, has another provocative and well-written book to grab (and hold) your attention: Balance Point, Searching for a Spiritual LinkIn this novelized book of truths, protagonist Joe Jenkins is sent on an incredible mission by his deceased Great Aunt Lucy's baffling will...an eye-opener of a voyage toward the understanding of an imminent disaster of global proportions. Joe's journey is initiated at a wicca ceremony in a sweat lodge where he is pointed to his first destination, Newfoundland.\\"We're robbing the earth's resources, particularly the non-renewable ones\\", Joe learned at a meeting with Sir (Professor) Gaulton of St. Johns College. \\"...we've become so blinded by our robbing frenzy mentality, a behavior that we've learned to take completely for granted, that we've lost touch with the natural balance of the earth\\".The quest to learn how to evolve the human psyche takes Joe (and his wife) on a reluctant itinerary to many remote places in both North and South America including the jungles of the Amazon. The message Joe learned is about the balance between careless selfishness in the use of natural resources, and our interaction and interdependence with each other and all of the natural world...a message of survival as well as one of spiritual awakening. As Great Aunt Lucy put it, \\"The forces of the Ego and Eco have become locked in combat\\".Balance Point is a timely page-turner that speaks to the most important and immediate problem we face...saving our planet and ourselves. Author and seeker Joseph Jenkins has given us a book that demands thought...and isn't that the definition of a great book? This reviewer thinks so!"},{"Title":"Balance Point","review":"This book was such a surprise. It is a marvelous story with a huge message. I seldom reread any book. This one, because it is so important and well written, I have reread and it is one of those that I keep in my library. Right from the start you are in the story and you can't put it down till you finish. It should be required reading for everyone, but particularly for our young adults and for politicians."},{"Title":"Balance Point","review":"Excellent job explaining the concepts we need to know to move onward and upward (or simply survive as a species).

The book is about a mystery of sorts given to Joseph from his aunt in her will when she passed away.From the beginning, Jenkins did a good job of letting us see him and his personality. The storyline and mystery was very grabbing and intriguing. I was always wanting to see what was behind the next clue.The book does have an environmental message. I avoid books that push an agenda or political cause, and Jenkins stays away from that. Any environmental point is backed up with scientific facts and personal experiences.I whole heartedly recommend this book for anyone who likes a good read or enjoys learning about the environment."},{"Title":"Balance Point","review":"I found the storyline to be a pretty good page-turner. And the author's viewpoint (working guy) is one I don't encounter very often in books.Aside from the storyline, there were interesting discussions of science, politics, and spiritual topics.This book was given to me as a gift. At first I was a little turned off when I saw the word \\"spiritual\\" in the sub-title. But this book presents dogma-free earth/universe spirituality - personal connection with The Great Mystery. I'm glad I read it instead of shelving it. Now I'm thinking of others I can give a copy to, spreading the gift."},{"Title":"Balance Point","review":"I love this book...I've actually read it twice so far, and will read it again. I learn more from it each time I open it up. Joe presents the story in a very readable format, but every step of the way he is opening the reader's eyes up to the destruction of nature by our present-day lifestyle. The whole \\"balance point\\" concept is beautiful, a premise to live by. This should be required reading in every high school class. There should be a copy of this book in every household."},{"Title":"Balance Point","review":"This book reads like an adventure mystery novel, yet it is the reportedly true story of the author Joseph Jenkins' quest to fulfill his late aunt Lucy's research project to discover why the human race has become complacent about the impending ecological doom from it's parasitic \\"robbing frenzy\\" of Earth's resources and to find his own \\"balance point\\".At first, the adventure of discovery seems like a \\"wild goose chase\\" taking Jenkins and his wife \\"Annie\\" around the country meeting scientists, witches, scholars and eventually down to the rainforest home of a South American shaman by the name of \\"Eduardo\\" who opens up new vistas of deep ecological awareness for them and the pieces of this mystery start to come together.Will humanity wake up in time to realize it's destructive bad habits and set a new course towards good stewardship of Earth? Jenkins does not know, but realizes that he can't just sit back and take it as it comes- he fine tunes his life to be as ecologically correct as he can to reduce his environmental footprint for healthy, happy, ecologically responsible living.Well written and engrossing, Balance Point is a thought provoking discourse on personal awareness and environmental consciousness. The book finishes with an ADDENDUM full of resources, contacts, and ideas for \\"symbiotic\\" (ecologically balanced) living on Earth. HIGHLY RECOMMENED FOR ALL BACKGROUNDS AND AGES!"},{"Title":"Balance Point","review":"I stumbled over this book title while referencing slate roofing techniques, and finding out that Joseph had written this book along with ones about slate and manure. What a spectrum of work! After reading Balance Point, I can't wait to read his other books. He has easily and convincingly brought the complex issue of ecological degredation and the possible collapse of human existence to the average middle class American reader or student. You don't have to have a college degree to understand this very important and timely issue, as presented here. this is a personal book. The closer we approach the tipping point of no return to a balanced and sustainable economy and society, the louder and more forceful the resistance of those who are promoting the plunder of America and the rest of this planet, and those blind ignorant lemming-like followers who are clueless and careless about their own futures. This book is a fine tale that involves mystery, learning, love, ecology, economics, spirituality, religion, roofing, good eating and beer. I could not ask for more. Buy this book. I guarantee you will enjoy it. It will boost your spirits, and point you in a great direction.

(Anthropocentrism is the erroneous believe that humans are the center of the universe.)The book also finishes with the very real issue of consumer responsibility for the impacts of every purchase.

I think this book is factually incorrect, but it fails to give first time travelers to CR the flavor of the country and the tools to build a satisfying and comfortable vacation. This book was written by long time North American residents of CR and functions more as a reference book for other english speaking residents of CR than as a tool for organizing a 2 week vacation.I must say that I do NOT consider CR a &quot;must see&quot; country. It does not have a distinctive architecture, history, culture (literature, arts, folk crafts, etc). Its capital city, San Jose, is squalid and dangerous. Its smaller towns (I visited Guanacasta) are reached by narrow, hot, crowded, dusty and unpaved road. Locals are poor and drink beer as a pasttime.Nevertheless I've seen many SUV's fording rivers with surf boards and other play things. Although its not apparent to the novice, CR is (by most accounts) an ecologists/biologists/geologists playground.To really enjoy CR the vacationer needs to know why they are visiting the country and make specific plans to meet their goals. Do not rely on serendipitious discovery to fill the core of your vacation. If you a surfer, birder, diver, sailor, hiker etc than plan to make a bee line for those resorts/ persons who can help you enjoy these activities. Appreciating local culture should be a secondary activity. (Go for a 2 tank dive in the morning and have lunch in town with locals in the PM).The book should be organized to help the vacationer reach places safely, confortably and mostly important, satisfy their interests.As it is, the book is a reference for the ex-patriot, long term exchange student and backpacker, not the typical traveler."},{"Title":"Sat Verbal Workbook (Sat Verbal Workbook, 6th ed)","review":"I studied this book for about 1 month and is giving me a clear understanding of the verbal part in the SAT.

The west is trying to form closer ties with Tito, while the Soviets, with whom Tito has already broken, are acting to prevent this. Many Italian partisans fought on the Yugoslav front during World War II and have remained there, supported by friends and family in Bologna as they engage in the smuggling of oil into Trieste, another plot line. As members of the local communist party, these Bolognese supporters are trying to control the future of \\"Italian\\" Trieste. In Naples, Salvatore Lucania (\\"Lucky Luciano\\"), recently deported from the US, works at controlling the world's drug trade.As these plots develop simultaneously, the reader must keep track of dozens of characters and their activities, since the various plots do not overlap until the end. Cary Grant, Alfred Hitchcock, David Niven, Grace Kelly, and the James Bond novels all play parts in Grant's story. The Naples story, with Luciano, involves all the on-going crimes of this don and his henchmen--drugs, race-fixing, gambling, prostitution. The Bologna plot is far more domestic, with a young man searching for his father, who is in Trieste, and a love story involving a married woman who takes care of her mentally ill brother. The McCarthy hearings, Emperor Bao Dai from Vietnam, Nikita Krushchev, and even Fidel Castro are also included here.Wu Ming, the \\"author,\\" is actually a collective of five Italian writers (four of whom, known as \\"Luther Blissett,\\" wrote the Reformation novel, Q). While this device allows for enormous creativity and energy, it also promotes the accumulation of vast amounts of period detail, and the introduction of more characters than I can recall in one novel in a long time. As each author writes his own section, the novel suffers from a looseness in overall construction and the lack of a single vision. The grand finale, while worthy of James Bond, is actually anticlimactic as the various plots finally come together more than five hundred fully-packed pages after they began.Filled with local color--bars, casinos, races, card games, and political movements--the novel is often lively and fun to read. The points of view and location change every few pages, however, and the reader often feels as if s/he is reading four separate novels simultaneously. Humor and irony pervade the novel, including sections written from the point of view of a TV set, a scheme to make a Madonna weep, and a satiric view of an FBI agent. There's a lot of everything in this novel! One wishes its authors had exerted more control by pruning it of its excess. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"54","review":"When a novel balances itself on the head of a pin, and when the complexities of that novel come to weigh as much as the pyramids, there is always the chance that the whole thing will come tumbling down to destroy the piece and end the suspension of belief. The longer the novel, the more intricate the complications, the greater the sense that now, just now, or at the very latest the next page, the plot will unravel and the machinations behind it all will be revealed. Broken cogs in a clock, the hand stuffed inside the ventriloquist's dummy. 54 has an even greater challenge, in that it was written by the Wu Ming collective, a group of five Italian authors working in tandem. Put it all together, and it could be a recipe for disaster. Happily, barring a few unfortunate mistakes, 54 is an entertaining, complicated novel that succeeds more than it fails.54 draws on a complicated set of character interactions, the beginning of which seem to be ridiculously separate. We have Cary Grant bored with his acting lifestyle, propositioned by the British secret service, the MI6, to travel to Yugoslavia to meet Tito about a movie. We have Pierre, a young Italian man who loves to dance and misses his father. We have a sentient television known, with the clever but strained name of McGuffin. We have drug runners, Italian mobsters, Russian spies, American FBI agents. The list threatens to become exhaustive during the January of 1954 - for the book's name comes from the year in which it is set, 1954, a year when Joseph McCarthy was causing widespread panic and distrust amongst Hollywood entertainers and intellectuals in general through his communist scares - but the novelists keep everything flowing. 54 is written within a tight, most forward chronological timescale, moving from the 1st of January, 1954 to mid-November.The plot is split into two halves. The first involves Cary Grant's mission to Yugoslavia, and the bizarre interactions that take place between himself and the other characters. Roughly half of this is devoted to Cary Grant's efforts in training his replacement and traveling to Yugoslavia, and half to Pierre. Scattered throughout are smaller chapters which don't seem to have much to do with anything, though they help tie events together during the first climax of the novel at the end of the first part, and form the primary thrust of the second part. Grant is as suave and charismatic as one would hope, adding a nice touch to that is Pierre's fondness for the actor. The second half plays up the role of the McGuffin television set as it is shuffled from character to character, its importance a mystery until suddenly everything comes to an explosive conclusion. Pierre remains an integral part of the novel in the second half, though Grant falls to the sidelines.For all that the novel seems focused on Grant and Yugoslavia, there is a strong emphasis placed on the state of Italy post World War II. The characters shown are tired, worn, waiting. After the war, the world changed in ways that have made them uncomfortable. America is encroaching upon their lifestyles, and the promises of the revolution never really came into fruition. The Aurora Bar's - Pierre's bar - struggle to purchase a television (which is, of course, the McGuffin) for the upcoming soccer world cup is pathetic and sad, yet entertaining and hopeful. There is a sense that the old Italy is seconds away from leaving, with consumerism, commercialism, capitalism and all those others isms of which America is so fond of exporting, right around the corner. The dire spectre of heroin also raises its head, though this functions more as a monetary device than any real social criticism.Wu Ming means 'anonymous' in Chinese, a name the Wu Ming collective have taken because they wish to dissociate their true names from the celebrity and fame that comes with authorship. Who they are is not important, what they are writing is, or so the saying goes. It is interesting to note that none of the anonymous Wu Ming members are actually unknown - a cursory internet search will reveal who they are - which strikes me as a more honest way of attaining the anonymity required. The chapters of the novel are often written in such a different style that it becomes almost a game to pick which member of the collective is responsible for which piece of text, and I would suggest in future that a group of five translator tackle the novel, one for each author. As it stands now, Shaun Whiteside performs an admirable job in the translation, through the proliferation of words like 'crap' and 'guys' in the narrative text come across as somewhat jarring. Setting aside the translation, there is also a sensation that the ending runs on for fifty pages longer than it should have, for no real reason other than to tie up loose ends that could have easily been left alone to the reader.54 suffers from, at times, writing that is too clever. Cary Grant, running around as a spy, picks up a James Bond novel and laughs and points out (several times) how it could never be a movie. Marlon Brando is commended on his acting ability - remember that Brando had recently come to the stage in the 1950s - yet a worry remains that he will end up fat and useless. The McGuffin television set is actually called a McGuffin - a name for a plot device which moves everything along while not really being a part of the story - which stretches everything a little too far for this reviewer's liking. However, these too-clever aspects aside, the novel is entertaining and worthwhile. The Wu Ming collective sometimes throw a little too much into the mix - why Russian spies? - but these daubs fail to take away from the grander picture, which is meticulously plotted, carefully orchestrated and wonderfully revealed. There is a lot happening in this novel, with countless references and endless cameos of real people and situations, but a firm thread of plot does shine through. Readers who put up with the scattered beginning will find themselves immersed within an enjoyable, though complicated, read."},{"Title":"54","review":"I was in Italy in 2002, when 54 was published in its original edition, and enjoyed the novel in Italian (and Neapolitan vernacular, and Bolognese 1950's youth slang, as well as plenty of other dialects and lingos). Back then, I thought it was an untranslatable book, full of local idioms as it was. How can you translate the colorful way people talk @ the Bar Aurora? When I heard that the Spanish translation wasn't very good and the authors had demanded a thorough revision (which was done for the paperback), I thought I'd been right. However I recently re-read 54 in English and I think Mr Shaun Whiteside has done a very good job. Of course many nuances get missed, but the language is pretty lively. I agree with the authors (see ProductWiki below) that this is a very European (and very Italian, I add) narrative, and some details and references may remain cryptic to American readers, and maybe this is the reason why the latter report this overwhelming feeling of \\"looseness\\" and \\"out-of-controlness\\" (I know this word doesn't exist), never the less I believe that the book can be enjoyed also by Americans, as it deals with universal themes (identity crises, celebrities as role models, yearning for social justice etc.)Now I'm waiting for their next novel Manitouana, which is set during the American Revolution. At least this what they say on their website."},{"Title":"54","review":"An intricate storyline set mostly in Italy in the year 1954, in the midst of the cold war. Most characters are associated with the communists to one degree or another. With a mixture of true people and historical events, it gives the readers a strong sense of time and places. Friendship, love, crime, adventure, ideology, international intrigue, and politics all intertwined into a complex web.The first hundred pages are not easy read as various plotlines start almost disjointedly. Too many characters to follow without any hint of who are the important ones.

I love reading these interesting stories and being taken back in time to hear about these long ago scandals that rocked hollywood. It was really well written!"},{"Title":"Dishing Hollywood: The Real Scoop on Tinseltown's Most Notorious Scandals","review":"Well, author Jacobson has certainly come up with a clever pun to format her book with. The text dishes some of Hollywood's biggest celebrity scandals, while linking each to a favorite recipe of the celebrity. So, if you want a taste of racketeer Bugsy Siegel's last meal, whip up some of that grilled trout recipe at the back of his little chapter. As a former tinsel town waitress, I guess the author should know.However, if you're looking for anything more than a brief whiff of the scandal part, better look elsewhere, cause only the basic story is dished up here, short-order style. Well, that's not quite the whole serving since Jacobson does garnish many accounts with her own spicy speculations. But whether they're based on anything more grounded is doubtful, judging, that is, from the routine bibliography. Anyhow, the author has definitely found a new way to serve up old dishes, but little more.(In passing-- looks like Dick Powell, Bette Davis, and Joan Blondell are gracing the cover. But, is that also David Wayne in the crew cut? Just thought I'd ask.)"},{"Title":"Dishing Hollywood: The Real Scoop on Tinseltown's Most Notorious Scandals","review":"This book is very well-written by a talented author who included some only moderately famous stars who are largely forgotten now. Many stars' stories are concisely told in 2-4 pages along with the novel approach of including a favorite recipe of the celebrity. Very entertaining, not meant as a definitive source for any star, excellent summaries with some surprising tidbits. The author pulls no punches and wished she would write another book. Much better source of 1950s Hollywood than The Bad and the Beautiful (James Bacon's book, Hollywood is a four Letter Town, another great book of Hollywood from the mid-40s to mid-70s)."},{"Title":"Dishing Hollywood: The Real Scoop on Tinseltown's Most Notorious Scandals","review":"I had so much fun reading this book! The stories are great and Miss Jacobson clears up a lot of false Hollywood rumors. The best part about this book is that it includes chapters about some forgotten stars like Carole Landis, Dorothy Kilgallen, and Lupe Velez.

The vanity of the 'dish' (aka scandal/tragedy/hard luck story) only enhances the general readability of this book. This is a novel approach that makes an already interesting product even more appealing. I kept thinking that the author did a terrific job with the material she was presenting.Aside from the kidding around, this book is really rather fair and factual. The author knows her stuff and relies on knowledgeable sources to substantiate or refute claims made in the book.My only criticism of this book is that I wish it had been longer and had covered some other stories that I find interesting and want to know more about. Hopefully there will be a follow-up to this book which will do that.Anyway, this is a very good read and worth the $ and time spent reading it."},{"Title":"Dishing Hollywood: The Real Scoop on Tinseltown's Most Notorious Scandals","review":"I love Laurie Jacobson's books and this one is the best yet!!!

Refreshing, in that the author grabs the reader from the word Go with earthy text, no punches pulled. I like that. It's a rare book that has those combined qualities! Ms. Jacobson clearly posesses the much-appreciated ability to not bog down the reader with overly-\\"politically-correct\\", \\"same old\\"-type stories that I've seen in some other authors' books. Dishing Hollywood cut to the chase and allowed me to see a much deeper and very colorful view of some of the celebrities and their scandles! The recipes are a new twist!

Fading away, hoping he will have his old beautiful face back up in heaven before La Liz had to save him in the wreck that smashed it.Or wish a peaceful rest for the sweet Sharon Tate and her poor unborn baby over some cheese enchiladas.

Laurie Jacobson really knows her stuff and serves up heaping portions of scandal and intrigue of Hollywood's most notorious stars. I have read all of the author's books and Dishing Hollywood is Jacobson at her best. Jacobson brilliantly spins tale after sordid tale, &quot;sprinkles&quot; famous film quotes throughout each chapter and &quot;tops&quot; off with a recipe of the star's favorite dish (or, in some cases, their last meal!).

I felt a lot of old myths and rumors were repeated here. The meal/food connected to a scandal idea was original although somewhat goulish.

This book is a rehash of scandals that have been written about before. There was nothing new in this book except some recipes inserted at the end of chapters.My biggest complaint was the very poor editing of the Kindle edition. There were numerous, glaring typographical errors. The editing was overlooked; was someone in a hurry to get the Kindle version posted on Amazon? In 2 instances, a sentence was written twice at the beginning of a paragraph. In another example, a Q was inserted instead of a 9. Small and capital letters were interspersed into titles.

The details of their history, culture, and religion are fascinating. However, those just beginning to dabble in this area of study should be warned, it may be more than they are looking for right now. For example, the alliances and warfare between the Cheyenne and other tribes would be very difficult to follow if you didn't already know a little bit about who they were and how their migratory paths crossed,etc. Once you've done a fair amount of study on the subject, however, your library will not be complete without it."},{"Title":"The Fighting Cheyennes","review":"I have not had a chance to read the book yet, but I believe I will learn a great deal about the Cheyenne when I do."},{"Title":"Everything You Wanted to Know about Sedona in a Nutshell","review":"Tom Dongo does it again! He's in touch with every facet of one of America's most alluring places, the red rock country of northern Arizona. In tune with the pulse of the legends, myths and mysteries, you'll find out what lies off the beaten trail, up in the cliffs and perhaps even beneath the ground. This town with a history that spans from pioneers to UFO's is a place of healing and self-discovery, and Dongo conveys it in all of his books better than any other author who's fallen under the spell of this enchanting place of beauty."},{"Title":"Everything You Wanted to Know about Sedona in a Nutshell","review":"Although this book provides some information about Sedona, it simply touches upon each of the subjects without giving you anything tangible to use while you're there. Each of the sections leaves you craving more, which leaves me thinking that I would have been better of buying the more expensive, yet more informative and comprehensive books that are on Amazon."},{"Title":"Everything You Wanted to Know about Sedona in a Nutshell","review":"Because I'm an open-minded gal with a voracious curiosity for learning, I've read a couple books over the years that dealt with the supposed energy vortices in and around the city of Sedona, Arizona. The first book I found was back in college and it was by hypnotherapy guru Dick Sutphen, who, as I recall, cited Sedona as the one-time location of a colony of refugees from the continent (not an island but a whole continent, mind you) of Atlantis. And then there was this more recent work by author Tom Dongo. (Betcha that name got him beaten up a few times on the playground, huh?)Here's my opinion: if people want to feel good about a pilgrimage to this New Age Mecca, then great, it's no more or less invalid than those of other faiths making a trip to a site germane to their convictions. But I feel that if there was something special going on around those red rocks, then it would seem to reason that the year-round residents of Sedona might manifest more abundantly than anyone else the powers the rocks bestow. Applying Tom Dongo's claims about the rock formations of Sedona being sites of earthly energy, then we should see the plants and trees of Sedona growing especially well, the children who spent their formative years there breaking all records in educational achievement, in their health and in their well-being. We should see fewer cases of depression, fewer stress-related ills, fewer colds, atypical longevity. If psychic powers are enhanced by being near the red rocks, then wouldn't we probably find more lottery winners coming from the environs of Sedona than anywhere else on earth? Just my two-cents worth on Sedona: a place of great physical beauty, where many a visitor and her money have parted company amid the Wicca-themed shops."},{"Title":"Before the Invid Storm (Robotech)","review":"The most marginal of all the Robotech books (and apparently the last), there's very little going on in this book, especially when judged in the time-frame of the overall Robotech story-line. If you wondered how Dana Sterling and company got off Earth between the fall of the Masters (end of book 9, or episode 60 of the TV show) and the arrival of the Invid, this book will tell you. Of course, if you read the books in numerical order, you'll have already gotten that info from Lisa Hunter's log entry at the end of &quot;Rubicon&quot;, or from Dana's activities in &quot;End of the Circle&quot;.It's to the authors' credit that they were able to keep finding stories in the undocumented time-lapses of the Robotech series and keep the whole universe consistent, but with &quot;Before the Invid Storm&quot;, the diminishing returns may not be enough for some readers to bother with."},{"Title":"Before the Invid Storm (Robotech)","review":"The Robotech Masters have been defeated, but nobody can really say Earth won either.

This is because, unlike many writers in this field, Arthur Findlay was truly a man of stature, respected in his community and writer of an incredible 2200 page world history (The Curse of Ignorance) which, although quickly disappearing from view after its initial great success due to its brutally honest account of the effects of religion on world history, or the results of misunderstanding our true place in the universe, has in recent years started being quoted in various bibliographies, which was how I was led onto this book. Although having been impressed at his first seances, he remained sceptical inside, convinced of trickery, but the checks and experiments he carried out after the medium Mr John Sloane (an otherwise quite normal warehouse packer in his 60s at that time, a man with no more interest in esoterica than your average working-class Englishman of the 1920s) agreed to being studied convinced him, and frankly myself. I'd recommend this to anyone of rational mind interested in this topic, I bought a few newer books on Amazon that if I'd read first would have deepened my previous scepticism. The writing style is a little old, but the contents are incredible. Like Findlay, I could never put 100% faith in a medium who was communicating with his or her own voice. But most of his seance transcripts were spoken from various positions in the room, while Findlay was holding the hands of the medium, who was practically unconscious and in a trance state. This was repeated at many locations of Findlay's choice with no advance notice. What was most convincing were 2 seances he attended a few days after his mother's death where he conversed with her, the first one being in Scotland. This itself makes fascinating reading, but more so is the start of the one in London, where his mother comes back again through a completely different medium unknown to the Scottish one, picks up where they left off before, and refers to the previous conversation! Now I would not accept such tales from anyone, but the credibility of the man seems beyond doubt. He proved something as evidentially as Galileo did with his gravitational effects demonstration with balls of different weights, and it's incredible that such phenonema have never been taken seriously by so many.

It is a very honest investigation of life after death, starting out from a position of scepticism. There are many detailed discussions of the next dimension and how things operate over there, e.g. the ability to create by mind alone and to travel at lightning speed, the fact that people over there still have bodies of matter although it is a type of matter oscillating at much higher vibrations than ours on the physical earth, the spectrum of light (showing how narrow our perception is as we can only discern a small band between ultraviolet and infrared) and yet further and higher dimensions after that. Countless examples are given of people receiving information from loved ones who had passed on. I do not doubt the author's integrity and I think this book is something of a classic, judging by the many reprints since its first publication date. It is impossible to tell whether this stuff is objectively true, but this book is certainly a gripping read.

It will change your mind with very convincing, specific and detailed evidence.After a careful study of it, you will understand why the evidence presented is not explainable in terms of cold reading, tricks, coincidence, fraud, or super-ESP (or any combination of them). Alternative explanations are simply not reasonable in this case.

I couldn't put it down, and got three hours or less sleep for three nights in a row. I foisted it on my mom with warnings not to begin it on a weeknight, she got hooked on a Tuesday and went downhill too. We talked for days about how tightly written it was, how clean, spare, descriptive, full of foreshadowing, and painful to any woman who knows what it is to be centally disappointed by a man. Yet the book never whines, it never pushes itself sobbing on your shoulder. It sits in dignity with sadness.Very quietly and methodically tragic, in the Irish way that says you do not whine about tragedy, you do not make fuss of it, you just simply pray a bit and go on. What makes the book so very valuable and unusual is that it applies the Irish knack for storytelling and forthright 'un-tragic' tragedy to women's lives and women's stories. It is both an Irish book full of water and woodsmoke, and a women's book in all its painful honesty and revelatory grace.Please read."},{"Title":"The Country Girls Trilogy and Epilogue","review":"If you happen to think that being Irish would be just the nicest cosiest thing in the world, and you want to keep thinking that, then don't read this book. If you want to read a genuine unputdownable masterpiece, though, and laugh and cry your way from the first page to the last, then go for it.I might also add, though, that if you're a husband, like me, it's only fair to warn you that this book will search your conscience pretty thoroughly."},{"Title":"The Country Girls Trilogy and Epilogue","review":"i heard an interview with edna o'brien on npr's FRESH AIR and was impressed with her style. i read the trilogy because of the interview, not because of the Ireland component. this book is poignant, funny, sincere, a page-turner, and honest. i keep looking at the copyright date and not believing that it was written years ago. this book is a definite breath of fresh air!"},{"Title":"The Country Girls Trilogy and Epilogue","review":"For the longest time, I didn't get Edna O'Brien. Her writing was so highly praised, but I couldn't figure out what all the fuss was about. Her characters were all so repressed and their interactions so brittle that I found her stories difficult to get into and generally boring. But as I embarked on my ongoing Irish tear, I was determined to try again. This time I had no trouble becoming interested in Kate and her childhood friend Baba or their lives in rural Ireland, in convent school and in Dublin. Ireland in the 1950s was extremely repressed, which is one reason this book was banned. But its portrait of a place and a people seems spot on. I think of this novel as a fictional twin of John McGahern's memoir All Will Be Will, which covers the same time period from a man's perspective. For Irish-Americans raised on sentimental songs and movies about the old sod, O'Brien's fiction is an important corrective. She is an excellent writer of spare but evocative prose. The Country Girls is the first novel of a trilogy, and I look forward to completing the set."},{"Title":"The Country Girls Trilogy and Epilogue","review":"I have read some exerpts from Edna O'Brien's writings and was looking forward to reading this trilogy. I found all three books too wordy and the main characters too annoying to enjoy my reading, perhaps because I didn't relate to Ireland of the 1960s. The fact that the books were considered scandalous and were banned when published intrigued me but they just didn't hold my interest as anything more than period writing curiosity."},{"Title":"The Country Girls Trilogy and Epilogue","review":"I was enthralled by this book and read it faster than most books I have read. There were nights I stayed up really late just to find out what happened next."},{"Title":"The Country Girls Trilogy and Epilogue","review":"The Country Girls Trilogy is an interesting take on Irish sociology. As a woman of Irish descent, I could relate to the stultifying atmosphere of the Catholic church which both controls by guilt and conformity. The nuns at the convent exemplify this, as well as the visit from Caithleen's father and priest after her escape to her lover's home.The second and third parts of the trilogy continue with Caithleen's eventual marriage and motherhood in the same vein. She never really becomes capable of decision making. Her melancholy persona becomes even more so, and by the end of the three books, her story becomes rather tedious. It ends, \\"not with a cry, but a whimper.\\"All in all, I liked the first book of the trilogy the best; each book following became more and more laborious to read. At the end I had invested so much time that I had to finish it."},{"Title":"The Country Girls Trilogy and Epilogue","review":"An interesting read. It is a look at the harm done to young women at the hands of those who want to control rather than guide them."},{"Title":"The Country Girls Trilogy and Epilogue","review":"The trilogy of three self contained novels features two Irish country girls, Baba (Bridget) and Caithleen (Kate) from teenage schooldays through marriages and beyond. the novel is a very well rounded view of vulnerable women and their relationships with men, as fathers, boyfriends, priests etc and husbands. We see a satirical picture through Baba's eyes. Baba is a survivor, and great fun, but rash and impulsive. Through Kate we see beautiful, lyrical prose about the Irish countryside, and we see the pathos of her mother's marriage, where mother and daughter are both victims of domestic violence, and have no love or respect, as a result, for Kate's drunken father. The third book, Girls in Their Married Bliss, was banned for many years in Ireland because of its realistic picture of relationships of husbands and wives, in Ireland, and elswehere, no doubt. I like the trilogy because of Baba's acid sparkling wit, which often packs a lot of truth, complemented by Kate's beautiful dreamy descriptions, and expression of her feelings, and a lingering sense of pathos. She could be seen as weak character, or as some one damaged by an irresponsible, drunken, abusive father. Baba can seem flippant and heartless,but she always rallys to help Kate, where needed, and they get into both amusing and pathetic situations. Baba's sharp wit balances Kate's dreamy lyricism. I think women and men should read the trilogy, and pause, maybe with nostalgia, to think about relationships generally, with friends, lovers, partners and family, and gain a deeper insight.The Country Girls Trilogy and Epilogue (Plume)"},{"Title":"The Country Girls Trilogy and Epilogue","review":"Words and contents of this book bring back many memories of life in Ireland.

I count myself firmly among the latter, but acknowledge that this volume differs significantly from earlier entries in the series. What some readers apparently view as an absence of skill and spirit on O'Brian's part, I find instead to be the product of a subtle and masterful command of the literary art. Death is a central theme, Death is a chief character of &quot;The Hundred Days&quot;, and I find it not surprising at all that O'Brian has elected to use a style in keeping with that particular focus. I have seen numerous comments from dissatisfied readers decrying O'Brian's &quot;failure&quot; to deal with the deaths of major characters at length. With all due respect, I think that view misses the whole point of what and how O'Brian has written. The cheapest, most false piece of writing produced by any hack would have lavished sorrow upon these deaths; shedding shallow tears would have been the easy thing to do. The abruptness of these deaths, even the absence of healing mourning, heightens the pain and the sense of loss we feel. O'Brian has not written a book to make us &quot;feel good&quot;. Instead he has painted for us a portrait of emotional constraint, the hues of the world washed over with the grey of an unexpressed grief. Only at rare moments are we pernitted to see the black gulf beneath Stephen's determined insistence to continue on after Diana's death. He is a man who is hiding even -- or, especially -- from himself the depth of his loss, while we see that grief has dulled his usual acuity. O'Brian has not tried to &quot;entertain&quot; us here, and those seeking light diversion would do better to look elsewhere. No, &quot;The Hundred Days&quot; is not an easy book, but it evidences an undiminished literary skill. I believe this novel to be O'Brian's finest writing in several years. Long after finishing it, &quot;The Hundred Days&quot; haunts me."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"Some critics have referred to the Aubrey/Maturin books as one long novel united not only by their historical setting but also by the central plot element of the Aubrey/Maturin friendship. Having read these fine books over a period of several years, I decided to evaluate their cumulative integrity by reading them consecutively in order of publication over a period of a few weeks. This turned out to be a rewarding enterprise. For readers unfamiliar with these books, they describe the experiences of a Royal Navy officer and his close friend and traveling companion, a naval surgeon. The experiences cover a broad swath of the Napoleonic Wars and virtually the whole globe.Rereading all the books confirmed that O'Brian is a superb writer and that his ability to evoke the past is outstanding. O'Brian has numerous gifts as a writer. He is the master of the long, careful description, and the short, telling episode. His ability to construct ingenious but creditable plots is first-rate, probably because he based much of the action of his books on actual events. For example, some of the episodes of Jack Aubrey's career are based on the life of the famous frigate captain, Lord Cochrane. O'Brian excels also in his depiction of characters. His ability to develop psychologically creditable characters through a combination of dialogue, comments by other characters, and description is tremendous. O'Brien's interest in psychology went well beyond normal character development, some books contain excellent case studies of anxiety, depression, and mania.Reading O'Brien gives vivid view of the early 19th century. The historian Bernard Bailyn, writing of colonial America, stated once that the 18th century world was not only pre-industrial but also pre-humanitarian (paraphrase). This is true as well for the early 19th century depicted by O'Brien. The casual and invariable presence of violence, brutality, and death is a theme running through all the books. The constant threats to life are the product not only of natural forces beyond human control, particularly the weather and disease, but also of relative human indifference to suffering. There is nothing particularly romantic about the world O'Brien describes but it also a certain grim grandeur. O'Brien also shows the somewhat transitional nature of the early 19th century. The British Navy and its vessals were the apogee of what could be achieved by pre-industrial technology. This is true both of the technology itself and the social organization needed to produce and use the massive sailing vessals. Aubrey's navy is an organization reflecting its society; an order based on deference, rigid hierarchy, primitive notions of honor, favoritism, and very, very corrupt. At the same time, it was one of the largest and most effective bureaucracies in human history to that time. The nature of service exacted great penalities for failure in a particularly environment, and great success was rewarded greatly. In some ways, it was a ruthless meritocracy whose structure and success anticipates the great expansion of government power and capacity seen in the rest of the 19th century.O'Brian is also the great writer about male friendship. There are important female characters in these books but since most of the action takes place at sea, male characters predominate. The friendship between Aubrey and Maturin is the central armature of the books and is a brilliant creation. The position of women in these books is ambiguous. There are sympathetic characters, notably Aubrey's long suffering wife. Other women figures, notably Maturin's wife, leave a less positive impression. On board ship, women tend to have a disruptive, even malign influence.How did O'Brian manage to sustain his achievement over 20 books? Beyond his technical abilities as a writer and the instrinsic interest of the subject, O'Brien made a series of very intelligent choices. He has not one but two major protagonists. The contrasting but equally interesting figures of Aubrey and Maturin allowed O'Brien to a particularly rich opportunity to expose different facets of character development and to vary plots carefully. This is quite difficult and I'm not aware of any other writer who has been able to accomplish such sustained development of two major protagonists for such a prolonged period. O'Brian's use of his historical setting is very creative. The scenes and events in the books literally span the whole globe as Aubrey and Maturin encounter numerous cultures and societies. The naval setting allowed him also to introduce numerous new and interesting characters. O'Brian was able to make his stories attractive to many audiences. Several of these stories can be enjoyed as psychological novels, as adventure stories, as suspense novels, and even one as a legal thriller. O'Brian was also a very funny writer, successful at both broad, low humor, and sophisticated wit. Finally, O'Brian made efforts to link some of the books together. While a number are complete in themselves, others form components of extended, multi-book narratives. Desolation Island, Fortune of War, and The Surgeon's Mate are one such grouping. Treason's Harbor, The Far Side of the World, and The Reverse of the Medal are another. The Letter of Marque and the ensuing 4 books, centered around a circumnavigation, are another.Though the average quality of the books is remarkably high, some are better than others. I suspect that different readers will have different favorites. I personally prefer some of the books with greater psychological elements. The first book, Master and Commander, is one of my favorites. The last 2 or 3, while good, are not as strong as earlier books. I suspect O'Brian's stream of invention was beginning to diminish. All can be read profitably as stand alone works though there is definitely something to be gained by reading in consecutive order."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"I confess I peeked at the reviews of this book before settling in to read it and was a bit worried by the rather harsh remarks by a number of readers. Shouldn't have been. This is a novel of real power. Witty (often darkly humorous), intelligent and beautifully written it is completely at a piece with rest of the series. Still puzzled by those reviewers who claim this was ghosted and a bit troubled by one writer who complained Villier's death was a problem because she was such a strong female character. Well yes, but this isn't Oprah nor is this about consciousness raising as we know it at the end of the twentieth century. Rather, this work is a fantistically imagined glimpse into the very early nineteenth century-a time quite different from our own. I had heard of O'Brian first in the mid-1970's but couldn't rally much interest. Napoleonic Wars? Royal Navy? So? Then, for some reason or another, I picked up 'Master and Commander' over the New Year's Holiday. Three months later, I had read each of the nineteen novels in sequence. One of the great reading experiences of my life. 'The Hundred Days' is an altogether tougher work than those which preceed it. Aubrey and Maturin have been at this for a great long while. The war with Napoleon drags on and on. Fortunes are made and lost. Friends and family die. There indeed is very little of the joy to be found in the earlier books. Choices available to a person were far fewer in number in the early 1800's. Societal constraints, class strictures, duty-any number of factors conspired to grind a person down. By the end of 'The Hundred Days' Aubrey seems tired and spiritless. And why not? Good friends killed. Endless political intrigue. He faces huge responsibilities as the 'Lord of the Manor' and member of Parliament as well those in his naval career. The death of his best friend's wife and the death of his long time coxswain Bonden are terribly painful. Remember, Aubrey has been at sea since the age of twelve. It is not a warm and fuzzy place to live. It is a painful and isolated existence. No,'The Hundred Days' gets it really, really right. It has been a wonderful trip for Aubrey and Maturin and all the rest, but the cost has been huge."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"I, as countless others, noticed within pages that this book did not have the heft, color, culture or beauty of the past entries. It felt like the OUTLINE of a possible book, with none of the nuances and flourishes filled in. A pale watercolor against the previous Rembrandts. And let's lose a vital character like Diana OFFSTAGE, as if she were a minor character, a footnote when really she balanced and made whole the Maturin we came to know. His tempestuous love affair made an otherwise dour, eccentric character come into his own; a character arc that paid off handsomely. Aubrey and the good doctor go through the motions as if ghosts of voyages past. They play music, engage in intrigue, visit (in a glancing manner) foreign exotic ports, and eat their toasted cheese -- but it's a vessel that's altogether too unseaworthy for the journey. Either the prolific author's powers have waned at this late stage, or he was trying to beat the deadline (he's 85 after all) and finish the saga with a round number; 20 (Blue Mizzen's out now). That's a cruel assessment, but his fault entirely for writing so beautifully of a time past that we came to expect that level of excellence, or more to the point, crave and need it like a good serving of plum duff and spotted dog. May his high standards unfurl and send us sailing at 12 knots and above on the next peregrination. For now, I'll take a bolus and bit of laudanum to ease the pain and curl up in my hammock while awaiting another installment."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"I love great historical fiction and O'Brian's Napoleonic era novels, although not as timely as more recently set novels like the Civil War's &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; or WWII's &quot;The Triumph and the Glory&quot;, capture the era in magnificent fashion. But no matter what type of fiction you like you should read the Aubrey/Maturin novels, they are wonderful, finely-crafted examples of the story-telling art.

Things that must be taken into consideration include the stage in development of both the characters and the story, as well as, of course, the immense build-up of expectations that met &quot;Hundred Days&quot; on its release from the yard. One must remember that POB's series is not comprised of massive line-of-battle ships, but consists of a sizable squadron of fast, nimble frigates of the sort before Americans got hold of the idea. Given that, in the proper context, POB has given us another lovely, though less lively, installment. Read it not becasue it's the best O'Brian has given us, but because it's much better than most of what those other than O'Brian have given us."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"Let me preface all that follows; this review is for those of us who have travelled with Jack and Stephen for 18 novels. If you are thinking of starting with &quot;The Hundred Days&quot; don't. Start at the beginning. It is worth it. The quality of writing and crafting of a story is constantly excellent through out the series.I finished &quot;The Yellow Admirable&quot; with a sad heart, fearing there would be no more stories, hoping there would be two more books. My joy in learning of them was delightful. I downloaded the first chapter and read it hungerly, until I learnt of Dianna's death and my heart folded in two for a character I had adored and in some ways related to as a woman. I found myself concerned for Stephen, Sophie and Jack. I went out late that night and hunted down the book.I couldn't figure out why Dianna was killed, couldn't see the sense in it. But maybe it has something to do with how the sudden death of a beloved one is incomprehensible, like the author experienced with that of Mrs Mary O'Brian. I think &quot;The Hundred Days&quot; is Mr O'Brian's grieving novel. It is, as all his work, crafted in a way that raises your expectation of writing, it looks at life, as always,in a delicate and strong manner. But it read to me that my favorite author was in pain and was writing to heal and get the book over and done with.As a hungry reader I wanted a long and detailed book, like &quot;The Post Captain&quot;, because I wanted to stay in the world created by this author. I found myself wanting to know how Sophie and the family were, I wanted to see Jack reach the official status of Admiral, of any rank and colour other than yellow. I wanted to see more of the relationship of Jack and Stephen. But this wasn't to be. I didn't understand the significance of the last few lines of the novel and am still pondering them.All this as a reader disappoints me. All this as someone who wants my favorite author to be happy saddens me as it shows me his sense of loss. Others are commenting on the lack of detail about Stephen's grieving. Well I think we have been honoured to witness how Mr O'Brian is dealing with his. We have all experienced loss for ourselves and can understand the understatement of Stephen's.I confess to being shocked by Bonden's departure. I re-read the passage several times to be sure I had understood it, there wasn't any elaboration which stood in stark contrast to the death's of other more minor charactors. I don't think it has to do with feelings of the era and attitude to death. Jack has cried in public for the loss of life during battle for men he has sailed with for only one voyage. Bonden has been with him for 20 years. Maybe this will be further explored in the next novel, I hope at least.I also hope the next novel is lengthy and detailed, we hear from Sophie and all at home, we see more of the friendship that has taught us about human nature, the dry wit of Stephen and the silly puns of Jack.&quot;The Hundred Days&quot; is an outstanding book to lose yourself in. It is also one that leaves the devoted reader hungering for more. It is also a book of contrast; in some regards I found it to be his finest, in others I found it wanting. Either way, I'm thankful it was written and I loved reading it. I just wish it hadn't finished so quickly."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"This nineteenth installment in the series is something of a return to the blood-and-thunder days of the earlier volumes, as Jack Aubrey, pausing at Madeira with his family before setting off on a putative hydrographic expedition to Chile (as always when Dr. Maturin is involved, there's a good deal more here than meets the eye), is told of Bonaparte's escape from Elba -- and is ordered to hoist his commodore's pennant once more, to take command of all the available ships in the area, and to repair at once to Gibralter to seal up the Med and protect Allied shipping. Then he's off to the Adriatic to disable the French ship-building activities in the region and to cut off the shipment of an astonishing amount of gold from North Africa to the Balkan Moslems to encourage them to intercede on the Emperor's behalf against the Russians and Austrians. Okay, there's a lot of politics here -- but it's a side of the last days of the Napoleonic Empire most of us know little if anything about, and there's plenty of skullduggery on Stephen Maturin's part as well as naval action against an Algerine galley. And not to forget the Adventure of the Unicorn's Horn and the Hand of Glory, which is one of the falling-down funniest episodes O'Brian has ever produced. On the other hand, there are two quite shocking deaths, too, one early in the book and one late, . . . but that, as they say, is life. An excellent entry in the saga."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"THE HUNDRED DAYS is the 20th in O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series. New readers are likely to be disappointed, as character development in earlier novels is essential to appreciating the main characters. Fans of the series are likely to be moderately disappointed. Very little new character development takes place, and oddly, there is little reference to earlier characters and events. The introduction of a new character (a female) surgeon's assistant, presents much potential, which is not realized. The plot thesis also has much potential which never materializes. As always, O'Brian brilliantly describes the day-to-day life of sailors. THE HUNDRED DAYS is even richer in such details that the earlier novels in the series. Unfortunately, in THE HUNDRED DAYS the ancient \\"HMS Surprise\\" journeys nowhere, and our beloved characters are too old and set in their ways to be interesting."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"I cannot agree that this book is flat, lifeless, and lacking in the drama of the previous Aubrey-Maturin novels. In The Hundred Days, O'Brian creates and explores a different topography of the heart and spirit. The deaths of Diana and Barrett Bonden are shocking, because there's no preparation, but as some other reviewers have said, there's never adequate preparation in life for such losses. No amount of verbal handwringing can make it right, in life and in this novel, and O'Brian does not indulge in even the attempt to cater to the wish for it. How would any of us attempt to depict Maturin, that reserved, disciplined man so profoundly in love, fresh on the news of Diana's death? The term &quot;unimaginable grief&quot; could suggest that O'Brian quite properly does not describe what can't be delineated, except in the heart of each reader who confronts his or her own losses in reading about Maturin's. As for Bonden, his death no doubt reverberates through the lives of Aubrey, Sophie, Maturin, and all his recent and former shipmates--again, O'Brian demands that we do a little imaginative work once we've caught our breath, just as Aubrey and the others will have to catch theirs after the shock. It takes time to absorb a loss, time O'Brian has not created for his other characters with respect to the death of Bonden, at least in this novel. And that's a final point. Patrick O'Brian is an older man, and each novel is a gift, likely to him, certainly to his readers. Blithe suggestions regarding what he ought to do in the next novel, or in future novels in the series, take no account of the facts of his life. I'd love another dozen books in this series, which has given me some of the best company I've enjoyed in the past few years. But I'd be immensely grateful to have just one more.

Indeed, the deaths of two integral characters is handled in such a way as to maximize the reader's response to their deaths.

Diane was a truly great character, a strong woman and also believable. I read the books for the naval action, the relationship between Stephen and Jack, and Diane. At the very least, we might have witnessed her death, experienced her final moments, had a chance to grieve for her. And I want to know how Sophie felt about losing her mother!

Maturin is still an innocent landlubber. The battle scenes and the sailing descriptions are as good as ever, but reruns.

Indeed, O'Brian seems to have abandoned their shore-side existences."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"Those who already read Patrick O'Brian do not need any encouragement to pick up The Hundred Days. The glory of O'Brian's language, the human-ness of characters who grow and change, the variety of exotic locales, the perfect exactness of details from two-hundred years ago -- all this has kept alive the interest of a growing legion of fans through nineteen extraordinary volumes. For these lucky devotees, it's enough to note that this volume will remind them of The Ionian Mission and the other Mediterranean-based episodes. It is livelier than recent installments, more surprising, has more of the smell of gunpowder, and yet delves deeper than ever into the psyches of the two central characters. It is as if O'Brian has recaptured his spark as he nears the end of his epic.But really, a review should convince new readers to test the waters. So, you should consider buying this book (or the first in the series, Master and Commander, also available from Amazon,) if...you admire a perfect command of the English language -- O'Brian is literature, not genre;you ever enjoyed even one historical novel (the New York Times called this series &quot;the best historical novels ever written&quot;);you generally like to learn something as you read, in the way of interesting arcana (in this book, such things as narwhale horns and Hands of Glory);you think it at least possible for people to behave heroically, and morally;and, most of all, if you have ever stood on the deck of any kind of ship, anywhere, and pondered, even for a second, the incredible courage of the &quot;iron men&quot; who could brave vast oceans in wooden sailing ships.O'Brian appeals to a certain kind of person, I find: one who wishes to find courage in oneself, and enjoys reading of it in others. The Aubrey/Maturin novels are, in fact, great literature.End of review.So. After twelve years, my B.A. in English Literature finally pays off."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"As a reader with an ear for authenticity and literary quality, one who has been immersed for the last month or so in the Aubrey/Maturin world of intricately interlocking personalities, predilections and performances, I opened this nineteenth volume with warm anticipation. By the second page, I was disgusted and angry; by the end of the second chapter, I was convinced that its &quot;author&quot; had not written it.Not only is Mr. O'Brian's voice totally absent in this book, but even its faintest echoes are distorted, inaccurate, even mocking. It is as if O'Brian had turned a sketchy working outline over to a semi-literate, callow young assistant and said, &quot;Here, you patch this one together for me.&quot;The publishers, if they had had any respect at all for the literary dignity of their author or the discernment of their readers, would never have foisted this atrocity off on an unsuspecting public. Not even Jack Aubrey would have deemed the considerable &quot;prize&quot; worth the dishonor of its capture."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"&quot;Disappointment&quot; is far too inadequate to describe my feelings after reading the first third of this book. There is none of the flash and sparkle that made O'Brian's prose so unique, none of the deep foreshadowing that haunts the reader's subconscious, none of the splendid sketches of personality of the main or supporting players which allowed nuances to ripen into full-blown behaviors. It is stilted, clumsy, boring, and, worst of all, a parody of the true O'Brian style.I could not bear to finish it; I have re-read the entire series at least three times, yet if I were to accept &quot;The Hundred Days&quot; as the ultimate chapter, I might never pick up any of the other volumes again. Do not read this book! Let Jack and Steven set off on their oceanographic expedition aboard the Surprise; let yourself forever speculate about the rest of their lives. Do not let them sail into this mess!"},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"About a third of the way through I thought, &quot;O'Brian has died and they're having someone ghost-write this!&quot; Stephen and Jack are mere caricatures. The bright, witty dialogue is missing and I just felt that some one had 'played me the flat' and that person was an awful scrub."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"Patrick O'Brian shows he has not lost his gifts for writing an elegant maritime thriller in this second to last installment of the Aubrey-Maturin saga. It's 1815 and Napoleon has escaped from the Italian island of Elba, seizing power once more in Paris. Commodore Aubrey is sent with a small squadron of frigates and corvettes to the Adriatic coast to stop French warships sympathetic to Napoleon's cause from joining the newly recreated Imperial French Navy. After a successful completion of this mission, Aubrey and Maturin find themselves off the coast of North Africa, in search of a Moslem Arab ruler sympathetic to Napoleon and the gold treasure he is sending to Napoleon's forces. Without question, this is one of the most exciting installments in the Aubrey-Maturin saga, replete with unexpected encounters and other suprises in store for the reader, such as reunions with several long-lost friends and the tragic, unexpected loss of one of their followers."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"Unlike Forrester O'Brian has really done his homework.

The version I purchased was narrated by Simon Vance, the least desirable of the O'Brian narrators. Seller blames Amazon."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"No, &quot;The Hundred Days&quot; is not a rousing, blood-and-thunder sea tale. And, no, it is not a &quot;feel good&quot; book. Instead, it is an exceeding well-written examination of grief and loss. Death is the major theme, and Death is a central character, right from the opening pages. A good writer can readily depict sorrow and mourning so that a reader can identify a character's sense of loss, but a great writer such as O'Brian creates that sense of loss in the reader to directly experience the shock and disorientation. Throughout this novel we follow a character who has been crippled by loss, but is unwilling or unable to exhibit his deep grief to those around him or even to reveal it to himself. O'Brien paints a masterly protrait in somber tones, but his chosen style in this book is a challenge to some readers, because he shows the results of grief and numbness without wordy desciption or expansion. Obviously, some readers see that as a weakness. I see it as evidence of O'Brian's skill. I have read &quot;The Hundred Days&quot; twice and am still haunted by it. I would not suggest this book to someone who is not thoroughly familiar with the rest of O'Brien's Aubrey-Maturin novels, but for those who do love the earlier novels and who are willing to open themselves up to the experience created for them in this novel, I most strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"A couple of years later and I stroll in and see such a weird collection of remarks! It seems that people either love this installment or absolutely loathe it. By my rating, you can see that I enjoyed it immensely. I think that O'Brian lived up to his reputation as a sophisticated storyteller. Yes, Diana's death is a mere mention - but the author creates such a deeply painful upset that feels very real - we grieve with Stephen from the shock - and if we are open to it, we appreciate the story even more. And yes, Bonden's demise is equally jarring, but that's life at sea (especially during that time). My one critique of O'Brian - there should have been more death among Aubrey's and Maturin's closest friends and followers - that is, if history were followed more closely. So - to the naysayers I say -\\"you are heard, but you do not speak for everybody.\\" I love this book as I love the entire series."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"The Aubrey-Maturin books are absolutely wonderful, but the Hundred Days isn't. Maybe the author is getting old and lazy. This book has a number of plot developments that start up and then disappear; the timing of events seems implausible; the most important events (such as the death of Maturin's wife) happen outside the narrative and are simply reported as accomplished fact. The timing is difficult: At the end of Yellow Admiral, Aubrey, Maturin, and their families all seem to be in the Azores, where they learn Napoleon has escaped--the Hundred Days have begun. When the book Hundred Days begins, Diana Villiers has had time to go back to England and get herself killed, and a ship has reached Gibraltar to spread this news--surely by now we've used up at least 30 days? But there's still time for Aubrey to dash all over the Med and the Adriatic and to destroy all sorts of enemy ports and shipping--not that much of this occurs in the narrative (again, we read about it later as an accomplished fact. O'Brian's novels have always been better for personalities and relationships than for action, but he leaves out too much in this volume. Meanwhile, the personalities seem a little weak too. For instance, Maturin is reported to be quite distraught over Diana's death, but after a few pages of moping he seems to be over it. Sure, I'll read the next installment, if there is one, but I hope it's better than this one."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"But don't judge this work of O'Brian's by his failure to pull the emotional strings that Forester did with such aplomb. The Hundred Days has less of the breathlessness of some of the other stories--e.g., the chase by the Dutch Waakzaamheid in the South latitudes. Less of the near mysticism of Maturin's climb over the thousand steps to the crater of the orangutans. Less of the nostalgia of the run-in with the Constitution and Aubrey's lock-up in Boston. And certainly less Corelli. But the Hundred Days has its own appeal in the way that these two complicated gentlemen--tired of two-faced French tyranny--deal with an absurd, waning struggle that they would much rather have left far behind. Taken aback by the loss of the rock solid coxswain and one of the grand heroines? Yes. Disappointed in the book as a result? Not at all. I believe that those of us who adore O'Brian's work generally--from Testimonies to the splendid biographies to this--enjoy it despite its lack of a formulaic plot line. The Hundred Days deserves its place with its 18 predecessors, and I look forward to reading them all again. For those who feel that this book is a hurtful parody or waste of paper--I recommend a return to Hornblower. The naval action is just fine and nobody important goes unmourned. I like those books every time I re-encouter them. But it's lighter fare."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"I usually wouldn't bother writing a review of O'Brian's work -- enough people have had great things to say about him. O'Brian is the finest storyteller alive. His books combine a very rare mix of high literary skill and adventure. He has been compared to Forster, Austen and Dickens, accurately and favorably. He can also be compared to Tolkien, Tolstoy and Homer. He is that good. Look at his fans: military history buffs, history buffs, fans of adventure fiction, those who look for great literature -- and those who enjoy a well told story. Some of the negative reviews of his latest book have prompted me to write in response -- I'm sorry you are disappointed. I agree that this may be the weakest book in the series. I agree the deaths of Diana and Bonden are jarring. And I think some of you are missing the point. This is a series. O'Brian doesn't have to tie up everything (including the grieving of his main characters) in this book. And another thing to remember -- he is writing of another time. Some of the most shocking, provocative, and fascinating moments in the books come when O'Brian is speculating about the differences in the different attitudes of this time. Human life, and the end of it, is viewed very differently. Aubrey regrets the death of Bondon, but he has a whole crew to worry about (and consider the irony of Bonden's death -- he's killed by a stray shot just before the war ends -- did O'Brian have to elaborate further). And I would gladly trade a defeated mourning Stephen Maturin for the character O'Brian gave us -- a Maturin who throws himself into action to deal with his grief. And I was terribly saddened by his sudden memory of Diana's blue diamond, his sudden feeling of life's emptiness, and or being told that Diana was buried wearing the Blue Peter. Her death was more startling in that single moment then pages and pages of funery rights would have been. One of O'Brian's greatest skills is knowing what to leave out. I know much of the griping is from disappointed fans -- but please give the man a break -- and give him some credit for taking risks -- even near the end of this series."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"Patrick O'Brian's capacity to carry off nineteen installments in the Aubrey/Maturin series is nothing short of astonishing. There is no faulting O'Brian's ability to craft a richly detailed and captivating tale combined seamlessly with subtle plot twists and turns. The Napoleonic wars and the escape of Napoleon from Elba provide the backdrop to this incredible tale filled with action and political intrigue that completely captives the reader.The personalities of the families, friends, and enemies left ashore by Aubrey and Mautrin permeate their lives at sea. If not considered in this light, the death of Mautrin's wife, Diana, would be a meaningless detail. This is also what allows the reader to become intimate with Aubrey and Mautrin, almost as if they are old friends. O'Brian is never callow or derivative. You should not expect these sea-going tales to be filled with swashbuckling adventure of which the singular point is action.This nineteenth installment takes you across the Mediterranean and the Adriatic, and into combat against the French navy. It also takes you ashore into North Africa to intercept caravans carrying gold. This gold is intended for Muslin mercenaries who are disposed to support Napoleon. This is an outstanding installment to the series and most definitely can stand on its own."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"If you are new to the Aubrey/Maturin series, DO read the books, but start at the beginning. Also, if you are going through the series, DON'T read all the reviews here - they give away too much key information that will spoil your reading.This book was very good for me, but a little jarring, and seemed to have been hastily edited, especially at the start. Reminds me of the Hornblower book where several longtime favorite characters were rather harshly dealt with. Like many others who have read the entire series, I was hoping for a little more &quot;and they lived happily ever after&quot; - I even harbour a secret desire for one more ball at Ashgrove Cottage ala the earlier one at Melbury Lodge, where all the old sea dogs gather around the Admiral and relive old stories and bring us up to date on what happened to them when they were not included in book plots. (Trust me - this actuals does happen among old warriors.) Of course, if you are in the midst of this series, you really don't need much encouragement to read this book - a true member of Captain Aubrey's crew can hardly resist.I you have finished the series, are feeling withdrawal symptoms, and wondering how long it will take Patrick O'Brian to write the next one, perhaps you will let me recommend you go ashore, transfer to Lord Wellington's Peninsular Army, and join the Sharp's Rifle series by Bernard Cornwell - he acknowledges O'Brian as an inspiration, and the Sharps books are very strong, although with more of an action orientation, and somewhat bloodier."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"To those who have followed this series from the first novel, as I have, The Hundred Days is curiously affronting. We have followed Jack and Stephen down the years and learned to love not only the author's erudition and grasp of historical detail, but also the delicate web of human relationships he has contructed with such a deft touch. Now, suddenly, with half a paragraph, he disposes of Diana Maturin, the guiding star of Stephen's life thus far, and with two half sentences passes Barret Bonden, Jack's coxwain since the early days, into glory. This abruptness is all the more shocking as in the recent novels O'Brian had been examining the relationships of his principal characters with greater depth and and reflection. What we have left is the finely crafted and researched plot that is the O'Brian hallmark, with the human touch strangely attenuate. I pray that the final volume we are promised will recapture the magic which another reviewer so well described as &quot;putting a spark into the sawdust of history&quot;"},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"\\"The Hundred Days\\" is the nineteenth of O'Brian's amazing 20-volume nautical series. It's not quite as heavy or complex as some of the others, but it has a wonderful flow. Aubrey and Maturin are back in the Med, back in Gibraltar, and the places where the whole series began. The period is Napoleon's brief renaissance, between Elba and Waterloo, and the ship \\"Surprise\\" runs up the Adriatic to sort out which ships will take Napoleon's side. Then Maturin stops in Algiers, and the book is topped off by a long slow chase of a bullion-filled arab galley. As in the previous installments, Aubrey and Maturin win and lose fortunes and favor at the turn of a page and at the whim of O'Brian's mischevious sense of humor. But the story definitely has a twilight feel, as though the aging author knew he was near the end of his long tale. I loved \\"The Hundred Days\\", but then I love the entire series."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"In reading the reviews and comments of other O'Brian fans, I find myself in agreement with all of them, as there is much to recommend about _The Hundred Days_ and an equal amount to disappoint. The plot of the story relative to earlier novels is more meditative, the action subdued and subtle. The crashing broadsides and clash of steel as boarding parties jump the gunwhales, blood running out of the scuppers is largely absent here - what little action there is at sea is the result of a long pursuit, chasers firing at one another from a distance, what ships are destroyed are burned at port. In fact, much of the action that is such an an attraction in O'Brian's stories takes place after the fact: O'Brian has Maturin and Aubrey as more passive observers of it than active participants. This was both frustrating and disappointing. Similarly, two long-standing characters die (I won't mention names, lest I spoil the story); I have no problem with their passing, but I would have imagined their deaths would have had a greater impact on Aubrey and Maturin, given the strength of the relationships between characters.Yet there is a magnificent subtlely in the storytelling here, a nuance to the characters that I think O'Brian is showing here. The loss of the characters is certainly felt, but it is shown in the manner of the time - mourning in the early 19th century was a very personal affair, all the more so considering the \\"stiff upper lip\\" one associates with the English. As an officer in the Royal Navy, Aubrey is no stranger to the loss of life, nor to the loss of shipmates. Keeping this in mind, the reaction and way in which O'Brian writes is consistent with the attention to historical detail he has always done. Regarding the action - or lack of it - this, too, fits the role and place Aubrey has in the Royal Navy: he is now a flag officer, whose presence in naval actions is largely absent (unless it is a rarer fleet action, which would be historically inappropriate during the 100 Days.)I do wish more attention was given to Maturin's intelligence work ashore, and to the political intrigue and infighting that is the battlefield of officers of Aubrey's rank. Still, O'Brian continues to impress with his series. It is with a heavy heart that I recognize my tour of duty is fast coming to an end."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"This book just can not and should not be compared with the rest of the series.

To a diehard fan of Aubrey and Maturin this novel just doesn't cut it.While we are, as usual, treated to a good deal of the two principal character's thoughts and feelings it is done in solitary isolation. In addition O'Brian falls down in his treatment of many old friends such as Bonden and Diana. As another reviewer says above it is absurd that their characters (who we have learned to know so well from the excellent in depth description in his other novels) are rubbed out in approximately one line each. It is also wholly inconsistent with the prior volumes in the series. How can O'Brian expect us to believe that Jack Aubrey showed no reaction whatsoever to the death of Bonden, his loyal coxswain over whose injuries we see him worrying in earlier books.Essentially O'Brian has lost the fantastic level of analysis of the many intertwined relationships between the characters that made the earlier novels so superb.The story is still exciting and very well written, but to any new readers contemplating dipping into the series DON'T start with this book. Buy the other nineteen, read them four times over (like I have) and then enjoy this as a good book in isolation.I sincerely hope that the last novel returns to the standard we (perhaps unfairly) have come to expect - perhaps O'Brian can dream up some believable way to reincarnate Diana (Bonden was probably too decisively cut out of the picture in a colourless one liner). Maybe, Mr O'Brian, you can use your wonderful skill to rectify this state of affairs.I have no problem with characters being killed off but let's hope that the author brings back his wonderfully sensitive treatment of the ones that remain and their relationships with each other in the 20th book.

The second half is much better and, although not up to the best of previous volumes in this series, approaches The Yellow Admiral, for example, in style and plot.Is this just my imagination? Perhaps. Maybe I got used to the &quot;new&quot; O'Brien by page 100 and was able to get over my initial shock. Still, what is the reason for killing off Diana and Bonden? I can see that a literary purpose might be served by the former (but it is never realised), but Bonden!

Otherwise, all the novels are winners, and the film based on themMaster and Commander - The Far Side of the World (D-VHS)is simply superb.Part of the great charm here is our window into a friendship spanning decades. In the first book, Lucky Jack Aubrey is an unemployed Royal Navy officer who bumps into an Irish physician, Stephen Maturin, at a concert - they both share a love of music. Their \\"friendship of opposites\\" grows through the years during danger-filled journeys across the world's seas and oceans. In the front matter of each novel, there's a diagram of the names of all the sails on a frigate, which considerably aids your reading.

The Great Powers of Europe are massing their armies once more to face the dreaded military genius of the Little Corporal. The French military has divided loyalties, and it is up to Stephen Maturin in his capacity as covert British intelligence officer to exploit those weaknesses. Stephen works the intelligence side of the warfare while Jack masterfully handles his ship and squadron to intercept a shipment of gold from North Africa that could spell doom for the Great Powers.Their mission commences with two bad omens: the shattering of a narwhal's tusk, (which the sailors authoritatively declare to be a wonderfully lucky \\"unicorn's horn\\") and a dog's woofing down one of Stephen's anatomical specimens, (which specimen the sailors declare to be a wonderfully lucky \\"Hand of Glory\\" - the severed and disfigured hand of a murderer). Sailors being the superstitious people they are, these two ominous events cause the crew of the Surprise to anticipate the worst - and indeed a character who's journeyed with Jack Aubrey for 18 novels is killed during the briefest of naval engagements. \\"So it goes.\\"Exuberantly recommended, and \\"there's not a moment to lose\\"."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"Patrick O'Brian's \\"The Hundred Days\\" is the nineteenth book in Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series. The Aubrey-Maturin books are quite simply the best fiction I've ever read. I enjoy them so much that I find it difficult to read any other fiction now.Although there are twenty (completed) Aubrey-Maturin novels, in a sense they are one long, unending story. O'Brian tells the story of an unlikely pair of friends in early 19th century Britain: a hard-charging Royal Navy captain and an Irish physician and naturalist (and British spy). Both are devoted, for different reasons, to the fight against Napoleonic France. Captain Jack Aubrey and Doctor Stephen Maturin are dedicated friends, and the interplay between this unlikely pair is ranges from deep philosophical discussions to intended and unintended humor.But what really makes these novels is Patrick O'Brian's writing style. Through his words, he paints wonderful pictures and creates real characters in brilliant narratives; which is good, because Aubrey and many of his exploits are based on real-life adventures during the Napoleonic Wars.\\"The Hundred Days\\" is set during Napoleon's brief return to power in 1815. Aubrey's squadron is involved in the Mediterranean, and much of the book is devoted to efforts - both diplomatic and military - to prevent a Muslim ally of Napoleon from shipping gold to its allies in the Balkans to be used to prevent the Russian and Prussian armies from joining up.

Cripes, it sets up the next novel. You can see her death coming books ago.I too have a problem with Bonden's death; I guess he felt the character tragic, and it was time to die. I think it was a stupid move. Bonden has as much right as Killick to continue on.I think from some researching that O'Brian WAS ill through much of this book. However, it is still eminently endorsable.The last two chapters I thought are very well done (O'Brian finishes a book better than anyone). And Jacob is a great character."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"Much of what other disappointed O'Brien fans have said about The Hundred Days is certainly true, but I think I noticed something unusual which may be a clue to &quot;what happened&quot;. The first half of the book is exceptionally poor, with almost no use of nautical terms, repetitive expressions (surely there is another word that will do in place of &quot;said&quot;), and lack of historical flavor. The second half is much better and, although not up to the best of previous volumes in this series, approaches The Yellow Admiral, for example, in style and plot.Is this just my imagination? Perhaps. Maybe I got used to the &quot;new&quot; O'Brien by page 100 and was able to get over the shock of the start. And what is the reason for killing off Diana and Bonden? I can see that a literary purpose might be served by the former (but it is never realised), but Bonden! I wonder if there could be something about the author's health (he is no longer young, more's the pity), production schedules, or ? which caused the apparent inconsistency within The Hundred Days."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"I was kind of hesitant about this book judging from some of the blistering reviews I've seen about it. Upon reading it, I was pleasantly surprised. In my opinion, the book is not &quot;shallow&quot; as some have said. I really don't see much difference between this one and the rest. It was just too short. I enjoyed it very much and as usual, with Mr. O'Brian's works, was disappointed when it ended. I would love to see a book about Aubrey as a midshipman.If you like this series, I heartily recommend the &quot;Sharpe's&quot; series by Bernard Cornwall."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"As a true O'Brian fan who devoured the first 18 books in this series, I can tell you #19 was a disappointment. I was bored most of the time and couldn't get involved in the story at all. O'Brian's writing seemed perfunctory at best, and the cavalier way in which he did away with both Diana Villiers and Barrett Bonden shocked me. I'm not giving away any major plot twists here, because there weren't any -- they just died. I'm disappointed in Mr. O'Brian but will read #20, hoping he will return to true form. If not, maybe he should quit while he's still sort of ahead, so those of us who love the series will reread it fondly and treasure it forever without it being tarnished."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"For the devoted series fan, The Hundred Days is like angioplasty. You have to have it done, but it's certainly not enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"I have great respect for Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin series, and this contribution is no exception. As to the early death of Diana in 100 Days, I was struck by a coincidence with the recent death of another, real-life Diana in a similar manner, which raises the question of a tribute on the part of the author. Comments?"},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"We made the mistake of buying this ABRIDGED version of The Hundred Days, not noticing the FINE PRINT. The reader was very good, but the material truncated, choppy, and not \\"up to snuff.\\" If you are a devoted fan of the Aubrey-Maturin stories, hurry up and read, yes, read the book. There's not a moment to lose!"},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"What a waste of time! After having read a number of novels from the series, I was quite excited to see this one. Unfortunately, my excitement was premature. The whole book is shallow and not captivating at all. Sorry that the ultimate novel in a great series had to be like this."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"A most sorry piece of work. Having read the first 18 volumes, this one simply must of been ghost written. No character, minimal plot, no historical detail, no medical details, the putative &quot;ghost&quot; writer was most unsuccessful in capturing O'Brien's style. Or P O'Brien should quit while he is a legend."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"I very much admire Partick O'brien's style and books, and I cannot say that this is even a mediocre book, but it is below his rest, merely for reasons of the plot. It is rather a shock to discover, in the first few pages, that Stephen's beloved Diana has died. At first I was annoyed that we heard about it from a complete stranger, but then I realized that it was really kinder than being with Stephen when he learned of it. I was and am still frusterated with Bonden's curt death, but in the next book there is somewhat of a recompense. As I said, a good book, one worth reading, but not as spectacular as the others in the series."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"If you want to spoil stuff for us, at least give us a heads up you jerk. Giving 4 stars because that's the average (and I have to give something), haven't yet read this, I was trying to read reviews and got mad at this guy."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"Jack and the rest of his squadron must intercept a shipment of gold sent to the Muslim mercenaries from Napoleon in order for them to join him in war. Jack must first sail through the Adriatic ports and sink and destroy any one who plans to join Napoleon.I personally did not like the book. The book moved to slowly, and was about something that I'm not really interested in. However, people who are interested in war stories and sailors would enjoy this book. Someone who is excited by Napoleon might also like the book. With a little more action and a faster pace, this would be a great novel. In the book The Hundred Days by Patrick O'Brian the main character is Jack Aubrey."},{"Title":"The Hundred Days (Master and Commander Series)","review":"I have read all the volumes of Hornblower last year and decided to give O'brien a try. I don't know if all his books are like this but this is a joke compared to Forrester."},{"Title":"Out of the Night: Writings from Death Row","review":"A must-see cover design by Terence Kelleher. This onefeature sets the book in a whole world of its own.I challenge anyone to read the contents, and not cry, and notconsider their outlook changed."},{"Title":"Out of the Night: Writings from Death Row","review":"With a thought-provoking and attractive cover painting by Terence Kelleher, this book isthe latest addition to a growing literature on the lives ofthe 2000 or so men and women awaiting execution in the UnitedStates. Composed almost entirely of accounts written by themen themselves, this makes a harrowing but life-affirming(ironically) read.It may well change the way you think."},{"Title":"The Little Colonel's Christmas Vacation","review":"This book was written in the early 1900's. It is about a young girl and her friends who journey off to boarding school. The exciting part happens when one of the girls (Lloyd or the Little Colonel) falls dangeressly ill. After traveling back home for a well needed vacation the Little Colonel learns that she is on the verge of a mental breakdown and that she is mentally unstable to return to school. She feels discouraged until she remembers a story from school that helped her pull herself together and concentrate on other people's lives instead of just her own. If you are ages 9-12 and like a relaxing and enjoyable story I would recommend &quot;The Little Colonel's Christmas Vacation.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Little Colonel's Christmas Vacation","review":"A cheery story of a group of girls in a morally uplifting boarding school. Tells of a girl who needs to stay home for her health, and learns good lessons on love & friendship."},{"Title":"Nick stellino's glorious italian cooking","review":"I bought this book for my husband before we were married and we dipped into it now and again to experiment with some of the recipes. Every one we tried was a resounding success. We surprised ourselves with how wonderfully these dishes turned out! Many unusual and creative dishes, from antipastos through to desserts. The entrees include wine, dessert and salad/side dish recommendations for easy menu planning. Every recipe has a heartwarming story behind it's history and inclusion in the book as a favorite of Nick's. The only thing the book lacks is photographs of the foods. I almost didn't buy the book because of this, but the stories in the margins and the descriptions of the recipes seduced me. Now, the lack of photos is part of the intrigue of this book--it forces me to focus on the power of the recipe and makes trying the different dishes all the more intriguing because of the mystery behind what the dishes will look like when they're complete. Each one has been a surprise and a delight. Some are a bit labor intensive, but I love the challenge and it's fun to watch the metamorphosis of simple ingredients into art. Particular favorites: the asparagus salad, baked pasta in eggplant and the TORTA RUSTICA! My family thinks I'm a culinary genius anytime I try any of these on them for the holidays. My parents start making special requests! Usually for encore performances. And I haven't seen most of these recipes anywhere else. All are unique (including the desserts which are mostly fruit and/or nut oriented, rather than cakes and pastries as found in most cookbooks.) Great fun! My favorite cookbook to turn to when I want to play in my kitchen."},{"Title":"Nick stellino's glorious italian cooking","review":"This is a great cookbook, not only Italian but some other cuisines as well, e.g. one of my favorites, Cabbage and sausage with apples.
