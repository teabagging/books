Let's start with the following advice for resume writing: \\"You'll need 50-100 copies. Sounds like a lot? Don't cheat yourself. You will have to send your resume with each of your initial applications and any follow up correspondence.\\"This sounds like buying as many lottery tickets as possible only and only to increase your chances to win the big prize. She stresses on huge quantity \\"50-100 copies\\", which from my background as Desktop Publisher I can label as mass mailing. In the brick and mortar world its success ratio is around 1% in case that the marketing/sales pitch is really good.Furthermore you can read: \\"Carefully proofread your resume as if your job depends on its accuracy. A misspelling or typo brands you as careless...\\" Well, while I was reading the book, I found 3 typos, 4 grammar mistakes and 3 serious defects in the typesetting of the book. I really want her to DO what she preaches. Unfortunately she neither cares so much how qualitative is her book nor will be your resume. Cynthia Ossenfort, the author of Cruise Ship Jobs! is the other example of going overboard with:\\" Have a professional photo made and make about 30-50 quality copies.\\"In the category's bestseller Cruise Ship Job in 14 Days the author advices to make one, maximum two resumes, which are targeted to a specific cruise line, position and hiring manager. Also he has written that The Professional Association of Resume Writers does NOT recommend sending any photos.

There are also so many personal stories from people performing all kinds of cruise ship jobs.

If you are interested in the book for its potential to help you for writing a great cover letter and resume you will be disappointed because it contains only few pages with common sense tips. Actually this is typical for all other books.The only exception is \\"Cruise Ship Job in 14 Days\\", which provides complete instructions based on the Professional Association of Resume Writers Standards. However it doesn't contain even one personal story. As you see there is specialization, which I guess is forced from the huge amount of information, which has to cover a book either on the life and work onboard or on writing a competitive application and acing the interview after this.

C.S. Forester, grand master of the naval adventure novel, here writes not a novel, but simply a story, of young America's struggle to gain freedom of the seas against a harsh and cruel enemy that was seizing American ships and enslaving American sailors. The rest of the world had put up with this state of affairs literally for centuries. America, armed with resolve but no money, and virtually no navy, determined to end it.Forester does not gloss over the difficulties and the folly that America committed along the way as it tried to figure out how to end the menace of the Barbary Pirates. We tried to buy them off, but they couldn't be bought off, and these efforts endgendered contempt and even more depredations against American ships and men. American politicians, even the great Jefferson, feared establishing a powerful Navy on the theory that such a Navy might become a threat to the young Republic's liberty by bringing forth tyrants. This quaint theory would cause young America endless problems, both with the war against the pirates, and later in the War of 1812 against Britain.Forester writes in a crisp narrative that completely holds the reader's interest, and he tells a complicated story in a manner that gets his point across without burying the reader in detail. This is a short, sharp book that tells a great story from the early history of America and which holds lessons that are relevant to today's events and problems.As Forester notes, every country at some time or another in its history brings forth an unusually large number of particularly gifted and great men. This was such a time for America, which brought forth Preble and Decatur, naval heros who lived to become legends in their own times, and whose leadership brought honor to the American nation and Navy as it finally crushed the pirates, establishing the doctrine of Freedom of the Seas which even today is a bedrock of American policy."},{"Title":"The Barbary pirates","review":"If you find this classic by Forester, snap it up. Written in a razor-sharp style, The Barbary Pirates recreates America's first formal naval engagement since the Revolutionary War. Stephen Decatur and the core of young naval officers at the heart of this remarkable story are more than American heroes, they are icons of dash and bravery, and intelligence. This book is an excellent introduction to one of the least-known periods of American history, a time when her Navy was young and the Barbary States---Morocco, Tunis, Tripoli and Algiers---terrorized the Mediterranean and Europe."},{"Title":"The Barbary pirates","review":"Between 1785 and 1805, the United States was at the mercy of the Barbary Pirates. The Barbary Pirates, actually fundamentalist Moslems, waged war against those who weren't Moslems. The Barbary States, Morocco, Algiers, and Tripoli, were engaged in a centuries long war with Christendom. They fought all of Christianity and enslaved their captives. When the American frigate USS Philadelphia was on blockade duty off Tripoli in 1804, she tried to capture the Tripolitans but ran aground on the shoals. To prevent her from falling into enemy hands, Steven Decatur, who said &quot;My country right or wrong,&quot; burned the ship with the help of a Neapolitan ship, captured by Decatur and his men, and named the Intrepid. A MUST READ for anybody who loves history."},{"Title":"The Barbary pirates","review":"This is a light, easy to read history of the American war with the pirates of North Africa.The book was originally written in 1953 so it cannot include new information or new historical perspectives.That being said, C S Forester is the man behind the Hornblower novels as well as the book/movie: Sink the Bismark.He is skilled at delivering a \\"rattling good yarn\\"It is old time , top down story telling. History as made by the leadership with very little in the way of criticism of anyone in the theater of action. There is some little generalized disparagement of the politicians who failed to comprehend the importance of having a credible war fighting ability.Speaking as Navy man, I was surprised at how little credit Forester gives to the role of Lt O'Bannon and his squad of Marines. The men who earned the \\"Shores of Tripoli\\" portion of the Marine Hymn almost disappear behind the role of fellow American William Eaton. Mr Eaton, self styled General, and more properly former American Counsel earned his place in this book. When compared to the version of the Marine role as given by Richard Zacks in: The Pirate Coast: Thomas Jefferson, the First Marines, and the Secret Mission of 1805, one can not help but feel that Mr. Forester failed the US Marine Corps.Forester neither did not know of, or mostly ignored the American infighting, cross purposes and failures. Again Zacks handles this better.The Pirate Coast: Thomas Jefferson, the First Marines, and the Secret Mission of 1805Conclusion, easy read, non challenging and more fun than entirely accurate. Likely this was exactly what Forester had in mind."},{"Title":"The Barbary pirates","review":"I'm not as impressed by this book as other reviewers are. The first few pages of the book sounded more like writing from a children's book. It would really take a skillful writer to turn this into a screenplay unless you are talking about a Disney movie. It's not giving much historical background for the Barbary \\"corsairs\\". And, yes it is \\"corsairs\\" that should be used to describe North African privateers not \\"pirates\\". There is indeed a difference. I would definitely recommend instead Stanley Lane-Poole's \\"The Story of the Barbary Corsairs\\" which was available from Amazon at some point. That is a more comprehensive and enlightening book than Forester's."},{"Title":"The Barbary pirates","review":"This book is a good historical synopsis of the struggles of the young US struggle to defeat piracy. Liberty briefly triumphs even as the foibles of its citizens proliferate. Will we ever learn? Maybe if we read this book...Like the brevity of the narrative, but sometimes Forester shorts the depths of the struggles found elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Barbary pirates","review":"Forester brings the challenges and heroics of the new American Navy to life in this easy to follow book. Provides great insights into this important but little understood period of America as a new nation and its emergence on the international military stage. This is nonfiction but could easily be turned into a great piece of historical fiction to challenge Hornblower!"},{"Title":"The Barbary pirates","review":"A facinating account of the beginning of American naval power and the men who lead the way.The Barbary Pirates"},{"Title":"The Barbary pirates","review":"Not a bad effort for a popular historian, and fans of CS Forester will want to read this especially as a prologue to his 'Age of Fighting Sail,' another not bad history, this one of the naval war of 1812. But for those who want more in the way of a serious, well researched and documented history, two recent works from the past year by Joshua London and by Franklin Lambert look far more promising. CS Forester had many strengths as a storyteller, but I'm not sure I'd rely on him for the last word on the history of anything."},{"Title":"The Barbary pirates","review":"However, this is not a review. American Reprint Company of Mattituck, NY, does not have a license to reprint this book. I represent the American interests of the CS Forester estate (our agency is Harold Matson Co, Inc.) and can state without a doubt that American Reprint Co. and its ilk (like Amereon) repeatedly through the years illegally reprint works that are out of print.

All he wanted was to study at a university and eventually become a minister. Jude taught himself to read in Greek and Latin. No man was as humble, decent and kindly as Jude and no man was a deserving as Jude of achieving his ambitions. Perhaps it was never to be. Jude's first wife, Arabella, the coarse daughter of a pig butcher, tricked Jude into marrying him. Jude's second \\"wife,\\" Sue, a cousin, was as intelligent and bookish as Jude, but was cold, inflexible, self-absorbed, and very neurotic. She proved to be the undoing of not only Jude, but also of Richard Phillotson, a former school master, who was as good and decent as Jude.Jude loved Sue tremendously, but family legend dictated that any Fawley family marriage was doomed from the start. Few men in all of literature appeared as lonely as Jude, and few men were as deserving of being loved as was Jude. In one scene, Jude saves his beloved Sue's life after she gets soaking wet after she jumps from the window of her training school. In one of the book's many metaphoric descriptions, Sue is seen dressed in a dry suit of clothes owned by Jude, and looks very much like him, suggesting that Sue may be Jude's alter ego. In a comment in the book, it is seems that Sue is more like an apparition than an actual flesh and blood woman. After much dithering, rather than marry Jude, Sue instead chooses to immerse herself in religion as a form of penitence for the shocking and extremely disquieting loss of their three children. Sue had previously considered herself a non-conformist, a pagan, however, her self-centered coldness to Jude after their great loss, is the antithesis of womanly love.Much of the tragedy in this book can be attributed to British morays during the Victorian era. British views at that time on marriage, sex, and co-habitation ruined many a character in the book, as it probably did in real life. Scandal must be avoided at every turn, just for the sake of appearances. Love may be easily crushed out, destroying people's lives in the process._Jude the Obscure_ is a sad and often depressing book, but very worth while reading. It is loaded with metaphors, which while adding to the book's complexity, often open it to many interpretations. Arabella's fake hair piece, her vanity pertaining to putting dimples on her face, the lugubrious little boy named \\"Father Time,\\" and the oddly colorful and joyous festival at the end of the book are just some symbolism in the book. If there is a message to be derived from Hardy's masterpiece, it is that life, even for the best people, is very unfair. Call it Karma, or whatever, but maybe some people are doomed to suffer."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Thomas Hardy's novel, Jude the Obscure, was a very insightful book, but I found its depressing content reminiscent of The Jungle. This is definitely not a novel that I would want to read sitting out in my garden on a sunny day,but rather for educational purposes only. It's examination and criticism of society makes the reader think, which is an essential element in any good novel.As in The Jungle, Jude the Obscure seems to make the characters' lives worse and worse and worse. The novel begins with high hopes for it's main character, but soon turns into a never-ending landslide of tragedy. The story follows Jude Fawley, who in the beginning of the book is full of dreams of going beyond his lower class station and on to college in Christminster. To do this he studies from books given to him by his old schoolmaster, Phillotson. Jude is a very compassionate and kind-hearted soul who wouldn't hurt a fly and when he is 19, he develops a crush on a local girl named Arabella. She seduces him and then pretends to be pregnant, so that Jude's sense of duty forces him to marry her. The marriage eventually falls apart and Arabella takes off to Australia with her family. Jude then goes to Christminster to pursue his aspirations, but is blatantly rejected. There he meets his cousin, Sue, and falls in love with her. Sue, realizing that Jude loves her, plays with his emotions, and marries Phillotson, the old schoolmaster. Hating the relationship, she asks to be freed from the marriage. Eventually, she likes Jude, but they never officially marry. They end up going from town to town because of the bad reputation surrounding their relationship. During this time they have two children, who are eventually murdered by Arabella and Jude's child, Father Time, who commits suicide after the murders. This drives Sue mad. She then returns to Phillotson, although she can't keep from cringing at his touch, as a form of penance for leaving him in the first place. This leaves Jude alone until Arabella comes back and gets him drunk, so that he will remarry her. Jude, completely broken, dies not too long after the second marriage.Bad experience after bad experience, nothing remotely uplifting happens! It is just depressing and painful. Not to say you can't learn a lot from books that aren't pleasant. This book examines society in a very pessimistic, but accurate light. Hardy's ideas about the negatives of society and the harsh realities of the human condition are apparent throughout the novel. I liked the book only in that it made me think. Beyond that it was just too hard to read because you feel for Jude and want him to find happiness at some point in his life, but he never does. I also found it very dull when it wasn't making me cry. It is a book I would recommend reading once, but definitely not for amusement and only if you can handle 400 pages of gloom."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This book really affected me. First of all, I could really commiserate with the main character through the tribulations of the first half of the book as he fell into the most basic conundrums of the human condition. I was also right there with him as he ranted against the social norms and institutions of his day. Everything was going so great, and then fate reached out its phantasmagorical knife and cut Jude's artery open, bleeding his life out upon the pages like the Pig from the opening chapters. I could only read in horror as Sue talked with \\"little father time\\" premeditating his actions, and watch as, by perplexingly inexorable steps, that which you hope against hope to not happen becomes reality."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This is one of the bleakest books you can ever read. When it came out in the late XIX Century, it was received with so much rejection and disapproval, that Hardy stopped writing novels and dedicated to poetry. Also, his wife thought the book was autobiographical, and since the portrait of the main character's wife was so unfavorable, she was mad at him. The novel raises some topics which were, and up to a point still are, socially controversial. Hardy seems to paint a negative portrait of all social conventions which undermine or irrationally restrict human freedom. Hard moral issues are faced by the characters, always with sad results.Jude is an orphan who grows up with a great-aunt in a backwards town in England. Early in his life he is inspired by his teacher Phillotson, who moves to Christminster (Oxford) to pursue an academic career. Jude wants to go there too and become an illustrated priest. He works hard in his aunt's bakery, and meanwhile gets books and starts learning the humanities all by himself. Later on, he moves to a nearby town and learns the craft of stone carver. One day, as he comes back, he meets a girl, Arabella, who will seduce and deceive him, telling him she's expecting a child. Thus Jude is forced to get married, but soon he discovers he has been cheated. The marriage, of course, is a disaster and Arabella leaves with her parents for Australia. Then Jude is finally free to pursue his dream, and he moves to Christminster. There he meets his cousin Sue, one of the strangest characters in literature, with whom he falls madly in love. But Sue is very weird: she is against all social conventions, while Jude abides by religion and traditional morality. Although he desperately wants Sue, he is convinced he has been married forever, as religion prescripts, and so he agonizes over his past mistake. Sue is also asexual, unstable, and erratic in her behavior, causing much sorrow to Jude. Years later she accepts to marry Phillotson (on the condition that no sexual intercourse is to be had), a further blow to Jude, who even dellivers the bride at church. But of course this marriage is also a failure, and Sue goes back to Jude, with whom she lives as a wife. But this is no happily ever after conclusion. Tragedy will still follow Jude.This is an important novel, both for its literary merit, since Hardy is a very talented writer, and for the difficult issues it touches. Should one remain forever with a person one doesn't love, just because there is an oath about it? Are those kind of mistakes not redeemable? We all make mistakes, don't we? Though finally together, in love, with children and behaving in a socially acceptable manner, Jude and Sue are permanently harrassed and rejected for not being properly married. To make things worse, Arabella reappears to make trouble.One thing that strikes the reader is the fact that, hard as you try, you can find no self-inflicted defeat in Jude. He is a decent fellow, hard-working and devoted to study, but his dream just never comes true, through no fault of his own. He's just maybe a little too uptight about morals, and emotionally weak. It's easy to say: \\"Well, dude, why don't you just dump the two crazy gals and go ahead\\", but if you read the book you'll see that was never an option for him.One other, and very important, literary merit of this book is the excellent character-development. Jude is a person you may know, a sad guy with bad luck. Sue would be today the delight of therapists, especially her problem with having sex. Arabella is a wonderful character, a cynical and outright wicked woman, resourceful in her multiple predicaments. She's nasty and irresponsible, a happy-go-lucky bird of destruction.So why then do I take a star off my review? Because the chain of tragedies and unlucky situations stretches to the point of hilarious preposterousness. Or maybe it's my sense of humor. But at many points I started to guess what would happen to Jude next, imagining unvelievable tragedies, and then Hardy came up with a worse one. Melodrama raises to the levels of black humor. Nevertheless, it's a good book if you can stomach all of Jude's bad luck."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I can hardly put into words how much I loved this book. Granted, if you're looking for a light-hearted read with a happy ending, then this is not for you, but if you love to be moved deeply and if you love books that can move you to tears and send chills down your spine with their final sentences, then this is the book for you. I repeat: this book is wonderful beyond belief."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"It's harder to see why such a fuss was kicked up over this novel. But its power is still intact, and the book I belive probably deserves another reading in order to truly appreciate all its greatness. Hardy was a writer ahead of his time. His outlook remains quite modern. His world is one where God either is indifferent or absent, and men are left at the mercy of society and nature, neither of which go out of their way to be kind. Both Jude and Sue are deep enough and have enough stature to be genuinely heroic characters. At the same time you feel they are so realistic in their personalities and aspirations that they probably existed in the thousands, and people like them are still around today--Jude with his longing for a decent education that is never fulfilled, Sue with her modern neuroticism. They are ahead of their time as well, and they end up at the mercy of the social constrictions and prejudices of it. There are no real villains or evil people in the novel--Hardy's vision is sharp enough to realize that the roots of the problems that make life miserable for people lie deeper than at an individual level: that is why this book was so hated, and still gets bad marks from some. What I felt in reading this book was a feeling that Hardy was describing life as it often really is--full of squashed hopes, undeserved suffering, and cruel twists of fate. His vision is certainly dark, but it is a needed corrective. Hardy as a writer manages to be eloquent and clumsy at the same time, and I wasn't moved by the book as much as I thought I would be.(Perhaps on second reading I will) But I greatly admire the inner strength and nerve it took to write this book and hold his convictions. Hardy was not afraid to throw up his hands at the more meaningless moments of existence and say &quot;That's how the world is! What can you do?&quot; At the same time, the love he had for his characters, and the tenacity he had and gave them, ensured that they would still strive, and try to live their lives on their own terms...because in the end that is all any of us can do. &quot;Ripeness is all.&quot;"},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"The thing with sadness is its so easy to write about. Jude the Obscure is no exception to this unyeilding rule of literature. This heartfelt tragic romance, which attacks many of the untouchable conventions and establishments of its day, is so painful to read that it can't be put down. Jude's endeavour's, destined from the beginning for doom, are the pathes of man searching for some sort of solace in two of his most prized passions, learning and love. Yet for some reason these two goals, which we are taught never to give up on, desert him. Hardy approaches the institutions of religion and scholarship with such a deep resentment by creating an ironic character who desires both, while Hardy himself seems to despise them. Hardy also manages to create an incredible woman in Sue. Sue's passion for her beliefs instill in Jude a passion for her. Her intelligence is something that should be rivaled today. Sue and Jude are the players in a wretched game of love. It questions the fact whether love in fact binds us all"},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Not a great book. A required reading for a class and I could barely keep on reading it. Good luck."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Questioning marriage, independence, self reliance in the mid 1800 for women is thought provoking. Women have worked very hard to have choices in their lives even in todays world."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Perhaps this review is a tad unfair in that I haven't finished reading the book yet. That said, I am determined to do so. The character of Jude is a \\"weak\\" one. Sue is almost anachronistically a hippie. The school master is dull and insignificant. Sue is about to be married but to what end? To tease Jude or to wreck the teacher?"},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure is a saddening book that deals with the oppression that society can force onto people. Jude Fawley's many attempts to rise above his social class and to become something better than he was born to are crushed time and again through society or the forces of nature. The writing itself is very readable; in the beginning of the book, I was very amused by how naive Jude was and enjoyed the way that Thomas Hardy used the language. The quality of writing never suffered through the book, but the plot becomes more and more depressing. In the final scene of the book, where Jude is finally dying after his life of oppression and tragedy, you feel incredibly sorry for all that Jude had to go through. Throughout his entire life he had been mocked by Christminster and all that it represented for Jude. Jude did all that he could to get there and become a scholar, but he was told to stay in his class and be content with what he had. Oppression through marriage of all of the main characters (Jude, Sue, Phillotson, and Arabella) was also explored through the entire book. Arabella is the mistake that Jude made that he cannot escape from. His one wrong choice early in his life ruins his chance for having a normal relationship with Sue, and in his final days he has to live with that choice. The underlying themes here are explored well by Hardy and give the reader a chance to see life from a different angle and hopefully appreciate what they have.One thing I disliked about the book was the constant tragic events. I understand that Hardy was trying to explore certain themes by using such depressing events, but it was too much sometimes. When little Father Time and the children of Jude and Sue died, I was probably as crushed as Sue was. That is perhaps the saddest point of any book that I have read and it caught me by surprise. The tragedy of it was much more than I was expecting, and that is probably what Hardy was looking for. I didn't appreciate being bombarded by such emotional manipulators by Hardy.The characterizations in the book were wonderful. Jude's aspirations that continued to be subverted by his weaknesses made him the perfect tragic hero. Sue was realistic, but she was never strong enough to earn my sympathy. She was just too weak, despite being the \\"liberatedEwoman. I came to dislike Arabella right from the start, and my dislike grew with each appearance she made. Phillotson was perhaps the most pitiable character in the novel, especially when he is persecuted for letting Sue go. The minor characters in the story add to these main characters and help to reveal who that are and why they do what they do.Overall, Jude the Obscure is an excellent novel, but it does have its bad points. The thematic elements in the novel are explored in a thought-provoking way and the characters are portrayed in a realistic and poignant way that helps the reader to understand who they are and why they are being slammed by forces outside of their control. Those forces, though, are sometimes too strong and detract from what Hardy is trying to do with the novel. I would recommend this book, but be prepared to leave aside time to think about it afterwards. This book makes you sit down and think after you read it. If you don't do this afterwards, there will be so much that you miss."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"One of my favorites - even by today's standards, Hardy's novel is wildly forward-thinking and shockingly real. The character of Sue Bridehead is one of the most complex and intriguing characters in Victorian literature. Torn between tradition and modernity, she cannot reconcile the world she lives in with the one she envisions. She and Jude are alike in that way, and it binds them to each other in a way that is inevitably tragic.JUDE THE OBSCURE examines what few novels dare to explore, and none as eloquently: the undeniable link between superstition and religion; the absurdity of entering into a marital contract; and the cruely of a society that breaks those that do not fit within its mold. Heart-breaking and narratively unmatched, Hardy's novel is a cautionary tale that, more than 100 years later, shows us how much as a society we have yet to overcome."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"As with Tess of the d'Urbervilles, if you like tragic, historic romances, you'll love this book. For that matter, if you like soap operas, you'll probably like this book. Furthermore, it isn't nearly as overly wordy as Tess, or for that matter most 19th Century fiction. Its style is much more concise and direct than most of its contemporaries, although still a bit stilted by modern standards.But what's more, this book is worthwhile from another standpoint entirely: it is a scathing condemnation of traditional marriage(&quot;And so, standing before the aforesaid officiator, the two swore that at every other time of their lives until death took them, they would assuredly believe, feel, and desire precisely as they had believed, felt, and desired during the few preceding weeks. What was as remarkable as the undertaking itself was that nobody seemed at all surprised at what they swore.&quot;) and traditional religion, and of ruining one's life by living it to please society and its strictures; and while society has changed much since the days this book was written in (and about), there are those who would argue that those changes were not for the better; that liberalizing attitudes toward divorce, and toward living together without benefit of marriage, have been a seriously bad thing. This book is an excellent look at how it was not always such a good thing for people to be forced into marriages that were clearly not compatible, and forced to stay in them. And while, as I say, times have changed a great deal, there are still far too many people who marry just as precipitously as Jude did Arabella, or Sue did Phillotson, and with no better reasons. It says here that it is a distinct improvement in our society that when people make such a mistake, it can be rectified without totally destroying their lives forever after.Granted, if you're looking for a worthwhile or positive female character, this is not the book to read; of the two main female characters, one is conniving, mercenary, rude and vulgar, (reminding me a great deal of Moll Flanders, from the DeFoe title of the same name, but without her redeeming charm) while the other is neurotic, selfish, whiny, and inconsistent. If you're looking for a worthwhile female character, &quot;Tess of the d'Urbervilles&quot; is a much better choice. Or better yet, the aforementioned &quot;Moll Flanders&quot;. But in general, this book is much better written than &quot;Tess&quot;. For one thing, although it is just as much of a tragic romance, if not more so, the characters do not ALWAYS make the wrong choices. They occasionally make good choices, and get a little bit of happiness as a result. This makes for a much better balanced book, and a much more realistic one. But it is definitely not for everyone."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude is a brilliant, critical and creative glance at Christian marriage and sexual relationships in England's Victorian age. The reader is slowly drawn into a relationship with the book's tragic hero who fails to achieve his dreams of being a scholar and a lover. The story is truly one of the saddest that I have had the pleasure of reading. Much can be learned from this profound novel."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I am a huge fan of Victorian literature, specifically Thomas Hardy, and I believe this is by far his most brilliant novel, although not as well known as Tess of the d'Urbervilles or the Mayor of Casterbridge. The story, though tragic, is beautifully told and skillfully developed without all of the useless hype of today's John Grisham and Tom Clancy novels. The thoughts, surroundings, and lives of the characters become the focus of the story rather than intense action or contrived suspense. You are drawn into the characters' lives; Hardy forces you to care for them, cry for them, and mourn for them. This novel is not for the empty-hearted or those looking for a light read. But for those interested in the emotions and lives of people, this book will be a fast favorite, despite its somber tone and tragic story."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"During a rather animated dinner conversation about the varied definition of &quot;family&quot; today, my English friend suggested that I must obviously love the works of Hardy, &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot;, in particular. No, I was not familiar with his work. As I recalled later, he did brief me on the plot, but the wine must have diluted its message, for it in no way diluted my tragic mourning at the novel's end. Steadfast ambition, good intentions gone awry, true love overwhelming, and eventually destroying all.This work is so sweetly pure in perfection that I have no expectation to ever come that close to it again in a literary experience. I read somewhere that it would be pure joy to read Hardy's novels in the same sequence that he wrote them. Unfortunately for me, I read &quot;Jude&quot; first. And although all his novels are hauntingly, achingly beautiful (I have to pace myself and read them only every so often or I would surely die of heartache), they only come close to &quot;Jude&quot;'s power. After I read the last line of &quot;Jude&quot;, I closed the book, closed my eyes, and desired nothing stronger that to travel to England, sit at Hardy's graveside and ask &quot;What kind of man are you to have been able to do that with mere words?&quot; And to thank him for doing so"},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Will Godwin (terrible_lizard@hotmail.com) from Wisbech, England writes several reviews below: &quot;I, like Mr. Myers, am substantially smarter than the average reviewer (or moronic AP student), and therefore must say that I am one of the few people who can truly appreciate the unique aestheticism of Hardy's transcendental, impressionistic, amorphous, and quasi-sublime genius.&quot;Then goes on, after a paragraph about the novel itself:&quot;After the completion of this novel, Hardy, as Mr. Myers told us, wrote poetry that suggested a great deal of Shelley's influence for the rest of his life. I am shocked, though, that no reviewer, not even Mr. Myers or a stupid AP student, mentioned that Hardy turned to poetry after the critics and public ridiculed and castigated him for writing JUDE. I seem to be the only reviewer knowledgeable and well-read enough to know that.&quot;PLEASE! The back cover of the Penguin classic edition of the book contains the information of which he speaks, which hardly makes one knowledgeable and well-read!Mr. Godwin would do well to be substantially more obscure himself!"},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"It is difficult to imagine a bleaker Thomas Hardy than the bleak author of his early and middle novels, but in his final novel, JUDE THE OBSCURE Hardy plummets into a depth of pessimism so entrenched into the very fabric of this book that he reaches what for him is the nadir of his tragic vision. Critical reaction was predictably negative. Hardy was so offended by what he saw as a universal misunderstanding of his philosophy that he refused to write further fiction. He spent the remainder of his life applying his personal ethos of tragedy to his poetry.It is quite true that JUDE THE OBSCURE is rife with the overwhelming sense of despair to which the critics so objected, but they had other problems with it as well. They did not care for what they saw as the ubiquitous immorality in the relation between Jude and Arabella and between him and Sue Bridehead. Living together in sin counted for more opprobrium back then than now. Further, they felt that Hardy had taken some cheap shots at his dismal portrayal of Christminster as a cesspool of false and elitist learning. Christminster was an amalgam of Oxford and Cambridge, the very alma mater of many of the offended critics.In order for Hardy to create such an unremitting world of gloom, he had to do some serious tinkering with a style of writing that was pretty gloomy in its own right. To make the reader \\"feel\\" the pain of Jude on a level that reached down to bone, he had to place Jude on a level much closer to the reader than Hardy had done in the past. He accomplished this by eliminating any trace of any element that did not somehow smack of existential pain. Hardy, in his earlier novels, occasionally leavened his level of tragedy by including characters who exhibited amusing quirks. No one on a quirky level is to be found here. Hardy, as in THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE, was able to portray a brute nature that might assume some of the blame as to why certain characters met a tragic fate. Here, Hardy places the blame squarely on man and his hidebound institutions as the source of tragedy. In the caste system that was typical of late Victorian society, Hardy saw more evil in that than in brute nature. What remained then was a social triangle with Jude at the apex, Jude's peers at the left end, and a ruthless society at the right end that was determined to squash interlopers more effectively than Egdon Heath ever could. If there ever was a stacked deck against those who wished to rise above their station, Thomas Hardy provided that as an equal opportunity pulverizer."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude The Obscure is a true literary masterpiece that examines multiple issues including class , marriage, hypocracy and Hardy does so by creating unforgettably tragic figures in the characters of Jude Fawley and his cousin/lover Sue Bridehead. These two are soulmates that are caught up in a tragic web that is partially forced upon them by the social conventions of their time. Equally tragic is the unrealized ambition and yearning for a formal education that Jude carries as a cross throughout his life as he ultimately becomes resigned to his station as a working class laborer who will never be accepted in the halls of higher learning which he so reveres.Hardy's writing typically is critical of late Victorian values and his characters frequently suffer tremendous burdens that result from being at odds with what were considered societal norms. None of his characters suffer more than the cousins in this book and the tragedy is one that will haunt the reader for years."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"As a Hardy fan, I turned to &quot;Jude&quot; with high expectations--and was very disappointed. I saw in his work the same recylcing of elements in other works (particularly &quot;Tess&quot; and &quot;Return of the Native&quot;). If Hardy wanted to come out and condemn religion, he should have done so, instead of his little forays and hasty retreats. So read &quot;Jude&quot; if you must, but to see Hardy at his best I recommend &quot;Mayor of Castorbridge&quot; instead."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"If there's one strange habit that's become a subtle part of my life it's that I have the hardest times remembering how I came across some of my favorite things, bands, movies, books, and Jude the Obscure is one of them. I was at a Barnes and Noble with a friend, looking at and picking up random books, when I came across this title. I read the synopsis on the back, informing me of how utterly bleak this book is supposed to be, that Hardy met with reactions so harsh that he never picked up a pen to write another novel until his dying day, and that, most importanly of all, it's the tale of a man's dreams continously crushed before even gaining any kind of momentum, for the majority of his life.After I read all that, the book never left my hand, and that night I went home and took in at least 1/4 of the book in one sitting. There are so many moments and quotes in this book that I can personally identify with that reading it was probably a far more cathartic experience for myself than most others. Jude longs to be a man of the intellectual scene, reading as much as he can, studying numerous languages, latin, of course being the most important, and he never gets close to ever seeing any of his hopes come to life. His life is spent, for the better part, working low class jobs, stone masonry, etc. and falling for all the wrong girls.The women in Hardy's final novel depict the sex at their coldest, most malicious and self-absorbed. Arabella, Jude's first wife, tricks Jude into marriage by faking a pregnancy, and Jude being the soft hearted, love hungry puppy that he is, weds her, only to meet with crushing consequences. Then enters Sue Bridehead, Jude's cousin, a character, I've read quite a few books mind you, that is near the very top of my list of absolutely vile people, Arabella is there as well.Sue is so unconsciouly full of herself, such a self-proclaimed goddess that it's sickening. For the majority of their courtship Sue never even so much as remotely returns Jude's love, which he notes on numerous occasions, to which she simply implies that she loves him but will never actually phyically speak the words.And in the background is Philotson, the man Sue marries before Jude, and the man who, ultimately, unwillingly tears Jude & Sue apart for good. An older man, a teacher, and yet another miserable human being, lets Sue go when he realizes that she doesn't love him, but that she may love Jude. The very fact that Sue was a part of his life, and eventually absent, destroys his reputation, when they get \\"divorced.\\" He loses his job and has to take jobs akin to what Jude did his whole life, if not just a bit better.Sue is basically the poison of the novel. Every life she touches ultimately falls apart. Little Father Time, the son born of Jude & Arabella's time, hangs himself, along with Jude & Sue's two children, because Sue told the boy that the world is a harsh place and that they're better off dead. \\"because we're too many\\" I believe is what the suicide note reads.The day of the child's funeral, Sue, pregnant with third child, has a miscarriage. So, again, it's obvious, in my opinion, that Sue is the poison, destroying all those she comes in contact with, even the child inside her body.There are more disturbing moments in the book, although none nearly as absolutely shocking as the suicide, but I'm already running off at the mouth about what is, and always will be, my favorite book of all time."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This is one of Hardy's best works, with his typical exposure of Victorian and Edwardian double values and moral bankruptcy. It is brilliantly, poetically written, and outlines a tragic tale of love and anguish."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Thomas Hardy was a brilliant writer who is incomparable in our day. Jude the obscure tells the story of a young man with a strong desire to better himself and is taken advantage of due mostly to his innocence, honesty and forthright moral character.

A fine example of classic literature, Thomas Hardy's novels are a must read for anyone with the desire to expand their love of good story telling and the english language."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"The digi reads edition doesn't even have a table of contents making it completely useless in the classroom.

I have never felt this intensity of pure love for a person who I'm told is fictional? He stares out at you, so real you could touch the stubble on his chin. You'll take each loss so personally, and feel each disappointment with such ferocious, physical pangs! Oh, his poor judgment. His bad, impetuous, foolish choices (like mine!), hard knox, followed hard upon by brittle, fleeting true love.The details of the characters make this book great. I loved reading about Jude's struggle to learn Latin. I loved his whimsical sympathy for the hungry rooks. I loved his simultaneous attraction/revulsion for Arabella. I loved the description of her slaughtering the pig, and then later her removing her hairpiece. I loved Jude's tribulations as a mason in the great Cathedral. I loved the complexity of his feelings for Sue. I loved his defiance and obstinacy in the face of death. Oh, he was so brave and stupid and romantic and deluded and smart and thwarted and alone.

In his introduction, Hardy writes that the publication of this book cured him of any thought he might have entertained about writing more. It is in Hardy's typical style of marriage gone terribly wrong.Hardy challenged the laws and even religion of his day. Characters on more than one occasion remark that their consciences go against everything they have been taught mainly by society and religion.Jude is an aspiring scholar who doesn't have enough money to go to the university in Christminster. He spends his childhood and young adulthood preparing for a chance to go. Jude is tricked into a marriage, but before long his wife leaves him. He eventually moves to Christminster, but finds he is unable to attend because of social prejudices and lack of money.

I will not tell the rest of the story for fear of ruining it for you, buy it, it is worth reading for yourself/."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"More than most novels I have read, JUDE THE OBSCURE consists of an extraordinary number of reverses of position, changes in thought, and zigzags of principle. With a background of rural England or smaller towns such as Oxford, (called Christchurch here) this dark story describes the tragic lives of two people who dare---far before our time---to consider love and marriage in a different way. Jude Fawley aspires to be a scholar or even a minister of God, but wanders into an unfortunate conventional marriage with Arabella, a barmaid with an eye for the main chance. He becomes a stone mason, but pores over Latin and Greek texts by night. Despite forewarnings of the unhappiness in marriage which runs in his family, he falls for a cousin, Sue Bridehead, an ethereal, philosophically-inclined woman, who loves Jude in return but marries a dry schoolteacher despite that. Later, as Jude's wife has run off to Australia and as Sue regrets her decision, they come together at last, only to go through a series of extraordinary vicissitudes. One cannot help but wonder if Sue is not more than a little mad. Rain, wind, dark church towers, and damp stones fill this story with atmosphere, but the constant changes in direction and convenient appearances of previous characters at propitious moments may prove a little aggravating. Though these can be taken as criticisms on my part, I admired Hardy's last novel as an attempt to do a very difficult thing---to show the lives of two ordinary people who at some moments transcend their ordinariness with sublime courage, only to lose their way and sink back into the sordid murk of daily existence and terrible tragedy. The characters, in the end, achieve nothing, yet they lived, they too reflect the extraordinary variety of the human condition. Jude, the character, reflects on his life, saying, \\"...it was my poverty and not my will that consented to be beaten. It takes two or three generations to do what I tried to do in one; and my impulses-affections-vices perhaps they should be called-were too strong not to hamper a man without advantages, who should be as cold-blooded as a fish and as selfish as a pig to have a really good chance of being one of this country's worthies.\\" Hardy's condemnation of middle class hypocrisy and the narrowness of \\"scholars\\" comes through constantly. Set against the entire array of world literature available, perhaps JUDE THE OBSCURE is not at the top of the scale----Hardy's indecision as to the direction of his plot prevents that---- but it is still a good novel."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This novel is just one step shy of being a true and great masterpiece. But it's still excellent and its near perfection makes it a compelling read. It's also a deeply moral work, although attacked upon publication as an insult to marriage and religion. No, it isn't. It's the story of a decent Christian guy named Jude who has dreams of getting educated and becoming something in life, so he teaches himself Latin. He meets and falls for a pagan girl named Sue, with whom he has nothing in common. Love works in mysterious ways. Although Thomas Hardy's writing is powerful and gripping with great storylines, his stories are ultimately tragic and convey his pessimistic view on life. But I prefer unhappy endings anyway. He's my favorite Victorian novelist.David Rehakauthor of \\"Love and Madness\\""},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure is an intersting book, which which begins with a small boy that is kind,loving and quite likeable. I found myself feeling sorry for him and his hard life. He is an orphan and lives with his great aunt that doesn't exactly treat him like family. Jude has a sensitive soul with a zest for learning and leads a religious life, and all through his childhood he dreams about going to college. He longs to travel to Christminster, the city of religion and learning, and all of his fantasty's point in the direction of this town. In between his dreaming and studying he decides to become a stonemason to support himself. Everyday he begins getting closer to his dream of reaching Christminster.So here you have this interesting fellow, Jude,on his happy path to fullfilling his dream, until the fatefull day when he comes across his biggest weakness--WOMEN!! Arabella, the pig killer, is Jude's worst nightmare because there is just something about women that Jude cannot resist. I found it quite ironic that Arabella killed pigs for a living, becuase in many ways she ends up killing Jude's soul. Women have mystical powers over Jude. Later in the book he falls for his cousin, Sue, and she has full reign over him; worse than Arabella but her powers are softer and not as forcefull. Sue is the women that Jude adores more than anything else in the world. He ends up living with Sue hoping that someday they will marry--especially as their family begins to grow.Throughout the book, Jude is juggling between his dreams of being educated, his devotion to religion, and the roles of these two women in his life. There is a backdrop of religion and it plays an important role in the book because it creates a contrast to the lives of the characters. Jude begins religious but after he encouters Arabella and Sue his dreams of learning quickly start to vanish and he begins digging himself in a hole that has no end. Before he knows it his roots in religion soon are pulled out and he becomes hopelessly reliant on the love he feels for Sue. Part of his departure from religion results from Sue being liberal and not very religiou, which in the end takes an unexpected twist as Sue turns to religion for comfort.This book is actually quite depressing as is weaves in-and-out of the lifes of Jude, Arabella , and Sue. These three people have no control over their feelings and in the end they all end up in miserable positions. I recommend this book only if you are in the mood to read about three depressing and unhappy lives. But the book does have interesting ideas about religion, marriage, hopes, and ideals, and the way they all intertwine and relate to the life of Jude the obscure. After reading this I realize that obscure is an understatement, and I no longer feel sorry for him, but find myself asking why Jude is such a naive fool."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I read this rather difficult novel in one weekend. The story of Jude Fawley's rather turmultuos life is engrossing and memorable. It seems that some people in life always make wrong decisions, and things never really go their way. Jude is one of those people. I couldn't help but feel sorry for the idealistic young man who only hoped for one thing, to study at Christminster and live a life in the church or university as a scholar.If I only had half the enthusiasm and drive that Jude started out life with, I would be successful beyond my wildest dreams. Yet Jude was never able to benefit from his hard work and study. He was constantly held back by family obligations, work, society and poverty.As depressing as Jude the Obscure is, I loved it from beginning to end. I felt that there are some valuable lessons to be learned from the book.

The manner in which the children are found dead seems to reach out from the book and grip the reader with heart-wrenching sadness. I found myself sobbing at the incredible grief and distress this child must have felt he caused his parents. As a result, he takes his own, as well as his siblings, lives. The note he leaves behind grabbed my heart. I read this book while on vacation, and although it is not what one would consider a conventional &quot;beach read&quot;, I found myself unable to put it down.

The story is beautifully well written, with characters the reader can sink their teeth into. Hardy is a master of the human condition, he understands the underlying principles of life and portrays them vividly so that we all can learn important lessons from reading his work"},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure by Thomas Hardy is an intriguing book. It is the story of a young man named Jude who aspires to be a religious preacher. In Jude's pursuit of this goal, he is faced with opposition.Jude is a poor orphan boy who lives with this aunt. He works by day and studies by candle light to get into Christminster, a special college for theologians. All seems well until a voluptuous woman distracts one Sunday from his studying. Before he knows it, he is not longer studying and married to a woman he does not love.Jude falls in love with another young woman. Society frowns on them for she belongs to another.Through the credible characters of Jude, Arabella, Sue, and Philloston, Hardy shows the effect society has upon the weak individual. Some would have you believe Jude the Obscure is an awful book, but it is not. It is a book that makes you think. When I was done reading it, I though, \\"Now what has that got to do with anything?\\" It has a lot to do with everything. It covers the subjects of God, love, fate, and society. What Hardy has to say should be heard. I recommend reading Jude the Obscure."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure, written by Thomas Hardy, is the story of Jude Fawley and Sue Bridehead. It follows the development of their love for each other and then their demise as lovers. I did not enjoy this book. I found its characters to be feeble and its theme twisted.Jude Fawley is a penniless orphan raised by his aunt in a small English village. He is inspired by his schoolmaster Mr. Phillotson to pursue a goal of attending one of the great universities in the town of Christminster. His dream is crushed when the universities reject him because he was not properly educated, and more importantly because he is not of the upper class. While in Christminster Jude falls in love with his cousin Sue Bridehead who is a rogue in society. Sue is well read and opinionated. Before becoming acquainted with Jude, She had lived with a young scholar that loved her. The two were never married because Sue desired to live as comrades and not sweethearts because she did not love him. The entire novel follows the love affair of these two outcasts of society.I found that I could not become emotionally attached to these characters. Jude and Sue constantly assumed the role of victim. For example, Sue promises to marry Jude's old school master Mr. Phillotson. She tells Jude that it is Mr. Phillotson's plan that Sue will complete a teacher training school, and then the two, as a married couple, will take a position at a double school (a school for both boys and girls). Sue acts like the victim of Mr. Phillotson's planning; she does not even consider that she could reject the plan just like she rejected the young scholar of her early days. After several of these incidents, I became desensitized to the suffering of the characters. Hardy lost his ability to manipulate my emotions by creating weak characters that never reacted to their surroundings, but were only acted upon by society.Thomas Hardy must be given credit for building consistent characters. Both Jude and Sue remain predictable throughout the novel. This quality leant credibility to the characters, because everything they did fit with their personality. I could believe that the characters were truly spineless human beings. They never surprised me by doing anything bold or courageous.I also found this novel to be distasteful due to the fact that I was left in a quandary as to the theme of the book after I had completed my reading. It appears Hardy was writing a criticism of the institution of marriage, but that can be debated. For example, Hardy pens the following statement by Sue as she and Jude attempt to marry in the Superintendent Registrar's office: \\"Jude-I don't like it here! I wish we hadn't come! The place gives me the horrors: it seems so unnatural as the climax of our love! I wish it had been at church, if it had to be at all. It is not so vulgar there!\\" (284) From this statement I would assume that Hardy is against marriage. But at the point in the novel that this statement is made, Jude and Sue had been living together for some time. It can thus be argued that this sentiment arose from not performing the marriage ceremony at the proper time. The theme of the novel would then be that marriage is necessary and must be done properly. I must confess that Hardy forces the reader to think and ponder in order to derive the themes from the novel. But I prefer a theme that is not so debatable.I rate this novel as deserving two stars. Thomas Hardy creates consistent and credible characters. He also provokes the mind of the reader to ponder his novel. But his characters were cowardly and his theme unresolved, which is unsuited to my taste in literature."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This book is about marriage and expectation.

Off to find a different version..."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure by Thomas Hardy is a compelling and intriguing novel. Instead of most conventional novels that rely on plot, it places its emphasis on getting certain points and ideas across to the reader. It is a book meant to make the reader think, not as a leisurely Sunday afternoon story. The story takes us through a series of tragic events, starting first, in contrast, with Jude as a young child full of hopes and dreams, the primary dream being to go to Christminster to become a learned fellow. We follow his life as he marries Arabella, a woman who fakes a pregnancy to get Jude to marry her. Because their marriage does not have the foundation of love, it quickly crumbles and Arabella leaves Jude to go to Australia.Jude then decides to follow his old dreams and travels to Christminster, only to find it was little like what he had imagined. There he falls in love with his cousin Sue, who in order to spite Jude, marries the schoolmaster Phillotson. She despises their marriage, and soon asks her new husband to let her leave. After much contemplation, he consents, and Sue runs off with Jude. The two start a life together with Jude worshiping Sue and Sue constantly pushing Jude away. They will not commit to marriage, and live a life together looked down upon by all of society. After a while, they get a surprise from Arabella, saying she has a son that belongs to Jude, and that he will be coming to live with them. Father Time, as he was nicknamed, comes to live with them. He is a very depressed young soul, burdened by things way beyond his years. Sue and Jude have two more children out of wedlock, and constantly move from town to town to get away from the jeers of society.Just as things are starting to look up, as Sue seems to finally love Jude, Father Time decides to take things into his own hands and hangs himself as well as the other two children. Sue, being unable to cope with the situation, leaves Jude and goes back to Phillotson, saying it is her duty. Jude, left alone, is then visited by the vivacious Arabella, who gets him drunk so he will consent to re-marry her. Their marriage, however, is simply one huge lie, and Jude, from depression and a loss of hope, becomes sick and finally dies in his misery.The main topics looked at by Hardy seem to be about goals and marriage. Hardy clearly defines Jude's many goals, for instance his pursuit of knowledge and his pursuit to win the love of Sue, but just as St. Jude, the saint of hopeless causes, Jude is never able to achieve them. The idea seems to conclude that no matter what your goals are, you will never be able to attain them. This is a depressing thought, and though it may be true for some people, I believe it does not clearly express the true things that happen in people's lives. Most people, if they have a goal in sight, do achieve their goals, bringing themselves happiness.Marriage is clearly looked down upon in this book. Hardy shows marriage between both Sue and Phillotson as well as Jude and Arabella as a trap of unhappiness. He then contrasts that unhappiness with the life of \\"true\\" happiness that Jude and Sue had together, out of wedlock. This idea, in my opinion, is absolutely false. Marriage is meant to be the union of two people who love each other so much that they are willing to commit their entire lives to each other. It is meant as a means for happiness and love to blossom. Hardy's demented idea of marriage is clearly false.Even though some of the philosophies in this book tend to be skewed, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. It made me think on an entirely different level. I could sympathize Jude's pain, and though it may not be a leisurely novel, it is a classic that I recommend any educated person should study."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"A must read, along with the Bronte sisters. So much better than wasting time w/ modern romance novels... one almost is there with this struggling young man."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Yet another sad ending, but Jude is such a great character! This is one of my favorites from Thomas Hardy."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I greatly prefer Far From The Madding Crowd and Tess of The D'Urbervilles to Jude The Obscure. The misconception of Hardy as a cruel bringer of doom and gloom is based on this novel. Unlike FFTMC and TOTDU, there are no happy blissful moments in Jude the Obscure- simply non-miserable ones.Jude is a working class country boy who dreams of studying at Christminster (Oxford). Jude is thinking with something but it isn't his head when he marries buxom country wench Arabella Donn and pursues his free-spirited cousin Sue Bridehead. He is constantly distracted from his books by his baser needs and the only saying that his family are not made for marriage. His tragedy is his obscurity- like so many of Hardy's characters, he dares to be awkward and pays the price.Jude himself is rather feeble-headed but one can empathise with his fervent dream to study at Christminster, which he is not suited for and is not the paradise he believes it to be. I like Sue Bridehead although her frigidity isn't really explained- though to be honest, it was daring enough of Hardy to explore behind the bedroom doors. We have to wait for DH Lawrence to publish Sons and Lovers before we get a book like that. Arabella is an interesting character- in one respect, she's the typical country wench, arousing Jude's baser needs but in another way, she represents the country lad in him, that rough and uncultured part which he keeps trying to flee from yet keeps coming back to torment him. She is spiteful, uncouth, selfish, and at two points in the novel shows extreme moments of cruelty. However, both women are very spirited in the Hardy manner.What I miss from Jude The Obscure is Hardy's descriptions of the country. At times they went on a bit but a lot of the time they were beautiful and evocative, such as the opening chapter of The Return of The Native. Instead of the passion and spirituality Hardy usually associates with the country, the country represents the things that will always hold Jude back. There are some nice descriptions of Christminster but they're not on a par with the country ones. Hardy seems troubled by his previous assertions and his desire to tackle the injustice of society, outside of his usual landscape, means that although the novel is comparatively accessible in light of other writers of the period, it is not his most accessible work. If you're a Hardy beginner, start with Far From The Madding Crowd, or Tess, if you have a strong constitution.The critics hated the novel, nicknaming it Jude the Obscene. It openly (well, as open as you can be in the nineteenth century) explores sexuality and Hardy dares to write a male protagonist whose feebleness is overshadowed by the brilliance of the female characters. Men identified with Jude- and they didn't want to."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Thomas Hardy beautifully portrays rural English life during the late 19th century. Having spent time in south England, it is easy to feel absorbed in the places and times brought to life in this novel. The characters feel very real."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"In the postscript to the preface of Jude The Obscure, Thomas Hardy quotes a German reviewer of the novel. Sue Bridehead, the heroine, was described there as \\"the first delineation in fiction of the woman ... of the feminist movement - the slight pale \`bachelor' girl - the intellectualised, emancipated bundle of nerves\\" that modern conditions were producing. The book's reception \`cured' Hardy of the desire to write another novel, and all of the above happened before the dawn of the twentieth century.Jude The Obscure is a novel about relationships within marriage. Hardy's opinion was that legal ties between men and women ought to be breakable once the union had achieved dysfunction. It was an opinion that differed from that expected by the age. It prompted a bishop to burn the book, rather than the writer, who was unavailable at the time.Thomas Hardy's Jude Fawley was adopted into a baker's family, and harboured an ambition to self-teach himself into a classical education in Christminster's learned colleges. His schoolmaster, Mr Phillotson helped a little. Jude's ambition was always somewhat far fetched, though he applied himself diligently to his studies and achieved a great deal. In his formative years, he also learned the stonemason's trade to allow the earning of a living. On a country walk he then took up with Arabella, the daughter of a pig farmer. Having found himself stuck, he tried to learn how to stick real pigs but somehow the penetration never came easy. The couple parted, apparently childless.Sue, Jude's cousin and thus a co-member of a family reputed for its marital failures, was always a soul mate for the young man. But she never quite seemed up to the task of giving herself, giving of her self. Thus, when she married Phillotson, the much older, staid and perhaps already failed schoolmaster, his lack of demands on her fit exactly with her assumptions about how married life would progress.Sue certainly knew what she wanted from life and did everything in her power to secure it. Safety, security, respectability, perhaps property were top of her list. Arabella, the pig farming barmaid who lured the nave Jude, was similarly single-minded in pursuing her own, rather different interests. After leaving Jude, she takes up with a new man and hops it to Australia, apparently for good.Sue and Phillotson finally dissolve their marriage by mutual consent to allow Sue to pursue her desires. She and Jude, who love one another dearly, then make their lives together. They do not marry. They live as brother and sister, with lust on one side of the bed and revulsion on the other. A child arrives by train. The wizened-looking boy is Jude's, Arabella claiming she was pregnant before the couple separated. Sue and Jude offer a home for the waif, and then two more whose family fortunes have fallen on bad times.And then tragedy appears. Their world falls apart. Sue craves the responsibility of marriage, perhaps merely for the respectability she has lost, so she returns to a new marriage with Phillotson. As before, it's just for the show of it. Jude develops consumption.What happens in Jude The Obscure is the meat of the book. How it happens is less important than how the characters justify their actions, effectively their reactions to what life offers in response to their imagined aspirations. How these people seek to justify themselves tells much of what they think is expected of them by others, by the society at large. Thus the novel appears to be a study - even a treatise - in selfishness melded with self-obsession, but this is always shrouded in a coded justification that cites the need for social, societal, even sanctified heavenly approval.In many ways, Jude The Obscure's men are its victims, its women coldly triumphant, its tone vaguely misogynist. It has little time for the establishment, which is often portrayed as a conspiracy to promote misery. Christminster, Oxford in other words, is thought of as a great centre of high and fearless thought. But in reality it is \\"a nest of commonplace schoolmasters whose characteristic is timid obsequiousness to tradition.\\" The alternative, self-congratulatory selfishness did not appear to be much better. Thus Jude The Obscure has much to say about our own time, about public virtue and the need to live according to the socially expected."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"The book is new and arrived sooner that I expected.Thank you for include a book mark. Everytime I buy something here, Im so happy. Thank you!"},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This is the second of Hardy's novels I have completed reading, the first being Tess of the D'Urbervilles. The latter was an instant favorite of mine and I can now say Jude the Obscure joins that category.Jude, poor Jude, aspires to be a scholar despite his meager upbringing of being orphaned and raised in a low income household. His intrinsic pursuit of happiness and determination is marked by his complete devotion to learning and acquiring worldly knowledge, with ecclesiastical texts being a close second. The supremely mental and spiritual pursuits of Jude eventually are sidetracked by his human, fleshly nature, which is one consistent theme prevalent in the novel. There are a lot of contrary themes, really, representative of the duality of human nature: Christianity counters Paganism, the battle of spirit versus flesh, marriage and single hood, pragmatical against emotional, ecstasy and despair, etc.The book is relative even to this day and age because Hardy captures the internal human struggle very accurately. There are plot twists that you get hints to, almost intuitively, but the execution of these changes catch you by surprise.It is depressing and tragic, there is no doubt, and has a sobering effect on the reader. You want Jude to find the happiness he's longed for and to see his dreams comes to fruition after all his sacrifices.When I finished the book, I thought back to those first pages of it when Jude is a naive young boy and had his future spanned in front of him. The Jude who had hopes and dreams and who had no semblance of what will befall him in his coming years. I couldn't help but then think to myself, \\"What if?\\""},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Ah, the novel that made Thomas Hardy stop writing. When this novel was first published, it was so controversial it is said that the Bishop of Wakefield publicly burned it. I can definitely see why. This novel questions not only marriage and the laws of the time, but also religion, the class system, and society in general. Add suicide to that and you have yourself quite a book for 1895. Although shocking at times and still relevant today, it doesn't quite have the impact now that it did then. It would be too hard to give a brief summary without giving away some major plot points, so I won't even try. I will say that I'm not always fond of the classics that I've read, but I think this one is a really good book. The old writing style gets a little annoying at times, but the storyline makes up for it. This is a not a book for the faint of heart. It's sad, depressing, and tragic. If you're looking for something light and happy, don't choose this one."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I very much enjoyed the beginning of the novel. However, toward the end, things became a little too dark. I'd been warned that it was Hardy's darkest, but was still unprepared for the plot twists.Hardy's word choice, foreshadowing, and imagery were very entertaining, but the plot was unenjoyable towards the end. Character motivation also was rather abstract. I had to read this book for my Eng102H class, and if I had picked it out for pleasure reading, I would not have finished it. It was obscure to say the very least."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Parts of this novel affected me very deeply and really broke my heart. One grisly scene near the end of the book is the most horrifying I've read since Capote's In Cold Blood. The little child, nicknamed \\"Father Time,\\" is one I will never forget. It makes us ponder on just how many children are born feeling that they are unwanted. Sad, very sad. But Hardy tugs our heartstrings to make us more conscious of the suffering in the world. If we ignore it, it will never get better.Most of Hardy's novels are very \\"modern\\" in tone and style. The plot rushes along at a fast clip and Hardy's message is loud and clear. He wants us to try really hard to make this a better world for the kids, and for ourselves. It's a beautiful, but very disturbing, little gem of literature."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"The edition of \\"Jude the Obscure\\" that I believe you're seeing on this page -- the Signet paperback, with the two horses on the cover -- first came out in '61 and hasn't been touched since then (except to add a bibliography in 1980). There is a helpful 11-page afterword by Al Alvarez, but that's it. Signet has just been reissuing and reissuing the same thing for over four decades.With the Signet, though, there are no footnotes; you're just getting the bare text. That means that you'll have zero help with Hardy's rustic or ecclesiastical terms, not to mention the abundant Latin.In short, get this one:Jude the Obscure (Oxford World's Classic), in which said defect is remedied. And unlike the Signet, in which the text has adjusted to reflect modern spelling and pronunciation, the Oxford's World's Classics is Hardy's original text as he saw it published."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I found the first part of the book to be pretty interesting; here is a nonconformist couple bucking the weight of Victorian mores and standards to live life according to their inner callings--actually, to live life in a way that's much taken for granted today--and I wondered what Hardy would do with them. I was pretty certain he wouldn't write a polemical celebration of nonconformist freedom like, e.g., D.H. Lawrence. Though this is my first Hardy novel (I don't count having read Return of the Native in high school or watching Roman Polanski's \\"Tess\\"), I'd read enough of his poetry to conclude he had a dark and gloomy side, mournful and fatalistic, an unerring instinct for turning things toward misery and loss...So there was a bit of suspense for me to see what Hardy would do with these free spirits of his who more or less reflected worldviews of his own.Well, without getting into the grisly details (in an effort not to spoil any of the plot's surprising twists), let's just say that in the second half of the book Hardy pulls out all the stops and sets Jude and his true love Sue down a path of unremitting grief, loss, and bewilderment. Hardy appears to be shooting for drama on the scale of Greek tragedy, with Jude confirming as much by likening himself to Agamemnon. The problem for me is that this story--two individuals clashing with the mores of Victorian England--is just not a stout enough framework to hang all the extreme emotions and heavy drama that Hardy unleashes. Jude and Sue have, as a couple, simply flouted Victorian morality by getting divorces and living together; and Jude, individually, had the gall to think that he, a working-class lout, could gain entry into the hallowed halls of English higher learning. I kept wondering why they didn't just pull up stakes, forsake small-town life and move to London where people wouldn't care as much. But Hardy turns it all into a transgression against cosmic law (at least that becomes Sue's view of things), requiring cosmic revenge through a tragic turn of events--again, like Greek tragedy.The problem for me is that Hardy's made it pretty clear in the first part of the book he thinks societal norms about marriage and class are hidebound, stifling, and absurd. For the first part of the book they're mere social constructs that are worthy of scorn and rebellion; then they suddenly become eternal values, the violation of which results in awful, tragic consequences.I wondered if Hardy was just making fun of Victorian morality, skewering its self-importance by inflating it to the inappropriate level of high tragedy. But Hardy is too believable a dramatist for one to conclude that all the howling and agony are there just for sport. The drama may be more than the situation justifies, but it's compellingly and artfully written. The moral of the tale seems to be, then, that those who flout society are doomed to a tragic end. Or maybe just that this particular couple was doomed to a tragic end for flouting society. Either way, I find it pretty unconvincing.It's too bad that Hardy couldn't have drawn more on the satirical in his writing; it appears he had a wry sense of humor. One description of marriage (between Jude and Arabella): \\"The landlord of the lodging...had doubted if they were married at all...till by chance overhearing her one night haranguing Jude in rattling terms, and ultimately flinging a shoe at his head, he recognized the note of genuine wedlock; and concluding that they must be respectable, said no more.\\" Hardy also seems to be giving a bit of a wink with names he uses: \\"Sue Bridehead\\" for the most reluctant bride on earth; \\"Sarcophogus College\\" for one of the dreary, morbid schools at Christminster; \\"Mildew Lane\\" as the address of gloomy lodgings in which Sue stays; and \\"Temperence Hotel\\" where Jude and Arabella are anything but temperate.But these instances of humor are mere blips on the screen in \\"Jude\\". Hardy seems determined to cast his story in terms of sin and retribution, drenched in misery and anguish. It seemed overplayed, hence unsatisfying."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure is easily one of the best-written stories I have read in a long time. You will probably think Jude and Sue are so weird they are from another planet. In a way, you are right.It may help you understand it a bit better if you think of it this way:Jude has Asperger's syndrome. Sue is a \\"Highly Sensitive Person\\" (HSP).On top of these problems, Jude is a young boy ready to have sex but not mature enough to be married and have responsibilities. His cousin Sue is a young girl ready to \\"be loved\\" but unready to have sex.Life repeatedly rushes Jude and Sue into the very things they are unprepared for and things get VERY bad quickly. The author, who obviously has baggage, is trying to make a case against marriage.I found myself caring for these characters, even though I knew that the story could not possibly end well. I found myself vomiting when the murder takes place.Do not read this book unless you are willing to have your traditional values unseated very painfully."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I watched the movie \\"JUDE\\" when I was a kid and ever since was stranged by it. I recently read the novel and to be honest, was very depressed from it. And I am and have always been a tomboy, someone who is hardly ever emotional... This book was one emotional trip due to many of its themes, as so many other reviewers here interminably wrote about and so I won't go into the many tradegies of Jude's life. I very much felt, and sympathized for both Jude and Sue and related to their harsh society they had lived in and that we delude ourselves to have changed since 1895. Because I did see the movie (and I must say that, even though it deviated from the book, it was nevertheless suitably done), I wasn't so much surprised by the chain of events. Many here criticized the bleak, grim tale of Hardy's \\"Jude the Obscure\\" on several specific events, but for me, I found the very ending of the book to be the saddest, austerest part of it(spoilers). Jude's death, I felt, was the Hardy's most horrendous, picturesque description of the ill guy I came to love and admire, lying in a couch, coughing and wishing his death. Regretting ever being born, Jude is alone (sueless) on his deathbed, feeling the warm wind of summer as it drifts in the room bringing with it musical notes from a graduation ceremony he himself never had the option to attend. The one thing I am not closed on, is the title for the book, which to my understanding was the third and final. But as my sister asked me: \\"why the obscure?\\" I answered I thought it was Hardy's mockery of society by naming its absurdity. This is because as one very fast realizes when reading this book, it is not Jude that is obscure, but rather society is, for forcing people unto structures, institutions and ways of life that from their foundations were never executable. I recommend this book to people who are emotionally stable."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This is a harrowing story about one man's utter helplessness against the winds of destiny. Jude is an orphan boy with a vision and a passion for life that is cruelly challenged and ultimately thwarted by forces beyond his control. His is a tale of fortune and fate, of desire and despair.But what struck me most was what I took to be the novel's sub-theme: unrequited love. I wonder if this is what Hardy sought to convey through his subtheme: that love, though it seeks to transcend the loneliness of life, is itself always a lonely endeavor--never fully mutual because it is inherently unequal."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"\\"Jude, the obscure\\" was almost Thomas Hardy last book. When it was published in 1895, the novel received reviews that were so negative that the writer resolved never to writer another novel. But there is a reason for such a negative reception of the novel. This book attacks some of the most important institutions for the British: education, social class and marriage. His narratives are known for the tragic heroes and heroines who are in the service of his critical tone. In this book it is not different. The title's Jude isn't the only one used for this purpose. Hardy creates one of his best characters in the book: the free-spirited Sue Bridehead.Love and tragedy walks hand in hand in \\"Jude, the obscure\\". Jude Fawley dreams of going to a university. But he is an orphan raised by his working-class aunt, who can't afford. He is lead to a career as a stonemason. Although inspired by the ambition of town schoolmaster, Jude can't leave the village after marrying a young woman named Arabella. But their marriage didn't work, she moves to Australia.But another woman will touch his heart. He meets his cousin Sue, and tries no to fall in love with her. She is going to marry shortly. But she is not happy with her husband, and leaves him to live with Jude. But the problems are just begining in Jude's life.Hardy's narrative deals with characters living in a circle of self-erected oppression that they cannot break free. The society, that cannot accept their rejection of convention, is the main cause of this oppression. As people who chose their will, Jude and Sue are ostracized. The fact of the society doesn't accept their marriage is one of the main causes of their tragedies.Jude's obsession with education, going to Christminster University becomes more and more important toward the end of the book. Alongside with Sue, college represents the thing Jude aspires but can't have.With \\"Jude, the Obscure\\", Thomas Hardy created an allegory of the ties that society uses to keep people in the place it wants us to be. His writing is evocative and his characters very human, aspiring common things that fall short when a repressive society is ruling."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"In my own personal quest to read as many of the \\"classics\\" as possible I picked this one up some years ago after seeing it referred to by many critics and writers as a beacon of excellent prose. I was pulled into Jude's world almost immediately and it took a while to escape it completely when I had finished the book. It's not pessimistic, it's just that Jude lives a tragic life and Hardy expresses it to the fullest. This book started me on a quest that didn't end until I had devoured each of his other novels and a biography of his life. As good as the others were, this one tops them all."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Thomas Hardy has much to offer the reader in this, his final novel before he committed himself full-time to poetry. It caused a storm of controversy when it was first published before the end of the 19th century. With its frank (but not graphic) descriptions of sexuality and its emphasis on the fact that only the two people involved need to consent to a relationship--not their priest or minister, not their families, and certainly not society as a whole--\\"Jude\\" shocked the public. It stands now as a beautifully sustained character study of a broken man and his steadfast love for the unsure Sue. Jude is a rock and it is fitting that he makes his living carving stone. Sue is birdlike, dainty, emotionally unstable and absolute catnip to Jude. Beyond this, they are distantly related and that adds a certain fillip to their interactions. The impatient reader will have difficulty understanding Jude's unwavering devotion, but it is evidence of Hardy's skill that he makes Jude make sense."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I just returned to this novel after twenty-five years: I first read it as an undergraduate and found it rather depressing, even slightly morbid. Well, it's still pretty dark, but the drama of thwarted desire and misplaced passion resonates, for a middle-aged reader, in a way I never imagined as a teenager--when the future seemed limitless. Then, too, there is the language, the ebb and flow of sentences, the rythmic exactitude of descriptions. If nothing else, Hardy reminds you that even the most critically-acclaimed novelists currently writing in English are still just kidding around."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"&quot;Jude the Obscure&quot; is the story of the self-destructive foolishness of the highly gifted Jude Fawley (ryhmes with 'folly'), which gradually takes him from a chance to become an Oxford scholar in spite of his provincial upbringing to a pitiful death it is better not to mention. This book is a well drawn example of a tragic waste of life and of great gifts, and as such it can be seen as a masterpiece of moralism in literature. It is hardly one of my favorite books, protraying as it does the brutal self ruination of high promise, but it does not lack in quality what it is missing in consolation."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"As with many of Thomas Hardy's books, Jude the Obscure is a book that satirizes society's views-this one of relationships and commitment. At the beginning of the novel, Jude is a young boy in Marygreen (a part of Wessex) gains an interest for the city of Christminster. At this young age he committed himself to becoming educated enough to one day attend one of the many colleges at Christminster and become a decorated scholar or minister of the church. One day while returning to Marygreen from a job as a stone mason, he meets Arabella. Her entire view of marriage is a social engagement by which a woman attaches herself to a man and allows him to care for her and carry her expenses. She attracts Jude's attention by throwing a piece of raw pig meat at him, and coerces him into marriage by making him believe that she was pregnant. This arrangement, Jude believed, would only postpone his ability to attend a mighty school in Christminster. After their divorce, and a lengthy intermission, Arabella again gets Jude to marry her by keeping him drunk for several days. As made manifest by her use of a false hairpiece and the way she artificially produces a dimple in her cheek, Arabella is a character that portrays the faade of marriage. Her view of relationships was entirely superficial, something for society to see. There was no substance to her or to any relationship she was engaged in.After their divorce, Jude finally moves up to Christminster where he is rejected by all the colleges. He realized that what he had hoped for as a boy was just a fantasy. Here he meets Sue, a cousin of his, and falls in love. Sue, who really loved Jude, only wanted the security from a relationship without ever having to give a commitment (why she always avoided marriage with Jude). This later led to Jude's downfall. Sue was extremely manipulative and controlled Jude and his emotions as though she were merely pulling and releasing strings. She was often childish and impulsive by drastically doing things and making rash decisions. She knew how Jude felt about her, but seemed to find more enjoyment by avoiding that which she felt was the natural course of nature. Ultimately, she only brought suffering upon herself, and unimaginable anguish upon Jude.Jude was a boy who wanted nothing more than to \\"be somebody.\\" He had great goals that were thrashed before his eyes by selfish women who knew his weaknesses. Had Jude been a confirmed bachelor, he would have had little problem in achieving his goals, and Hardy would have been without a book that illustrated the follies of marriage in his day. For example, it is pretty sad by knowing that two people were married by their indifference and mal disposition toward each other. Whenever he recovered from a folly with either of the aforementioned women, he would return to his roots at Marygreen-more going back to the basics-reset his goals (which ultimately led to Christminster) and set out to only be shoved off course by a pretty dame. Hardy's book, being well written and easy to follow and read, if nothing else illustrates what I definitely do not want in a relationship. It is a story like you find in the Bible, one that shows the potholes in life so that you may avoid them."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I didn't enjoy reading this one. I know Hardy isn't the most cheery writer, but this was beyond just depressing -- it was boring. About halfway through, I was tempted to just skip the rest but I trudged on to the bitter end.This may have been scandalous when it was published, but why couldn't Hardy have done a better job with the ending? The almost Dickensian sequence of hard-to-swallow tragedies was too contrived for my taste. Was Hardy afraid of writing a happy ending for this unconventional pair, or did he want to display the worst-case effects of a rigid social code of behavior? Either way, it all became pretty unbelievable.From a historical point of view, as a jumping-off point for a discussion of the social constraints and morals of the period, Jude is a success; it certainly seems to have set off some fireworks when it was first published. As casual reading, I can't recommend it."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This book will not put cheer in your heart. Few books I have read recently have been so consistently and methodically depressing as &quot;Jude.&quot; His utter naivety in being pulled into mistake after mistake and wasting away his life makes you want to shake sense into him. The worst part is that he is not a bad man, he just makes poor decisions. Or perhaps I should say he allows others to make poor decisions for him. He wants to push societal norms on the one hand and conform to them on the other. And he, like most of us, does not have the courage or ambition to break through and achieve his goals. In the end his environment, created by his own folly, drags him down and guarantees his unhappiness. The reason for my ranking of 3-stars is that I didn't find the book compelling or particularly thought provoking. It described a situation I find often in current society. On the plus side Hardy is an excellent writer and the book moves you to emotion."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"As a British person, I am perplexed as to how this novel could possibly change the view of the Seatle resident on the Brits (see review by Seattle). I dread to think what his or her opinion of the Brits was before this novel, let alone her revised opinion of us since reading the novel. It is amazing how simplistic some of these prejudices are, especially since they can be re-vamped in such a shallow way by reading a Thomas Hardy novel, which completely sums up British culture in a nut shell ( I think not). I always think it's advisable that to hold an opinion, you must have an educated and broad justification for it. That means until you know what you are talking about, remain respectively non-judgemental about other people etc in the world.Nevertheless, this is a wonderful book by the great Thomas Hardy. It is dark, moralistic and tragic, so don't expect a pleasent Jane Austin type read. The film, made from the book, starring Kate Winslet and Cristopher Eccelston, is a superb adaptation of this novel. It's grim and hopeless theme is well portrayed.I reccommend you to read this book!"},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Simply awesome. Had me pumping my fist in the air and yelling, \\"Yes!\\" over and over again. I read this in one marthon session of fist-pumping and yelling."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure is one of my favorite books. I have read it several times, and now I have it on my Kindle to enjoy again."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"A book that shows the tragic results of making an most important life decision early in life and how such a decision can ruin one for the rest of one's life."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure is one of the greatest books of English literature ever published. The central character is almost too sensitive for this world, but he struggles on, as we all do. Yes, it can be painful to read about suffering and there's no happy ending, none of Hardy's books have happy endings that I can recall. It's not a book for children, but if you love literature, this book should be on the top of your reading list."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"The book started out good. I liked Jude and had hope for Jude, but everything came apart and continued to get worse. I was crushed by the end. Not something to read for encouragement."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This is classic Thomas Hardy--a likeable hero allows himself to be ruined by the opposite sex and the hard realities of life written in very descriptive, poetic language of bygone years. Jude, the hero, is a very humane, decent sort of man who although poor, aspires to become educated and enter the priesthood. He is self-taught and disciplined and seems to be well on the way to achieving his goals at the college when he meets a crude pig farmer girl and becomes intimate with her. She tricks him into marriage and immediately they have major problems and part. Jude then sets out for college only to meet his cousin and erstwhile soul mate, Sue. Sue is quite a character, a bizarre mixture of feminist, scholar, teacher, flirt, rebel, and self-absorbed fool. She is on an emotional roller coaster and takes Jude with her. She toys with Jude's affection and that of an older school master, leading them both on although she is repulsed by physical contact. She marries the schoolmaster only to suddenly want Jude back and leaves her husband. She and Jude then begin an unmarried life together and produce children, as well as taking in Jude's son by his wife. Their life is full of problems and ends with a tragedy involving the children. Through it all Jude remains a likeable, moral character of sorts who tries to accept his lot in life and shoulder responsibility, only to be dashed down again and again.I could not help to like Jude, as I also liked Tess in Hardy's other similar novel. Jude is hurt by his propensity for the wrong women as Tess was hurt by men of low morals. I found myself getting annoyed by his love for selfish Sue and hoping he would get away from her before it was too late.This is a dark, despairing kind of novel, stark in its realism about human nature and the consequences of wrong choices and going against the norms of society. Yet, it is a good read and is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obcure is really a book about life. It involves Jude's search for happiness. Of course, he never quite achieves happiness because something is always in the way-preventing him from being happy. He starts out as a young lad living with his working-class aunt, dreaming that one day he may study at Christminster. The problem is as he grows he falls in love with a devilish girl named Arabella who tricks him into marrying her. Inevitably the marriage goes sour and he goes to Christminster, while she moves to Australia. Jude then meets his cousin Sue. He sets her up with Phillotson and they get married. Sue is then not happy and leaves to live with jude. As you can see this is really just a soap opera, but isn't life really just one big soap opera. Arabella then comes back to Jude with a son in Australia. Basically Jude feels responsibility to go back to Arabella and Sue goes back to Phillotson. Jude then dies soon after.It's quite interesting how Hardy devises his plot. It's quite a dark novel, filled with every character's problems. Through this book we see that what society thinks is the right thing to do isn't always best for everyone. The climax of the book is a horrifying murder-suicide of Jude's children. This is no doubt a book that makes you think about the psychological aspect of life. It's a good read if you like the fact that none of the problems actually get resolved and trying to solve problems only makes new ones."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"The story is such that you feel that the tragedies and the emotions he depicts are always possible even if they are to the extremes. Love between Jude and Sue is looked down upon but this story has evolved beautifully on this love. I bet Hardy was criticised in his time although now people get to enjoy this story."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Spend the whole book feeling sorry for Jude, if that was the goal of the author fine, but never really got to the point that I could recommend this to others, sorry. Just left me flat."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure is the last novel written by Thomas Hardy, about a young stone craftsman (Jude) living in Wessex, England, who dreams of studying at Oxford University and for that purpose moves to the town. But he cannot afford to pay tuition and is turned away. In the meantime, he is seduced by an earthy barmaid (Arabella) into a disastrous marriage. He then falls in love with his cousin, the sexless intellectual rebel (Sue) who is already married to his former teacher (Phillotson). Jude and Sue run away together and try to form a life, but it's plain that they are doomed.From start to finish, the novel is imbued with foreboding, doom, and human weakness. Hardly a light of humorous moment is to be found. Although it was written in the 1890s, there is barely a hint of modernity. It may well have taken places in the 1700s or even 1600s. Harding attempts to critique the Victorian conservative morals of his day, strictly interpreting marriage, as well as its class stratification denying advancement to Jude. To fit his tragedy, he must create numerous partial, incomplete characters, including a frightening little boy known as \\"Father Time\\" who seems more like a zombie than a person.Hardy's passionate invective against Victorianism was clearly needed, and before his time, given the harsh reaction to this book, which resulted in him being ostracized and banned from writing. But to the modern reader, it is utterly incomprehensible. The characters seem to fret and fro endlessly and bring themselves to tears over nothing. Because society has changed so much since the 1890s, the central drama and conflict of the novel no longer makes sense to the modern reader. A firm historical background in Victorian conventions is needed to be wholly understood before one can make sense of this book. Numerous references to English and Classical writers are also made which may be unfamiliar. In short, it is no longer relevant to to-day."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"If you fell that you are so happy and you are looking for something to put you in depression, this novel will be a good choice. It is about a guy (Jude) full of ambitions since his childhood and the through the pages, you will read that he lose them one by one. I don't know why I kept reading it to the last page, maybe it was some commitment as I purchased the book. I read the novel after that I couldn't understand totally some events occurred in the last edition of movie for the novel. I am looking now for a comedy novel to relief me from pain of depression caused by this story."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure is a depressing book. Thomas Hardy portrays the main character, Jude, as a man with no morals and no backbone. The novel is full of immorality, beginning when Arabella reveals she is pregnant just to get Jude to marry her. Later in the book, Jude and Sue live together and have children, but they do not marry. These instances highlight the immorality and wickedness portrayed in the novel. Another quality Jude possesses is the lack of a backbone. He lets women run over him and tell him what to do. They also trick him and lie to him.Another thing I do not like about this book are the characters in general. None of them seem to have any redeeming qualities. There is no character that I liked. Each character has many evil things about him or her, and they lack positive traits. Arabella can be described as a \\"woman of the world\\" without feelings and sympathy. Sue appears at first to be a good, moral person, but she turns out to play with Jude's thoughts. Jude is just a miserable man who lacks courage.This book is full of tragedy and misery. It is inevitable the reader will feel sorry for Jude. I caught myself saying \\"Awww, poor Jude\\" many times throughout the novel. Then at times I would remember he brought much of the tragedy on by his own actions.Hardy's attitude to his novel is unclear. When reading the book, we are taken through Jude's life, and we witness many things that seem to only affect Jude. Even though we are allowed to enter into the consciousness of the other characters, their motivation seems based on selfishness. The book is full of lies and deceptions. There is no serenity, peace, or understanding in the novel. It seems like the world is moving so fast, and when Jude attempts to comprehend what is going on, he is left behind.Love has the power to create suffering or happiness. In this book, the tension of the love relationship is increased when a third party comes into the picture. Without the presence of Phillotson, Jude and Sue's relationship may have been quite simpler. She may have seen marrying Jude as the right thing to do. They could have gotten married and could have been a happy couple. Hardy did not let this happen; he chose to leave the reader with the dark view of love.The only thing that redeems this book in any way is one of the themes it contains. This is the marriage theme, which is ambiguous in the novel. One could suppose Hardy's view of marriage is one of abhorrence. This may be because of Jude's cynical view of the issue. On the other hand, marriage can also be seen as a good thing because if Jude would have gotten married for the right reasons and if he really wanted to, he would not have married Arabella in the first place. Plus, great tragedy comes from the decision not to marry Sue, but to live with her and pretend they were married. I agree with the second view of marriage. I like how Hardy leaves it up to the reader to decide which view he has of marriage. This is probably the only thing I like about the book."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"After finishing Jude the Obscure, the reader is left with many questions that ask how Jude's life could have gone so haywire. He is caught in a love triangle with two unstable women, who ultimately keep him from his life-long dream, of receiving an education in the town of Christminster. He finally comes together with the woman he truly loves, yet she constantly pushes him away, not ready to give him her entire heart in return. One of Hardy's themes in Jude the Obscure, is that of love, but the primary focus and theme in the book is on marriage.Jude marries the trampy Arabella in his early 20's. She is in an even lower social class than he is and doesn't understand or care about Jude's educational goals in Christminster. Their relationship is mainly based on physical attraction and is void of any real commitment and mutual respect. Arabella leaves Jude, fleeing to Australia, leaving Jude the opportunity to set his sights on Christminster.In Christminster, Jude falls madly in love with Sue, his cousin and a schoolteacher. Sue resists Jude's affection at first, and marries Phillston, as a way to boost her education and career. Her marriage to Phillston is miserable. Sue is completely repulsed by him, and refuses to even sleep in the same quarters. Phillston grants Sue the option to leave and they divorce. Jude's divorce with Arabella is also finalized, thus leaving Sue and Jude free to marry. Yet they never do.The town is very judgmental and unaccepting of Jude's and Sue's relationship, especially when they have two children out of wedlock. At around this time, Arabella comes crawling back to Jude and says that they have a son. So, Jude and Sue then take his son in their care, while Arabella runs off again. Father Time, Jude's son, is very insecure and disturbed. In his situation, what kid wouldn't be? Yet, Jude and Sue fail to realize the extent of his depression and insanity.Sue walks into the house one morning, to find that Father Time has hanged their two children as well as himself. This horrific event makes Sue believe that her relationship with Jude is cursed and that the deaths of their children was a punishment from God. To do penance for her immoral behavior, Sue leaves Jude and goes back to Phillston, believing she doesn't have a right to be happy. Jude returns to Arabella, becomes sick and dies, heartbroken.Hardy obviously isn't a fan of the instiution of marriage and makes that clear in Jude the Obscure. Marriage is a trap for both Jude and Sue. Perhaps it was Sue's horrible marriage with Phillston that made her so reluctant and unwilling to marry Jude. In the end, both felt tied down to their previous spouses and forced to return to their own unhappy marriages.I really didn't like this book, perhaps I'm somewhat an idealist and believe that Jude and Sue could have gotten their lives together, as a couple. Jude is such a pushover. He never really stands up for himself, or does what he wants. His life is run by two unstable women, who never think much about anyone else but themselves. If you like tragedies, you'll love Jude the Obscure, which is a series of tragedies one right after the other."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Probably a book best read in the depths of a deep and dark winter - I found it way too depressing. Although I can enjoy 'bleak' as much as the next man, this book just does not do 'bleak' well (try Patrick White for that). It is simply dull and depressing. By way of example, the character development is poor, surprising for quite a long book - the major characters never emerge much beyond cardboard cut-outs, set in variations of their unconventional ways. Honestly, I found myself wanting to slap them with a \\"get over yourselves!\\" Hardy's prose does take you to the time and place, however many other authors \\"do the nineteenth century\\" better (Dickens, Eliot, Gaskell). And far too much of the dialogue in this book was tedious and unrealistic.In terms of themes, Hardy has a bit of a rant over the hypocrisy of established religion, the inaccessible ivory towers of tertiary education and the stigma of non-conforming - but really, most of the troubles experienced by the characters seem self-inflicted or exacerbated by their shallow, self-destructive natures, which detracts from the points Hardy was presumably trying to make. Unfortunately, for me, this book does not resonate. I will try another Hardy, as I expect this book may not have been one of his better efforts - certainly not in the realms of great literature as claimed by some reviewers. I suggest readers try Silas Marner as a much more effective piece in the 'self-effacing man' genre.For Kindle users - the book format was fine, presumably the problems noted by previous reviewers have been fixed."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure is a novel typical of those written in its time period in England. When I had read fifteen pages into the first chapter, I turned to the title page to see the date-1895. That's correct, this is the time period of The Scarlet Letter fame. For those who are unfamiliar with The Scarlet Letter, it was written in the mid-1850s. The Scarlet Letter would have made an excellent short story of about twenty-five to thirty pages. It made for an extremely dry, slow novel. Jude the Obscure impressed me immediately as following after the same tradition. The difference: Jude the Obscure is twice the length.Remarkably, however, Thomas Hardy manages to salvage his style. Before too long, I was actually drawn into the tragic story of Jude. He began as a character I could closely identify with. He was born into a working-class family, and he had lofty dreams of a life of distinguished intellectual greatness. He taught himself almost everything that he knew of higher learning, and planned to move to a place where he could be formally trained.Of course, none of this works out; otherwise, it wouldn't be much of a story. To cut it short, Jude fell in love with Arabella (whom he met when she threw pig parts at him), got her pregnant, and gave up his childhood dreams for a marriage with her. After all, Jude says, \\"it was better to love a woman than to be a graduate, or a parson; ay, or a Pope!\\" The remainder of Jude is largely a recounting of his tragic sexual and marital relations with his cousin Sue and later, with Arabella again.It is difficult for me to sympathize with the pathetic Jude or even credit him as a character by the end of the story. Here is a man who is so determined that he teaches himself languages; he studies tirelessly in an effort to prepare for university. His character is strong. Yet in a matter of weeks he decides that he doesn't care anymore. I've seen men distracted by women before, but he wholeheartedly dumped his dreams and ambitions in favor of a pretty woman with a pig bladder. From there he proceeds rapidly downhill for 350 pages, personifying every possible malfunction of marriage.This malfunctioning marriage seems to be the sole unifying theme of Jude. Yet it is difficult to put a finger on just what Hardy is trying to say with his story. If he were trying to display all of the shortcomings of marriage, why would Sue, who self-righteously opposed marriage as an unnecessarily binding bunch of paperwork, wind up back sharing a bed with her first husband? If he were using the trouble that came to Sue and Jude by trying to live out of wedlock as a tool to show the power and security of real marriage, why is Sue portrayed as being so unhappy to return to Phillotson, her first husband?All in all, Jude the Obscure was just not my kind of book. I visited the local paperback exchange a week ago and picked up a few novels by Isaac Asimov. In the author's note, Asimov stated what has become an inspiration to me in my writing (many will recognize this as similar to a famous saying by Twain):\\"I made up my mind long ago to follow one cardinal rule in all my writing-to be clear. I have given up all thought of writing poetically or symbolically or experimentally, or in any of the other modes that might (if I were good enough) get me a Pulitzer Prize. I would write merely clearly and in this way establish a warm relationship between myself and my readers, and the professional critics- Well, they can do whatever they wish.\\"If only Thomas Hardy could make up his mind on what he wants to say and say it, I think we could all be spared an incredible and thought-stifling novel."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"thomas harding's overly descriptive writing style backfired in this would be entertaining novel. hardy should've realized that the harsh reception of the novel by the public was probably more because it's boring than because of the controversial text. hardy ruined a perfectly good plot with excessive description and annoying detail."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure is a tale of a young orphan boy who has a perfect picture of his future painted. Being an orphan, he has very little going for him. He is not shown affection by anyone, especially his caretaker-his great aunt. He is constantly being chastised for the way he lives his life. Because there is not a single significant influence at home, Jude looks elsewhere for guidance and direction. He finds this positive influence in his school teacher, Mr. Phillotson. Jude sees good and potential in this school teacher, and wants to emulate him to the best of his ability. However, Jude comes face to face with his major weak point... a woman. Upon encountering Arabella the pig killer, Jude almost instantly forgets his aspirations of attending Christminster to gain an education and instead decides to marry Arabella.After having sacrificed time, money, and his dream of school, Arabella decides that she is going to leave Jude and move on with life. After drinking away his problems, Jude finally decides to move on and try to accomplish his dream of a Christminster education. It is in this town that Jude finds and falls in love with his cousin Sue. Upon befriending Sue, Jude takes a walk with her to find his old mentor and see how he has fared over the years. During their discussion with Mr. Phillotson, Sue is drawn to him, because he is able to teach her how to be a teacher. Jude worries about this, but has few options. Eventually Mr. Phillotson courts Sue and they are wed. Once again Jude is thrown into a fit of depression and drinking. Eventually Sue grows tired of Phillotson that she pursues Jude. However, staying true to the theme of the book, as soon as you have the person you love, you instantly fall out of love with them-and this happens to Sue.This book is story of more than love, marriage, and the problems associated with each. This book has a deeper meaning that Hardy means to convey. It is a story of life in general. Although love is the underlying theme, there are more problems addressed in the book. Those that have a worthwhile goal in life are rarely able to accomplish their dreams, and even when they do, they aren't happy as they envisioned they would be. This book is one of depression and failure. Somehow Hardy is able to make the worst-case scenario out of nearly every situation. A good read, but there are more uplifting stories out there if that is what the reader is looking for."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"A thought provoking book about the troubles of life in the real world (especially regarding marriage), Thomas Hardy's \\"Jude the Obscure\\" is a worthwhile read. The story is quite good in its own right, though I thought the end to be too abrupt and a little too cynical. I have never in any of Hardy's writings, however, known him to end on a happy note.The book begins with Jude's childhood, when his schoolmaster leaves their small town for the city of Christminster, a college town renowned for learning, where the schoolmaster hopes to become a student. The boy Jude soon resolves to follow his schoolmaster, and obtaining several texts on Greek and Latin (the languages spoken in the colleges of Christminster), he begins his studies with a feverish fascination. As he gains proficiency in these languages and as he slowly obtains books, he expands his studies. Then one day when he is a young man apprenticed to become a stonemason, he meets a young woman named Arabella, who convinces him that he loves her. They have a romantic relationship until Arabella tells Jude that she thinks that she is pregnant. Being honorable, he marries her for the sake of the child, but there is no child after all, and Jude is married to a girl that he soon discovers that he does not love. She makes him neglect the studies he holds so dear and soon they both begin to be quite miserable. Finally, she asks Jude to let her leave him, which he consents to. She moves to Australia and he to Christminster, where he meets another woman who captures his heart. Sue is his lasting love, and though she is his cousin (they had never before met), they fall in love.The book is ultimately one focused around romances. First, there is Jude's romantic and unrealistic dream of going to the city of Christminster and becoming a scholar. And secondly, there is his romance with Sue, a young, intelligent, and independent woman. The first question Hardy asks deals with the first romance and goes something like this: \\"Why does social position stop a man that is otherwise eminently qualified from achieving his dreams?\\" And the second question is \\"Is it better to remain unmarried-always in the state of a lover, giving rather than expecting anything from your companion, or is it better to be married, bound to each other for all of life in order to gain acceptance of men?\\" Jude and Sue are constantly frustrated by the society they dwell in as they try to live out their very unconventional lives together in peace and happiness, taking care to harm no one.The book is very well written, and I enjoyed it more than \\"Tess of the D'Ubervilles,\\" another book that I have read that was written by Hardy. I'd recommend this book for deep thinkers and people not afraid of a disappointing ending. Jude and Sue's unconventionality causes you to question what you once held for granted. A careful analysis of those institutions seems necessary after reading \\"Jude the Obscure.\\" I hold that to be one of this novel's greatest values within the world of literature."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"As soon as Thomas Hardy was named as the author, I knew that it was bound to be depressing. However, for a depressing novel, it was quite powerful. Its power lies in the prose laden with Biblical allusions, the contrasting characters of Sue and Arabella and in the universal truths about the thoughts of women and men that it brings to the surface.Hardy is a very eloquent writer. His passages of prose are always meaningful.One of the reasons that his prose in Jude the Obscure is so powerful is because of the allusions that Hardy makes. This book is essentially arguing against the organized religions of his day, but he does it with beautiful Christian allusions. He compares his characters to Christian characters that have done and had similar experiences. It weaves the two books together so that it almost seems that Hardy's characters are really these good Christian people and that the people who belong to the organized Christian church are far removed from the real point of the Bible. His references to the Bible give the text new levels of meaning that simply stating what the character felt like would not have done.Another way that Hardy made his message more powerful was through the use of foiling two characters, Sue and Arabella. They both misuse the protagonist, Jude. Although they are quite different in their backgrounds and mannerisms, they both have the same personality flaws, such as selfishness. Because Hardy made them seem really different from the outset, it makes it all the more noticeable when they start to mistreat Jude in the same way. It is through Hardy's use of devices such as foiling in order to point out character flaws of two totally different women that he is able to point at some fundamental truths about women and men.He foils Sue and Arabella to show some of the defects of women, but he also compares Jude to Phillotson to point out the flaws of the male sex. This was the most intriguing factor in the book to me. There were many times when I would see some of my actions right there before me on the page with a nineteenth century twist. It really didn't feel like Hardy had just written this book in the nineteenth century because there were so many universal truths. But since I knew that he had written it a long time ago it convinced me all the more that what I saw in Hardy's characters that was also in me must be a trait possessed to me degree by all women in all ages. Hardy understood men's and women's timeless character traits well enough that he could create somewhat realistic characters for us to see ourselves in them.Jude the Obscure is worth while if you are interested in exploring the unconventional views of organized religion in the nineteenth century. It is also worth reading for anyone seeking insights into the mind of the opposite sex or why the sex you belong to behaves the way they do."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This tragic book brings forth issues relating to class, love, and marriage. Hardy illustrates the ties they have to one another and the different ways they trap individuals. In the early stages of his life, being in a lower class sets the stage for the traps that Jude will find himself in through out his life. He is limited in the things that he can do, but still he continues to have a goal reaching towards an education, even though it is next to impossible. The desire and the potential preside in him, but the situations he encounters quickly throw his dreams of gaining an education aside. The class barrier once again blocks his path when he falls in love with Sue. At first she marries another as a way to get ahead socially in life. After suffering through that marriage, she turns to Jude. The two never marry and the people of the town find their relationship to be inappropriate, and that situation doesn't better its self after Sue bears two children. The social class barriers that prevail during this time period trap Jude and don't allow him to move on and find the life that he searches for.Jude struggles with relationships and marriage all the way through this book. His affections and marriage to Arabella never have a chance of working because they only touch the surface of true emotion. Arabella's social status is even lower than Jude's so she only marries into a higher social class to benefit herself. There is no true affection, and that results only in misery. His relationship with Sue has the potential to be a great one. But, there are many factors that lead to the deterioration of their relationship. When Arabella returns claiming that Jude has a son that begins to tear apart the relationship that has already been ridiculed by the town people. The attempts to keep their relationship are shattered by the murder and suicide of all Jude's children. Sue leaves Jude and returns to her ex-husband to live out her life in misery and sorrow. Jude's life is ultimately run by these relationships and keeps him trapped until his death.Although I have never read Hardy before, it seems as if his views on marriage are very negative. Every single marriage in the book falls to pieces. None of the characters seem to realize the divinity in marriage. Marriage is just a thing that people do. It's a social trap. At one point in the book Arabella compares her ring to a padlock. From this work it shows that Hardy doesn't even believes that marriage works. None of the characters marry for love; they all marry for social reasons. The thought of giving yourself for the relationship and to build it, never even crosses their minds. I wonder if this same theme crosses over into other of Hardy's works. The never ending mishaps in this book frustrate me. In some ways I felt sympathy for Jude because he couldn't release himself from the women that in a sense hold him captive. But in the end Jude the Obscure is a great tragic tale of a man that never gets the courage to stand up for himself and get what he wants."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Hardy wrote Jude the Obscure at the height of his career. Does the book reflect his mastery? Or does it fall short of his capability? At the time of its publication, Jude (like Tess) received critical admonition from the public: The blatant sexuality and the unfulfilled/unheroic main character won over fanatics and made enemies of literary elites.I picked up this book out of boredom, believing I'd put it down after a few pages. I enjoyed Tess from High School, but Jude for leisure? I was wrong: Hardy's poetic melancholy and rythmic cadence drew me in yet again. I was mesmerized by Jude, Arabella, and Sue. Though their conversations seem forced and some of their characterics unnatural, I felt sympathy for their deterioration and sadness. And in my feeling this, Hardy has accomplished a great poetic influence.I really believe that Hardy could have written a greater Jude the Obscure if he was unhindered by the public. Though his true passion lay in poetry, he had much potential in prose. Too bad this was his last novel..."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"A very good book.It is shocking and disgusting but that is the beauty of the book.The initial part seems like another story of ambition but the twists in the plot shocks you.I started the book thinking it would be another mediveal romance like Hardy's Tess of d'uberviles or Far from the madding crowd but....In fact it is a good book for anyone.Even for those who are quite familiar with the mediveal stereotyped plots, the book is a releif.It is surprising that the book is not so much discussed as many others which are said to be surrealistic.Though the plot is not at all surrealistic, the story would sent us to a sort of frenzy by its sheer twists showing us how irrational rationality can be.It is a must read for anyone intrested in serious literature.Whatever be the contentions against the work , it acts as a link to the Victorian era .Not just the story but the reactions to the book, seen in the victorian era is quite enlightening about the life and times then.Hardy is different here.So a Hardy enthusiast should read this book to get to know another face of the author.The book must be approached with caution and certain level of academic intrest and knowledge about the era.Only then a reader can appreciate the work to its fullest.On the academic viewpoint , i would say on a personal note that even for a non-english, non-european and non-litearture student the book went a long way in giving a glimpse of the life and times of an era and aroused my intrests.Thomas hardy pulls me towards England - to see the great cathredals, to walk throught the moors, to see the rural England. Of course i dont hope to the see the same England that he saw but i can see it through his words and that is enough for me.Probably once i visit, who knows, my dreams might be shattered...."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This has been one of my very favorite books since I was about thirteen... and every time I read it, I still get the same feeling from it. It's very tragically written, in classic Hardy style, where nothing will ever work out as it should... but despite that, you find yourself hoping that it will, even though the doom of the well-written charachters is inevitable. Jude Fawley is a very well-developed charachter, and you don't forget him any time soon. A good read, for perhaps early highschool and older."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"We see women of type &quot;Sue&quot; all time but we never can understand them as was potrayed in the book. They are caught between moral and desire. They endup doing what they never desired and suffers in the end. Unfortunately, they are given much higher tolerance to suffer and take pains to the level of absurdity. We men like &quot;jude&quot; find them totally irrational creature and can never understand them. Hardy's heroines always in some sense provoke the desire to understand them. Hardy is as usual The Best."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I had to put the book down 3/4 of the way through. It was so...........SAD. Finally, I finished. AT the same time that I was really intrigued, I was really glad it was over. I haven't read Hardy for so long. It was a welcome return."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"The issues of marriage, children, passions and revelations of the ordinary dominate this detailed and gripping novel.Hardy's tragic novel leads the reader along the lives of the main character, Jude, and his lover, Sue so well that it's a small wonder that this book hadn't been made into a feature film before this year. This is a book of longing for dreams, but finding only stark reality again and again. Though this point may not be a happy one, Hardy's concern for his characters and their settings make this book impossible for the reader to set down for any length of time. A must read."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Thomas Hardy has accomplished a miracle with this novel. He has written a novel equal in the strength of the ideas, the beauty of the writing, and the compelling nature of the story. If he had only done one of the three well, the book would be worth reading, but having done all three so beautifully has resulted in a masterpiece.I first read Jude about 10 years ago and recently re-read it. I was even more delighted after reading it again, and plan to read it a third time.Some of my literary compatriots have been put-off by what they characterize as stiff language in Hardy in general and Jude in particular, but I would encourage anyone to persevere...after a few chapters, it wears-off and then you will thoroughly enjoy the reading!"},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Thomas Hardy... I wonder what his life must have been like in order for him to write such a tragic book. For those considering it, this book is a romantic tragedy of the highest degree. If your looking for a happily ever after, look elsewhere. But if your looking to run the gamut of human experience in books, this is one you will want to take up, I've never read a book that has taken such a sentimental turn for the worse than this. I hope this helps."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This is a sad book! Going through it, you can't help but feel sorry for Jude. He tries so hard and seems to fail at everything he's ever wanted. He's never really had any adult role models when he was growing up. This has made him vulnerable to the ploys of people like Arabella who tricks him into marriage twice. As for Sue, although he considers her the love of his life, you cannot help but wonder how she truely feels about him.All the females in this book are so flawed in so many ways. Arabella is the master manipulator as for Sue, she has some quite peculiar theories and ideas. Sometimes it makes them irritating.It's pretty sad and almost heartbreaking to see this man give up so much of himself for his love and to suffer so much for it."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Hardy's last novel before public indignation forced him to give up book writing (for poetry) really uses passion as a destructive force. As he takes his most likable male character in Jude and basically ruins him against his 2 least enjoyable female leads in Arabell and Sue. Sue more than anything is infuriatingly fickle and will either make you yell at the book or wish for her early exit. She's a real struggle to cozy up to and yet she becomes the voice for Hardy to express his disgust with social conventions and public morality and what is right and what isn't. etc... Probably contains his harshest plot twists. And as well, his most damning indictments against a rigid world dominated by rules and tradition. Jude is at once trapped and alive with his choices but eventually even his last ounce of love for Sue does him in. Since she's enough to drive even a saint to madness. Hardy really made her as exasperating as possible. Jude becomes a brave soul just for putting up with her... Each chapter takes place in a different location, perhaps to symbolize the characters' indecision. The more than unstable ones who can't seem to make up their minds. PS: a pig killing sequence is especially disturbing."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I've read all of Thomas Hardy's novels, and Jude is my favorite, followed closely by The Mayor of CasterBridge. I love Hardy's details; he almost always uses symbolism in his character and place names. Did you know Jude is the smallest book in the Bible? Well it is, and accordingly, Jude is a diminuitive character from appearances. Hardy's complex views on marriage and relationships really stood out to me in this novel.Above all, Jude values education's enlightenment, not just a degree. But the fool marries Arabella (for impatient, youthful lust), a worldly woman who could care less about Jude's unpractical philosophy. He, in turn, abhors her family's pig slaughtering business. Eventually, she runs away.Over time, Jude comes to know and love Sue Bridehead. She is an intelligent teacher whose love is mutual, but she refuses to marry him. First of all, he never officially got divorced from Arabella, and secondly, she is superstitious. Both have a history of luckless marriages in their family histories (they are cousins). Eventually they come to the decision that since they are morally upright, they can be married without the formalities. They have three children. All goes ok for a time.Then Arabella comes back with a child, Jude's child. She cannot keep him. This child is barely older than the other three and severely depressed. The child does not understand why people have children in such a cruel world. I won't tell you the ending, but be assured it ends in the worst possible way. I love the novel anyways; it has artistic integrity. The final collapse of Judes relationships is a moment of 'pathetic catharsis.' Catharsis is always associated with tragedy (Greek, ie - Oedipus), but I think Hardy actually pulls it off in this pathos story. Catharsis is a brief moment of intense grief that causes the reader to pause, to learn.Morals in the story: Don't get married too quickly; use your head. Also, marriage requires formalities to protect us from the world's cruel darts. It doesn't matter how upright you are; environmental chaos will try to destroy you anyways. That's why Hardy saw the need to have marriage promises formalized. We should not think that we're so strong when we don't know the future's misfortune."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure, is rather compelling, but not a book you can't put down. Where its grip on the reader lacks, its attacks on a repressive social structure dedicated to conforming to religion make the story applicable to any time and place.Jude, the main character, begins his life as a lower class boy with aspirations to become a great scholar in the illustrious universities of Christminster. Jude puts his heart and soul into a dream he believes attainable, but society and his vices derail him. Hardy shows even an honorable high hoping young man cannot reach the heights of society unless he conforms to its traditions and obligations.Marriage is the example that demonstrates the main characters obligations to society. Jude can't pursue an academic career because of his requirement to please society by marrying Arabella. Jude and Sue are unable to pursue their truest desires because society thwarts them due to their unconventional relationship. The story seems to attack marriage, as none who impart in it are happy, but Hardy is really trying to say that it is society's regard and adherence to tradition that only allows for a mainstream view of life. Society would rather have a man and woman living miserably under marriage vows than living happily but unconventionally in a stable but unmarried family. It is society's harsh judgment that ruins people; not marriage.The book starts off with some sensual action and then moves a bit more slowly as it delves into the interplay between characters that exemplifies the books theme. The pace finally picks up again as the events at the end of the book become more feverish and intense.Overall, the book compresses the reader as he feels the graveness of society's judgment upon unconventionality. It is also intriguing to see the characters fight for what they believe is right despite society's heavy hand upon them."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Before reading Jude the Obscure I had read Tess of the D'ubervilles. Being pretty young, the writing style of Hardy was a little bit hard to follow and I floundered during so many inferred scenes of the book. i.e.when Tess all of a sudden just has a baby. I think that was freshmen year in High school the first time, but I have since read it again, and along with Jude, I quite enjoyed it. I learned to love the scenes that made you infer, or guess. I love his language and it is beautiful to know that almost every person, every thing and place has significance and has been thought about.As morbid and sad as Jude may have been, I thought it was an amazing book. Hardy makes you think long and hard after he hits you tragedy and fate. It seems that Tess and Jude could be brother and sister books, there were so many characters and ideas that paralelled, which made Jude so much more interesting to read. I think one of my favorite parts of the books is the fact that although a lot happens from start to finish, it is the simple emotions and lives that make the story. I like thinking about symbols like the pig in Jude and the birds in Tess, it is also amazing to me how Hardy can bring everything back together through these symbols. On page 386 Arabella says, \\"You couldn't kill the pig, but you could kill me.\\" I like how consistent Hardy is in his meaning behind symbols, and also how reliable it is to know that every cities name and every characters name has been thought over and has meaning to the story.When I finished Jude, I wasn't quite sure what to think. The results were so extreme and tragic, that it was hard to place the exact meaning. I think though, what I got from it was the difference between true love and lust, also the debate between fate and choice, not to mention, what the book said about education, religion, marriage, and society. For my own sake of sorting things out, I'll go through each of these and what I understood of them. Education; Jude's education and love of knowledge seemed to be a constant thing that he strived for. He dreamt about Christminister, and when he finally got there, he was told he shouldn't be there, yet through his entire life he never gave up on the idea of education and books, he ended up dying in the city he loved, and on his last walk through the town he saw the men he'd always wanted to be, their spirits were laughing at him. Next, religion, there was not nearly as much written about God and religion in Jude as there was in Tess, but there was still many conotations to it. It seems that many of he and Sue's defining moments take place in a chapel. There is also the characters directly related to religion, Mr. Phillotson, and the name Jude is the name of a saint. I've run out of time, but I loved the book, I love to read Thomas Hardy. I cannot even begin to imagine putting together so many characters and situations and ideas into such beautiful words and images."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This novel renewed my fascination with the written word. Hardy's prose has a uniquely akward elegance, his characters truly live within the text, and the story grips us and keeps us up at night. Horrifying and invigorating at once, it kept me dreaming of certain possibilities dreamed of one hundred years ago, and still yet to be realized.A comparison to Tess can reveal a great deal about the past fifteen years in American culture, considering the fact that Jude has begun to overshadow Tess in the eyes of social critics as Hardy's greatest contribution. After reading these two novels, I believe they show us how far we've travelled in terms of gender equality: just as far as we had travelled one hundred years ago. Jude's new-found popularity shows our own subtle shift from a culture failing to recognize the plight of the victimized woman, to one underhandedly rejecting the emergence of the outspoken, independent, &quot;modern&quot; woman. More than that, these books remind us of exactly who suffers in the wake of our obstinance.In its time, this novel was one of the few in history to affect real social change. It was the sited inspiration for the re-organization of the English Public Education system. Unfortunately, not all of the ills of society can be cured with fiction. We're still working on some of them, Tom. Please have patience."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"In &quot;Jude the Obscure,&quot; Thomas Hardy masterfully balances his narrative between an incisive criticism of many of England's entrenched cultural institutions and a thoughtful portrait of the &quot;love square&quot; of Jude, Arabella, Sue, and Phillotson. Instead of being a bleak work of social realism in which each character is grotesquely locked into his or her social milieu, &quot;Jude's&quot; characters are passionate and articulate, despite the conditions that plague them. Additionally, Hardy does not offer the reader a mere snapshot of his characters' lives: each main character matures and struggles with his or her beliefs, thereby developing a vitality, which, again, I feel is unique for a novel that addresses such a breadth of social issues, from education, to alcoholism, to the conventions of marriage, to the sense of being thrown into the world. One of the best novels I have read in a while, &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot; has a mature, balanced vision that can be appreciated from a variety of perspectives, each reading possessing a singular fullness."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This book, as I'm sure you have heard by now, is unbelievably sad. Yet, it lures you into its spell and keeps you connected to the characters, though what each of them go through is horrible. For, within this sad, miserable love story, is a beautifully poetic tragedy. Perhaps the way it's written is what makes me think so. I love the classic Greek tragedys, myths, and legends, and from what I have read, Hardy was influenced by these same things. In any case, it captured me. It has the fable-like magic of &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles,&quot; while still holding its own as a unique work.I love this book and the author who wrote it. He had a great talent for cutting the excess and presenting a simple picture of life's complex situations."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Supposedly, this book was burned by the Bishop of Wakefield when it was first released, and Hardy's wife was furious at him because people would think it was autobiographical. The response to the book was the final nail in the coffin that caused Hardy to stop writing novels.Jude Hawley is born into a changing world-- a world that's changed enough that a poor boy can dream about a university eduction and a professional future. However, it hadn't changed enough for that dream to yet be realizable. Hawley instead is entrapped into a hasty marriage and sacrifices his dreams of further education. Even after the marriage is dissolved by the wife removing herself to Australia, Jude continues to be haunted for the rest of his life by his early mistake-- dooming himself and his true love to a lifetime of misery.The book is bleak. The characters (Jude and Sue, primarily) can't live with the choices that law and religion demands, but they can't live outside them either and their attempts to do so only drive them down deeper. The central thesis of the book, and the one that was so shocking a the time, was that these moral and legal strictures prevented people from fulfilling their dreams and living happy lives. Jude the Obscure challenges the sanctity of marriage by building a tragedy about people trapped by its convention.An important and challenging book. It continues to be relevant today."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Ready for four hundred pages of sparkle and sunshine? \\"Jude the Obscure\\" is about a group of people whose every hope and dream is gradually crushed to a fine powder and blown away by the winds of despair. Hardy is his usual unforgiving self in this grim, discomforting tale of educational goals thwarted, marital bliss destroyed, childhood innocence corrupted, and spiritual redemption viciously mocked. Those who might suspect that this is a recent example of the current cultural debasement of family values would be amazed to know that this novel was written not in 1995 but in 1895. Upon its publication, Hardy was criticized for his pessimism when all he was did was herald the arrival of the pessimistic twentieth century.\\"Jude the Obscure\\" is not an indictment of education, marriage, family, or religion, but rather Hardy's bitter commentary on how society misuses these institutions to defend its shaky beliefs and practices. Jude Fawley, the title character and society's puppet, is a young man trying in vain to transcend his environment. A stonemason by trade, he dauntlessly studies Latin and Greek with the rigorous mind of a classical scholar in preparation for entering the ivy-covered Gothic halls of Christminster, a college town supposed to evoke Oxford. Two things stand in his way: He is too poor to afford the tuition, and he marries an ignorant farm girl named Arabella who discourages his academic aspirations.Separated from Arabella but still legally married, Jude begins a relationship with his pretty cousin, Sue Bridehead, after he moves to Christminster to be nearer his goal, supporting himself with various stonemasonry jobs. Sue marries Jude's former teacher, Richard Phillotson, many years her senior, also rejected by Christminster and now a local schoolmaster. When Phillotson realizes that Sue's heart belongs to Jude, he sorrowfully but graciously cuts her loose, whereupon she goes to live with her lover. The irony that Hardy emphasizes is that the two couples in the novel who were never meant to be--Jude and Arabella, and Phillotson and Sue--were the ones who married, while Jude and Sue, the only mutually happy couple, are unmarriageable to each other.Sue is the most interesting, and arguably the most tragic, figure in the novel. At first she appears to be a devout Christian, working in a shop that makes religious ornamentation; but she soon reveals herself to be as cynical as Jude is earnest, acknowledging that she and Jude are descendants of a fractured family for whom marriage seems not to be intended. However, towards the end of the novel her character is transformed by a misfortune so violent and sickening that it has the power to convince her that she is being punished for her sinful ways. A pious person would be probably cheered by choosing conventional morality after such an incident, but Sue, fearful of the wrath of a divine force she can't know or control, is only made more miserable by feeling pressured to accept the undesirable situation of living with her lawful husband.\\"Jude the Obscure,\\" even more so than Hardy's other famous novels, is swamped in loneliness, frustration, disillusion, anger, and hopelessness, all delivered by the relentless fist of fate, and it is exhausting to imagine the emotional abysses he would have had to plumb had he decided against all critical opposition to continue this avenue of his career. Hardy, like Jude an autodidact but unlike Jude a professional success nonetheless, is plaintive about a social system that prevents talented people of poverty from realizing their potential while requiring them to live holy lives. His response was to write a book that would shock the public, not to shame them, but into seeing what he saw."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"As are Hardy's other books, Jude the Obscure is not an &quot;easy read.&quot; Appreciating Hardy's work requires a little work and the ability to pay attention and to think a little along the way. But the effort pays off. Jude the Obscure is a great book about the human condition, at least as it exists for many people. Like other Hardy characters, Jude Fawley makes a mistake early in his life and continues to pay the price until the day he dies. He commits an act of folly that seals his doom, and nothing he can do can make it right. This would be merely sad or melodramatic were if not for the fact that Jude is a truly good man with truly good intentions. It is this that makes his story truly tragic. Not only is he trapped by the consequences of his early act of foolishness, but he is also trapped and eventually dragged down by the conventions of a society that is more concerned with status and class than with character and ability and more devoted to mindless tradition than to a considered morality. Most of what can be said of Jude also be said of his love, Sue Bridehead, although I found her to be a less believable and sympathetic character. I was surprised by the frankness with which Hardy deals with sexuality in 1895, and I can understand now the furor this book apparently caused in Britain and America upon publication. Hardy is a writer of great power and insight. He also knows how to build a great story. And he is a novelist of ideas. He has his faults, of course. At his worst, he is wordy, obscure, and pedantic. But at his best, he is one of the most emotionally moving of writers. At times his books flash briliantly with passion. At times, he is heartbreaking. Jude the Obscure is a novel that no lover of fine writing and a great story can afford to miss. The novel has haunted me for weeks since I read it, and it probably will for a long time."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Prior to reading Jude the Obscure, I had a smattering of knowledge about the religious uproar it caused upon publication, which led Hardy to abandon novels and focus merely on poetry. His work being denounced and burned by the churches, Hardy felt that if that was to be the treatment of his work, he would no longer produce the work.Now that I have read the novel, and having attempted to place myself in the mindset of the later 19th century morals and ideals, I can begin to understand why such an uproar was raised.First, the story...Jude Fawley, of poor and meager birth, aspires to academic greatness. When it is recommended to him that he stay on the 'blue collar' course he has begun, and not wish for more, he decides to educate himself, one day hoping that it will position him for greater things.Jude enters into a hasty marriage, which by later standards would be described as a 'shotgun' wedding, which he eventually comes to regret, and ends. Enter his cousin Sue, who becomes the love of his life. Sue also ends an unsatisfactory first marriage, freeing herself to be with Jude, whom she loves as well.What follows is a descent into tragedy and despair, with numerous twists and turns along the way. Not wanting to spoil them, I will not divulge.However, the remainder of the novel touches upon many, many themes that amounted to raising of the ire of the church in response. Divorce; childbirth out of wedlock; loss of faith in God; questioning religious ideals and teachings; all these and more are present in the latter half of the novel, and so much more.Upon finishing the book, I was left to question were these really Hardy's own feelings illustrated in his work, or simply a realization of a course of events for the characters, and not a reflection on the author's beliefs. That, however, bears further reading on the life of Thomas Hardy.Where I find fault with the novel is in the characters, and it is merely a distaste with their actions. Sue, the heroine, spends far too much time vacillating about her love for Jude and her desire to marry him. When Jude tries to do the right thing by Sue, and respect her wishes, she claims he has 'given up too easily, and doesn't seem at all disappointed'. Jude's first wife, Arabella, displays an utterly selfish, self-absorbed personality, and was, for me, unlikeble, and unsympathetic. Jude, a character capable of learning Latin and Greek and engaging in other scholarly pursuits, seems completely naive in the ways of the world, and further seems blinded by a sense of duty over a sense of the rights and wrongs of others. His actions make him appear to have no regard for himself, until the very end.Perhaps this is exactly as Hardy meant the characters to be seen, perhaps not. I did enjoy the book more than I expected to, and apparently more than others who have said to me \\"What on earth are you reading THAT for???\\". Hardy is not a comedy writer, and one should not expect a glamorous, cheerful, tidy ending, it does not exist here.While not the greatest of classic novels I have read, I can certainly see why this one has been discussed for over 100 years. While Dickens peppered his stories with levity to break up the gloom, Hardy continues on a downward spiral, leaving his characters in despair within and without. I recommend it to readers who enjoy a good characterization of later 19th century life in England. But if you are looking for something to put a smile on your face, Hardy might not be for you."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure, the last novel written by England's greatest novelist, is often called Thomas Hardy's masterpiece. I do not quite agree, but it is certainly in his top tier, which puts it with the all-time best novels. It is absolutely essential for fans of Hardy, English literature, or tragedy as well as anyone alive to art that is profoundly moving and deeply thought-provoking.Jude in many ways culminates Hardy's novelistic career, portraying several key themes and facets more clearly and fully than previously. The marriage institution had rarely fared well in Hardy, but this is his most devastating critique - nay, one of the most devastating of all-time. Hardy questions it on all fronts: historical, social, religious, and moral. He also thoroughly explores a wealth of related issues: sexuality, male/female relations, love, etc. Very few writers have written of love so movingly or honestly; Jude shows nearly every aspect - from euphoric first love to cynical bitterness - so vividly and emotionally that everyone will relate to one or more parts. All told, the love depiction is extremely bleak; Hardy has little hope for successful relations and generally portrays love itself as fundamentally destructive and lust even more so. They distract from what are really more important things and can even wreck dreams, which of course does not make it any more resistible - even if one knows it.This is the novel's most famous aspect, but it has a wealth of other important themes. Keeping its 1895 publication in mind is important, as it deals with many issues central to late Victorian society - mostly ones that few wanted to discuss or even admit existed. Hardy truly had his finger on the contemporary pulse, and his unorthodox views led to near-unbelievable controversy, which gives Jude great historical value. However, it is also universal in the best and truest sense. Many problems dramatized here are unfortunately still very real; even more sadly, most seem inherent to the human condition. Class problems are one of these - always important in Hardy but perhaps never so clearly. Hardy was an autodidact, as are many of his characters; he routinely shows just how hard it was for the poor to become educated, much less use education for advancement, even if they wanted it desperately. Jude explores this with great depth and subtlety, shedding much-needed light on a perennial social failing and many overlooked personal tragedies. The English education system itself is thus taken to task, as are self-proclaimed intellectuals. The novel also more than hints at what Hardy later called the Imminent Will - a blind force governing human fate. The characters seem to have very little or no control over their destiny, being prey to vast forces beyond their control. Hardy is often said to have an almost malevolent attitude toward characters, arranging chance and circumstances so that they do the most possible harm to essentially undeserving victims. This inevitably leads to very elaborate plots and heavy reliance on melodramatic coincidence, which some have always disliked. This is of course one's right, but those who think he could not plot without such things miss the point; he had a very dark view of life, lacked belief in a benevolent force overseeing humanity, and thought change and chance usually affected life for the worse. All this comes across very powerfully; Jude may have faults but is far more sinned against than sinning. Hardy has drawn him too specifically - and, some have always said, too autobiographically - for him to be an Everyman, but we identify with and have great sympathy for him because of his core frail humanity. What happens to him could happen to almost anyone, making his story all the more believable and thus all the more tragically affecting.As all this suggests, Jude is very modern; most of Hardy's views were very advanced, and the novel was on the very cutting edge of late Victorian ethics, philosophy, and theology. The marriage issue of course takes on a central church issue directly, but the discerning will see more fundamental religious criticism. Though he almost never gets credit, Hardy was a proto-existentialist, consistently dramatizing the intellectual and moral consequences of living in the modern, post-religion world. Jude shows just how black that world can be and vibrantly conveys the profound changes that were even then transforming every aspect of it. Hardy's work is well-known for showing modernity's ache - how rapid advancement in everything from technology to religion was quickly making obsolete a rural agricultural society that had been virtually unchanged for a thousand years. Like much of Hardy's work, Jude is partly set in Wessex - a part-real, part-dream setting based on his native Southwest England. Perhaps no one equals him at making place so important that it is integral to the story, and setting is never mere background with him. The lush, minutely described rural landscapes are as compelling as ever, but Jude is unique in being substantially set in Christminster - a relatively large town, based on Oxford, outside Wessex proper. Oxfordians have long been fascinated by Hardy's depiction; he did much on the spot research to maintain his usual verisimilitude, and it shows. He truly seems to bring the city alive to an extent rarely even approached, much less achieved, with any location. Those who appreciate this Hardy aspect will thus not be disappointed, and those who stereotype him as using only rural agricultural settings will be pleasantly surprised.Important as all this is, the characters in many ways make the book. Jude is one of Hardy's great creations, and Arabella is one of literature's most intriguing and nuanced female villains. The most interesting character may be Sue Bridehead, a curious and uneasy mix of the Victorian female ideal and the rapidly emerging New Woman. Hardy's Preface notes that an early feminist told him Sue was literature's first real feminist, and so she is in many ways. Hardy himself was almost a proto-feminist and uses her to explore many issues of importance to women at the time and indeed now. In particular, he shows just how hard it was for even the most staunchly independent and freethinking women to stay true to themselves - or even stay alive - in such a drastically oppressive society. We see how marriage was virtually the only method of subsistence and how women were all but forced to marry grossly unsuitable men. For a man of the era, much less of Hardy's age (fifty-five) to have even been aware of such things, much less to dramatize them with discernment and sympathy, is truly remarkable. The feminist was disappointed by what Hardy does with Sue in the end, saying no woman would have written so, and D. H. Lawrence was later fascinated by her for similar but subtly different reasons. It is easy to criticize Hardy for losing nerve and falling back on prevailing stereotypes, but it is important to remember a few things. First, the event that pushes Sue over the proverbial edge is the most harrowing I have ever read; even the darkest Russian literature - nay, even Greek tragedy itself - does not equal it. I will say no more because all should experience it for themselves - and indeed it cannot be reproduced -, but it must be asked what would drive a woman (or anyone) to extremes if this would not. Second, and probably more importantly, Sue's plight and all it leads to epitomize Hardy's dark philosophy. Showing things as they should be was not his goal; he showed them as they are - which is of course not what most want to see. A wide range of ideologies may find this far from palatable, but he wisely noted that there is an obligation higher than any ideology - Truth. Few have equaled Hardy at showing it, especially the dark side so many refuse to see, and Jude is a seminal instance.Jude may not be the easiest Hardy novel to start with; a work like Far from the Madding Crowd or The Mayor of Casterbridge is probably better. However, this should be one of the first Hardy novels anyone reads, and those who have not read him should start immediately. He is not only one of the world's greatest writers but seemingly more relevant and influential with each passing year, and this is a masterpiece of the highest order - essential Hardy, which means it is simply essential."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"He was a poor boy who felt things those around him couldn't feel. He felt pain and compassion towards helpless animals. He levitated while reading books into a charming world of imagination and fantasy; the words that lifted him were the same words others considered boring and complicated. He saw something more, unseen by others, from floating phantasms and phantoms to vivid dreams. Eventually he joined their obscurity, away from the surrounding idle vision and hollow souls.Thomas Hardy's last novel \\"Jude the Obscure\\", tells the story of Jude, a visionary and intellectual orphan growing up with his aunt in the humble town of Marygreen. As we turn the book's five-hundred pages we witness the formulation and maturation of Jude's character and the successive failures and misfortunate events cast upon him.The adjective \\"obscure\\" is not confined to Jude's character; it is rather used repetitively throughout the novel to describe situations, places, circumstances etc... The obscurity manifested in the actions and thoughts of the characters is not part of them, but rather shed upon them from their society and the positions it entitles them to.Such obscurity comes to light when we observe the constant confusions and internal struggles suffered by both Jude and Sue, his lover, soul-mate and cousin. Jude is shattered between his dreams, intellect, religious faith and animal instinct. At one point of the novel he says \\"people go on marrying because they can't resist natural forces, although many of them may know perfectly well that they are possibly buying a month's pleasure with a life's discomfort\\". Jude is shattered between his religious conviction and aspiration of becoming a priest and his human instinct, until at last he decides he was unfit for such vocation and burns all his theological books. At times he regrets reading and studying, as he knows that he would go on being a stone worker, yet his resting hours were always dedicated to his books.Though from the beginning of the novel an aesthetic dreamer, Jude soon discovers that reality encompasses all dreams, hopes and fantasies. The society denied him all chances of happiness. He had thought that if he couldn't get the education he had longed sought, the presence of Sue beside him would condole, or even obliterate, his great loss, but even Sue was collared from him like his career and efforts.Towards the end when Sue threatens to leave him after the significant change in her mentality, Jude wonders in rage \\"Perhaps the world is not illuminated enough for such experiments as ours! Who were we, to think we could act as pioneers.\\" Even though Jude had determination, he wasn't strong enough to contend the multitudinous problems that confronted him and fight long enough for his beliefs.The other character almost equally important as that of Jude's is Sue Bridehead, his cousin. At the beginning of the novel Jude's aunt makes a brief reference of her as a girl who shared Jude's passion for reading. Then when Jude decides to move to Christminister, his aunt tells him that she happens to be there at well. He takes her picture, which he finds very pretty, searches for her, but despite that never dares to go and tell her about their relation. It was she who took the initiative after discovering that he was her cousin.Like Jude, Sue has a distinct character which develops and undergoes significant changes.We see her first as a reckless intellectual who is charmed by -and encourages-men's love to her \\"Sometimes a woman's love of being loved gets the better of her conscience, and though she is agonized at the thought of treating a man cruelly , she encourages him to love her while she doesn't love him at all\\" .However she is repugnant by their sexual desire in her. She sent Jude a letter telling him he can love her if he wants, however even after she went to him she didn't like him kissing her a lot \\"I think I would rather go on living always as lovers, as we are living now, and only meeting by day. It is so much sweeter for the woman at least, and when she is sure of the man\\". It was only when faced by the seriousness and likeliness of Jude's returning to Arabella that she finally agrees to \\"go further\\" and \\" intensify\\" her \\"liking\\" of him by marriage. Unlike Jude, however, Sue didn't have any feelings for Philloston except those of respect ad friendly love. Her brief marriage to him was unbearable and once she chose to throw herself from the window than to have him touch her.Faced by the death of her children ,however, Sue finds herself unable to hold to her convictions and she yields to the religious thought of her society leaving Jude behind.Christminister is the embodiment of mystery. The mystery of dreams. The mystery of time. The mystery of loss. The obscurity of mystery. It is the place that sums up Jude. The place that built him and turned him to an additional edifice of its ancient and glorious architecture. The core of his heart; his Jerusalem; his \\"centre of the universe\\".Arabella and Philloston can be better described as ghosts than as characters. They are the ghosts of past and convention that haunt the freedom of the rebellious couple, following them like shadows so that they look obscure in the eyes of the society. Whether consciously or unconsciously they act with a determination to normalize or destroy them.The only winner at the end seems to be Arabella. The story unfolds with her preparation for marriage amidst the tragedy of a dead Jude and a dying Sue. She was the one capable to be cruel and heartless for her carnal desires within the limits of accepted tradition and social conventionalism. She could murder a pig in cold blood to eat, and lawfully- yet immorally-entrap a man to marry her for her own comfort, support and protection using virtue and weakness as a justification.Jude suffered because he pursued his dreams. In his quest of becoming something more and going out of the gloomy conventional track of his society he lost everything-his children, his love, his life. However a sense of mollification underlies the tragic end of the story, for even though Jude dies after a lifetime of suffering, he dies at an early age, before he could live long enough to witness further humiliation and anguish. It is a romantic ending for someone who searched, someone who tried; someone who was pulled back, and abandoned."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude The Obscure goes against the normal strain in its treatment of topics ranging from marriage, ambition, dreams, and class-society. The book takes shocking twists and turns, and even though the subjects are often depressing, the sheer shock of what has just happened makes you want to read more. Hardy's main character is Jude, a poor, parentless boy whose ambitions far exceed the restrictions his class would put on him. Throughout his childhood he pushed himself in the studies of academia, he would always be seen with Latin books while delivering bread to the villagers. Eventually, as Jude grows he decides to move to Chirstminister-Jude's dream starting from his very early days of youth. Christminister is the center of all academic pursuit and home to the greatest colleges of learning. We follow Jude's adventures there, along with all of his attempts to being admitted into one of these institutions. This is not easy for a young man who has no money or family status behind him. One of Jude's great battles is between his burning desire to achieve higher learning, and his weakness towards women which draw him away from this goal. The elements which Jude's eventual children present, make an outlandish story even stranger by their actions. Certainly Hardy intended the children to present us with some additional lessons to consider while contemplating the book.The book was difficult for me to read, as mentioned in other reviews, the depressing subject matter and gloominess is not inherently an inviting thing. However, by unfolding the story as Hardy did, following the dreams and failures of young Jude, I learned some lessons that I do not think I could have otherwise. I received a strong personal impression in the importance of not giving up on yourself. That even if your opportunities are not optimal, or you environment is not perfect, that you still have the ability to reach for your dreams. And at all costs you should not give up on your dreams, or believe that you are not capable of accomplishing them. I also thought a lot about the acts the society would have us perform, which are not securely right. Having read the book forced me to reflect about the daily choices I make, how many of those are really mine, and how many are artificial restraints institutions would have me believe I must make.While I have read more entertaining books, I would have to recommend this one because of the unique perspective it presents. Hardy message allows us to think about important issues in a light not often seen through."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Obviously Jude the Obscure is a classic and everyone should read it some time.However this version is not the best although not for the reason the previous reviewer described. I do not know if it has been updated since the time of that review but currently, there is no problem with the arrangement of the text on-screen.Unfortunately, Jude the Obscure had many revisions during Thomas Hardy's life and it is unclear which of the editions this copy represents. Additionally Jude is full of obscure (get it?) literary and cultural references that would have been far more decipherable by an 1890s British reader, but that are--sadly--lost on me and most without annotation, of which this version has none.Finally, like most free Kindle editions (and far too many of the full-priced ones), there are no chapter breaks programmed into the text, so it is not possible to flip through the text to find something you have already read. I also have the paperback Oxford World's Classics edition and I don't think I will be able to discard it as a result of getting this version. Still: free is free."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"It seems to me, after reading a couple of Thomas Hardy novels, that although Hardy's stories are rich in narrative, they're working on a more abtract level or meant to convey more universal themes. My impression is that the point of the novel is made in the very title of the book. One doesn't have to consider this story in the context of the 19th century. The same set of circumstances could have occurred in any century. Jude was living his life according to his own values; outside forces played upon his choices, and the results were unfortunately, unhappy for Jude. I guess in today's competitive world where people believe they control every turn of their destiny, it may seem the outcomes in this novel should have been different. But, look again. You'll simply find a man living his life the best way he knows how to."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This was Thomas Hardy's last and most dark (obscure) novels. A true masterpiece! Hardy exells himself in describing every little emotion of Jude and Sue: two outcasts from society, seeking refuge in each others love, but with a grim conclusion. Though, Hardy's extraordinary insight in the souls of his two greatest creations is astonishing, it is the pureness and simpleness of the story that is most striking.This is truly one of the best books I have ever read"},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Besides Jude the Obscure, I've read Hardy's Mayor of Casterbridge and Tess, both of which fascinated me. I find that although I don't enjoy the plot of the books necessarily, I enjoy reading them so much that I'm not able to put the book down. After I finish reading Thomas Hardy's books, I am left feeling less than enthusiastic for my future, but at the same time renewed with passion to make my future all that it can be. There is an underlying message in all of Hardy's book, one of consequences. Those who sow actions of wrongdoing will eventually reap misery. Jude gives up the things that he wants most for instant gratification."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"An opening word of caution: if you've ever winced at a movie where the bad guy won, leave Jude the Obscure on the library shelf. Because we're not talking about a book where the protagonist merely loses. He loses spectacularly. If you feel cheated because you just found out the ending, don't worry: the first half of the novel will leave you so full of pessimism that you won't be able to accept anything but a tragic conclusion. It is hardly surprising that author Thomas Hardy gave up novel-writing due to the almost universal displeasure voiced by his conservative English readers.The story outlines Jude's progression from ambitious young boy to hopelessly distracted and troubled young man. However, his problems are not used by Hardy to ridicule human weakness, but rather to take pot shots at selected targets, namely women, marriage, and the upper class. Jude himself seems to bear little blame for his misfortunes when the story is finished.The plot and pace of the book often resemble a rookie driver's first attempt at operating a stick shift. Certain parts grind along, taking significant amounts of time without a critical purpose. Others race ahead without warning. The majority of the time period of the central relationship in the story is summarized with a single sentence: \\"Two whole years and a half passed thus.\\" Dialogue seems to be strongly favored to narration, and at times significant energy will be required for the reader to plow through the elaborate conversations of certain characters.The characters themselves are generally convincing, although often maddening. As suggested earlier, Jude really winds up as a tragic hero. While his weaknesses for alcohol and women are hardly ignored, they only serve to emphasize his humanity and evoke greater sympathy. The beginning of the book sets us up for a stereotypical feel-good, rags-to-riches story. As Jude fails in one aspect of life after another, it simply reinforces to the reader that the vast majority of us are condemned by our averageness to lives of mediocrity. Perhaps even more compassion should be poured out to Richard Phillotspon, Jude's childhood mentor and eventual competitor for a woman's love. He makes a very selfless and thoughtful decision on behalf of the said woman, and then suffers a mighty backlash from society. Despite this, he does not regret his choice or complain about having made it.Our two male heroes are sharply contrasted by the feminine presence in the story. Sue Bridehead, the most significant female, makes horrendous decision after horrendous decision throughout, and despite her uncommon education and knowledge, she offers limited justification for any of them. However, her weakness is almost loveable when juxtapositioned with the blatant evilness of Arabella Donn. This woman dupes Jude into marriage by the basest means imaginable at the beginning of the book, and her reappearance at the end of the story only reinforces her true wickedness.Despite his biases, Hardy should be given full credit for his ability to evoke sympathy. The plot, while bordering on being too neat and tidy, is believable enough to give credibility to his arguments. While taking significant time to develop, the storyline is carefully manufactured to defend largely indefensible positions and blame scapegoats in a compelling manner. It seems that Hardy wrote this work to create irritation within the reader, and direct it at the targets of his choice. If this is the case, then his mission is accomplished. In light of that fact, it is pretty obvious why it was not wildly popular at its first publication. However, if you are one who enjoys being irritated, this book is definitely for you."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"At no risk of giving away the ending, I'd say Jude the Obscure isn't a gem, but its worth reading. Aren't we just swamped with depressing novels coined \\"great classics\\" from the middle ages and on? They are all full of dejection, tragedy, mortality and painful plots. Well, Jude is no exception. It falls into the ranks of these sorrowful books, containing nothing extraordinary (like some happiness) other than its unorthodox morals. Was anyone ever happy back in the ol' days? According to classical literature, no. Jude the Obscure is another masterful way to induce discouragement and bleakness...well done Mr. Hardy, you've done it again.At the same time, if you can handle just one more sufferable novel, I'd recommend Jude...and if you like sappy soap-operas, I'd definitely recomment Jude. Admittably, the story is highly intriguing with a rich plot defined by rich diction. Hardy is a marvelous writer, and you won't be left unfulfilled after reading him. Maybe a little depressed...but not unfulfilled. It is hard to not become twisted into the plot, angered by the characters, mesmorized by Jude's myths, and lost in the fluent descriptions. Symbolism and good literature is appreciated as well as enjoyed...but I'm tempted to stamp on the cover \\"Another Depressing Classic\\" so a bunch of trendy humanists can gawk over it and talk about human suffering with herbal tea in their hands.

I couldn't relate to the characters at all. Except maybe Arabella. Jude and Sue were tremendously sad characters. Jude was obviously an intellegent man, but idiotic in his view of Sue.

Though very well-written and to some extent heartfelt, Jude to me was a classic with poor morals and suicidal mortals."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude The Obscure is a heart-rending, tragic tale about an ordinary, rural boy, who seeks to make his name at Christminster (Oxford) university. His aspirations to learn are readily felt by the reader and the heartache felt by Jude on being refused admission to learn is only a beginning to the tragic tale that Hardy sets out hereafter. Having experienced an unsuccessful marriage with Arabella, who could not sympathise with his desire to read and learn, the reader is forever hopeful that he will eventually find somebody who is able to share his ambitions and respect his sensitive nature. It is this hope that stays with the reader throughout the remainder of the book. Jude and Sue's story, though more tragic in its day, still strikes a chord with anybody able to sympathise with the horrible irony of their situation. Although standing outside of society and detesting the morals and conventions of the time, both Jude and more so, Sue, cannot fight against the poverty th! ey are pushed into or the religious teachings that they have been brought up believing. It is their poverty that leads Jude's son to hang both himself and Jude and Sue's other children and it is this same poverty and the tragedy of the children's death that forces them apart. The children's death to Sue signals that her and Jude should not be together but have responsibilities to their past (once again Hardy's attack on the damage caused by religion). Their 'forbidden' love labelled as such because of the religious Victorian morals only serves to increase their poverty as Jude's chances of either securing a successful job or gaining admission to Christminster become ever more few - exposing the class-ridden society for what it meant to its victims. Hardy's only fault in writing Jude the Obscure is to expose too harshly the innate weakness of Sue (who seems unable and unprepared to throw off the shackles of Victorian society) and the inability of Arabella to empathise with ! Jude's desire to go to Christminster."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I never thought something could upset me this much.

For one it is not an engaging novel. Usually I can't put Hardy's novels down but I was reluctant to pick this one up. Second Hardy seems to blame \\"society\\" for everything that goes wrong in Jude's life. This is a huge departure for Hardy who normally writes about flawed characters that create their own misery and troubles. Blaming social pressure not Jude's personal acts is a departure from his other books such as The Mayor of Casterbridge.I personally had no sympathy for Jude or the other characters in the book. I also found the anti-marriage theme troubling. Jude chose to enter a relationship with Arabella who was completely wrong for him. People who knowingly enter relationships and then marriages with inappropriate people are completely responsible for the misery that results. Saying that social conformity is a bad thing because it asks men to take responsibility for the offspring they produce is troubling. Yes Arabella tricked him into marriage with a false pregnancy but he chose to become intimate with someone knowing pregnancy was a possibility.

After reading your review for the ninth time, I have come to the conclusion that it is some strange species of bilge that could easily be classified as unscrupulous toxic waste. You, Ms. Wiggin, strike me as a very dull-witted little girl whose only whetstone probably exists as a rather blockheaded father. I am about to begin my own discussion of JUDE and thus will no longer linger over your writing. Your entire review is comprised of nonsensical cant that both contradicts itself and makes ridiculous, irrelevant references. It deserves no further attention.JUDE THE OBSCUREThis, Hardy's final novel, is in no respect a masterpiece. I cannot imagine a novel in the entire Western Canon that is any worse. All of Hardy's other 13 novels, though exceedingly melancholy, seem to have been written by another person: as with Shakespeare and EDWARD III, Hardy's mark of authorship is absent. Possibly they were written secretly by Hardy's wife, cousin, brother, sister, psychiatrist-who knows?Jude's pursuit and relationship with Arabella throughout a substantial part of the first half of the novel is utterly revolting. His attempt to educate himself is comically hopeless. His love for his cousin Sue is a scene from America's Ozarks. When Hardy tries to make a grand statement on marital intercourse/surplus procreation through Father Time's acts of murder and suicide \\"because we are too menny,\\" it comes across as more grotesque than tragic. In the final pages of the book, the record for the greatest amount of melodrama in one novel is attained. The following is the novel's atrocious finale (speaking of Sue's condition following the death of Jude):\`Well-poor thing, \`tis to be believed she's found forgiveness somewhere! She said she had found peace!'\`She may swear that on her knees to the holy cross upon her necklace till she's hoarse, but it won't be true!' said Arabella. \`She's never found peace since she left his arms, and never will again till she's as he is now!'SUMMATIONIf you share my opinion of this novel/recognize its abundance of faults (i.e., the words), there is no need to despise it. Oscar Wilde once said, \\"One must have a heart of stone to read the death of Little Nell [from Dickens's OLD CURIOSITY SHOP] without laughing.\\" The same should be said of JUDE."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Being an English AP student, I was given this book to read over the summer. I was hoping for a book with at least something enlightening or interesting in it, but I found this book to be nothing more than useless. Nothing can save this book from being what it is: overdramatic and overpraised. Jude is a pathetic loser, Sue has no control over her emotions, and they are both idiots. I was glad when the children hung themselves, as it was the single most entertaining part of the book. Who the hell names a kid \\"Father Time\\" anyway???? A tale of incest and stupidity..... forget it. read this book if you want to punish yourself. This book made me angry and will do so for any reasonable person that picks it up and makes it all the way through."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I agree with Mr. Myers' observations about this book's merit and his mention of its relation to Percy Shelley. I, like Mr. Myers, am substantially smarter than the average reviewer (or moronic AP student), and therefore must say that I am one of the few people who can truly appreciate the unique aestheticism of Hardy's transcendental, impressionistic, amorphous, and quasi-sublime genius.Hardy's novel, though a bit melodramatic and self-conscious in comparison to his better works, still stands, as only Mr. Myers and I can adequately recognize (as I said before), as one of the great monuments of western literature. Jude's progression from an empty life with Arabella, to a sort-lived and star-crossed fling with his cousin Sue, to his ultimate separation and isolation is one of the most heartbreaking stories ever. Hardy related more to Tess than any other character, but still feels a relation to Jude's involuntary attraction to suffering.After the completion of this novel, Hardy, as Mr. Myers told us, wrote poetry that suggested a great deal of Shelley's influence for the rest of his life. I am shocked, though, that no reviewer, not even Mr. Myers or a stupid AP student, mentioned that Hardy turned to poetry after the critics and public ridiculed and castigated him for writing JUDE. I seem to be the only reviewer knowledgeable and well-read enough to know that."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Poor Jude, literally and figuratively. He is the ultimate trapped man waiting and hoping for redemption that never comes. He wants education, love, and a future for his children. These are all thwarted by both society and individuals. This book is wonderfully sad and depressing, perfect for a rainy weekend ALONE. This is not the book to read in the throes of love and optimism. Hardy's language draws you in and keeps you reading. I threw down the book five times in anger and frustration but HAD TO keep reading to find what happens next, I finished it within two days! The writing evokes the mood of the novel and the people involved so vividly that I could almost smell the pigs, hear the stonemason's tapping and feel the cold fog of Christminister."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I've read Tess before I read Jude, and reading the two of them in comparison has helped me understand Hardy's life philosophy a little better. As a piece of literature I think most would agree that Tess is a much better read, in style, subtlety, plot and character development, etc. Jude, however, is certainly worth everyone's while. I think the most telling point in the novel is when Jude goes to meet the composer of the beautiful hymn he's been singing in the church choir, and finds out that the composer is just as worldly and materialistic as anyone else. Jude is a romantic, sensitive, passionate man searching for a pure and natural beauty in a world that demands one to deny their natural instincts in exchange for money, status, and respectability. His tragedy, however, is not as keen as Tess's: Tess's was purely determined by fate and could by no means be considered her &quot;fault,&quot; whereas Jude's, it seems to me, could have been preventable from the start had he not succumbed to a whimsical impulse.&quot;Jude&quot; is one of the most vitriolic and direct attacks against the institutions of religion and matrimony that I have ever come across. The theme of a &quot;natural spouse&quot; as opposed to the &quot;societal/religious spouse&quot; is one much propagated by Hardy, and that is very much obvious in &quot;Jude.&quot; The conflict between the two puts Jude in a very interesting dilemma, around which the plot centers. In short, &quot;Jude&quot; is a very intense look at the ever-debated clash of the natural and the societal."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure is a sad book of legendary proportions. Not until reading did I realize how utterly depressing/tragic it is. This doesn't mean it's bad; Tess of the d'Urbervilles (also by Hardy) is also depressing yet it is moving, and is an excellent read. Jude the Obscure, at least for me, falls short of the mark.Jude the Obscure is about a man who wanders (..literally across all southern England) looking for happiness in marriage and life. He's a deep-thinker who is incredibly naive and, due to bad luck and the social neurosis of the Victorian era, finds himself moving further away from his objectives with each passing...page! Just when you think Jude's life is about to turn for the better it turns horribly tragic. While similarities to Tess of the d'Urbervilles abound, Tess's tragic turn was expected and plausible. Jude's misfortune comes from nowhere, and so it seems like Hardy is playing a cruel trick on the reader.So I disagree with the strongly opinionated reviewers before me. Jude the Obscure is neither great nor terrible. I find it to be rather formulaic Hardy, which for many readers will be reason enough to read over and over again."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This book is about the struggle of having character. As such, it addresses perhaps a timeless question: should we follow our hearts and do what we want or should we follow convention and do what we think is demanded?Although they try desperately, and for a time succeed, Jude and Sue never fully escape the demands of conscious, obligation, and social convention. And it destroys them. Jude and Sue thus personify the agonizing struggle to make moral decisions. If we knew right from wrong, we would choose right every time. But, what makes Jude and Sue's struggles so painful is that they are trying to choose between right and right, or wrong and wrong. Either decision provides as much pain, although in a different way. So what do you do?Hardy doesn't give any easy answers. But, especially today when most of us all the time do exactly what we want, perhaps the question is worth thinking seriously about."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Regardless of what some uneducated or shallow people might say about this novel, it IS a masterpiece. For one, the way Hardy writes is wonderful. He does not give it to you easy, but he gives it to you. To recomed a Dickens novel in place of this is tragic. For one, Dickens was a man of the people and wrote for the people, often changing his endings and tittles to better suit audiences. Hardy obviously does not do this. Jude is clearly a late Victorian Age novel and even though it was not accepted during this time, Hardy's portrayal of 19th century England, the view points of sociey at that time, etc should be read now for not only historical reasons alone, but for the unique way Hardy presents them. Too, this novel is very sad. This is one reason it was not accepted at the time. However, readers should note that due to the publication of this novel, education was made more readily availible to people of lower socioeconomic classes. For me, that, meant that this novel made a diffrence, thus making it even more spectacular. Overall, for all those interested, Jude is by far a classic masterwork and should be read and appreciated by those who can fully grasp its power. More importantly, though, it is a true drama of the mind and of human existance and emotion."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This is the second novel by Thomas Hardy I've read. The emotionally-wrenching \\"Tess\\" was the first, and I decided masochistically I'd like a little more punishment. I will skip the plot-line and the criticism of Victorian-era conventions, all well-covered by others, and just give my impressions of how enjoyable a read it is.First, I think you should read the book without plot details given ahead of time, and NEVER read the introduction of a classic novel by Penguin or Oxford -- they will give it all away. Sometimes they even give away plot details in the footnotes, but Hardy is an author I'd recommend buying an edition with explanatory notes.I thought this book was much darker than \\"Tess,\\" but I didn't sympathize with the main character quite as much, although I feel I was a bit like him myself in my youth. I suppose Tess, being a woman, will get more sympathy, but the things that happen to Jude are far worse. Furthermore, the character of Sue is deeply sympathetic as well. As I read this book, and dreams got deferred, then tragedy mounted on tragedy, some things that happened were almost unbelievable. \\"Anna Karenina\\" is dark, \\"Ethan Frome\\" is dark -- but what happens in the last 100 pages of this novel is downright nightmarish, bordering on horror.After I read \\"Tess\\" I bought 6 of Hardy's novels and plan to read them all eventually, but I wouldn't read them back-to-back!"},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This is the second Hardy novel that I have read. The first was Tess of the d'Urbervilles, which I enjoyed despite that fact that it was a tragedy. I found Jude the Obscure to be much darker and to the point that I didn't particularly enjoy it. I did relate to the character of Jude, and could understand his reaction to his situations. The reactions of Sue later in her life highlighted the danger of an incorrect understanding of the mercy of God, repentance and forgiveness of oneself.Recommended for lovers of tragedy. If you want to be uplifted, don't read this book."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"If there's one strange habit that's become a subtle part of my life it's that I have the hardest times remembering how I came across some of my favorite things, bands, movies, books, and Jude the Obscure is one of them. I was at a Barnes and Noble with a friend, looking at and picking up random books, when I came across this title. I read the synopsis on the back, informing me of how utterly bleak this book is supposed to be, that Hardy met with reactions so harsh that he never picked up a pen to write another novel until his dying day, and that, most importantly of all, it's the tale of a man's dreams continuously crushed before even gaining any kind of momentum, for the majority of his life.After I read all that, the book never left my hand, and that night I went home and took in at least 1/4 of the book in one sitting. There are so many moments and quotes in this book that I can personally identify with that reading it was probably a far more cathartic experience for myself than most others. Jude longs to be a man of the intellectual scene, reading as much as he can, studying numerous languages, latin, of course being the most important, and he never gets close to ever seeing any of his hopes come to life. His life is spent, for the better part, working low class jobs, stone masonry, etc. and falling for all the wrong girls.The women in Hardy's final novel depict the sex at their coldest, most malicious and self-absorbed. Arabella, Jude's first wife, tricks Jude into marriage by faking a pregnancy, and Jude being the soft hearted, love hungry puppy that he is, weds her, only to meet with crushing consequences. Then enters Sue Bridehead, Jude's cousin, a character, I've read quite a few books mind you, that is near the very top of my list of absolutely vile people, Arabella is there as well.Sue is so unconsciously full of herself, such a self-proclaimed goddess that it's sickening. For the majority of their courtship Sue never even so much as remotely returns Jude's love, which he notes on numerous occasions, to which she simply implies that she loves him but will never actually physically speak the words.And in the background is Philotson, the man Sue marries before Jude, and the man who, ultimately, unwillingly tears Jude & Sue apart for good. An older man, a teacher, and yet another miserable human being, lets Sue go when he realizes that she doesn't love him, but that she may love Jude. The very fact that Sue was a part of his life, and eventually absent, destroys his reputation, when they get \\"divorced.\\" He loses his job and has to take jobs akin to what Jude did his whole life, if not just a bit better.Sue is basically the poison of the novel. Every life she touches ultimately falls apart. Little Father Time, the son born of Jude & Arabella's time, hangs himself, along with Jude & Sue's two children, because Sue told the boy that the world is a harsh place and that they're better off dead. \\"because we're too many\\" I believe is what the suicide note reads.The day of the child's funeral, Sue, pregnant with third child, has a miscarriage. So, again, it's obvious, in my opinion, that Sue is the poison, destroying all those she comes in contact with, even the child inside her body.There are more disturbing moments in the book, although none nearly as absolutely shocking as the suicide, but I'm already running off at the mouth about what is, and always will be, my favorite book of all time."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Although Jude The Obscure may see somewhat depressing dark, and gothic I did enjoy the story of the character Jude. He admired his schoolteacher as a boy and wanted so bad to go to Christminister and become a scholar. The fact that Jude is a gentleman allows women like Arabella and Sue to stray him far of the path towards his goal. It makes me wonder what would have happened to him if he hadn't run into Arabella. After being away from Arabella he starts to fall in love with his cousin Sue. All Jude wanted was to marry her, however she did not want to conform to society after being married once before. The end of the novel is sad, however I really sympathized with Jude and felt like he did the best he could with his life."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude's life is short and miserable. His aspiration of becoming a scholar is thwarted when he is trapped into marriage by Arabella. But even without Arabella's manipulations, he is trapped in time, born many years too soon for the reality, instead of only the dream, that someone of a working class background can attend an institution of higher learning.He remains a stonemason and eventually unites with Sue Bridehead, not in a legal marriage, but one of heart and mind. Jude is ahead of his time, again, for this type of union to be socially accepted. Their rejection of a marriage contract turn them in social outcasts and their hardships culminate into a horrific event that affects Sue profoundly and causes the separation between her and Jude.For me, Sue is the character who leaves the most lasting impression in Jude the Obscure, even though it's not in a wholly positive sense. She is indecisive and at times so annoying that I clenched my teeth as I was reading. But the scene where she jumps out the window when Phillotson accidentally enters her bedroom is priceless and forever ingrained in my mind. She cannot force herself to accept him as a husband. Others, less free-spirited and emotional than Sue, might have been resigned or indifferent to being the wife of a dull, older man. Not Sue. Her spirit rebels because she wants to be with Jude, until she is shocked and overwhelmed by grief. Then she transforms into someone who can overrule her own will and submit herself to Phillotson. In the end she is crushed and as dead as Jude in his coffin.Jude the Obscure is bleak, but also surprisingly fast-paced with good dialogue and memorable characters. If the book had been more favorably received by critics upon its publication Thomas Hardy would almost certainly have continued writing novels. But he was discouraged by the cries of outrage and turned his attention to writing poetry. We'll never know what great books he might have written but the masterpiece Jude the Obscure is an exclamation point as a last novel."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Having said that, I think reading Jude the Obscure was a worthwhile experience.It concerns the young man Jude, stonemason by trade, who dreams of a university education. His hopes and dreams are high at the beginning of the novel. But a series of events ensures that life does not have happiness in store for him. His academic aspirations are thwarted, he marries a vain girl in a moment of lust, and watches his real love - Sue - marry another. When he finally gives everything up, job security, social respect, his ambitions, to live with Sue &quot;in sin&quot;, there is a brief, uncertain ray of happiness on them before tragedy stikes again.The emotions I went through while reading Jude's journey and ultimate disappointment in life were intense. I felt despair, sadness, shock, and was ultimately left feeling quite bitter about his plight. BUT, I enjoy reading books that wrench out your heart and make you feel deep emotion, whether happy or not. Few books do that well in my opinion. That fact that Jude the Obscure did that for me, even though the emotions were negative, was the reason I gave it 5 stars.If you don't like being depressed by what you read, it is probably wise to avoid this one. If, however, you want a truly momentous emotional experience, you should definitely take time to read Jude the Obscure. Just be aware that the feelings it arouses are not pleasant, but it will definitely leave you deeply moved."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I read it in college. It is still one of my 5 favorites. I felt identified with the characters so much that while reading it I felt the same pain and agony of the two heroes.If you have read before other Hardy books then you may think this is another sentimentalist \\"soap opera\\" book. But it is not. This is a masterpiece of literature. I recommend that you start reading Hardy from here."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I remember this book -one of my 5 favourite- specially for the impact that made on me when I read it back in college. If you read first other books by Hardy you may think this one is a little sentimental and \\"soap-operistic\\". But this is trully a gem, a work of art.I felt identified with the hero and I could sense the things and places that show in the whole book. It is so real, and the feelings are so real and strong that you suffer with the characters.Trully a masterpiece. You must read it."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"One of the many things that amaze about Hardy is how widely his imagination roamed -- how much variety there is in his Wessex novels, though all are set in the same little geographic patch of territory, traversing the same cities and countrysides.Though it addresses sex and marrriage with a directness that is almost startling, JUDE is not so sensuous or earthy as TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES. It has a more male personality, suited to its protagonist; not poetic but leaner, more abstract and philosophical; not pastoral but urban, with churches, schools and colleges, the strongholds of civilization, as landmarks.Still, readers who take JUDE as an extended tract against convention aren't paying attention. It's true there are moments that ask to be taken as parable and passages in which you can hear the unmistakable voice of an author making a case. But the story of Jude and Sue is too complex and full of reversals to support any mere argument. They don't fare very well in Wessex, but it's hard to imagine any social conditions in which they would. They are fascinating but unexceptional people whose restlessness, neuroses, desires and ambitions would be thwarted anywhere -- and they are us. They aren't as attractive as Tess, or as Gabrial and Bathsheba in FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD, but they are arguably truer and certainly newer in fiction. They are citizens of the 20th century. This was Hardy's last novel, supposedly because of the outcry against it upon publication, but I don't know where he could have gone from here. It's as if he had a glimpse of the disintegration of human personality along with the achievements and monuments of the race. Where could he have looked next?I'm making the book sound grim, but it has many pleasures for the reader. Here Hardy seems to be holding himself to a higher standard as a novelist. The language is trim and swift, and the subsidiary characters are vivid and memorable, not just voices or stock figures. Arabella, Phillotson, the Widow Edlin are wonderful creations. And (as in TESS), the architecture of the story is dazzling and resonant, like a concert hall with perfect acoustics.In other ways, though, JUDE isn't characteristic of Hardy. A reader coming to him cold may as well start with JUDE as not, though it will give no real sense of his oeuvre as a novelist. If you're a Hardy reader, you might love the other novels and only admire this one, or vice-versa. Some consider it his greatest achievement (though for me, that would be TESS).Certainly it stands alone. The Victorian novel could go no further."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure centers on the life of a neglected commoner with dreams of breaking the chains of society, which hold him bound, and becoming a more educated and proper man. The only challenge that stands in his way is his poor choice in women. Unfortunately this stumbling block becomes more than enough to hinder the weaker Jude along his way. He is not only held up by the lower class, to which he belongs, but seems to be pushed down from the upper classes, preventing his natural progression from both sides of the social spectrum.The cunning Arabella Dunn, a poor country, first beguiles him using him as her escape from the very un-civilized life she had been leading. Having never had any real contact from members of the opposite gender, and no one that even pretended to care for him before, he was easily betrayed by his feelings. Thomas Hardy portrays Arabella as very manipulative only using Jude as a means for furthering her own well-being. She fakes a pregnancy to convince Jude to marry her, instantly stopping his education and centering his attention solely on providing for his newly acquired family. Hardly any time had passed and Jude had forgotten what he set out for. This reminds me of a quote I once heard, \\"Don't let what you want now get in the way of what you want most.\\" Far too often Jude lets his temporary desires distract him from his ultimate goal of gaining an education.Once Arabella leaves Jude he finally has the opportunity again to pursue his goal of becoming socially advanced. However, once again his pursuit of manipulative women prevents him from success. Jude pursues his cousin, Sue, who represents the women of the upper class. She has some of the education that Jude has sought for, yet this seems to do nothing for her as pertaining to life choices. Her marriage to Phillotson is just one example of how even the learned may not be wise. Her decision to pursue Jude following both their divorces, leads to further misery. Not being accepted by the community and never actually committing to marriage puts quite a strain on their relationship. Sue's indecision only prolongs the suffering of Jude and his poor choices. The punishment seems to transcend generations as Little Father Time decides to save him and the other children from this misery by hanging them in the closet one night.Not only does Hardy portray marriage as the main stumbling block along Jude's path but also as the constraint that prevents people from truly attaining that which will make them happy. First of all, Jude and Arabella seemingly have a marriage without love. The marriage appears to be only a social commitment to provide security and other comforts regarded by society. Sue is unhappily married to Phillotson even though he provides her with financial stability, an educated partner, and seems to be the ideal husband. Sue and Jude decide not to enter into that covenant sighting their youthful mistakes as precedence. Even without the confinement of marriage their love is unable to flourish with society looking down upon them and no real commitment rendered. Hardy implies that in marriage one must sacrifice of them for another who is looking after his or her own aspirations."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Thomas Hardy's book Jude the Obscure follows a common theme like his book Tess of the d'Urbeville's. This theme is conventionality verse morality. Hardy's subtitle of Jude the Obscure says it all, \\"the letter killeth.\\" This interprets to the letter of the law killeth, the social conventions of the Victorian Age figuratively and literally breaks Jude. The basic story line is Jude is first married to Arabella. Arabella tricked Jude into marrying her. Jude is in Christminister and meets Sue, whom he falls in love with. However, Sue gets married to Phillotson. After some time both Sue and Jude get a divorce and end up living together (and never marrying each other).It is evident in the text that Sue and Jude's relationship is looked down upon (they have trouble receiving lodging because they are not married). Despite the fact that the book shows marriage in a negative light and both women in the book have undesirable qualities this book is not an anti-marriage book. Also, this book could suggest the importance of marrying the right person, so that, one can be happy, but the overall theme is not to promote the importance of marrying the right person.Hardy uses marriage as the means to manifest the social conventions of the time. By convention Sue and Jude should not have had divorces even though they were participants in unhappy marriages. Even though they both had legal divorces the church shuns them because of their divorces. It is almost an unspoken rule, even though divorces are legally allowed socially they are not approved.Also by convention, they should not have been living together. Even Jude's son is pressured into the conventions of the time and in the end of the novel hangs himself and Jude and Sue's two sons. In a moral sense Jude and Sue tried to be true to their heart and defied the conventions of the time and attempted to live together. They do not go far enough, they should get married. Jude and Sue are still tied down by the social conventions and can not take the last step to break free of the conventions of the time. Jude and Sue are constantly \\"on the run\\" to avoid the stares and shuns from their neighbors.Hardy is clever in his use of symbolism. The name of the town is \\"Christminister.\\" This is town, which Sue and Jude have trouble finding lodging. People should be showing Christ like love; however they shun Jude and Sue. There is an abundant amount of irony with the church. The church should help and attempt to understand Sue and Jude but the church neglects the two.This book is an excellent example for the critique of social convention versus morality. The examples are poignant and the distressing end for the characters makes the criticism of social conventions self-evident."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"There are several novels written in the Victorian era about the life of common people and the struggles they encounter. Jude the Obscure is on the top of many best-seller lists and appears on many Great Literary Works lists, not to mention my own personal list of favorites. Jude the Obscure is a great novel to read if you are looking for complicated characters, emotional injustices, a complex story line, and unexpected events in each chapter. The novel Jude the Obscure, written by Thomas Hardy, portrays the life of Jude Fawley and his relationships with women, his religious obstacles, and other problems faced by a common person in the Victorian times.Jude is a stonemason who appears to be very religious. His list of faults includes a drinking problem, his ignorance of women, problems dealing with stress, and his inability to decide what to do with his life. In fact, when Jude is not able to deal with the issues in his life, he stops everything that he is doing and thinks only about the problem at hand. After this thought process, he begins to drink and hope that the problem will disappear when he becomes sober. Throughout the novel, there are two women who corrupt Jude in some way, either by turning him away from his religious ambitions, by degrading him in a social atmosphere, or leading him away from his dreams by putting their own first. The women in his life, Sue and Arabella, put Jude at an emotional high of loving him unconditionally or tearing him down to the point of causing him to drink. His two wives (which he has a different times) simply play on his emotions like a roller coaster throughout the novel and use him to get what they want out of life, which they too, are incapable of deciding. Several plot events explain Jude's religious beliefs and how he struggles to sustain those same beliefs in the relationships he has. It is his religious faith and the interactions Jude has with Sue and Arabella that shape the novel and the course of events.The author, Thomas Hardy, does a great job in illustrating the religious beliefs social expectations of the Victorian period. Hardy uses both women in the novel to portray the ideals of different classes of women on religion and worthwhile. He uses Jude and Phillotson to portray the differing ideals of religion among varying classes, but also to paint the social expectations of men in the Victorian period. Hardy uses the different social classes of the men to as an excuse for their behaviors. For example, Jude does not cheat on his wife while she is away for a year because they are still married. Because Jude values the bond of marriage both from the church and socially, he is faithful while his wife, who does not have the same moral standards, is off getting married to another man. There are several examples in the novel from all four of the main characters that will give insight into various aspects of life and the ideologies of people in different social atmospheres. Hardy also does a great job in describing each of the characters in a way that their description matches their personality traits or their ideals on life. Hardy also brings to life the scenery in which the novel takes place, allowing the reader to visualize the setting of the events. By drawing the reader in visually, he creates more of an emotional appeal and the reader becomes more involved with the events of the novel."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"When you watch movies nowadays, more than often you see many of the female characters portrayed as extremely weak in one form or another. In an intense battle scene where our hero is in trouble and needs someone to kick the gun a little closer so he can shoot his enemy, what is the he loves girl doing? Screaming her head off. She nearly ruins the happy ending by her inability to be useful.I found Jude the Obscure to be somewhat of a literature version of this classic movie scenario. The main female characters did move the plot along, but only in a downward direction. Jude starts out as a young man aspiring to achieve greatness in the learned city of Christminster. Soon, he is lured into a relationship with Arabella, for which he begins ignoring his hopes of high education. While this relationship is not entirely a manipulation of Jude by Arabella-he falls for her pretty hard, even without her trickery-Jude is ready to get out and head for Christminster when Arabella reveals her \\"pregnancy\\" and they are quickly married, to comply with the social expectations. Before long, Jude learns that Arabella is by far a much different woman than he first thought. His pushed-aside dreams of Christminster are mocked and trampled by her, and of course he must find a practical job to support them. It doesn't take long for Arabella to get tired of the situation-of Jude's sensitivity to the world, his hopes for education, and his all-around \\"sissy-ness\\"-and she heads off to Australia with her parents.Jude does end up moving to Christminster, where he meets his cousin Sue. For some reason, he falls in love with her. He decides that he likes this girl long before he actually talks to her. Love? Sounds more like attraction. At any rate, through a long and complicated set of events, Sue is married to Phillotson (ironically, the man from whom Jude got his love for learning), and later separated and divorced. Jude also obtains a divorce from Arabella. Jude and Sue develop a friendship, while she keeps him at a distance, knowing of his feelings for her. Arabella returns from Australia and comes to talk to Jude; Sue becomes jealous, and decides to have a \\"more than friends\\" relationship with him.Social expectations dictated that they should be married, and Jude is all for it. Sue has issues, though. She feels that marriage is nothing more than a ceremony that puts bounds and chains on something intangible, and although she and Jude go several times to be lawfully wedded, she always backs out. Without giving away too much of the plot, eventually it's more harmful to her and Jude to NOT be married than to go through with the ceremony. When tragedy strikes the family they have made together, Sue becomes our well-known female movie character. As Jude attempts to pick up the pieces of their broken life, Sue is unable to do anything more than repeat the same ideas over and over-it's a sign, this is wrong, we're sinning, religion is the answer. Quite the opposite from her earlier thoughts in the book, where Jude was planning to be a priest and she constantly disagreed with his religious and moral views. I honestly think that Jude and Sue could have pulled through their hardships if she would have done something more than just \\"scream.\\" Instead, she chickened out big-time. By her own uselessness at that critical point, Sue led to Jude's eventual death-she couldn't just kick the gun a few inches closer, and the enemy triumphed. Interestingly enough, I think Sue was the enemy. She was Jude's downfall.Despite all that (in fact, probably because of it), Jude the Obscure is a very good book. The characters are an adventure to become familiar with, and although for me it was frustrating, it was a good read as Jude's life went \\"down the tube\\" more and more rapidly. Best of all, you can't actually hear the annoying high-pitched screams I talked about in movies-you'll just have to imagine it."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Reading this novel, it seems that Hardy is putting women and the organization of marriage down. But at the same time as reading this novel I was also learning that in Hardy&#65533;s time women were sex-crazed harlots and men the picture of virtue who were deceived by the evil women. This helped me to understand that Hardy wasn&#65533;t exactly putting down women, but that he was depicting them as the world saw them at that time. As for the whole marriage issue, Hardy just slams that into the ground. He uses the characters in happy times and in sad times to show how distasteful marriage is. One of the biggest things that points out how Hardy thinks of marriage is how others look upon those who are married and those who are simply a couple. Sue sees that those who are not yet married are happy with one another and still find joy in each other&#65533;s presence. But when she looks upon those who are married she sees that they no longer are happy and find joy in other places. Arabella also sees this when she comes upon Jude and Sue together without their knowing that she is there. She is told that they have supposedly been married, but when she sees them she thinks that they are not because of how they hold hands and still wish to be with each other. This is rather ironic because she and her husband are at the same event but prefer to go their separate ways. By this example Hardy shows that happiness need not be found in marriage.Further he shows some of the consequences of a bad marriage through little Father Time. This boy comes to thinking of himself as a hindrance since he could understand what a hindrance was. If he had been born into a good marriage he would have felt loved and he would have felt as though he belonged. However, he was born to a mother who did not want him and a father who did not even know that he existed. Because he was not raised in a healthy home-life, he began to see the world before he was ready. His death portrays an extreme end to an unhappy marriage, but it all shows what can happen to those who are not wary. Father Time also helps to go back to Hardy showing how evil women were considered at that time. Today many people would consider it very immoral to simply leave their child to another to care for, whatever the circumstances may be. Arabella does not seem to mind though, she only cares when it seems that he has been with these people too long. So instead of taking him back, she simply sends him to Jude. Hardy portrays Sue as evil through Father Time by her talk with him right before his death. She tells him that it would actually be better had he and the rest of the children never been born at all. Now, she may not have meant it in quite that way, but that is how he took it, and so the passing away of the children soon after.There may have been something good about marriage and women in the book, but if there was it was hidden well. As a story it is good, but it is not something that I would want to be judged by, or to base my life on."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure is a tale of a young orphan boy who has a perfect picture of his future painted. Being an orphan, he has very little going for him. He is not shown affection by anyone, especially his caretaker-his great aunt. He is constantly being chastised for the way he lives his life. Because there is not a single significant influence at home, Jude looks elsewhere for guidance and direction. He finds this positive influence in his school teacher, Mr. Phillotson. Jude sees good and potential in this school teacher, and wants to emulate him to the best of his ability. However, Jude comes face to face with his major weak point... a woman. Upon encountering Arabella the pig killer, Jude almost instantly forgets his aspirations of attending Christminster to gain an education and instead decides to marry Arabella.After having sacrificed time, money, and his dream of school, Arabella decides that she is going to leave Jude and move on with life. After drinking away his problems, Jude finally decides to move on and try to accomplish his dream of a Christminster education. It is in this town that Jude finds and falls in love with his cousin Sue. Upon befriending Sue, Jude takes a walk with her to find his old mentor and see how he has fared over the years. During their discussion with Mr. Phillotson, Sue is drawn to him, because he is able to teach her how to be a teacher. Jude worries about this, but has few options. Eventually Mr. Phillotson courts Sue and they are wed. Once again Jude is thrown into a fit of depression and drinking. Eventually Sue grows tired of Phillotson that she pursues Jude. However, staying true to the theme of the book, as soon as you have the person you love, you instantly fall out of love with them-and this happens to Sue.This book is story of more than love, marriage, and the problems associated with each. This book has a deeper meaning that Hardy means to convey. It is a story of life in general. Although love is the underlying theme, there are more problems addressed in the book. Those that have a worthwhile goal in life are rarely able to accomplish their dreams, and even when they do, they aren't happy as they envisioned they would be. This book is one of depression and failure. Somehow Hardy is able to make the worst-case scenario out of nearly every situation. A good read, but there are more uplifting stories out there if that is what the reader is looking for."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude Fawley, is an orphan trapped in poverty and a narrow working class paradigm, but in spite of these limitations, he dreams of a scholarly life in the university town of Christminster.Jude is smitten by Arabella, who tricks him into marrying her. After a short time Arabella leaves Jude to go to Australia. Shortly after Arabella leaves him, Jude moves to Christminster to pursue his dreams.While in Christminster he meets his cousin Sue. Jude had fallen in love with Sue when he first saw her picture. Now he is in Christminster where he can pursue his dreams of becoming a scholar and meeting Sue. The conversations between Sue and Jude, despite their differences, bring them closer together and they quickly become friends. Sue deflates Jude's dream when she marries the schoolmaster (the same man at the beginning of the book, who had promised Jude some books but never fulfilled his promise).Even after Arabella comes back into the picture, Sue and Jude get divorced from their respective spouses and live together without marriage. In the years that follow, because the couple is not married, they face a lot of difficulties and become social outcasts. In spite of their difficulties, they still love each other and the family they are raising together. An extremely tragic event shatters the family. The consuming guilt, brought on by the tragic event, leads Sue and Jude back to their former hated lives.It was a desperate try on Sue's part to say no to customs she didn't believe in, and a desperate try on Jude's part to live the peaceful life he wanted with the woman he loved, but just as life didn't grant him his dream of an education, Society denied him acceptance of the relationship he wanted with Sue. The shocking end was Hardy's way to convey his thoughts on love, sex and the institution of marriage, at a time when talking about love, sex, and criticizing the marriage constitution was taboo.Hardy was criticized for creating complex, overtly sexual characters like Sue and Jude who would act against established norms of marital and sexual behaviors. Sue, recognized her intellect but still used marriage as a way of having the career she wanted, She could not force herself to be attracted to her older husband, who was understanding and gave her a divorce, after which she was free to pursue Jude. Jude loved Sue deeply, but knowing that she was married, he still slept with Arabella, when she came back, because she was still his legal wife.Reading the entire 500 plus pages of Jude the Obscure was totally draining. The emotional torment that Jude experienced throughout his life left me depleted. Each and every person in Jude's life played a little role in aborting his dreams of happiness: the schoolmaster who didn't pay attention to a promising ambitious little boy, Arabella who was a totally self absorbed narcissistic woman, whose character along with Jude's character is clearly revealed during the pig killing ritual, Sue who truly loved Jude, but her love was a selfish love that was centered around her own demons of guilt and doubts. Even Jude's older son, was another extension to Jude's obscurity.In the end Jude became completely obscure to the people for whom he cared. I don't think Hardy himself totally understands the canvas he has painted and perhaps that is the reason Hardy turned to poem after Jude and wrote no other novels. It wasn't the controversy that took place in Great Britain and the United States over the scandalous nature of the book, which led him away from novels to poetry. But rather Hardy left part of his heart in Jude and was unable to retrieve it."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This book is a classic about the effect on people's lives when they choose to engage in behavior that is totally against society's norms.Story: The story itself consists of a number of vignettes. Each vignette is compelling and shows how the characters mature (or don't) well. The pacing dragged out a bit, but that is to be expected in a character driven story such as this one.Characters: This is where I am most conflicted. Hardy does a masterful job with the characters of Jude and Sue. Despite having many faults and maddening defects, I was able to feel sympathy for each character as the story progressed. Hardy's secondary characters are less impressive. Arabella is a stock villain, tempting and trapping Jude with no remorse. Phillotson is a stereotypical martyr character. If Phillotson and Arabella would have had some of the same complexities as Jude and Sue, I would have enjoyed this book a great deal more.This is a very depressing book. Jude's outlook is bleak at the beginning, and it never really improves. Still, it is a commentary on society and living in sin that is still applicable to today's world."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"If nothing else, it makes one's own life seem not so tragic!"},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"The relationship between Jude and Susannah is one of the most beautiful (and codependent) in literature. Two well-intentioned (though impulsive) people are lost to public censure and their own consciences (trying to cope with unbelievable trajedy and explaining it as God's retribution--Susannah becomes a believer, but in a most horrible and self-sacrifical way). Their downward spiral is difficult to witness, yet Jude's love for Susannah makes the read bearable. Thomas Hardy is a person whom I wish I could have known---uncanningly intelligent, at times seems to channel the voice of the higher power--clairvoyant and insightful, and yet cynical--full of tales of worst case scenarios and victims of circumstances."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"In my personal opinion, Jude the Obscure by Thomas Hardy, is the most enjoyable, fascinating and memorable book I have ever read.

That is one of the things that makes Jude the Obscure so rich. If it had been a happy love romance it wouldn't be considered a classic. It instead challenges the readers to question the them which is on marriage. Hardy attacks marriage from every angle making the reader feel that there is no hope.Jude the Obscure has a rich plot that pulls you into the story. You feel for the characters in the book. You want Jude to be able to obtain his goals. You feel frustrated when he once again gets sidetracked from his goal because of his one weakness-women. If you like the classics, especially tragedies, than you will appreciate Jude the Obscure. It is good literature, has great symbolism, and the ending scenes will leave a poignant impression that won't be easily forgotten."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure was a very interesting novel, but I would not call it enjoyable. Hardy illustrates many different ambivalent characters, none of whom carry any heroic or acclaimed traits. The characters consist of Jude who has great potential, and aspirations but most of them are largely crushed by the way he handles his life and decisions. He lets the two female characters of the novel twist him and turn him in any, and every direction. He carries no stability and does not resemble any type of human being that has nobility. He has so many dreams and he works so hard to achieve them, but often he lets outside forces influence him and sway his priorities. This is the character that Hardy bases the book around, a man who has goals but they are continually cut down throughout the book. It also irritates me that the two characters who have this great amount of influence on him actually have no honor themselves. Arabella, his first wife is a woman who gets her way through life by dishonesty. She lies about anything and everything that will get her what she wants. In the beginning she gets Jude's attention by throwing pig lard at him showing from the start her lack of refinement. She is the first character that sways Jude from his long time dream of becoming a scholar, doing this through her many lies and deceptions. The second character that contributes to the degradation of Jude's character is Sue. This woman who is in actuality his cousin not only contributes in the detour of Jude's many dreams, but she also ruins the small reputation that he has. By teasing him, and refusing to marry him she creates a relationship that causes a great deal of controversy in their society. She continues to drag Jude's emotions until the very end never coming up with any achievements, and helping Jude do the same.Although I didn't particularly enjoy any of the characters that the novel consisted of, there were some major issues that are important especially looking at the time period that the novel was written. Having been published in a time period where sensitive issues were rarely spoken about such as the ones that are addressed made the book very unique. At that time period rarely topics were addressed like they are in Jude the Obscure. The book ventures into a great deal on the issue of society and it's constrictions. Having society be one of the main topics was not what caused the most uproar at the time. The references of the church and education probably did not attain a pleasant reaction preventing many of the readers from observing the more major theme of the novel. No I did not enjoy the book, but I do not thoroughly understand the time period that the first publication occurred at, or the type of society that it was released to. Knowing that such information would probably make the book a little more appealing to me, but overall I can not say that it was an uplifting read."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure is a tragic novel that brings forth a very anti-marriage message, which was a shock to the strict Victorian society it was published in.

This one is even better than &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles.&quot; You must read it."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure by Thomas Hardy is a compelling and intriguing novel. Instead of most conventional novels that rely on plot, it places its emphasis on getting certain points and ideas across to the reader. It is a book meant to make the reader think, not as a leisurely Sunday afternoon story. The story takes us through a series of tragic events, starting first, in contrast, with Jude as a young child full of hopes and dreams, the primary dream being to go to Christminster to become a learned fellow. We follow his life as he marries Arabella, a woman who fakes a pregnancy to get Jude to marry her. Because their marriage does not have the foundation of love, it quickly crumbles and Arabella leaves Jude to go to Australia.Jude then decides to follow his old dreams and travels to Christminster, only to find it was little like what he had imagined. There he falls in love with his cousin Sue, who in order to spite Jude, marries the schoolmaster Phillotson. She despises their marriage, and soon asks her new husband to let her leave. After much contemplation, he consents, and Sue runs off with Jude. The two start a life together with Jude worshiping Sue and Sue constantly pushing Jude away. They will not commit to marriage, and live a life together looked down upon by all of society. After a while, they get a surprise from Arabella, saying she has a son that belongs to Jude, and that he will be coming to live with them. Father Time, as he was nicknamed, comes to live with them. He is a very depressed young soul, burdened by things way beyond his years. Sue and Jude have two more children out of wedlock, and constantly move from town to town to get away from the jeers of society.Just as things are starting to look up, as Sue seems to finally love Jude, Father Time decides to take things into his own hands and hangs himself as well as the other two children. Sue, being unable to cope with the situation, leaves Jude and goes back to Phillotson, saying it is her duty. Jude, left alone, is then visited by the vivacious Arabella, who gets him drunk so he will consent to re-marry her. Their marriage, however, is simply one huge lie, and Jude, from depression and a loss of hope, becomes sick and finally dies in his misery.The main topics looked at by Hardy seem to be about goals and marriage. Hardy clearly defines Jude's many goals, for instance his pursuit of knowledge and his pursuit to win the love of Sue, but just as St. Jude, the saint of hopeless causes, Jude is never able to achieve them. The idea seems to conclude that no matter what your goals are, you will never be able to attain them. This is a depressing thought, and though it may be true for some people, I believe it does not clearly express the true things that happen in people's lives. Most people, if they have a goal in sight, do achieve their goals, bringing themselves happiness.Marriage is clearly looked down upon in this book. Hardy shows marriage between both Sue and Phillotson as well as Jude and Arabella as a trap of unhappiness. He then contrasts that unhappiness with the life of \\"true\\" happiness that Jude and Sue had together, out of wedlock. This idea, in my opinion, is absolutely false. Marriage is meant to be the union of two people who love each other so much that they are willing to commit their entire lives to each other. It is meant as a means for happiness and love to blossom. Hardy's demented idea of marriage is clearly false.Even though some of the philosophies in this book tend to be skewed, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. It made me think on an entirely different level. I could sympathize Jude's pain, and though it may not be a leisurely novel, it is a classic that I recommend any educated person should study."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"When I first read this book, all I could think was &quot;Oh my God. Another tragedy!&quot; I've come to the conclusion after reading this, 'The Mayor of Casterbridge' and 'Tess of the D'Burvilles', that Hardy must have either hated life, hated women, or both. However, my appreciation of this book has risen slightly since I have had to study it within the context of the ideologies it represents. (I am currently doing a unit on Victorian Ideologies at the best uni in Western Australia.) This still doesn't make the tragic ending any less horrific and unsatisfying and frustrating and just plain awful!!! Thinking about it now makes me cry! I couldn't cry when I was reading it because I was so mad! But in retrospect, how sad. Please take my advice and DO NOT read this book if you're feeling depressed! But for an insight into the ideologies that trapped both men and women of the Victorian era, 'Jude The Obscure' is certainly well worth a read."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I liked Tess of the D'Urbervilles a lot. I could not finish Jude the Obscure--not just because it was sad and tragic. I mean after awhile I got tired of reading about and feeling sorry for Jude and Sue who make most of their problems for themselves and then whine about them. I would describe this book as &quot;agonizing.&quot; And not nearly as good as Hardy's other books that I have read. It is true that I was not able to finish the book (I got about half way through) so this may discredit my evaluation."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"One hates to start a book review with a commentary on his other reviewers....but, in this case, one has no choice: Will you AP English students who haven't even had a chance to take the class yet please cease your activities. I just finished reading too many reviews that sounded like Keanu Reeves monotoning, &quot;Yo man, like,this book was a total downer. Go catch some waves instead.&quot; But, as they say, it's a free country and, if you want to make fools of yourselves, who am I really to stand in your way?Hardy was a great lover of the poet Shelley. In fact, after Jude the obscure, he devoted the rest of his life to writing poetry based on his poetic model. In this book there are so many references (for those familiar with Shelley's poem Epipsychidion), and even one whole page particularly referencing the poem by name and giving quotes from it, that I was astounded that nobody even mentioned it. I just figured that it was you numbskull AP students again (sorry, guys, hang in there), but then I thought back to MY AP teacher and reconsidered. Even she would not have picked up on it. &quot;Epipsychidion,&quot; in Greek, means &quot;soulmate.&quot; It was one of Shelley's last poems before he committed suicide by drowning at the age of 30. I could cite several examples of it in Hardy's novel, but the last few paragraphs of the fifth section of the &quot;At Shaston&quot; chapter where the poem is mentioned by name and several lines from it are quoted will suffice. This book is really Shelley's poem in novelistic form. As such, it is to be praised mightily. &quot;Epipsychidion&quot; is essentially the story (though the narrative breaks down in parts) of the poet seeking his heavenly vision of love here on terra firma: To find that vision in Earthly form. What greater meaning on Earth is there (Shelley and Hardy would ask)? There are moments (fleeting) when Jude and his new love do seem to achieve this happiness envied by the gods. But all too soon they are thrown into despair, their dreams lieing in tatters around them, shattered by the conventions and prejudices of the world. Shelley's poem was never finished. His drowning of himself got in the way.....So what are we to gather from all this failed love, cruelty, murder,suicide and misery....THIS, that the world is a terribly unkind place for intellectual visionaries. They are the best and the brightest among us and their visions are REAL, the most beautiful things we can experience. But their attempts to implement them repeatedly result in cruel failure. The Judes of this world will never be successes, more often miserable failures....But in other worlds?..."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure, by Thomas Hardy, shows that to follow the social and religious pressures of the world only brings sorrow and misery. This theme is proven by the misinterpreted religious acts of Sue, the lack of morals in Arabella, and social pressures that keep everyone from happiness. The story focuses on the life of Jude Fawley, a poor dreamer. He is unlucky to find himself, at an early age, in the care of his embittered aunt: who does not encourage or help him to hope for a brighter future. His dream, ever since he was eleven, is to go to the town of Christminster and study among the intelligent and fantastic scholars, however this dream is never found because of the mistakes and obscure actions that Jude, or those around him, take to follow the social norms.Throughout the book, Jude rarely loses his dream of being educated at Christminster, but because of obstacles along the way he finds himself more unhappy than before, and worse off. His dream is first detoured because of the untimely \\"courtship\\" with Arabella. Although Jude had no intention of remaining with Arabella, he would not let his honor, or his social faade, be ruined by not marrying a woman who carried his baby. Since the first day of their marriage, Jude regrets having been succumbed to the pressures of society. The legal action of marriage, which is forced by social pressures, only caused misery in Jude's life. He was unable to go to Christminster, and once he met Sue, the relationship was severely delayed because he felt he must be loyal to Arabella. Arabella, on the other hand, did not live according to social pressures. Although she married Jude, she left him quickly for Australia where she seemed to be content. She had another husband in Australia and no doubt other \\"one-night stands\\" with other men that she was able to seduce or get intoxicated. But, because she had the courage (or stupidity) to disregard the society's negative opinion on a woman being disloyal to a husband she was able to live freely. Even in the end of the novel, after she realizes Jude is dead, she goes to the boat races-disregarding what a normal member of society would have done. Although her actions are not moral or virtuous, she is able to live the life of her own choosing because she does not take to the extreme religion, social pressures, or moral obligations that others do.On the other hand there is Sue. Sue through parts of the book is able to receive full happiness by ignoring social and religious pressures, but still living a virtuous and moral life. In the eyes of society, one must be legally married to engage in intercourse, but because of Sue's fear of marriage her and Jude only take on the appearance of marriage. During this time she had happy times with Jude and the children; but as soon as she would start to think about \\"right\\" in the terms of others she would become upset. Whenever Jude and Sue attempted to get married, a socially pressured action, Sue would become upset and emotional. And as soon as her children died she became frenzied and looked to strict religion as the answer to her problem. If anything in her life went \\"wrong\\" from there on out it she believed it was her duty to suffer for the cause of religion. After not accepting religion for awhile, she became the complete opposite and punished herself by marrying and having intercourse with Phillotson. Her emotions against herself and her new belief that she needed to live a strict religious life, full of pious actions only cause her sadness. She was held back from love and made miserable by the pressures of society and religion that were around her.Between these two women, the burdens of society, and the standards of the church-going world Jude was trapped. While he studied and dreamed of going to Christminster he was laughed at by the world around him because they all knew that a poor low-class man would never be allowed or able to attend there. From the beginning there was no hope for him to become an educated man because of his place in the society. The people around him and the rules that created the society kept all the people in the level of society that they already inhabited. Then because of Jude's relations with Arabella, he was forced, by society pressures to marry her-crushing his dream of going to Christminster. Although Arabella eventually leaves, he is still linked to her emotionally (because of his upbringing) and cannot fully enjoy life. Once he meets Sue, he is once again, held back by the pressures of society. Sue is his cousin, and at first, they feel that a relationship together might be wrong; then Sue goes and marries Phillotson creating more social, and now religious, barriers. Throughout the entire story Jude continues to be blocked, broken, and torn apart by social and religious pressures slamming down on him. Whether it was his unfulfilled dream of going to Christminster, his chains of marriage with Arabella, or his heart breaking relationship with Sue, Jude was not able to get past the social and religious barriers to have a happy life."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This book was ok.

The story of Jude's expectations and the downfall of his family is overwhelmingly tragic. I bought this novel for my teenager--hoping she'd appreciate how good she has it."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I first encountered Thomas Hardy through \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" where I found his determinism to yield excellent themes, plot and character. From there I went to \\"Return of the Native\\" and enjoyed it as well. Then I thought that I might tackle \\"Jude\\". This was some 40 years ago while a senior in college. I had remembered it as being sad and grim, but still worthwhile. Ostensibly I read an abridgement for, while depressing in the extreme, it did seem to move right along. Having forgotten a great deal of the narrative and story, I decided to read it again to see what new lessons I could glean.Unfortunately, this time I read the unabridged version. This tome is not only depressing, it is overly long, preachy, and boring. Hardy had decided to cover the entire Victorian world with this one. His themes take on religion, higher education, class structure of the day and, to some extent, feminism. To squeeze all these into his story and still make his convictions known to the public, he had his three protagonists--Jude, Arabella, and Sue Bridehead spew forth every mundane, arcane, and pontificating thought that he could place into their mouths--sometimes repeating the stultifying notions and concepts three of four times throughout the novel.This is a sorry threesome. They can never seem to make up their mind about anything, or if they do, they soon turn in another direction. Jude--tender hearted and learned, but weak willed and a doormat; Sue--stong and scholarly initially, she soon turns into a wretched conformist; and Arabella who, one must say knows that she is ignorant and a strumpet, is conniving and manipulative. (These three reminded me of the threesome in \\"Sophie's Choice\\" and perhaps \\"Jude the Obscure\\" is where Styron conjured them, for they are every bit as boring, long winded and tragic.)This novel, as well as \\"Sophie\\", could have ended with about a third of the ink that was finally laid to paper. Having gotten through the first three major chapters, one wishes that all three would die and that this book could be placed back on the shelf, never to be opened again.

I researched LOTS of fondue cookbooks, and this one has fantastic recipes. I think the reason I particularly love it is because we like to make fondue in a more healthful style (i.e., not cooking meat in boiling oil) and this book has an entire chapter just on fantastic broth recipes.

There are many recipes in this book explicitly designed for kids, as if parents don't know what their kids like, or that kids have a discriminating (perhaps picky though) palate? These are simply wasted pages. It's like finding a watered down mac and cheese recipe -several times- in your shiny new cookbook, which, in this case, happens to be titled, *best* fondue recipes...2) limited vision: most of the cheese fondue recipes (for example) are exactly the same: same cheeses, etc., with 1 or 2 different final ingredients. These could have easily been collapsed into one recipe, saving space for something more novel, for example, in the cheese section.3) Each recipe comes with a little \\"serve with\\" section, but these parts are clearly hurried, and unresearched. Most of the cheese recipes are \\"serve with bread\\" etc. Nothing most readers won't already know.

Bennett, ISP, author ofISP Certification-The Industrial Security Professional Exam ManualandInsider's Guide to Security ClearancesThis book goes into great detail about security systems without being too simplified. My security background until recently had been in safeguarding information on a team of 22 security professionals. Recently I took a new job as the head of corporate security and had to develop new security systems. Of course I hired professionals to bid on the job, but I lacked experience to really understand what I needed. I consulted some colleagues and of course went to ASIS international for recommendations.In the process, I was pleased to have discovered Physical Security Systems Handbook. It really helped me to work with the vendors to help them understand what I needed and better understand what they recommended. This book does an excellent job of breaking down the components of the security system (ie. strike plates, crash bars, cameras, alarms and etc). It also goes into great detail to show you how to survey existing sytems and improve them. In my case, we had to start from scratch and this book helped me through the process.If you have had similar experiences or are looking for study material for the CPP, ISP or other certifications, get this book."},{"Title":"Physical Security Systems Handbook: The Design and Implementation of Electronic Security Systems","review":"Accurate, down to the point, practical, logically presented in a project oriented approach and yet concise.

Baby Driver: A Story About MyselfBaby Driver: A Story About Myself"},{"Title":"Baby Driver: A Story About Myself","review":"The images of a strange life float along in this autobiographicalnovel, by Jan Kerouac, daughter of Jack. In many ways Ms.Kerouac led a harder life than her father, from dropping acidat twelve in the East Village to prostitution and heroin inAlbuquerque to an endless journey deep in the Amazon junglewith a madman. A searing tale of life on the road, and forher nowhere to fall back to. Like her father, Ms. Kerouacburnt the candle at both ends, and like him, died young (in1996, at 44). This is her story, of the Seventies unbound."},{"Title":"Baby Driver: A Story About Myself","review":"though i may be young i still can tell what a fabulous book is. baby driver is my most favourite book. i read it over and over. jan kerouac was an amazing woman and it's a shame she had to die at such an early age. i would have liked to have had the chance to meet her or know her. i also wonder what her last manuscrpit &quot;parrot fever&quot; would have been like if it had been published."},{"Title":"Baby Driver: A Story About Myself","review":"Jan Kerouac only saw her father twice or maybe three times in her life. Of all the things Jack Kerouc was, he wasn't a father to Jan at all. His direct inpact on her life beyond his name was minimal.I'm not sure what makes this story more compelling than other memoirs of people who abused themselves and were abused by others. There seems to be a voyeuristc appeal to reading a story like this. It is interesting but you somehow you feel a tad perverted while reading it.The annoying part of the book is her transparently flagrent use of adjectives to try and cop the flavor of her father's writing style. Her use of \\"mad\\" (I lost count) especially tripped me up and reminded me- I've read \\"Kerouac\\" and this is no \\"Kerouac\\"."},{"Title":"Baby Driver: A Story About Myself","review":"i'm not saying these things because i am a woman and am biased... jan kerouac's story of her life was better than any of her father's books. i was lucky to stumble upon a first edition hardback copy and it remains one of my top four books. i recommend it to any beat generation fans."},{"Title":"Baby Driver: A Story About Myself","review":"Alright, this book was RIDICULOUS! Jan, the main character, was a mess... the complete cliche of needy messed up women with dependency and self-esteem issues. I admit, her father was a bum, her mother was a bit spacy, but it was just redundent- one dumb decision after another. SHe was clearly selfish and clueless, I felt the need to slap her into reality several times during the course of my read. Spiraling into one disasterous episode of drug abuse, sex, and stupid relationships after another; her life never changed, it remained in a constant state of scandal. Worst of all was that she did nothing to better her situations no matter how much help she was offered. I was very unimpressed and annoyed. I expected better! Gosh...Jan made me mad... were she still alive I would right her a letter to inform her of how idiotic she was. The only good part of the whole entire book was when she was living in mexico. However, in some sick way it was rather enjoyable. It reminded me of the tommy lee and pamela anderson porn, so stupid that you laugh at them and feel so glad your life is much less pathetic. I recommend it if you ever want to feel better about your own life."},{"Title":"Baby Driver: A Story About Myself","review":"I have to admit, I first checked this book out of my local library without expecting to like it. Being a tremendous fan of Jack Kerouac, I really just wanted to read Baby Driver out of curiosity. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the family literary gene successfully made its way to Jan Kerouac. This book is excellent; her writing style is fluid and highly commendable. It's not hard reading, but that isn't to say that there isn't plenty here to ponder. I would certainly recommend this book to anyone, and not just those who are interested in Kerouac Sr. For women especially, this book is well-worth reading."},{"Title":"Baby Driver: A Story About Myself","review":"Jan Kerouac, to me filled a void with her book that had always been left after having read her fathers work. I was able to appriciate Baby Driver not just as an enjoyable read but also really relate to to it. Comparisons to Jack Kerouac aside, the engrossing story and the unique way in which Ms.Kerouac presented the sequence of events in her life as the events and not as the &quot;sequence&quot; were what made me love this book. My own copy of this book is in horrible repair, the cover taped together, pages still glued to one another in various sized clumps yet none of the clumps are actually attached to the cover itself any more. I've been looking for a new copy for years. Even the City Lights bookstore failed to turn up anything. While the old jacket cover was more endearing I'm looking forward to a new copy, so that I can once again share this book with friends. As is usually the case with the works of so many other women writers, this book has been unnoticed by most, yet is greatly enjoyed by the few of us lucky enough to stumble on to it."},{"Title":"Baby Driver: A Story About Myself","review":"Reading BABY DRIVER allows the reader to feel close to this abandoned daughter, who, in spite of all hardships, moved constantly forward through life. Her foundation was her mother, Joan Haverty, her brother, David, and her husband, John Lash. These three people loved Jan for being Jan, not because she was Jack Kerouac's daughter. And although she imitated her father--consciously or subconsciously--this is her &quot;story about myself.&quot; Her decision not to focus upon her famous father creates a sense that is palpable, that while Jack went about his life, focusing constantly on himself through introspection and self-destruction, Jan went about hers with love, searching, and optimism. Her voice is often naive, and therefore, revealing of the pain she could not see or admit to. She never expresses the anger she feels too deeply to touch, instead seeking danger, excesses, and adventure. In the end, she always has the three most important people in her life to return to, and they always, always accept her unconditionally. Looking past her forays into prostitution, drugs and petty crime, a portrait emerges of a brave, determined person, capable of love, but with a big hole in her own life that was never filled by an abandoning father."},{"Title":"Baby Driver: A Story About Myself","review":"Jan Kerouac, Jack Kerouac's only child grew up in a chaotic, nomadic childhood that swept her from the poverty-stricken tenements of Lower East Side New York to blissful shores of a tiny Mexican village. Intelligent, articulate and restlest, Kerouac was already unconsciously emulating her famous father's boozy itinerant lifestyle when she began dropping acid at the age of 12. By fifteen, pregnant by an ex-boyfriend and on the run from juvenile authorities intent upon locking her up, Jan Kerouac set out on a remarkable journey of self-discovery that she chronicles in this beautiful, absorbing memoir. This 10-year odyssey meanders from New York City to Sante Fe with side rips to Mexico, Guatemala, Columbia and Peru. Along the way, Jan introduces the reader to a motley assortment of characters including philosophical junkies, a vengeful witch, a matter of fact part time hooker and her schizophrenic Argentinean lvoer, Miguel, who hears murderous voices in his head urging him to kill her. Although this was Kerouac's first book, she was already a mesmerizing storyteller fearlessly exposing her flaws, bad choices and mistakes while somehow maintaining her dignity and sense of humor in the worst situations including a stint as a prostitute. Jan is also a very sensual writer whose lyrical prose vividly evokes the sights, sounds and smells of her settings. \\"After a spell, one of our favorite creatures came out to intertain us. The Fred Astaire spider, we called him. He was a brilliant orandge with a large pad on the end of each foot -- they loooked like actual shoes. Right into the pool of lamplight on the floor he would leap take a sort of bow, putting four of his legs together on one side and then lean over. Then the spider would do the most frenzied, intricate footwork, twisting, hopping, kicking with just one leg, then another.\\" \\"Baby Driver\\" captures perfectly the drug infused, delirious beauty of a time when finding yourself meant hitting the road to seek adventure and experience life at its most intense and chaotic."},{"Title":"Baby Driver: A Story About Myself","review":"The only reason I bought this book was because I thought it would be a nice edition to my beloved beat library. I figured it would be a mediocre attempt by a famous authors daughter to cash in on her fathers name. Wow was I ever wrong! Jan had an exceptional gift for writing descriptive narratives as we follow her adventures from the run-down tenements in NYC to eventually Washington. Each chapter switches between her childhood recollections to her adult life until the book comes full circle in the end and the two time periods connect. Brilliant. I often found myself thinking about the book during the day and couldn't wait to read more. It's an easy uncomplicated read for those who may have been tripped up by dad's spontaneous prose.My only wish was that Jan embellished more on her thought process and feelings during her adventures. Often she just reports on the incidents without expounding what she thought/felt during that time or what compelled her to do what she did. But who knows, maybe she didn't know either and was just kinda living life."},{"Title":"Baby Driver: A Story About Myself","review":"What a tragic life - anyone interested in human psychology will get a wild ride with this one. One can only guess what a different life she would have led if Jack was more involved in her life."},{"Title":"Baby Driver: A Story About Myself","review":"Daughter Jan Kerouac's own written adventure can actually be read w/ pleasure and not w/ tedium. The adventure itself has some awfully surprising twists and turns, would make a great film, and ends most unexpectedly."},{"Title":"Baby Driver: A Story About Myself","review":"Forget the last name and the heritage, this is a well written book about a life fully lived and extremely tragic at times. She met with her father rarely, but she inherited much. His lifestyle became her's and she was the embodiment of the Hippie spirit of the 1960's. The book begins with her having a miscarriage in Mexico and doesn't get much happier. The style and lifestyle are close to her father's but she is much more. It is not just a feminist view or emerging feminist view, it is story of a person on an adventure. She is one of the first feminist voices to come out of the Woodstock generation and asserts herself with this book. If you are looking for a happy read forget it. But Jan's first book is a great look into two different emerging voices and movements. For any fan of the Beats this is a nice step into the next generation."},{"Title":"Baby Driver: A Story About Myself","review":"It is exceedingly rare when the child of a famous writer who tries to be a writer too doesn't embarrass him or herself in the process.

It is most excellent."},{"Title":"Baby Driver: A Story About Myself","review":"Interesting, if not sad, stories by and about Jack Kerouac's daughter.

Alex's highlights of his family adaptation to a new country and culture provide a great sense of the emotional and operational adjustments that anyone new to a country will likely experience.I was an ex-pat from the US to Germany and found it quite amusing how similar his experiences were with my own. Everyday is a wonderful new experience- some frustrating some very amusing- overall a must do if you have an opportunity to live somewhere else in the world for a period of time.It is a very quick read- I read it on a flight from West to East Coast.ENJOY!!"},{"Title":"A Sabbatical in Madrid: A Diary of Spain","review":"I have read many travel books about short visits to Spain, and I have seen books for individuals planning to move permanently to Spain, but this book is the only one I have found that addresses the needs of individuals traveling to Spain for 4 months to a year.This interesting and easy to read book is the true story of an American family which relocates temporarily to Spain. The chapters include useful information about Spanish customs, culture and history, punctuated by charming stories of the family members' adjustment to life in Madrid.A Sabbatical in Madrid: A Diary of Spain will help the temporary resident \\"hit the ground running,\\" with enough basic information that he can establish himself quickly and make the most of his experience in Spain. I recommend it to students who will be studying in Spain (and to their parents) and to teachers and business people who will be living and working temporarily in Spain."},{"Title":"A Sabbatical in Madrid: A Diary of Spain","review":"Written in diary form, Macario's book is a great read! I have only spent limited time in Madrid but have toured large sections of the country. As a result, I found it difficult to put the book down as I found myself reading about places I had been and things that I had done. I too shopped at Corte Ingl&eacute;s and brought home Mephisto shoes. I too became curious about bull-fighting and its lore. Nevertheless, the potential reader should not look at this as an insider's book. On the contrary, once one gets over the intimacy of experiencing this family's daily life and experiences, with which everyone can identify, there is a cornucopia of information written in a very easy-to-read format. There are so many varied glimpses of the author's reactions to things that they experienced and places they went, as well as a compelling description of daily life as albeit temporary transplants in Madrid. The details are what make it fascinating. It is a travelogue as well as a fascinating story of family life. Who would not be anxious and then gratified to learn that the small children's initial antagonism to a strange place and strange school, with people saying things they did not understand, would gradually give way to relative fluency and enjoyment of the madrile&ntilde;o way of life? I highly recommend this to anyone about to spend time abroad with their family, and to anyone thinking of visiting Spain for more than a day or two. &iexcl;Vale la pena!"},{"Title":"A Sabbatical in Madrid: A Diary of Spain","review":"Excellent book: useful and very instructive and entertaining. A must read for anybody planning a visit to Spain of one day, one week, or one year. The longer the planned visit the more necessary it will become to read the book for learning about Madrid as part of Spain, and about Spain as part of Europe. This is one of the book's most remarkable strengths: it teaches us about the city and the country in a way that helps us to understand them, their peoples, and also Europe and Europeans. The book is a cornucopia of practical tips as well as insights on many things (from the Euro currency to favorite sports, and politics, and bullfights) a traveler must know when visiting a European country, Spain in this case. I think entertaining and instructive are the best words to describe this book. For example, the visit to the Museum of Queen Sofia in Madrid and the description of El Guernica (the famous painting by Picasso) and the author's reaction to it are extremely powerful and helpful for those who want to see the picture for the first or the nth time. The same can be said about his visit to El Prado and his comments about Las Meninas and Dali's paintings. In addition, the book contains innumerable passages useful for visitors who want to see the essentials in several other cities beyond Madrid. The book should be of particular interest to first-time travelers since it addresses their typical needs, affinities, and fears while providing clues on how to deal with them. The book is also a unique resource for those who have children and plan to stay for a while."},{"Title":"A Sabbatical in Madrid: A Diary of Spain","review":"I found \\"A Sabbatical in Madrid\\" to be a delightful combination of anecdotal descriptions and interesting factual tidbits. Although I myself have lived in Madrid I still learned a few new bits of trivia which further added to my enjoyment of the book. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Spain. Those who have already had the pleasure of visiting there will nostalgically smile upon reading of favorite places in Madrid and the side-trips to Segovia, Toledo and elsewhere. People who have not yet traveled to this wonderful country will get a sense of life in Madrid which will likely increase their interest in planning a journey there to experience it first-hand."},{"Title":"In Christ;: Or, The believer's union with his Lord","review":"I was in a legalistic sect for over two decades.

There are many patterns and line drawings in the book and she explains, in detail, the steps and the process of painting roses, violets, pansies, water fowl like mallard ducks on china; and tells you what colors you need to begin with, how to set up your palette and the supplies required to get started.I had read on another internet site that this book was an excellent source of information for a beginner china painter, and this is why I purchased it initially; and I agree. For I have purchased many other newer books on the subject, and can tell you from experience, this has been the most beneficial with a step by step explanation of 'how to paint a rose' and other florals with color examples on a step by step basis.Gladys Galloway also has a good book out on \\"China Painting Basics\\", for those who are just entering the field of china painting. She is deceased now, but you can still buy her products via the internet at Gladys Galloway's Studios.

The imagery of this poetry has an elegance and poignancy that is truly breathtaking.

A great gift book that I intend to include in this year's Christmas stockings."},{"Title":"The Fall & Other Poems","review":"J. Bottum, The Fall and Other Poems (St. Augustine's, 2001)I'd not thought this was going to be any great shakes, being both a book of nothing but formal poetry (I can't think of a poet save Marilyn Hacker who's been able to pull such a thing off for thirty years or so) and released under a Christian imprint, but oh how wrong I was. There was a magazine in the Poet's Market who used to say they'd only take religious poetry (forgive my awful paraphrasing) if you could do it like John Donne did or Will Inman does; Bottum certainly qualifies. In addition, the Christian messages to be found here are not delivered with the iron mallet one normally finds in religious poetry, and Bottum also has a great sense of humor, as he shows in his review-in-rhyme for the book Modern Catholic Verse:\\"Oh, and did I mention the pope?But don't let the contents-page raise too much hope,for it's after John Paul that things start to get worse:There aren't enough Catholics writing good verse.\\"Contemporary\\", I thought, means just today.It makes you wonder if old Claude McKayknew when he died more than fifty years backthat Craig and McCann would dig him up for their claque?\\"As with most books of poetry, it does flag now and again, but all in all, it's one of the better poetry collections I've read this year.

Well, I'm somewhere in the middle!This book is fine, but has a few drawbacks. Firstly, the print was too small that you needed microscopes to read it. Secondly, the authors seem to assume quite a number of things, so if you cannot get through the second chapter, you're a dead man. And finally, Millman has his own way of deriving new equations - he wants you to refer to a dozen equations from half-a-dozen chapters.Those being the downsides, now here are the positive ascpects.

I've read many textbooks in graduate courses before, but this is definitely the worst. My main issue is that the authors use confusing, overly-complex sentence structures and language. As a result, readers spend more effort just trying to parse the sentences, and less time actually understanding the material. This textbook is almost unintelligible for people new to program evaluation.For example:\\"As we have seen, evaluators using the Responsive Approach would say that their major role is an educational one. This is to lay out the organisational and programmatic situation, often presented as an extensive case study which portrays this situation in detail. This provides a starting point for program providers and other stakeholders to engage in a 'dialectic' about the current worth of the intervention. This implies a 'point-in-time' reporting strategy, leaving program providers responsible for change based on the results of the discussion (and, presumably, debate).\\" (page 231)Is the text above legible? Yes. Is it written effectively, such that you can read over 300 pages' worth of it? No way!The fun doesn't end there, however. There are almost no opportunities to test your understanding of the material. When the authors do present questions in text, they don't provide answers. Readers are left scratching their heads, wondering if they've understood the materials. Finally, there are no visual structures to help organize the materials. It's all text, so you'd better be good at building your own models in your head.I would stay away from this book - there are way better texts on program evaluation."},{"Title":"The Red House Mystery","review":"Who knew that the author of Winnie the Pooh had written such a wonderful mystery?

I became especially skeptical after learning that this was to be Milne's one-and-only foray into the field of mystery-writing. So he wouldn't have a chance to practice his aim, to practice pulling the trigger without jerking. However as it turns out, Milne hits the bulls-eye dead-center on this one try.In his introduction to this edition, Milne sets forth what he considers the criteria for a classic mystery - and he meets all those criteria in this engaging, quintessentially British drawing-room murder.Although written in 1922, \\"The Red House\\" has a timeless quality. However, aside from being gently low-key, there is one other sense in which the story does depart from what's popular for most modern murders. Milne says that in order to be a classic, a mystery must feature an amateur detective, and this amateur must reach his conclusions by pure logic - leaving any \\"microscopes (and such) at home.\\" The detective should only have access to information that the readers might also possess in their everyday, commonsense occupations. So no CSI-like reliance on the arcane habits of blowflies.The breezy bachelor detective, who serendipitously arrives at the house-party just moments after the murder - reaches his conclusions by way of simple mental re-enactments. When he espies something a shade unusual, he traces back and thinks of all the scenarios that could have led to that particular configuration of things and events. Why is a man's collar tossed by itself in a downstairs hamper? Why are the books in the manor-house library arranged in that slightly inconvenient way?When Antony Gillingham and his chosen Watson sidekick arrive at the junction where all these different re-imagined scenarios intersect - they have their motive - their means - and their killer.There are only a limited number of suspects here, so you won't be faced with having to memorize a long list of characters.

There were three versions available, one version coupled with a second book called The Mystery of the Yellow Room by Gaston Leroux. A cheaper \\"Public Domain\\" version of just the Red House Mystery and this Digireads version. Since I already had a copy of Mystery of the Yellow Room I went with this solo higher priced version by Digireads.Shortly after beginning to read the book I notice that many places in the book where characters were speaking that there were NO quotation marks. In some places this made reading the book very difficult, trying to determine who was speaking or if it was the writer describing something.I thought perhaps A.A. Milne actually might not have employed quotation marks when he wrote this book but having read several of his other books where he did use quote marks, I did not think this would be the case just because this was a Mystery book.So I bought the cheaper \\"Public Domain\\" Kindle version of this book (no sample available to try) and ta-dah the quote marks were there (there was no Table of Contents in that version though).

It seems to be written for an even younger audience and for me, now, I found it dragged and was VERY repetitive. The interplay between Bill and Anthony was annoying and had an almost homoerotic element to it (not that there's anything wrong with that!). A.A.

Milne didn't cheat. You can solve this msytery, but chances are very great that you won't. Now 90 years old, the novel still is a great read. The Milne who wrote many wonderful plays for adults always displayed a subtle wit. For example, no one has ever surpassed his hero's comment on the least likely place to look for something hidden. In construction the book is loaded with original ideas that later writers copied from the murder in the locked room to the underground secret passage. I decided to write a review mainly to correct the statements in other reviews that Milne wrote no other mysteries. He didn't write any other mystery novels, but he did write a very wonderful mystery play entitled THE FOURTH WALL (old copies available on Amazon) Also two New York revivals of his \\"problem\\" plays in recent years should help revive the reputation of the author who too many think of as a children's writer who wrote about Winnie the Pooh.

In fact, I had to make myself keep reading it over a few pages. Once Gillingham and Bill get together with each other it's a lot more entertaining. It never achieves greatness but (in my opinion) don't think the author was aiming for the ultimate literary mystery masterpiece. I think he was writing a nice, light mystery with a dash of humour thrown in. I'm not even sure if it had been intended to be published, the dedication pretty much days that he wrote it solely for his father. I did take one star away because a few times 'Antony' becomes 'Anthony' and the chapters could have been spaced a little better. Which is a common problem with the &#34;digitized by a community of volunteers&#34;. These volunteers must have no idea of spelling, grammar or formatting."},{"Title":"The Red House Mystery","review":"Surprised to find Pooh's author when perusing my eBook mystery anthology, I thought I'd indulge my curiosity to see what Milne did in another format entirely. I was treated to a pleasant mystery with well constructed characters and plot. It's set over only a few days, primarily at the manor house of landlord Mark Ablett. Mark's ne'er-do-well brother Robert arrives after fifteen years in Australia. After apparently arguing with Mark, a shot is heard. Mark's cousin Cayley, his assistant of sorts, with newly arrived visitor Antony, investigates and finds Robert shot dead in the \`office'. All evidence seems to point to Mark, but with Mark's being missing and having apparently fled and no gun to be found, whodunit and why are problematical. Antony voluntarily assumes the role of investigator, playfully taking on friend and fellow guest Bill to be Watson to his Holmes, and engaging in observation and deduction to attempt to come to the bottom of things. Milne develops the story line well, and draws things to an unexpected conclusion. Characters Mark, Antony, and to lesser extents Bill and Cayley are well made. There are no women in central roles and only a handful in peripheral ones. Milne's writing directly to the reader is comfortably familiar and his style in this format is gently flowing. Wishing there were other Milne mysteries with Antony and Bill or without them, this short mystery is definitely worth one's time, reading, and enjoyment."},{"Title":"The Red House Mystery","review":"Having read many of Milne's Winnie the Poo stories as a child, I was very surprised to learn that he had also written a detective story. The Red House Mystery was his first and last one. I find that a bit sad as I thought it was a good read. The story was a bit draggy for me in places, especially the first 2-3 chapters but then again, this is a British detective story and I often find the pace of these things somewhat slow to my liking. About a chapter after the murder of a visitor to the Red House, I figured out who the murderer was and also the identity of the man that was murdered. Basically, the joy of the story was watching the author roll it out. It reminded me of the old Columbo TV detective stories where the murderer and how it was done is known to the TV viewer and the fun is in watching Peter Falk work his magic on determining who it is and how the killer did it. For that reason, this book is certainly worth getting and reading. If I had to compare it to some others that I have read that were written back around the time that Milne wrote this one (Milne wrote this in 1922), I'd have to say that it is reminiscent of Agatha Christie in terms of style of writing. Wording and the way words were put together back then have a certain style about them. In my opinion, although I found Christie's novels a bit more \\"mysterious\\" than this one by Milne, I think if you like Christie, you will like this novel as well."},{"Title":"The Red House Mystery","review":"So thrilled to have been given this by a friend.

What a great satirical look at mysteries from the author that brought us Winnie the Pooh. I will caution you that it is a classic and therefore has an older style of writing. Don't expect a fast paced thrill ride. It is an easy read with easy characters to get along with."},{"Title":"The Red House Mystery","review":"This is an enjoyable read. It is set in the English countryside during a less complicated, quaint time. The characters are fun and the Holmes/Watson aspect between the 'detectives' is amusing. The motive for the murder is age old. One minute, I thought I knew who the murderer was, the next I wasn't sure. Some of the terminology was unfamiliar to me, so I was glad there was a dictionary readily available.This Kindle version has a few typos and extra spaces, but they do not interfere with the flow.

Anyone who's read any mystery novels at all will be familiar with the tropes -- an English country house in the first half of the twentieth century, a locked room, a dead body, an amateur sleuth, a helpful sidekick, and all the rest.It's a clever story, ingenious enough in its way, and an iconic example of Agatha Christie / Dorothy Sayers -type murder mysteries. If you've read more than a few of those kinds of books, you might find this one a little predictable, but it's fun despite that.It's particularly of note, however, because Raymond Chandler wrote about it extensively in his essay \\"The Simple Art of Murder.\\" After praising it as \\"an agreeable book, light, amusing in the Punch style, written with a deceptive smoothness that is not as easy as it looks,\\" he proceeds to take it sharply to task for its essential lack of realism. This book -- which Chandler admired to an extent -- was what he saw as the iconic example of what was wrong with the detective fiction of his day, and to which novels like \\"The Big Sleep\\" or \\"The Long Goodbye\\", with their hard-boiled, hard-hitting gumshoes and gritty realism, were a direct response.So this book's worth reading not just because it's \\"an agreeable book, light, [and] amusing in the Punch style\\", but also because reading it will give a deepened appreciation for the later, more realistic detective fiction of writers like Hammett and Chandler."},{"Title":"The Red House Mystery","review":"This was the most fun I've had reading a mystery since I read the Hardy Boys as a kid. It seems you should be reading it under the covers with a flashlight. In The Red House Mystery, A.A. Milne (of Pooh fame) lets us pal around with Tony Gillingham, a jack-of-all-trades who is trying his hand a being a detective. The setting is an English country house loaded with guests, including the British major, the willful actress, and the dim-but-lovable young athlete. These are stock characters; Tony and his friend Bill even gleefully refer to each other as &quot;Holmes&quot; and &quot;Watson&quot;. It's all very playful, despite the corpse. So much so that Tony and Bill are guilty about how much fun they are having.There are tons of mentions of amateur theatricals and acting. Tony is playing at being a detective and so is the reader, which draws you into the story alongside him. In a way you are competing with Tony and Bill to solve the crime. It's a fair contest: only amateurs allowed. Milne gives you all the clues, even to the point of saying things like &quot;This would be important later.&quot; In the reader's head a siren goes off and a sign lights up saying &quot;CLUE&quot;. Tony and Bill bounce theories off each other and the theories change as the clues mount up. Still, Tony is always ahead of Bill (and probably the reader). He knows the real question in a mystery is not &quot;How?&quot; but &quot;Why?&quot;The best parts are the gasps of surprise and moments of anticipation while we wait in darkness for the sounds of approaching footsteps. Milne has a great way of setting the mood, whether it's nervous tension or eager curiosity. A fun mystery is like opening up a big present: You can't wait to know what it is. Milne conveys this sense of &quot;I need to know&quot; in this his one-and-only mystery novel. If you're like me, you'll need to know and keep saying to yourself, &quot;One more chapter and I'll put out the light.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Red House Mystery","review":"This is Milne's only foray into writing an adult-level book (unfortunately), having written it for the sake of his father (a consummate lover of mysteries). A country side mansion is a common gathering point for several of the upper crust of British society. One of the guests invites a friend of his over to meet the host. As the friend arrives the host suddenly dies behind a locked door. Foul play is immediately suspected, but the police are stumped. Somewhat formulaic, this mystery had a couple of unexpected twists and turns which kept me guessing, until near the end, what had happened to the host (yes, even the manner of his death is mysterious). I was pleasantly suprised when I realized that all of the data to solve the mystery had been there all along, but I had missed it! This smacked a little of Christie and Holmes wrapped together (perhaps an unfair comparison, but I did enjoy this book).

Greene in the introduction of A. A. Milne's \\"The Red House Mystery.\\" Since Greene is considered the leading expert on John Dickson Carr--one of the greatest Golden Age detective novelists--I was tremendously excited by his recommendation and plunged into the book straightaway.It took me a little under two weeks to finish. Yes, for a book that isn't even two hundred pages. The story features Antony Gillingham and Bill Beverley as a rather unlikely Holmes and Watson who set out to unravel a bizarre murder at the Red House. Although Gillingham and Beverley make an interesting pair, the way they tackle the problem is a bit too languid and leisurely for my taste (and I usually thrive on cozy mysteries), and since there is virtually no action and almost no other major characters to focus on--well, it's not exactly a page-turner. There are a few nifty plot tricks--one twist involving a door key is particularly clever--but the resolution (which falls back on that most irritating of cliches, the letter of confession) doesn't carry much in the way of suspense or surprise.Still, it's all very witty and well-written, and the droll humor that spawned \\"Winnie-the-Pooh\\" is very much in evidence. Anglophiles will treasure it for its delineation of mid-1920s England alone. But I was expecting a masterpiece, and as a detective novel, \\"The Red House Mystery\\" is no masterpiece--but then again, Mr. Milne is no John Dickson Carr."},{"Title":"The Red House Mystery","review":"This is a world gone by but fun to read the mystery. I did figure it out quite early, though. Well written and the characters are fun. He really is a fun writer to read."},{"Title":"The Red House Mystery","review":"A. A. Milne is best known as the author of the 'Winnie the Pooh' stories but before he began writing stories for his little boy he penned this story for his mystery loving father. This one has all the classic mystery novel elements, an amateur detective, a house party in the English countryside, and, of course, a body discovered in a locked room. Young, handsome and wealthy Andrew Gillingham had decided that he would stop by the Red House to visit an old friend who was at a house party there. Their reunion was cut short though when the owner of house was discovered dead in the library. All the usual mystery elements are present, the red herrings, the subplots, hints of romance, hidden motives and secret passages all twist and turn into a merry chase until all is revealed in the final chapter. It is a fun read, and while many readers will reach the conclusion before our hero there will still be a twist or two that will come as a surprise.This was originally published in 1922 when the cliched mystery novel elements this story abounds in were all fresh and new. For the most part the story holds up well although at times it does begin to drag a bit. It is worth the effort to push on through the slower bits to get to the charming finale - and to try to spot any forerunners of Christopher Robin's friends."},{"Title":"The Red House Mystery","review":"During a weekend party at the Red House, guests become amateur sleuths when a murder is discovered.

Since I've read every Agatha Christie and Sherlock Holmes book there are, the discovery of another mystery in roughly their style was a sweet surprise.This mystery is not made up of crazy cozy-mystery ladies, or outlandish plot contrivances. It is a gently moving, logical and totally satisfying mystery. This is so refreshing in an age where authors sometimes feel like they have to come up with something unique to capture the attention of their readers. The Red House Mystery kept me interested and delighted throughout its entirety. I highly recommend it for lovers of the Golden Age of mysteries style."},{"Title":"The Red House Mystery","review":"This was a very pleasant read. I did not \\"figure it out\\" before the end. It is an older book, and some may be put off by the out of date language, but I found it quaint.

Although it started interestingly enough, it seemed to bog down occasionally with just too many details, causing me to lose interest. I did finish it, but it was not one of the best mysteries I have read."},{"Title":"The Red House Mystery","review":"People who enjoy British mysteries will like this book - Not as exciting and clever as Agatha but good nevertheless!"},{"Title":"The Red House Mystery","review":"The so-called \\"Golden Age of Detective Fiction\\" was a largely British phenomenon that took place in the 1920s and 1930s and its masters are among the most well-known names in the mystery genre (Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers, Ngaio Marsh, etc.). The stories of this time had a number of conventions (which they did not invent, but certainly popularized), and they were so prevalent that several essays were written codifying them. These will be familiar to anyone with a passing familiarity with older mysteries: the amateur detective, the country house, a murder, a cast of suspects staying at the house, all clues revealed to the reader and sleuth at the same time, hints of romance, etc. Apparently, the man who later gave the world \\"Winnie the Pooh\\" was interested enough in the detective genre that he decided to have a stab at it himself. The resulting book, which, while anemically titled, has to be considered a very entertaining example of the \\"Golden Age\\" novel.The protagonist is Andrew Gillingham, a young man receiving a fine inheritance who, rather than gadding about (a laBertie Wooster), finds it interesting to try out different professions for a year or so. One day, while out in the country, he realizes that a good friend is a guest a nearby manor house. He heads out for a brisk walk to pay a surprise call on his friend, only to stumble into the immediate aftermath of a murder (in the office, with a revolver). It doesn't take long for him to realize that instead of being a supporting player in the police investigation, he can, instead, try out a new profession -- that of detective.And so the game is afoot, as the sharp young man uses his powers of logic and deduction to try and reason out the murder (with the typically plodding help of his sidekick friend). If you've read many of these kinds of stories, you'll probably be able to figure it out reasonably easily (although I didn't), but the real charm of the book is in the light, witty prose, which carries the reader along effortlessly. It's a style likely to appeal to fans of P.G. Wodehouse, though obviously not as farcical as that. It's well worth reading if you've got a taste for the world of Britain between the wars. Had Milne not made his fortune with Pooh Bear, this book demonstrates that he certainly could have done well as a mystery writer and he did write several other mystery plays and stories, just not novels.The real mystery is why this particular novel has never been made into a film!"},{"Title":"The Red House Mystery","review":"(3.5 stars) It's great fun reading a murder mystery by the author of the Winnie the Pooh. Set at Red House, the country home of Mark Ablett, the novel opens on a party weekend, with most of the houseguests away from the house playing golf or tennis. Ablett has just received a letter from his brother Robert, who has been living in Australia for the past fifteen years, and \\"when a gentleman goes to Australia, of course, he has his reasons...\\" Robert, the family embarrassment, intends to visit Mark that afternoon. Shortly after Robert's arrival, shots are heard inside Mark's locked office.By coincidence, Antony Gillingham has just arrived at the house to visit with his friend Bill Beverley, who is a guest at Red House. When Antony hears the shots and learns that the office is locked, he and Matthew Cayley, Mark's distant cousin who acts as his secretary, rush around to the back of the house to peer in the window, where they see the prone body of Mark Ablett. Antony, always looking for exciting new activities to occupy the times that he is not traveling, teams up with Bill Beverley, who has been away from the house at the time of the murder, to try to catch the killer.A typical \\"locked room mystery,\\" the novel features characters who may not be all they seem to be, acting for mysterious motives, which range from love to revenge. Servants overhear bits of conversation which offer clues. The discovery of a secret passage, the appearance of a ghost, and a convenient lake to hide evidence all become part of the plot, which is more cerebral than action-packed. Antony's photographic memory aids him in getting at the truth about the murder, well before the local constabulary.Written in 1922, before Winnie the Pooh was even \\"born,\\" the book was a gift for Milne's father, a retired headmaster who loved mysteries. Milne had written twelve plays, at this point in his life, and that background serves him in good stead here, as the book has the feel of a long play, depending more on dialogue than on action, and featuring many of the clich&eacute;s of locked room mysteries. Avoiding the need for difficult transitions between scenes, Milne often addresses the reader directly to offer information, an awkward conceit which keeps the reader at a distance. At one point, Bill Beverley affectionately teases Antony Gillingham. \\"Silly old ass,\\" he chides, reminding the reader instantly of the \\"silly old bear\\" who will make his debut in just four years. n Mary WhippleWinnie the Pooh 80th Anniversary EditionNow We Are Six Deluxe EditionSunny Side: Short Stories and Poems for Proper Grown-UpsFirst Plays of A A Milne (Dodo Press)Second Plays by A. A. Milne"},{"Title":"The Red House Mystery","review":"The Red House Mystery is an amateur detective story written by the author of the Winnie the Pooh books. Milne wrote his only novel for his father, an avid reader of mysteries. Could the children's book author really write an entertaining mystery? Not especially.Set in an English country house, the story begins by introducing the owner, Mark, having breakfast with his guests while complaining about a later meeting to be had with his estranged brother, Robert. Once the guests leave to play golf for the day, Anthony, a friend of one of the guests, wanders up to the house to discover Robert dead and Mark nowhere to be found. Anthony and his friend, Bill, one of the guests, take it upon themselves to investigate the mystery.Antony is Sherlock Holmes-light; he shares some qualities with the famous sleuth (and even refers to his sidekick as \\"my Watson\\"), but he fails to really distinguish himself, hovering in Holmes' shadow. He knows he has a similar role; he just doesn't pull it off as masterly. After all, he's just playing detective for a little bit of adventure. The mystery itself seems intriguing initially, but the solving of it is pretty uninteresting. Antony makes some smart deductions along the way, but they're more tedious than exciting to read about. The stock characters added nothing except for Mark's cousin, whose interests aren't explained till the end. And once the mystery gets solved (in a rather cliche manner), there's little satisfaction to be had. Antony and Bill are just having fun with their first chance to solve a murder mystery, but the plot and simple style fail to convey their fun, nor do they present anything that hasn't already been done."},{"Title":"The Red House Mystery","review":"Of course it's very hampering being a detective, when you don't know anything about detecting, and when nobody knows that you're doing detection, and you can't have people up to cross-examine them, and you have neither the energy nor the means to make proper inquiries; and, in short, when you're doing the whole thing in a thoroughly amateur, haphazard way. -A.A. Milne (The Red House Mystery)A.A. Milne is, of course, best remembered for his series of Winnie the Pooh tales. In addition, he wrote for the famous British humor magazine Punch, was a fine playwright and, though he served in WWI, became an outspoken pacifist. In the midst of all this, he wrote one of the classic English drawing room mysteries--The Red House Mystery. The book ends on a note which seems to imply that further adventures will follow, but sadly none did.The Red House is a British manor, home to Mark Ablett, and gathering place for his fun loving friends. But the bucolic setting is disrupted when Ablett's long lost brother, black sheep of the family, is murdered and Mark goes missing. Two guests, Antony Gillingham, a sort of Holmsian jack of all trades, and Bill Beverley, a mildly dense Watson-like sidekick, take it upon themselves to solve the crime. What follows is a reasonably dated but still amusing &quot;intuitive&quot; mystery. Raymond Chandler apparently went out of his way to attack the story as one of the worst examples of the genre, wholly lacking in genuine criminological methodology and requiring enormous intuitive leaps on the part of the &quot;detectives&quot;. Still, take it for what it is and it offers a pleasant enough reading experience.GRADE: C+"},{"Title":"The Red House Mystery","review":"The title intrigued me, and the fact that this whodunnit was written by the creator of Winnie The Pooh compelled me to check it out. Once I got past the plethora of unnecessary speech tags, profusion of semicolons, and what would be considered today misplaced commas, I found myself enjoying The Red House Mystery. But it failed to captivate me.Milne's Holmes-Watson attachment to amateur sleuths Bill Beverley and Antony Gillingham is humorous but Gillingham, the deductive brains of the two, lacks any true sense of intellectual depth and came off to me like a mere puppet for the author to speak through.A man's been shot to death in a country manor. Though only the estranged missing brother appears to have a motive, the police give far too much latitude to the other guests without any concrete evidence to eliminate any of them as suspects. But without this flawed contrivance Antony and Bill wouldn't be able to conduct their secret investigation, in the course of which they stumble upon a secret passageway which they far too easily discover how to enter from the library. From that point on I took everything with a grain of salt in order to plow on, because by then I HAD TO KNOW how the story ended."},{"Title":"The Red House Mystery","review":"NOT REALLY A REVIEW JUST A VOTE FOR THIS DELIGHTFUL BOOK.

I remember that I was quite lost down the tubes at the beginning of my trip to London a few weeks ago. Meanwhile the mainstream of people ran down the escalators in a hurry and fetched a seat in one of the trains; I studied an information board about the different stations. This is why it's so funny to read about a girl who knows almost every station in London. It was good to follow the thoughts of a Londoner once and of course her view of visiting tourist attractions. The book generally kept my interest going and I realized it could be more excitement going on than just daily stress below the streets of London. I just wish that the author had written a little more about the warmth down there and for example the wind coming from the trains, so that if I hadn't recently been there I could somehow have imagined the feeling.I'd recommend the book to be read by everybody who wants an exciting book that goes right on the story without to many metaphors or overbearing social issues. Mainly I recommend teenagers to read it though, it's not really that frightening as in the quotes of magazines and it is kind of predictable. For what I know, teenagers mainly need to stress off and this book was a perfect get-away."},{"Title":"The Underground Conspiracy","review":"You know, I bought this simply because it featured the Tube, and frankly I'm a Tube nut. (Don't run away!) In terms of the book, I was left wholly satisfied. The problem for me, as an adult, was this is a children's book. Nothing wrong with that either, as I like some children's books -- but they ought not seem like children's books (Harry Potter for instance).This one had such an obvious \\"this is where the author is going\\" predictability about it, it was irritating. Sure, there were some nice surprises showing how good a True Friend can be (kudos to the author) but they were outweighed by \\"I know what's next.\\""},{"Title":"Clinical Approach to Infection in the Compromised Host","review":"&quot;With admirable clarity the authors- all highly regarded in their respective fields- present the clinician with a supremely readable text.

This book will not let me go; I finished it, but cannot place it on my bookshelf. I continue to read it and even take it on trips.In the beginning of Peace, Brueggemann sets up a towering metaphor: \\"The Brickyard.\\" As anyone who has read Exodus (or seen \\"The Ten Commandments\\") knows, the children of Israel were slaves to Pharaoh. They made bricks for Egypt.In Brueggemann's eyes, the brickyard becomes the oppressive, demanding, soulless spirit of our (or any) dehumanizing age.Most of us understand the heartbreaking futility of the brickyard; we see it every day - in our children, our neighbors, our fellow workers, ourselves. The confluence of technology, economics, marketing, government, health, employment, and religion (and other factors) has created a new and sometimes crushing slavery. More than once, I was deeply moved at the devastating extent of The Brickyard.From that, he presents Shalom as the antithesis of everything the coercion of the age represents. In short, Shalom is the Kingdom of God.\\"Peace\\" is an eloquently written powerhouse; the best book on the Kingdom of God I've read. I have finished reading Peace. But I suspect that Peace has not finished reading me.BTW, Brueggemann is often criticized by conservatives for his thoughts on human sexuality. But, I think what he is really saying is that morality must flow from the revelation of the Kingdom of God, and not from \\"it is written.\\" Heart-deep morality can only be forged in experience with a healing and delivering Yahweh.

Robbie Miller Kaplan's book &quot;How to Say It When You Don't Know What to Say&quot; takes this basic tenet a step beyond.&quot;How to Say It...&quot; brings to the table an enormous amount of research and some good old common sense about how to respond to those who are suffering. What we learn is not only what and what not to say and how and how not to say it at these often painful times, but what we also begin to understand is why we respond the way we do.

When energy is no longer cheap or plentiful, how will we adapt? One way to approach this question is to look ahead and see how technologies such as solar and wind energy can help. Turns out, however, that the feasibility of these technologies is also dependent to a large degree upon plentiful, cheap oil. So, in addition to looking ahead, it's probably a good idea to look to the past. How did people of a few generations back manage such simple tasks as refrigeration (for example), without relying upon constant availability of electricity and fossil fuel?This book is a good resource for those who want to investigate this question. It offers many examples of very practical implements, most of which can be built with simple tools, some basic skills, and hard work. \\"Hard work\\" may be the most operant item in that list, and throughout the book are sprinkled brief aphorisms encouraging one to embrace the work ethic: \\"the manly part is to do with might and main what you can (Emerson)\\"; \\"keep your shop and your shop will keep you\\"; \\"Taste the joy that springs from labor (Longfellow)\\".Good illustrations; spare, to-the-point writing st"},{"Title":"Handy farm devices and how to make them,","review":"This book is filled with tons of little tricks and devices to make farm life easier.

Handy Farm Devices by Rolfe Cobleigh is a must own to anyone who owns or is even thinking about owning their own homestead. This book allows you to make just about anything you could possibly need around a private farm/homestead. Just to name a few things that are tucked away in the pages of this litte gem are How To: use a carpenters square, build stairs, temporary animal housing, a cellar, make your own dresser drawers, feeders for your animals, make a chicken coop from a barrel (and other chicken, pig, horse, and cattle housing designs as well), laying cement foundations, simple housing plans, how to build a concrete stone house for $400 dollars, build your own wheelbarrel, plus various orchard and planting ideas as well as other ideas that are so numerous I can't possibly mention them all.The only thing this book will not do is give you a step by step guide on how to go about doing X,Y, and Z. It gives you pointers and a general push in the right direction, but it doesn't give you in depth direction. I only see this becoming problematic if you were to take on the task of building one of the houses described in this book. However, I don't see in depth directions being an issue for most of the devices mentioned. Even a modest amount of ingenuity should be sufficient in most cases.

The sparse phrasing of Seidensticker's may be nearer to the original and from the point of view of following the plot it is certainly easier but Arthur Waley's translation is altogether more beautiful. In fact you become so mesmerized with the delicate description of the physical and the emotional that you fall prey to a kind of love affair with the book that Genji himself would have no difficulty understanding. The story is as much about each of the women as it is about Genji. Reviewers who have labelled Genji a playboy have completely missed the point; playboys are by definition carefree and non-suffering. In contrast it is the very fine nature of Genji's temperament and the intensity of his emotional attachments that lay him open to experience the most painful awarenesses. Moreover he is quite unable to banish past episodes from his consciousness or his conscience. Sexual attraction serves largely as a catalyst to romantic adoration rather than as a goal in its own right. If you study the range of language employed by Waley you will empower yourself with a vast arsenal of English phrasing. It is unlikely that any other book offers more from this point of view and I'm including here Proust, Joyce and the Bible. To the western reader it is an opening to a sensibility that many do not associate with Asia. To the Japanese student who has reached a high level of English a careful reading of Genji would be worth more than all the vocabulary books on the market. To both of them though, it would be a nourishing of their consciousness and although this undoubtedly leads to a multiplication of pleasure, it will also lead to a corresponding potential to contact with pain. Such is life and therefore I give to this work of art the greatest accolade, it captures something true, and beautiful. If you should find seidenstecker too matter of fact just try Arthur Waley, it is a matter of art."},{"Title":"The Tale of Genji (Vintage Classics)","review":"This is a review of the abridged translation of The Tale of Genji by Edward G. Seidensticker.The Tale of Genji was written in the 11th century by Lady Murasaki Shikibu, and its story is set in the same period. It is universally considered THE great Japanese traditional novel, and one of the greatest works of world literature.Seidensticker's abridged translation is about one-quarter as long as the complete work, and includes chapters 1, 4-5, 7-14 and 17. These chapters hang together fairly well as a self-contained narrative that gives a flavor for the complete work. The story begins with the lady of the Paulownia Court, a kind and refined woman with whom the Emperor falls in love. Because she lacks support at court, she is hounded to death by those jealous of her, including Kokiden, the Emperor's wife. But before she dies she gives birth to the Emperor's son, Genji. Since, like his mother, he lacks influential relatives at court, the Emperor keeps him a commoner (and hence ineligible to become Emperor). But from his childhood, Genji's beauty, elegance, artistry and aesthetic sensibility leaves others awestruck, and frequently in love with him. In the period of the novel, upper-class people occupied themselves primarily with poetry composition, painting, ritual activities and romantic affairs. These affairs were largely tolerated, as long as they were conducted discreetly. Much of the novel is taken up with Genji's affairs, which lead him into near-disaster more than once. Eventually, he is discovered in the apartments of Oborozukiyo, sister of Kokiden. Genji might have gotten away with this under his father's reign, but by this time his father has been succeeded by the Suzaku Emperor, who is largely controlled by his mother, Kokiden. So the scandal leads to Genji going into exile. At the end of this abridgement, Genji returns from exile, in part through the intervention of the spirit of his father, who appears to the Suzaku Emperor in a dream, and then Genji's illicit son succeeds to the throne. We eventually see Genji returned to his old honors at court, and planning on bringing to court the Akashi Lady, whom he met while in exile and who became the mother to Genji's daughter.One might understand Genji as a man always searching for the mother whom he never knew. In the \\"Evening Faces\\" chapter, Genji has an affair with an unnamed woman whose hold on him seems mysterious: \\"She was of an extraordinarily gentle and quiet nature. ... She did not appear to be of very good family.\\" (41) This could just as easily be a description of Genji's mother. This woman dies suddenly (seemingly as the result of malign spirits), so metaphorically Genji loses his mother once again. His great love is Fujitsubo, the new consort of the Emperor (Genji's father), whom the Emperor chose precisely because she reminds everyone of Genji's mother (22). Fujitsubo is also attracted to Genji, and their illicit relationship results in Genji forcing himself on her and fathering a son whom everyone believes to be the current Emperor's (86-88). (Indeed, this child eventually becomes the Reizei Emperor.) After this, Fujitsubo more and more isolates herself from Genji to avoid any suspicion. The other major woman in Genji's life is Murasaki. When Genji discovers her, she is a ten-year-old child. He finds out that, like him, she lost her mother while young. Perhaps even more significantly, she is Fujitsubo's niece (74)! Her father still lives, but she does not live with him, and he has not shown much interest in her. So Genji spirits her away in the middle of the night, planning on raising her to be his ideal woman.This novel could also be seen as presenting a sort of Buddhist perspective on romantic love. Genji sees the beauty in everything. This is part of the reason that he is attracted to so many different women. And in the aesthetic of this book, beauty is accentuated by its very transience. The person we love today may die tomorrow. This is a distinctively Zen perspective. But Genji is also trapped by his attachment to the people whom he loves from achieving enlightenment. Listening to a monk intone the scriptures \\"Genji was filled with envy. Why did he not embrace the religious life? He knew... that the chief reason was\\" Murasaki (208).The position of women in Genji's society is complex. Genji says of women, \\"The clear, forceful ones I can do without. ...a woman who is quiet and withdrawn and follows the wishes of a man even to the point of letting herself be used has much the greater appeal\\" (62-63). On the other hand, the novel does have a genuine heroine: Fujitsubo. She resists her attraction to Genji and then resigns as Empress and becomes a nun, all for the good of her son. The ambivalent position of women is well illustrated by the interaction between Genji's wife, Aoi, and the Rokujo Lady. After Genji ends his affair with the latter, his wife's servants embarrass her at a public event. Then when Aoi is pregnant, she becomes seriously ill when possessed by a spirit: \\"It was not Aoi's voice, nor was the manner hers. Extraordinary-and then he knew that it was the voice of the Rokujo lady. He was aghast.\\" (162) The Rokujo Lady's spirit has \\"gone walking\\" in her sleep, attacking the object of her anger and jealousy. The story clearly takes this as a serious possibility, but we can also see it as a symbolic playing out of the dangers of affairs and jealousy.There are many aspects of this story that will seem alien or even disturbing to contemporary Western readers. As one of my students put it, colloquially but succinctly, \\"Genji seems like a player\\": it is hard to even keep track of how many affairs he has over the course of the novel. And his relationship with young Murasaki is, to be equally colloquial, creepy. She is frightened when he comes in the night to take her away, but he tells her \\"You are not to sulk, now, and make me unhappy. Would I have done all this for you if I were not a nice man? Young ladies should do as they are told.\\" (103) He takes her virginity just a few years later, after essentially treating her as his daughter.But we must also keep in mind that Genji's behavior was not regarded in his culture the way that it would be in our own. And we must recognize Genji's admirable qualities. He sees something unique and beautiful in each of the women that he has a relationship with, and does not merely forget them afterwards: \\"His manner as always gentle and persuasive, it is doubtful that he said anything he did not mean. There were no ordinary, common women among those with whom he had had even fleeting affairs, nor were there any among them in whom he could find no merit; and so it was, perhaps, that an easy, casual relationship often proved durable.\\" (235) This is perhaps more than many people today could say."},{"Title":"The Tale of Genji (Vintage Classics)","review":"It's amazing how so many of the people writing negative reviews on this book are focused on what they see as moral or philosophical content.They seem to miss the fact that Lady Murasaki was writing in the context of the society at that time, and exploring those same moral conflicts within the reality of both society and individual consciousness. Genji is not a hero placed on a pedestal, Murasaki examines him in the most honest way, showing both the good and the bad, the beauty and the beast; and that's what makes it such a great novel. It has integrity of subject rarely seen in our modern formulas and Hollywood endings.In modern texts the writing formulas is a hero who goes through a series of climaxes, culminating in a victory or defeat where the protagonist discovers something about themselves, but with Genji, the reader discovers something about themselves, and maybe that's too disturbing for some people.In addition, it passes on an abundance of information on Japanese history and culture of the Heian area. It is a significant work relating to the Japanese Incense Ceremony called Kodo, of which today the most famous game is called \\"Genji Koh\\" or \\"Incense of the Genji.\\""},{"Title":"The Tale of Genji (Vintage Classics)","review":"This does appear to be the unabridged Seidensticker translation, and it's great to finally have a full Genji for the kindle.

It does not appear to be abridged."},{"Title":"The Tale of Genji (Vintage Classics)","review":"The first moment of jarring strangeness in Lady Murasaki's great novel comes when her hero, the shining Genji, settles for the embraces of a young boy go-between, rather than his reluctant sister. From there, the novel goes on to explore ever more complex psychological dimensions of incest, the Don Juan complex, and married love. Each chapter is composed with the care and precision of a poem, and the author's elusive / allusive prose conceals the Jane Austen-like precision with which she charts her two heroes' foibles and self-delusions. Somewhere in between Seidensticker's robust and spare translation and Arthur Waley's Proustian expansion it may, perhaps, be possible for the English reader to grasp the lineaments of the original work. The greatest novel ever written? The first psychological novel in any language? The first anti-hero (Kaoru, Genji's nephew) in world literature? Each of these statements could be defended, but perhaps it would be more to the point to say that the Genji should be as essential to the truly educated reader as Homer or Tolstoy"},{"Title":"The Tale of Genji (Vintage Classics)","review":"In the book's defense, Aristotle said &quot;It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.&quot; Many of the events described in this book seem unacceptable to the Western 21st century moral code, BUT neither Lady Murasaki nor Genji were 21st century Westerners.Many cultures around the world still have arranged marriages, the arrangements happen while the bride (and groom) are still children, sometimes the groom is much older, so there's nothing really THAT strange about that. From what I gleaned Genji didn't have physical relations with Murasaki until she was old enough so really, no harm no foul.As far as the cultural content this book was fascinating, you have to factor in when it was written that it had to be translated into English which I would assume was no easy task for any translator; sometimes &quot;ideas&quot; don't translate as well as one would hope.Other than that the book was a hard read but definitely worth it, I found myself almost craving to read it if I put it down for a while. I just couldn't wait to hear about Genji's next adventure or conquest.The poetry was also of interest, apparently it was proof of intelligence and/or good breeding (or something) at that time to be able to make up a good poem spontaneously (on the fly) and they do this often throughout the book; which at first threw me while reading, but you soon get used to it.You can also catch a hint of the traditional Japanese culture (that I know of, which isn't a lot) and it may help with an understanding of what it's all about; in other words it is possible to make some connections between then and now.The characters are all very interesting and Murasaki makes them come alive with her very vivid descriptions of their personalities as well as physical descriptions that aren't too exhausting. You can practically say you &quot;know&quot; the people she describes, you can imagine someone you know that is just like that character. Genji is so haughty and pompous, it's almost comical at times, but who wouldn't be if they were given near god status at birth? He seems almost naive or innocent, even though in reality he's far from it, almost narcissistic, but it's all good because he's &quot;Genji&quot;, lol. You almost become narcissistic along with him - toward him, it's contagious.It is also very humorous at times and I found myself chuckling out loud (and then not able to explain to people what I'm laughing about because you &quot;had to be there&quot;); you get so in tune with the culture that you find humor in the &quot;slights&quot; that are completely culturally based.I was struck so many times by the similarites between &quot;human nature&quot; then and now, the only real differences are cultural. Their personalities, their desires, their emotions are all the same as what we are familiar with in this day and age.This was just a GOOD book and a GOOD story, it's no wonder it has been around so long.Sondra"},{"Title":"The Tale of Genji (Vintage Classics)","review":"The Tale of Genji is a rare glimpse into eleventh century Japan. Murasaki Shikibu does a magnificent job describing the life at the imperial court. The story follows the life of Genji who is the son of the emperor, but his mother is of very low rank so he is unable to become an heir. Even though Genji cannot become an heir to the thrown he is the jewel of the imperial court, being talented in everything that was valued at the time including: poetry, dance, koto playing, and a keen eye for ascetics. Some could say that Genji is the equivalent of the European Renaissance man.The good looks that the people at court thought would lead to Genji having a short life, proved to be wrong and ended up turning Genji into s true ladies man. Most of the story is consumed by Genji's affairs, which can be a bit tiresome and confusing. Genji chose some rather unexpected characters to become his lovers including a little girl that he brings to the palace to shape into the perfect wife. One good thing about all of Genji's affairs is it gives the reader the chance to read many different Waka, which are two lined poems that would be exchanged between lovers.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Japanese history, since it is written by someone who lived during the Heian period. This book is also good for anyone who truly enjoys classics because it is considered one of the WORLD's first novels. However if you don't mind lengthy books, I would recommend reading the unabridged version which has 54 chapters compared to the 12 available in this version. One plus to the abridged version is it is full of woodblock printings inspired by the novel."},{"Title":"The Tale of Genji (Vintage Classics)","review":"Genji is an over-romanticized pretty boy and playboy type dreamed up by a lady of the Heian court. His &#34;adventures&#34; are mostly conquests of different women. The story comes off as wish-fulfillment of bored, under romanced women. Now, historically, this novel is incredibly relevant. The Heian period was the emergence of Japanese civilization as we know it, and the book has great first-hand descriptions of the clothings, customs, and lives of the people of this period. Also, the Chinese influence that largely helped shape the Heian period is given multiple nods in this book in the form of quotations of Chinese poetry, and references to Chinese history."},{"Title":"The Tale of Genji (Vintage Classics)","review":"This is a wonderful book, but the Einstein Books version for Kindle is simply terrible.

A work of genius, although to my mind a reader should have a guide, either someone who knows the novel and has studied it or several references such as Ivan Morris's guide to the Heian era. Genji has many very dark and cynical sides, which a reader may not see very well without a knowledge of Buddhism.

Insights into Japan of yore and its nobility and customs are plentiful, and the characters, though underdeveloped by today's standards, are interesting and even captivating. Problems? Of course... the flow is very uneven. A chapter ends, and the next one begins later in time, often skipping over crucial action (such as Genji's sexual encounter with his father's wife). The ending isn't much of an ending, either, leaving you hanging there without closure. Still, considering the age of the novel, it's not bad. Don't read this for its story, but for its historical significance."},{"Title":"The Tale of Genji (Vintage Classics)","review":"Surely ,Shikibu was the great writer. Her tones are intelligent ,clear and beautiful. But, I don't like Genji. He is a PLAYBOY! Nevertheless, I feel great sympathy for him. He didn't relate very well to Genji' Girls. Kiritsubo, Utsusemi, Yugao, Momiji, Aoi, and others, they were very charming and mysterious girls. And he was longing for his Anima in his youth. After all, he got Murasaki, maybe his forever sweetheart, in this way. He coulld not have seen his Swan in his dream, I think...... Because of young Genji's behavior, he suffered terribly in his prime age. After his death, Poor soul! by the irony of fate, Kaoru, Ukifune ,every his relationships must have continued suffering,too. Oh! they could have no inspired artists, for all their gorgeous court life. Unfortunately, Ukifune tried a suicide, but, she was saved and in religious house.

It is a collection of \\"letters, official reports, court proceedings, reporters' dispatches from the battlefronts, diaries and captured archives\\" and is edited by an eyewitness to the saga; Robert Payne. This book includes the writings of John Dos Passos, Arthur Koestler, Andre Malraux, George Orwell, Elliot Paul, and others. As an intro to the Spanish Civil War or a supplementary text this is great."},{"Title":"The Nostradamus Bible Code","review":"There are, of course, many interpretations and translations of the Bible. This book differs in that it offers, rather than the author's own ideas about what the Biblical text might mean, an interpretation of how the text relate to the prophecies of Michael Nostradamus. It touches on how Nostradamus' cabalistic codes can shed new light on Biblical history and reinterprets timelines of events."},{"Title":"Timothys Game","review":"Our eponymous hero returns in this second installment of the Timothy Series.In the first novella, Run, Sally, Run, Timothy Cone has been specifically recommended to determine where leaks in a company, Pistol and Burns, are coming from. A Case of the Shorts begins with the assassination of John Dempster, CEO of Dempster-Torrey. Haldering and Co. is retained, and Timothy is drafted to investigate why the company is a target for industrial sabotage. In the last novella, One From Column A, Chin Tung Lee, of the White Lotus label, assigns the investigative team to discover why anyone would speculate in such a conservative company. Oedipal lust to unbridled greed actuated by hatred are just a little of what we see in The Game.As usual, Timothy Cone cracks the cases with confidence and exaggerated bravado, leveraging on the knowledge of financial specialists, and his bevy of police informants. The whole cast from the Files are back, with some chaps added to compensate for the diversity of the new clientele.Most Sanders fans when reading about this shabby detective are apt to compare him unfavorably to the dapper McNally. They might just be mistaken. Actually, both characters do have their similarities: their snitches in the police department who believe in quid pro quo, their emphasis on appearances and location, as well as their queer relationships, and controlled humor.Yet Cone has his strengths. Here,the bad guys are unafraid to get their hands dirty; also, as each client is referred to Haldering and Co., there is a certain a continuity along stories. Moreover, since the focus is on financial institutions, a virgin forest in investigative fiction, we get to read a lot about the unheralded SEC.In Timothy's Game, Lawrence Sanders delivers sizzling stuff that should be enjoyed in it's own right."},{"Title":"Timothys Game","review":"This book is actually a collection of three stories about Wall Street investigator Timothy Cone. Originally issued in 1988, it was written when Lawrence Sanders was at the peak of his writing career (before he started insulting his fans by cranking out pot boilers). The stories concern various intrigues on Wall Street - insider trading, stock manipulation and short selling, and corporate takeovers and greenmail. The plots are well developed and well written, and the characters are interesting."},{"Title":"Timothys Game","review":"The best Lawrence Sanders I've read so far.

I recently purchased the first of Kid friendly books for my younger brother. They were edited with the more adult themes taken out and had a few new works of art. But the problem is that they are the same price as the one original. So you are paying the full price of the full book for half the book. Even though this makes no sense I am glad that a new Genereation of young Adventurers will be able to travel Krynn!All in all a great book that might not be as hard as a full novel for children to read, but if you are older just buy the originals. Thanx!"},{"Title":"A Rumor of Dragons: Dragons of Autumn Twilight, Vol. 1 (Dragonlance Chronicles, Part 1)","review":"Overall, this series makes for wonderful reading.

However, whoever edited these books for a younger audience ought to have his or her head examined. The number of explicit allusions to sex, rape, arousal, instances of characters calling each other \\"bastard\\", etc., is disturbing in a series supposedly targeted at younger readers. Any editor with half a brain ought to have taken such things out or else \\"softened\\" the wording. It would have done no harm to the great story to have edited out such needlessly explicit and/or graphic details.I therefore got into the habit of previewing each chapter and flagging anything to be skipped before reading them aloud. It's really too bad this wasn't done by the editor! Such passages and terms don't occur that frequently, but it's best to be prepared for them all the same.Bear in mind also that a lot of bloodshed and death is included in this story as well, along with numerous references to the gods and goddesses of Krynn, who are \\"real\\" in this fantasy world. To me, it is a fascinating trip into a mythological world created by the authors, as entertaining as Homer's Odyssey and the like.But as to some of the content, parents, be warned."},{"Title":"A Rumor of Dragons: Dragons of Autumn Twilight, Vol. 1 (Dragonlance Chronicles, Part 1)","review":"How does a meeting of a small group of companions separated by fate erupt into a mystical, wondrous tale of magic, heroes and evil? Eight heroic companions on the world of Krynn were created by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, and they did a wonderful job of continuing the DragonLance tale.The tale begins in Solace, in the Inn of the Last Home, with the characters slowly coming into the building to meet once again. They share stories with a mysterious old man and two plainspeople, Goldmoon and Riverwind, who turn out to be very civil.I really enjoyed this tale, because it is full of mysteries and suspenseful events that will keep you interested and wanting to read more. Once you begin the book, you won't want to put it down until you find out what happens to Tanis Half-Elven and his friends.Tanis and his friends reunite at the inn of the last home in Solace, meet two mystical people and embark on a quest for knowledge which becomes a life threatening struggle for the disks of life, mystical artifacts of healing, which are guarded by a dark dragon minion under the influence of Verminaard Dragonbane.This is a great book, but there are two parts that I don't like.If there was a backstory explaining the journey and lives of the characters, it would be a lot easier to understand. Also, the ending leaves you hanging on to what will happen to the companions so that you have to go out and buy the next sequel."},{"Title":"A Rumor of Dragons: Dragons of Autumn Twilight, Vol. 1 (Dragonlance Chronicles, Part 1)","review":"This book is awesome and is very descriptive. it has a good plot as well"},{"Title":"A Rumor of Dragons: Dragons of Autumn Twilight, Vol. 1 (Dragonlance Chronicles, Part 1)","review":"I absolutly luved this book!

Cable caught a lot of hell for this book (along with OLD CREOLE DAYS) and it's easy to see why. Taking potshots at popular historical myths (and making arguments for racial equality) was never popular, especially in Louisiana right after Reconstruction when this book was written. While the writing and some of the melodrama are considerably dated (if exquisitely lush and beautiful), Cable makes excellent (if occasionally strident and jarring) points of his own while giving us a beautifully entertaining story of forbidden love and the clash of cultures, (themes more than resonant in Southern literature), and his characters, particularly the strong-willed Aurore, the family black sheep Honore de Grandissime, and the idealistic young Anglo (well, German, really) immigrant, Joseph Frowenfeld, stay in the soul's memory long after the book's finish. As an afterthought, the way Cable goes after Creole society has relevance today, as there is probably no other part of Louisiana history and culture as misunderstood and yet sentimentally applauded as its Cajun and Creole components. A great novel not only on its own terms, but also for the impact its had on perceptions of the South and especially Louisiana."},{"Title":"The Grandissimes: A story of Creole life","review":"Critic Rebecca West compared Cable to Balzac and the comparison is apt; this is possibly the closest an american novelist came to the french author. Set in exotic New Orleans during the time when Louisiana was being admitted to the Union, the novel is atmospheric and rich in description. The plot is complex but never enervating. The Grandissimes will be a real surprise to readers who have only read the society novels of Henry James and Edith Wharton."},{"Title":"The Grandissimes: A story of Creole life","review":"Cable's epic masterpiece details the adventures of a young protagonist stranded in New Orleans after his family succumbs to yellow fever. Through an acquaintance with a well-connected Doctor, he is able to enter a society that few people get to experience -- upper class New Orleans.Mark Twain said that if you read the Grandissimes, you wouldn't have to go to New Orleans, because by reading it, you have already visited. Cable, with extensive detail, humor and intricate commentary on the Old South, has written a novel that stands the test of time, even though some of the characters (Agricola Fullister) do not.Although the book is at points tenuous, the characters are vibrant and interesting enough to keep the plot moving along.Of course, the most controversial aspect of The Grandissimes is the ending, which many feel is a let down after pages and pages of emotional build-up. Without giving anything away, the finals pages are somewhat of a disappointment. But the ending in its entirety is a well done.Overall, the Grandissimes is a fascinating look at class and culture of the Creoles. It is recommended to anybody who enjoys reading New Orleans literature or literature in general."},{"Title":"The Grandissimes: A story of Creole life","review":"To tell you the truth, I had to read this book for a class I took this year, which focused on literature from New Orleans. I don't mind reading books for classes; however, once I read the first couple of chapters of The Grandissimes, I thought that this would be one of those books that I would fall asleep reading. It seemed confusing and dealt with issues that did not really pertain to me, but I was pleasantly surprised at how interesting and complex the novel became.Once the plot started to unfold, the novel grabbed my interest and I grew to respect and be amazed by it. I think that Cable did a great job tying major themes into this piece of literature, such as family pride, Creole lifestyle, Iron Virgins and Southern Belles, and the rigorous expectations of society. The Grandissimes takes place right after the Louisiana Purchase (1803), which allowed Cable to encompass ideas that many people are familiar with, such as a fear of change. The characters in the book where well developed and each seemed to carry their own message to the audience. For example, it is easy for everyone to relate to Joseph Frowenfeld, an American who finds himself wrapped up in the Creole society. This character was forced to be an outsider and the novel depicts how he dealt with the divisions of class and status.The Grandissimes is titled after the Creole family from New Orleans who held most of the power and influence in society at the time. Throughout the book, the family must struggle through twists and turns of deceit and unexpected events, while still holding up their Old South charm. This book does a great job portraying how the family struggled to keep their position and power in society, in order to stay true to their roots.If you are thinking of reading this book, I would suggest giving it a try. It may seem very complicated and choppy at first, but it will eventually tie together to make a great story. However, the only downfall to this book is that I could not truly like it until it was done and I reflected on it. It is one of those books that ends up surprising you!"},{"Title":"The Grandissimes: A story of Creole life","review":"Subtitled \\"A Story of Creole Life\\" and set in New Orleans during the early 1800s, the main thread of this novel revolves around a family feud between the Grandissimes and De Grapions. Various members of each family love and hate members of the other, which is eventually worked out to the satisfaction of some (Honore and Aurora) and the disappointment (even death) of others (Agricola and Palmyre). Cable's goal was to portray as realistic a picture of New Orleans and Creole society at the time when the city was still mainly French and Spanish (proud old Agricola hates the newly arriving Americans) as he could, and in that he mainly succeeds (even with many of the romantic elements that creep into the story, such as the developing love interest between Joseph Frowenfeld and Clotilde Nancanou). Beyond the feud, though, Cable depicts a society drenched in violence and racial hatred, and this is about as realistic as it could get. In one scene a black woman is lynched, then cut down just before she suffocates and told to run for her life; when she does she's shot dead. Bras Coupe, a one-time African prince who is now a slave, is an imposing character and worthy of respect. The book has a great deal of Creole and French dialect throughout, which may be problematic for some. A product of the deep South, Cable writes with vitriol against the slave system and the cruelty of white masters, but also reveals sympathy for a dying culture in New Orleans. Probably Cable's best work."},{"Title":"The Grandissimes: A story of Creole life","review":"This farsighted inditement of Southern society is still powerful today.Much of the story is seen through the eyes of Joseph Frowenfeld, a young Northerner of German background who has just moved to Louisiana with his family. He is soon left bereft by yellow fever, and with nothing to go back to is befriended by several kind souls, chief among them Honore Grandissime, the scion of a filthy rich Creole family.He is quickly dismayed by the inequities of New Orleans society, a confession that prompts his new friend to pour out his heart to him. Honore, who knows what his family is, longs to reach out to his Mulatto half-brother and share the family business with him. He also wants to do right by the beautiful and virtuous Aurora Nancanou and her daughter Clotilde, who have been left destitute (by genteel standards, anyway) after Honore's father murdered Aurora's husband and swindled her. Honore would like to court Auroura, but honorable man that he is doesn't want to take advantage of her by performing his good deed barely before knocking on the door. In short, he wants an end to the moral decay of the old South.He is not so deluded, however, as to think he can live happily ever after married to Auroura with his brother at his side. The Grandissime family will not give up it's ill-gotten wealth and prestige without a fight, and with few exceptions save his delightful cousin and protege Raoul - who is still too young to have a voice in family affairs - he is virtually alone.Inspired by his new friend, Honore finally makes his lonely stand, unsure that his efforts will bear fruit - or even that they won't end with a Grandissime bullet in his back.Honore must rank as one of the most likable of literary heroes - a good man who you can unreservedly sympathise with and root for. The point is not that he succeeds - we are left very much uncertain on that point - but that he has the strength to be the first to fight for what he knows in his heart is right. It's a struggle that many concientious white people are facing now long after this book was written."},{"Title":"The O'Connors: Roses and Rain & Shadows in the Mist (Harlequin Romance)","review":"I'm intrigued by this author.

Then, to page 82, one finds beautifully reproduced color photographs of Roger Brown's sculptural art works. For example, one finds his painted irons (I have done a Roger Brown painted iron, using a second hand iron, and enamels. It was great fun. Any Sunday painter can do it.) Also found are the usual Roger Brown western landscapes (but associated with a row of pottery to give the painting a sculptural quality), mask buldings, such as a waitress' mask building festooned with fastened forks and spoons (Mask for a Waitress), a mask for a corporate executive comprising a hinged sculpture of a skyscraper (Mask for the Chairman of the Board). The rows of pottery appear to be attached to a platform, where the platform is connected to the picture frame.My favorite Roger Brown book is Roger Brown, by Mitchell Douglass Kahan, Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts (1980). But it is out of print. It contains paintings of a swamp (Bayou La Batre), mid-western thunderstorms (e.g., Thunderhead), rolling mid-western hills (Misty Morning), flat mid-western plains (Oklahoma is O.K.), and a forest of cut down trees (Lewis and Clark Trail). Misty Morning is one of the most sensuous paintings committed to canvas, and features an array of some 15 hills, one visible winding road, and ten sets of high beams from invisible trucks, the beams penetrating the mist. In the foreground, the hills are dark, while in the background, the hills are washed out and abundantly misty. Lewis and Clark Trail has a sculptural component. Affixed at the bottom of the painting is a platform, while the platform supports a row of actual tree stumps.Really, Roger Brown deserves a comprehensive hardcover book featuring his paintings and quasi-sculptural works, e.g., masks and steam irons."},{"Title":"The Hidden Meaning of Birthdays (Quote-A-Page)","review":"&quot;April 17th: Weighty, Secretive, and Purposeful&quot;. This uncanny assessment of the April 17th birthday struck a chord with me; this is my birthday, and it is-albeit a generalization-very true. (It provides 3 positive and 3 negative attributes per day, as well as a history lesson of signifigant events on your date-of-birth.) The more comprehensive assessments within the paragraphs relative to each birthday are more intriguing, and are more detailed, and provide advice relative to the sketch of the person it provides; you will be turning the pages and will not be able to put this down, whether to find a description of a co-worker or relative. It will touch on something about somebody-I guarantee it. It will remind you of their birthdays and suggest how to act vis a vis them-even if it's not always on the nose. Besides, it will make an excellent and thoughtul, inexpensive trinket. I have given it to several acquaintances who cannot seem to put it down! Even if you do nost subscribe to the astrological points-of-view, this book transcends the genre with a light-weight approach and packaging; it is not for the more serious star-gazer, but even the most skeptical will find something in this for them."},{"Title":"The Hidden Meaning of Birthdays (Quote-A-Page)","review":"The book itself is great however it was described as in good condition however I would have said it was in ok condition.

It's been on our coffee table wherever we've lived and we always encourage guests to write their name on the page containing their birthday.

We've passed on the tradition by giving it as a gift to others on their own birthdays."},{"Title":"The House of Niccolo: Caprice & Rondo","review":"I was disappointed with this book. It had received a good deal of critical praise. I don't really understand why. It's not a bad book, but it's not particularly good either.Our hero, Nicholas, is a jack of all trades deluxe. Businessman, engineer, fighter, singer, horseman, archer, diviner, lover - he does it all, and does it all well. Why, the only person who can thwart him is...himself. Ugh. Being good at everything is nice, but it does make for a boring character. Furthermore, by the end of the book we learn that he's so darn clever, he knew what was going on all along. Well. That does drain the tension from the novel, doesn't it? Nicholas isn't the only problem. The characters - and there are a lot of them - speak with more or less the same voice, and a suspiciously modern voice at that. I suppose they must be in the Renaissance - after all, they're wearing the right clothes and eating the right food - but you could drop them in England in 1920 and I bet they wouldn't miss a beat. Their emotional relationships are right out of a television soap opera, including a truly odd shyness about...you know...\\"the act\\"...(soft focus, please). Lacking distinction, lacking personality, the cast becomes a dull blur.In general, there's just too much going on in this book: too many plot lines, too many characters and too many places. Of course complexity is not a bad thing. But \\"plot\\" should mean more than \\"things happening one after another\\". One would like to see possibilities develop, then watch some mature, some wither and some die as the characters make their choices. There's no time for that in Caprice &amp; Rondo. Here's a murder, there's a coup, there's a seduction, here's a revelation, there's a betrayal. How will they get out of this mess? Like this! Bang! On to the next episode! Let's go! go! go! To Caffa! To Tabriz! To Moscow! To Bruges! Oh my! It's a deus ex machina perpetua, and you can never forget the author's heavy hand grinding behind the scenery.To be fair, Caprice &amp; Rondo is part seven in a series. If you had read books 1 through 6 the characters, at least, would seem far more vivid and real, and the novel more enjoyable. But I can't imagine putting in that much effort for the promise of so little in return. Caprice &amp; Rondo is too lofty to be good pulp and too workmanlike to be good literature."},{"Title":"The House of Niccolo: Caprice & Rondo","review":"The seventh of Dorothy Dunnett's eight book House of Niccolo series is Caprice and Rondo. The Niccolo books have never engaged me quite as thoroughly as her earlier series The Lymond Chronicles did. Those are among my very favorite historical novels ever. The Niccolo novels are good, but I have tended to find them a bit harder to follow. However, in the particular case of Caprice and Rondo, I was able to follow the action quite readily. Perhaps as the series comes to a conclusion the answers to the many mysteries are becoming clear.This book opens with Nicholas in Poland. He's been kicked out of his company and exiled from Scotland and the Netherlands as a result of his actions in the last book. (This is another reason the Niccolo books are a bit harder to like: Nicholas does some pretty clearly bad stuff. Whenever Lymond seemed to be up to something bad, it turned out he was being misunderstood.) In Poland he spends a winter womanizing and drinking with the pirate Pauel Benecke, who wants him to join in a pirate mission the following summer. But Anselm Adorne, the upright burgomaster from Bruges who misunderstands Nicholas pretty comprehensively, and who stands in a role vaguely similar to Lymond's brother Richard Crawford in the Lymond books: a good man who tends to regard the hero as an enemy because he doesn't understand him, shows up on a mission to try to recover damages from an earlier piracy committed by Benecke. Also, Adorne and the Patriarch of Antioch, Ludovico da Bologna, intend to head to Tabriz to negotiate with the Persian Uzum Hasan for support against the Turks. (So far, every character I have mentioned except Nicholas is an actual historical character. Dunnett does this extravagantly, on occasion, I think, using characters mentioned very briefly in historical records, which allows her to claim a character is historical but treat said person just like a fictional character.) And Nicholas' long-time friend Julius and his wife Anna also intend to go East, to Caffa in the Crimea, to negotiate new trade agreements for their part of Nicholas' former Bank. Inevitably, Nicholas is drawn into accompanying Anna and the Patriarch to Caffa and Tabriz, and he's also drawn into (or does he do it on purpose???) shooting Julius so he can't come, and frustrating Adorne's plans so he has to go home, mad at Nicholas again. Follows then plenty of action and danger and sexual tension, (this last as Nicholas, frustrated by 8 years of separation from his wife Gelis, must resist his attraction to Julius' beautiful wife), as things go horribly bad in Caffa, and Nicholas ends up trekking to Moscow, and a meeting with the mysterious Greek with a Wooden Leg, Acciajouli, who was involved in the very first of Nicholas' escapades from Book 1.In parallel, we follow Gelis and Katelijne back in Scotland and Bruges, as the evil David de Salmeton hoves into view again, ready perhaps to revenge himself on Nicholas by attacking those close to him. At the same time Gelis begins to work to resolve her conflicted feeling about Nicholas. Of course, eventually Nicholas is lured back to the west, to confront difficult revelations about his family, and about his relationship with Gelis, and with others, and to try to rebuff various threats to his family and friends.Much is resolved: perhaps almost too much. Some of the eventual revelations are a bit lurid, and perhaps a bit too reminiscent of some &quot;revelations&quot; in the Lymond books. Nonetheless, the book is fascinating reading, absorbing, colourful, complex. Another fine chapter in an excellent series of historical novels."},{"Title":"The House of Niccolo: Caprice & Rondo","review":"Caprice was everything I expected from Dorothy Dunnet, and I expect a lot. Great atmosphere, great story. But warning, don't start with this book. Read others in the series first. Like all the Niccolo and Lymond books, Caprice is beautifully researched and difficult to follow in the beginning pages. There are dozens of characters, most witty, and they often read each other's minds. Even minor players have large roles, so that following their conversations--and indeed who's talking--takes some getting used to. But there's a reward. Soon, you catch on and and it's a joy. Dunnet's ellipses let you participate much more than a simpler presentation that gives every character's every thought to you straight up. These people become your own family, friends, acquaintances and enemies. Unlike another reviewer, I found the characters exquisite, but then I know them from several prior books. It really helps to read the first book, Niccolo Rising, if not the ones between, to understand Nicolas and sympathize with him. And I doubt Gelis, Nicolas'wife, or her actions would have any meaning at all to readers who had not sufferred through her betrayal in earlier books. But it's still a great story. This edition does have a nice list of characters and summary of the plots from previous books, which are very welcome."},{"Title":"The House of Niccolo: Caprice & Rondo","review":"In this 7th volume in Dunnett's intricate, superb historical series, protagonist Nicholas de Fleury is bent upon an aimless, self-destructive existence, matching pirate Paul Benecke drink for drink and woman for woman after being exiled from Scotland for plotting to destroy the country. But Nicholas' natural curiosity and intelligence are soon rekindled by a visit from his former mentor, Julius and Julius' beautiful, mysterious wife, Anna. Nicholas is lured on an adventure which will take him to the courts of Russia while he searches for the gold which was stolen from his in Cyprus. As usual, Dunnett has deftly woven a fascinating tapestry of history,culture and character. In Nicholas, Dunnett has created a complex, infinitely fascinating hero; a man capable of creating brilliant works of art but also capable of acts of astonishing cruelty. Nicholas' contradictory nature was shaped by his tragic childhood which is revealed when Nicholas' wife, Gelis, embarks on a mission to find the truth about his disputed parentage. Is Simon St. Pol really Nicholas's father or was his mother unfaithful as Simon has always claimed? Gelis hopes to understand what drives Nicholas in his relentless manipulation of people and events. Few authors have ever achieved the mastery of plot and character that Dunnett has developed. Her historical novels demand a level of commitment far greater than the average bestseller. But the reader is rewarded with a sophisticated, absorbing drama that becomes addictive."},{"Title":"The House of Niccolo: Caprice & Rondo","review":"It becomes increasingly clear in this, the seventh novel about Niccolo, that the focus of this whole saga shows deep interrelation with the author's earlier &quot;lymond&quot; series. In fact, Lymond's mother, Sybilla Semple, is clearly a 'St. Pol' and shares the same coloring as both Niccolo's father, Simon and Niccolo's elder son, Henry. If this all sounds as though the author, Dorothy Dunnett, can weave her spell around you-it's true. Her world is so vividly realized, yet the basic 'detective' element at the core of it (not for nothing has Dunnett also written some first-rate thrillers) will keep you on the edge of your seat, waiting for the next installment. Fabulous in every way; a little melodramatic in spots, but meticulously researched."},{"Title":"The House of Niccolo: Caprice & Rondo","review":"This the seventh book in the Niccolo series does offer some explanations of Nicholas's early life and gives some reasons as to why he did the things that he did. Brilliant Nicholas has been exciled to Poland. He tries to forget all of his previous life and become a devil-may-care pirate, but his history keeps coming in to interfere, and he has to resume his life in order to protect those that are dearest to him. In this book we contine to see the beautiful Anna, Julius's wife, and without giving the story away she is certainly not what she seems.We also see Nicholas and Gelis get back together at the end of the story. That is indeed a happy occasion, but it puzzles me where Katalejne fits into this. We don't see much of her in this story, and that is a great loss since I for one feel that she is by far the superior heroine in this series.I can't wait to read the last book in the series. Perhaps then things will all make sense. I found that there were some similarities between this series and the Lymond series, and that disappoints a bit, since the Lymond series is so superior. But this is still a good series and it's well worth the time spent to read it. I recommend reading all the books in the series in the order that they written."},{"Title":"The House of Niccolo: Caprice & Rondo","review":"January 1474 finds Nicholas de Fleury in Danzig. There are consequences from his vengeance in Scotland and Nicholas is in hiding. But Nicholas is not the only person at risk, and his need to protect those he feels responsible for including his estranged wife Gelis, their son Jodi, and many of his friends and associates, means that he is soon on the move. There is also a possibility that he may be able to recover the gold which was stolen from him in Cyprus.Nicholas de Fleury is a fascinating and complex hero, and fifteenth century Europe provides a fascinating historical and cultural backdrop for his endeavours and adventures. While some of the action takes place in Western Europe, Nicholas travels to Russia and beyond. But then he returns, to face all manner of truths.Three things make this series special for me: the larger than life character of Nicholas de Fleury himself; the way the fictional characters are inserted into history; and the way that the history itself comes to life off the pages.This is the seventh volume in the House of Niccolo series, and to appreciate the series they really need to be read (and for some of us, re-read) in order. I'm writing this review having just concluded my fourth re-read of the book. Why? Because each reading has so far provided me with new insights and possibilities. Ms Dunnett's novels are like that: complex, sparkling and full of possibility. I'm looking forward to my re-read of Gemini, the final book in the series.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"The House of Niccolo: Caprice & Rondo","review":"The gorgeous tapestry of the Niccolo series continues to be woven by artist/author Dunnett in the seventh volume. You could almost say this is the conclusion but surely it can't be! There are characters... no- people whose fate is unknown.

It ranges geographically to include regions outside the familiar Sao Paulo-Rio axis. And it explores the sexuality, behavior and cultural norms of a complex, disparate nation.

I am sure we will read this book over and over again!"},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"Mr. Brown can moo, can you? If you want a good laugh definetly read this book. It teaches kids the sounds animals make but ith a twist (like popping corks on horse feet) while having fun with it. It also teaches memorization because it asks questions like Mr. Brown can make a sound like a fish kiss -pip! can you? Mr. Brown can make the sound of a hippo chewing gum -grum grum grum, can you? It's quite a funny book, but a good one to read too."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"My son (now 3) is speech-delayed, and this is one of the first books that actually had him talking along! I would read, &quot;Oh, the wonderful sounds Mr. Brown can do. He can sound like a cow, he can go...&quot; and my son at 2 would yell &quot;MOOOOOOOOOOOOO!&quot; and do the same with the other sounds! It ENCOURAGES your child to speak by having them make some silly sounds! We even came up with hand gestures for several of the sounds to supplement my son's sign language (ASL) he used at the time. We read this book every night at least 4 times before bed. As his speech flourished (yay!), he began to want to say more of the words himself (we've memorized the book - not hard, and very fun to recite when waiting in lines, etc, heeheehee). Then, we bought him the Dr. Seuss video of ABCs, which has this book's &quot;video&quot; at the end. He watches the video with this book in hand, although the video has a few more sounds (I think this board book is a bit abridged, but not too much), and is now learning to read with the video/board book combination! I am HIGHLY pleased with this book, from it's hilarious illustrations (see lightning/thunder page) to it's musical cadence and silly sounds - it helped my son realize sounds can be fun and silly and encouraged him to play with them when speech was so frustrating for him at the time."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"Dr. Seuss has always been a favorite of mine since I was achild. I recently purchased this book for my daughter to see if she'dlike it as well...and...she absolutely loves it. The text and pictures appeal to her. I read this book to her a minimum of 5 times every day. It clearly is her favorite. It certainly is highly recommendable!"},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"My 19 month old loves this little book. She Moo's and buzzes and even &quot;hoo hoo's&quot;. It has opened up some fun, new and different sounds. Now when it rains, she says &quot;Dipple-Dopp, Dipple-Dopp.&quot; This is one of her favorite selections. The illustrations are classic Dr. Suess, and are wonderful. I would recommend this book for toddlers and older."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"Welcome to the wonderful world of whimsical, wacky writing, and crazy, colorful caricatures - \\"He can sound like a clock, he can TICK, he can TOCK. He can sound like a hand on a door KNOCK, KNOCK.\\" \\"Dr. Seuss's Mr. Brown Can Moo! Can You?\\" is an inspired introduction to sounds through rhyme and alliteration. The text, format, and images have been adapted from the original to accommodate board book standards; yet, the prose still flows.I am flabbergasted by the lack of enthusiasm for the revised board book editions of Dr. Seuss's (and others) beginner books published by Random House. I am thrilled to have the opportunity to offer my infant son a CLASSIC narrative, by means of a board book, even in its ADAPTED form. These magical miniatures are entertaining for little babies, who enjoy the positive interaction of cooperative play through reading. The objectives of these small books are to appeal to newborns, and very young children with short attention spans who are not attentive enough for the full text versions, they are NOT meant to replace the originals. Moreover, these pocketsize gems are fashioned for effortless travel to the market, on a plane, in the car, or on a train. Hee, hee.I own a lot of Dr. Seuss's first editions, in addition to a few of the board book volumes, and agree that the original \\"Bright and Early and the Beginner Books\\" are just that - ORIGINAL. They are more amusing, entertaining, and educational, but are in fact more appropriate for older children, 3 years and older. I believe introducing infants to creative works, such as these, only encourages listening and learning from an earlier age. In summary, if your child is two or older purchase an original version, otherwise think of introducing your infant to the shorter, travel-anywhere format, and procure the original at a later date? The marvelous, magical magician, who was Dr. Seuss is worth it! Birth and up."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"The book was in perfect condition! It's a smaller book, made for chubby little hands to hold. I admit that I went through the book and read it. Reminded me of when I was a kid."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"for my sister in law, she is collecting these books for her little one. It Arrived before the estimated date, and in amazing condition. I really appreciate it, and it is very helpful and very convenient. Thank you."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"This little board book, like the others in the Dr. Seuss collection, is abbreviated, but it's fine for young babies. For toddlers and older, though, the full-length, non-cardboard versions are much more interesting."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"Our son was obsessed with the little board book version so we got him this...it's great! Some sounds were a little challenging so it will make you giggle right along with your child. Enjoy this fun classic!"},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"One of Dr. Seuss's best! As a certified teacher, mother of 6 and grandmother of 6, This is one of my favorites. All children love the rhymes.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"I have a 1 year old who loves all the Dr. Seuss board books. It's good for individual time, as he sits and looks at the pictures and turns the pages as if reading the book. He also loves to sit in my lap as we read it together. I love pointing to the pictures and telling him what they are and what sound they make. It's great fun!"},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"This book is so much fun. My son laughed for the first time at the funny sounds Mr. Brown can do - in particular he thought the Buzz Buzz was pretty funny - each time, another sound catches his interest. I love to read it to him to hear his cute chuckles - he is only 5 months!"},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"To those reviewers bashing the board book version, I say: get over it! The board book version makes it possible to hold a squirming infant and read and turn the pages at the same time. Accordingly, the baby is exposed to the process of reading at a time when it would otherwise be prohibitive. My five month old loves this book, clearly tries to mimic the sounds of Mr. Brown, and smiles beyond belief as I loudly moo, whoo, buzz, and tick-tock. I think above all else, Suess would want youngsters exposed to his works as early as possible, abridged or otherwise."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"I don't think there's one Dr. Seuss book that I can't recall being read to me when I was somewhere in the under-10 age. Mr. Brown Can Moo, Can You? stands out in particular. How could a child forget the first time mom makes those delightful noises to go with the pictures in a book? It's the stuff of high comedy and intense interest to three-year-olds everywhere.Mr. Brown is a funny little man dressed to the nines (in dapper brown of course) who can imitate all sorts of noises like a wiz. You'd better be prepared to go beyond barnyard animal sounds, too - lightening cracks, goldfish kisses, and a hippo chewing gum (which is GRUM GRUM, for those of you who don't know!). The book prompts children to try and match Mr. Brown's sounds in a nice, low-pressure way.I'm not sure if this book has ever received official recognition for its educational value to young children, but as far as I'm concerned MBCMCY is a wonderful tool for teaching kids to be better observers, listeners, and responders to their surroundings. Better yet, it introduces parents to the fine art of interactive reading.-(...)"},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"Dr. Seuss has it all. Cadence. Rhyming schemes. Silliness. Creativity. Originality. His childlike views of his wacky worlds come with very real lessons that we never really know we are learning. All are glorious fun to read but this one is especially fun to read aloud.The book is about sounds and making sounds and rhyming sounds and inventing sounds. All wrapped up in Seussian rhyming schemes and a degree of cleverness which is just so, well, simple. Seeing eyes light up at the various \\"buzzes\\", \\"clicks\\" and \\"pips\\" is a delight. Then comes the murmer as the child or children begin to imitate the sounds themselves until there's only one sound- laughter.This book engages both reader and read to with a bond neither is likely to forget. Though one of Dr. Seuss's lesser known, it becomes one of his best loved. You'll see. . . (or in this case, hear.)"},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"The rhymes are so fun to read. I think I enjoy it more than my son!"},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"Of all the Dr. Seuss early books, this one was loved most by my daughter when she was very young (about 3 months old) and she still loves it at over a year in age. Unfortunately, I think she hid it somewhere. Anyway, the book is fun to read and really holds a baby's attention. Some of her first giggling was during the \\"cock-a-doodle-doo\\" while I would read this book to her. It is a definite must for any baby's book collection."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"my voice is literally hoarse from reading this one to my 14-month old. She can't get enough of Mr. Brown and all the &quot;wonderful things he can do&quot;. And contrary to another reviewer's comments, I have found this (and her other Dr. Seuss board books) to be very sturdy and they have had a Lot of abuse !"},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"I bought this book for my daughter's first birthday. I liked the strong beat and the rhymes, although I was worried she wouldn't understand the non-realistic drawings and that she wouldn't have a clue what a cork is (so why should she care if it goes pop-pop). Obviously I am not a very experienced mom. She was CRAZY about this book from the get-go. In six weeks she learned all the sounds so that you could stop anywhere in the rhyme and she would finish it: Me: \\"he can sound like an rooster\\" Her: \\"Cockalooloo [close!]\\" Me: \\"he can sound like an owl\\" Her: \\"hoo hoo hoo.\\" This book was as compelling to my baby as a song and the pictures made it in some ways even better than a song since she could understand the words. I am very glad it is a board book because it has been covered with food and liquids and would be in shreds if it were not. I would recommend this book 100% to any parent of a 1 year old."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"My daughter is about 6 months old, and this is by far her favorite book. Although my parents read me a great deal of Dr. Seuss when I was growing up, I had never heard of or seen this book until I found it as a bright and early board book at Toys'R'Us. I'm very glad that I decided to buy it, because Mr. Brown Can Moo has quickly become my daughter's favorite book. A lot of the other books will easily lose her attention, but because of all the fun sounds that are in this book she stays interested from beginning to end. I highly recommend this for parents of very young children. This book is also likely to get a small child/baby laughing, which is always nice to hear. :) I'm planning on buying copies for all of my friends who are having babies as a birth present."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"Everyone and their mother knows who Dr. Suess is. I mean, his name is synonymous with \`children's story' and rightfully so. That said, this little treasure was not one that I was familiar with as a child, but it has quickly become my favorite.When my daughter was still learning to talk I would read this to her nearly everyday. She adored the pictures and thought that the quick rhyming on the part of her daddy was pretty hilarious. Soon she started to copy every sound I was making and then she began to memorize every sound, associated with each object and she would spit them out before I would.Now, at nearly three, she has memorized this entire book and reads it to me.This little gem is funny, witty and entertaining. The artwork is what's to be expected from Dr. Suess; unique, strange and oddly vintage in character. The tongue-twisting poetic nature of the dialog is fun and surprisingly easy to spit out.Easily one of my favorites from the master of children's literature!"},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"This is an excellent children's book. My daughters absolutely love the tale of Mr. Brown and all of his noises. The traditional Dr. Seuss illustrations bring me back to my own childhood, and I'm happy my girls will share some of those same memories. It's also a nice introduction into rhyming and onomatopoeia."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"My children and I love this book. I bought this recent copy to give as a gift. I enjoy playing with the different noises; there is ample opportunity to be a cow, a rumble of thunder, or patter of rain. Readers can be creative with the text. And, children love the fun sounds. I hope the hardcover is durable...Appears to be just like the old copy we have."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"This was one of her first books.

Can you?","review":"So I bought this book at the store, and it was the first ever book (and we have read many) that made my 8 month-old giggle. So I purchased it straightaway. And it still makes him grin every time we open it. It is by far his favorite book!Yes, it is different from the original, but this is a \\"board-book\\", and board books are made for the following: chewing, short-attention spans, and more chewing.

In this story is a man named Mr. Brown, who makes a plethera of odd noises, and asks the reader to make noises along with him.

We began reading it to her when she was about 15 months old. The best part is that thunder and lightning are addressed in the book.

Now she loves to hear the rain and thunder, and to see lightning."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"I have been reading this book to my son since birth every night. He loves it.

Many are so simple there's just nothing to them -- you don't really get to settle in for a nice reading session. But abridged versions of longer picture books often lose the magic of the original.Congratulations to the folks who trimmed &quot;Mr. Brown&quot; down to size. It has a wonderful, natural rhythm -- even zippier than the original! And my baby daughter LOVED hearing us make all the silly noises.

I can't imagine any child not enjoying this book."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"My son loved this book as an infant and adores it as a toddler! He learned Mr. Brown's sound's before he learned to talk. An amazing book that draws children into the rhyme and rythm, and directly encourages them to participate. Every family with small children should own this book."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"I first started reading this book to my baby at 2 months old, and she was fascinated by the sounds and the bright pictures. I've read it to her so many times that I think we both have it memorized. When my baby was 3 months old I could simply recite the book to her while I was driving in a car trip and she would be entertained.I highly recommend this book, along with Sanda Boynton's two books &quot;Barnyard Dance&quot; and &quot;Moo, Baa, La La La!&quot; books for infants and toddlers. With books that are interesting like these, my baby will sit for 45 minutes at a time to be read to!A great way to interact with your child and teach her to love books and read."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"Mr. Brown Can Moo! Can You? is going to be a lot of fun for your child to read--or to use as a tool for them as they learn to read. This is a great book for children learning to read independently; the illustrations are grand and the words are relatively simple. The book also teaches, in a fun way, some important words for child to increase their vocabulary at the same time. Great!The book has a page near the very beginning on which the child can write their name to personalize this and draw them into the lessons of this book. Just don't tell them they're going to be learning anything--if they think this is all a game they'll gobble up the information faster than anything!The short story introduces a character named Mr. Brown who can go \\"moo\\" just like a cow can. We get a picture of a cow and the sound put together with the picture is very educational. The child is also prompted to make the sound \\"moo\\" themselves. This way they learn about a cow interactively in a creative, fun way that they're sure to love.The book then goes on to use pictures of Mr. Brown and various other creatures so that the child can see these creatures and learn the sounds that each one makes. The child, for example, is asked to make the sound of a bee on a page where Mr. Brown is making the sound \\"buzz;\\" and the child is also encouraged to make the sounds of a cork opening up (pop) and horse feet sounds (klopp klopp). Every few pages there is a \\"refresher page\\" that recaps the lessons of the last several pages so that the child can informally review what they've just learned.The hardcover is strong enough to resist any accidental damage your young child may try to do to it; and the quality of the paper is excellent.Overall, this is an excellent book for introducing children to animals and wildlife. They see the pictures and make the sounds of each creature as they see Mr. Brown (the informal leader) do the same. I highly recommend this book for children just learning to read who also need to be introduced to animals and wildlife."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo!

Can you?","review":"There are some true gems among the Dr. Seuss books, but this isn't one of them.Fails both as poetry (the lines don't scan) and as onomatopoeia - \\"splatt\\" for lightning? Dreadful.I'm truly astonished to find that, nearly forty years since its first publication (1970), we're still wasting trees on this.Try either Dr. Seuss's ABC or Sandra Boyton's \\"Moo Baa La La La\\" for an infinitely superior alternative."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"I have bought several of the Dr. Suess Bright and Early Board Books, and they simply don't stand up to the abuse a toddler dishes out. None of the other board books we own have fallen apart the way these have."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"This story was about how Mr.brown can make all these nosies and Mr.Brown said can you do all this stuff.This book tought me how to make nosies.The age level for this book it 3-6I thoughy this book was good."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"The book was not clean and the spine was damaged. Rice was up in the spine so when I held it open to read to the kids it all fell out on the floor. It appeared that the pages were torn from the spine than glue together because they didn't open properly. I needed the book for my lessons or it would have went back."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"We love this book. The text is fun to read. My 11 month-old likes being able to easily turn the pages. Plus I don't have to worry about him tearing the pages apart."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"My son loves this book -- and so do we! My husband and I have really enjoyed reading this book, which is great because we read it everyday. The boardbook design is perfect for young children because the pages can't be easily ripped up or torn, and if a little drool gets on a page or two, it can be wiped off with a damp rag.After a couple of weeks of reading this book, my son has started trying to say, \\"Cockadoodle-doo!\\" He says, \\"Ca-ca\\" a lot. It's so cute. He just loves all of the noises!"},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"This very short book is a total winner for reading to the very young. Throughout the book, the rhyming is fantastic. This book is also great for helping your children to learn about onomatopoeia, and how neat it is to imitate the sounds around us. Because this book is so brief, it is easy to learn all the words. Knowing the book by heart is extremely useful for keeping your rhythm while your child chews on the pages."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"I started reading this book to my son when he was a year old and he just loved it! He goes &quot;moo,moo&quot; whenever he sees it and it got him addicted to books. Since then, he makes me read to him before bed every night and bedtimes have become a time for family bonding."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"What a great book for babies and toddlers. My now 21 month old will finish the sentences for me. She has always loved this book. It has a great rhyming pattern. She especially likes the last page with all the sounds."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"&quot;Oh, the wonderful sounds Mr. Brown can do&quot; and now you can, too! Can you immitate the sound of a cork or horse feet? Your little one will love to hear you bring these wonderful sounds to life. But don't worry, Mr. Brown is very helpful and soon you'll be able to sound like a cow, too. &quot;Moo Moo&quot;"},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"From just about the time they are born, children love nothing more than making funny noises and having funny noises made to them. This is the perfect book for that.Read it, make the noises, and watch your child burst into giggles at himself and you."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"Not only does my 12-month old son want me to read this book over and over and over again, but I truly enjoy reading this book. It's sing-song manner is spriteful and uplifting. I have even memorized this book and find myself subconsciously reciting it at work. The words jumping out of the page &quot;Boom, Boom, Boom&quot; or &quot;Dibble Dibble Dop&quot; give me the freedom of expressing myself in a more outlandish manner when reading the book, making it much more fun. I recommend this book to any parent who wants a book that is fun to read."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"My twin girls absolutely love this book - the world stops when I pick up this book and read the title. Once or twice the girls have caught me mentioning this title in conversations and stared until I read it. You'll have fun, too, with the silly sounds. I never really noticed that rain goes &quot;dibble dibble dopp&quot; until I read Mr. Brown."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"My earliest memory of reading is this book. I was two and I'dsneak in off the playground during recess to read it. It's very easy,brightly colored and good-natured.We didn't have the board booksback then, but these things are great! You don't want to drop them inthe bathtub to soak, but other than that, you can spill, bend, step,chew, and other wise &quot;man&quot;-handle these books withoutcausing serious damage. Some children feel more comfortable with booksif they don't have to worry about wrecking them."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"This was the first book I bought for my son and it is by far his favorite. We began reading it to him when he was about a month old. It is easy to memorize for parents since you'll read it again and again. He laughs anytime we recite one of the pages out of the blue. It always calms him down and holds his interest. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"Like many Seuss books, this &quot;Mr Brown Can Moo ...&quot; is pretty fun. The illustrations are very basic, which is great because it lets you -- and eventually your child -- focus on making the many sounds Mr Brown can do. At the end of the book is a &quot;review&quot; page. Because the sounds are in different colors and fonts, your child can easily identify which one he/she wants you to say.Also recommended are &quot;The Shape of Me and Other Stuff [...]&quot; for the visual representation and &quot;One Fish, Two Fish&quot; because it's got a wide variety of cute stories you and your child will enjoy."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"We had the mini board book, but she loved it so much I figured the original had to be better and it is! Our baby girl (7mo old) absolutely loves this book. It's easy to memorize, so I recite it anytime she gets a little fussy in her car seat and her cry turns to a smile pretty much immediately.can't recommend enough....this book (both the board version and now this version) have been her favorite since about 4 months...."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"My daughter loves loves loves this book. Every night, before her 8 o'clock bed time we pull out the basket o' books as we call it, and my 13 month old always pulls out this book. I emphasize the sounds and rhymes so she absolutely loves it. I love reading this book to her too. I think it's become my favorite also. Now, I recite the pages without even looking at the words as I turn the pages, and point to the pictures describing each object. I read it so much I know the entire book by heart. I even use the book as a learning tool when we are out, since I know the book by heart. Pointing to real objects in the world that resemble the objects in the book. So when I recite the words without the book she gets really excited, and looks at me like \\"Mom, how did you do that\\" LOL Great book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"My son loved this book as a child and now we are sharing it with his daughter. Dr Suess can lose."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"Great book....Lots of fun making all the sounds and looking at all the pictures with my 2 year old granddaughter! Dr. Suess is the best!"},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"My daughter is 5 months and 2 weeks old. She likes it when I read this \\"noise\\" book to her. It not only grabs her attention but also makes her laugh. I guess it's because of the sounds as well as the exaggeration of my facial expression (you'll need it to make some of the sounds in this book).As a comparison, we also have Sandra Boynton'sMoo Baa La La La(which is a lovely book). I can see my daughter is interested when I mimic the animal voices from Moo Baa La La La, but seldom does she laugh like when I read this \\"Moo!\\" book.The only downside is that a few sounds are a bit challenging; for example, eek eek of the squeaky shoe, grum grum of the chewing gum, and splatt splatt of the lightning. I can never make them right. But I don't think my daughter mind it, as least for now. :)"},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo!

Can you?","review":"This is the perfect size for babies to be able to play with themselves and it is one of our favorites to read! My son has been enjoying it for 10 months now and I expect it will continue to be a favorite. I now buy this and the ABC book as baby gifts!"},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"My daughter loves loves this book - it's become her favorite to take in the car. She's not quite old enough to read it herself, however she makes all the animal sounds. It's compact and travel friendly!"},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"I read this to my 1 yr old daughter.The sounds are fun and she enjoys them. She generally gets hooked to all other colorful books I read to her but not this one. The cartoon in the book is not exactly what you would expect to find in a book for toddlers. Its rather what you would find in a comic but what else could you expect for the price.I read the book and she keeps looking at me. Its nice to have that kind of attention from a 1 yr old but now I just make those noises and dont need the book anymore."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"I love this book.

The flow of the book isn't as smooth as the full size one, but still a good book to have for babies who love to laugh at funny noises."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"This has been my daughter's favorite book since the beginning. Everyone in our house knows this story by heart, including her. She's only 21 months old and already needs a new book because it is falling apart. She drags it out all the time. It is really easy to get into the story and change voices and make it fun. My daughter can almost read it to me now!"},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"My husband and I collected several books in anticipation of our son's birth, and among them many Dr. Suess volumes. We were so excited to discover that our son loved this one! From the earliest age he latched onto it as a favorite and would bring it to us to read. The board version is slightly more condensed than the original which turns out to be handy for little attention spans. Get it...its worth every penny."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo!

It's colourfull, fun & very sturdy."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"Very fun book. I would say kids from the age of 4 to 6, maybe 7 get a kick out of it. This book keeps getting passed around in my family, it's cute."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"Jordan loves this book. We bought it right before a plane ride and he had a great time reading it and learning the different noises. Now, Jordan can moo, buzz, pop, and klop with the best of them!

Can you?","review":"I bought this book for my 3 month old son, who at the time was a bit young.

It's a book he will love for years."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"this is a wonderful book introducing various sounds--animals, items in and around the house ... even thunder--and that's been a wonderful thing. My son has never been afraid of the loud cracks and rumbles of a thunderstorm b/c I've been able to say &quot;that's thunder (or lightning), just like Mr. Brown makes&quot; and then we procede to make the sounds (boom, boom, boom or splatt, splatt, splatt). This is one of the books that I always give as a gift at baby showers b/c the very young can enjoy it--simple, happy and fun!! **My son is now 2 1/2 and still pulls this book off the shelf for me to read to him ... or for him to read to me!"},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo!

It will teach your child to &quot;Moo&quot; whenever he/she sees a cow!"},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"We started reading this book regularly to my daughter when she was eight months old. She can't get enough of it. She will sit still and listen and laugh as we read this to her over and over. I think part of it is the animation in which we use during the reading, but this book lends itself to that perfectly. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"Out of the dozens of board books we have been given and purchased for our infant, she enjoys this one best of all. Our four month old enjoys sitting on our laps, looking at the bright illustrations, and listening to us make animal sounds. A fun, rhythmic book which baby can grab and really sink his or her gums into."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"Be warned! These \\"Board Books\\" are not the same as the original versions of the Dr. Seuss classics, but are instead slightly changed versions of the same stories. The normal Dr. Seuss books flow extremely well, provide interesting stories, and have beautiful cadence. These \\"Board Books\\" illustrate very effectively why there was only one Dr. Seuss -- basically, the modifications that have been made to the stories make them much less compelling and educational. In particular, the rhyming is never as good, and the meter is non-existent. I will grant that the \\"Board Book\\" style is much more durable, as our child has torn a number of the classic Mr. Brown pages. That having been said, I would still encourage you to buy the classic version of Mr. Brown instead of this one; its ISBN number is 0394806220."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"Mr. Brown can moo, whisper, buzz, and boom . . . and that's just for starters. There are about a dozen different sounds to make along with Mr. Brown and all the sounds bear a pretty close resemblance to the originals (bees buzz, cows moo, thunder booms, etc.) with a few creative interpretations. Okay, so your child may be the only one saying &quot;dibble-dibble-dibble dopp-dopp-dopp&quot; for rain, instead of maybe &quot;pitter-patter. The pictures are simple - pretty much just Mr. Brown and each animal or item - no extraneous background drawings. My 2-year old daughter's favorite part of the book is the last page, where they list all the sounds in the book. Moo moo, buzz buzz, pop pop, klopp, and so on. She likes to try and repeat them with me really fast. Try adding some action along with the words, put all the tips of your fingers together to make a bee, rap on the book for a knock, put a finger to your lips for a whisper, etc. Oh, never mind reading all the reviews. It's a good book! Just buy it !"},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"I've never read the non-board book version, but other reviewers have said that the board book leaves out some content. I believe that because it doesn't seem to flow quite as well as other Dr. Seuss books do, but considering that the board book format is much better suited for very young children than other book formats, I feel like that's an acceptable compromise. This book has enough pages to make it a legitimate \\"story\\" unlike some other board books that only have say...3 pages.The one year old it was purchased for seemed to enjoy it."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"I won the hardback version and the boardbook version fo thiss book and the boardbook is much shorter and worded differently.

We read her many books but this is by far her favorite!"},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"This is one of the most fun books to read aloud ever!There isn't really any \\"plot\\"; the main character is the titular Mr. Brown, who has not only the ability to make a great many noises, but the will to go around doing so.Kids love the idea of a grown-up going around making animal noises, and many will join in the fun as you read it with them. Learning takes place without boredom!As with so many of Seuss's works, there is some deep pedagogical stuff going on beneath the playful surface. Take the word \\"Moo\\" in the title. Children who know that cows go \\"moo\\" don't have to be told that two o's together make an \\"oooooo\\" sound; many will see the cow, see the letter M followed by some letters, and unconsciously figure out that this is the sound \\"Moo\\"!You can ignore all that if you like. It's a fun book that many children will enjoy having re-read to them until they can read it themselves, and what could be better?"},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo!

For younger kids that's good for their attention span, but there are a lot more rhymes in the full book."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"It's ok, but nothing great.

Can you?","review":"I love Dr. Seuss, and I think this is one of his best. The text is a very catchy rhyme, the illustrations (like all Dr. Seuss books) are silly and fun. It's a great book for learning all kinds of sounds. Tons of books focus on animal sounds, but this one has animal sounds as well as other sounds your little one may hear often (such as the Knock Knock of a door or the Tick Tock of a clock). My daughter is 20 months old now, and she started enjoying this book from the time she was an infant. This book is fun enough for me to read that I don't mind reading it over and over, and she certainly wants to hear it a lot!"},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo!

Can you?","review":"This little board book is so much fun -- my three month old is mesmerized by it. It's appropriately subtitled as \\"Dr. Seuss's Book of Wonderful Noises\\" -- and it certainly runs through the range of noises. This book goes beyond the introductory cows go moo into a much broader range of sounds -- bees buzzing, corks popping, horses klopping, rain dibble dibble dopping. There is also reference to a soft whisper, so the reader can use a range of dynamics. The illustrations are classic Seuss - Mr. Brown is an odd little fellow with a tall brown hat, a spriggly mustache under his nose, and a haughty chin-in-the-air demeanor. The animals range from the semi-realistic to floppy-footed bizarre. Overall, this book is a delight that should keep any little one entertained for a few minutes."},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo!

The sounds are funny and you can interact with your child who will be fascinated by the noises you make when reading the story.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo! Can you?","review":"Dr. Seuss' original book is a wonderful, rhythmic book. That book is suggested for children four to eight years old. It is NOT the same as the Bright and Early Board Book which will pull the same reviews here on Amazon.com as the original book!The board book is an abridged version of the Dr. Seuss favorite. It is not a bad book (my son has fun with the board book which he received as a gift and likes to hear grandma make the sounds Mr. Brown makes). However, it is in no way as detailed as the original (no gum-chewing hippo for example) and the rhythm doesn't quite &quot;work&quot; in some places (&quot;...He can sound like a bee. Mr Brown can buzz. How about you? Can you buzz? ...&quot;).If I could separate my reviews I would give the Bright and Early Board book Two Stars and the Dr. Seuss original Four Stars.

The intent seems to have been to create an infant and toddler friendly edition of the book. Unfortunately, the editing was done very poorly. Much of what children seem to perceive at this age is \\"rhythm and rhyme\\" - the musicality of spoken language, if you will - not necessarily the story or the words themselves. In the editing process, much of the special \\"rhythm and rhyme\\" that makes Dr. Seuss so special was garbled. While some of the \\"noises\\" are still fun, much has been lost and this edition isn't half as good as the unabridged (non-board book) version.If you are looking for a book of \\"wonderful noises\\" for young children in a board book format, a better bet would be Sandra Boynton's \\"Moo Baa La La La\\" (published by Simon and Schuster and available on www.Amazon.com). Or, wait until your child is a little older and purchase the unedited Dr. Seuss (also available on www.Amazon.com).Incidentally, Random House decided to publish this edition without acknowledging the fact that it is an abridgement, in clear lettering, on the front outer cover . Other of this company's board books reportedly share the same problem. The legalities notwithstanding, this is certainly a misleading practice, if not outright unethical.

Can you?","review":"This book deserves many more than five stars for its great ability to engage your child with books at a very young age! With this head start, you can expect to help nurture a lifelong love of books and reading.Dr. Seuss must have known that children respond more to noises than to words. So this book emphasizes noises. It also provides a wonderful opportunity to act. The facial expressions, gestures, and body movements you make will create a strong impression. Soon your baby will begin to imitate the sounds. Imitating the word syllables and words is seldom far behind.&quot;Oh, the wonderful thingsMr. Brown can do!He can go like a cowHe can go Moo Moo&quot;Sections all start off like that. Then they end with the encouragement to imitate:&quot;Mr. Brown can do it.How about you?&quot;You can point to your child then, and repeat the sound with a nice smile.Here are the animals or objects, and the sounds they make that are in the book:bee -- &quot;Buzz Buzz&quot;cork -- &quot;Pop Pop&quot;horse feet -- &quot;Klopp Klopp Klopp&quot;squeaky shoe -- &quot;Eek Eek&quot;rooster -- &quot;Cock a Doodle Doo&quot;owl -- &quot;Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo&quot;rain -- &quot;Dibble Dibble Dibble Dopp&quot;train -- &quot;Choo Choo Choo Choo&quot;butterfly -- &quot;Whisper Whisper&quot;horn -- &quot;Blurp Blurp Blurp Blurp&quot;big cat drinking -- &quot;Slurp Slurp Slurp Slurp&quot;clock -- &quot;Tick Tock&quot;hand on a door -- &quot;Knock Knock&quot;egg in frying pan -- &quot;Sizzle Sizzle&quot;hippopotamus chewing gum -- &quot;Grum Grum&quot;goldfish kiss -- &quot;Pip!&quot;thunder -- &quot;Boom Boom Boom&quot;lightning -- &quot;Splatt Splatt Splatt&quot;The sounds are repeated as partial and total lists in several places. These repetitions can be made very humorous in your reading and cause gales of baby giggles.Except for the lists, there is a beautiful large illustration to help your baby or child tie the sound to an animal or object.A good way to enhance your baby's enjoyment of the book is to notice what sounds your baby seems to like already. For example, most babies like low, comfort sounds (in the moo moo range). You can add those sounds and your own drawings (or photographs) to go with them. You could have a refrigerator go Hum Hum Hum, or a car go Wrooom Wrooom. Your own ideas will be better than mine, I'm sure.Have a wonderful time being a parent, and be sure to take the time to enjoy the pleasures of books like this one with your baby!"},{"Title":"Mr. Brown can moo!

In the process of \\"adapting\\" these books to the kid-friendly formula, they appear to have edited out much of the original charm and wit....not to mention size!Disturbingly, the fact that these books are adaptations rather than originals is not clearly stated on the front cover, by the author's name. Instead, one has to look at the fine print on the inside of the front cover. One suspects that Random House feels these \\"Bright and Early Editions\\" wouldn't sell half as well if they were a little more forthcoming about what they have done.It is truly sad to see that these books have been subjected to editing by Philistines who operate under the false illusion that what form a book comes in is more important than what is written within.

In 1984 Born, a musician-cum-ethnographer spent a year observing the institute, and this expanded version of her subsequent Ph.D thesis was published in 1995.Fans of contemporary music--and I'm one--will be pleased to have the opportunity to learn something of the structure and day-to-day life of IRCAM. Born details the bureacratic hierarchy, the various types of employees, and the \\"squatters\\", composers entering after-hours to use the centre's equipment and hoping to be established workers there. She talks about typical visits by composers who come to be trained and to realise a piece at Ircam, and about the use of the fearsome 4X machine, IRCAM's early technological breakthrough. Born could not use real names in the preparation of her thesis, so instead people are referred to with random initials or with general attributes, but it's not particularly challenging to guess who is who. PL, the \\"black American composer\\" is Alvin Singleton, for example, and WOW is Jean-Baptiste Barriere. There are photos of IRCAM's hallways and offices, one containg a young Kaija Saariaho at work. Among the author's ethnographic themes are the phenomenon of the avant-garde (the \\"outsiders\\") becoming subsidized by the government (\\"the Establishment\\") and IRCAM's early shift from composer-scientist equality to scientists at the service of composers.In spite of the book's informative presentative of IRCAM, it is fraught with problems. Born mixes what should be a dispassionate report about the sociology of IRCAM with her own opinions on contemporary music, which she seems to loathe immensely. Right from the beginning she writes that she left the conservatory to play in rock bands because she didn't like modern styles. In the chapter on music, while reporting the discussions of some composers on their inspirations, she even suggests that what they are doing isn't real music at all.Throughout Born writes in such a way as to make the reader think that IRCAM is a worthless institution on the verge of being shut down. Granted, IRCAM took a while to get off the ground, and if one goes only by Born's 1984 chronicle, one might get the impression that it's not a terribly productive place. However, in the years following, many wonderful pieces came out of IRCAM, by such composers as Saariaho, Lindberg, Benjamin, and Eotvos. In 1984 all of the technology--a couple of huge servers--seems to be constantly on the fritz and without sufficient processing power for all users, but within a couple of years the centre transitioned to PCs and work gets along fine. Born does dedicate a few pages in the last chapter to later events in IRCAM, but she still ends the book in a critical fashion, not acknowledging any of the great achievements of the centre. Hand-in-hand with this are snipes at Boulez, whom Born seems to think a tyrant who holds music back instead of a benevolent dictator who has done so much to advance the art. At least there's little outright sniping at him here--on a recent radio BBC programme she accused him of \\"stealing\\" French music funds instead of really deserving them--but there is nonetheless a serious lack of respect.If you're curious about IRCAM, I'd recommend seeking the book out at your university library. It can be informative. However, Born's bias against great music, which permeates the whole book, is infuriating and I wouldn't recommend purchasing RATIONALIZING CULTURE."},{"Title":"Rationalizing Culture: Ircam, Boulez, and the Institutionalization of the Musical Avant-Garde","review":"Really rather a shame. Might have been quite an interesting work if it hadn't taken the by now utterly tired \\"it's an elitist institution of my god I hate it\\" track. Everyone knows that modernism is polemical and complex. This makes it extraordinarily interesting and exciting, but like every other form of modernism, its complexity opens it up to the rage of the slaves who scream the empty phrase \\"elitist\\" while failing to evaluate judicially the object under consideration (here a state funded institute for new music and musical research). One can only consider this work: a failure."},{"Title":"Rationalizing Culture: Ircam, Boulez, and the Institutionalization of the Musical Avant-Garde","review":"I first read this book before I became aquatinted with the &quot;New Musicology&quot; of cultural criticism. I assumed it to be a sociological report, rather than a musicological one. I did think it odd that this ?sociologist? took such as consistently hostile viewpoint of the musicians within I.R.C.A.M. and thought that some of the scholarship was not very rigorous. I assumed that this was because it was a sociologist ?out of her element,? discussing issues, with which she was not familiar. I figured that she must have had a passing bad experience with the modernists and gone to study them, while complaining about them in revenge.Later, in the course of studies in musicology, I came upon the strange camp of ?cultural criticism. There is a bit of solipsism in this viewpoint; all there is for anyone is a viewpoint constructed of a culturally specific semiotic code, that we can only understand the world through that code, and that we are therefore always biased to the point of being unable to really know anything. Therefore, in this viewpoint there is no knowledge, only a culturally situated set of biases, and any attempt to assert truth is looked upon as merely some sort of cultural power play.Georgina Born seems friendly to this philosophy. Her scholarship is good compared to many examples of the &quot;cultural critic&quot; literature, many of which are purposefully obscure and jargonistic (taking after Derrida et al), merely to intimidate the reader with rhetoric. This is a trick that they ironically picked up from academia (who largely did that unintentionally). However, when there is no truth, why not try to assert yourself over the others with whatever means? When there is no truth, there are no lies. Postmodern thought has recently spawned individuals who regard systems of logic as merely culturally situated (and oppressive, biased) semiotic codes, with no relation to reality. Georgina Born makes good arguments by comparison, but it should be noted that this research was probably inspired by the work of those others that I have just mentioned. One of the things that is necessary to pave the way for such criticism is the clearing aside of those pesky scholars that still think that it is possible to know something &quot;objective.&quot; Or at the least, to create a study that presents data in a straightforward manner rather than as pointed polemicThis book seems primarily motivated as a ?slam? (to use such as vulgar colloquialism) on the avant garde. Part of the doctrine of the avant garde was that they were supposed to be bringing the ?future? and destiny of a civilization back to it; they were prophets or ?cutting edge.? This of course implies that there was something to bring back; the idea of truth is implicit in the statement. The postmoderns have spent a good deal of their time trying to discredit the bulwarks of the avant garde and the study of music theory. In my opinion, book is part of that endeavour. It does contain some interesting titbits and some food for thought. This study could have been so much more interesting if it incorperated more points of view on the issues raised by ICRAM as an institution. Instead, we get an overdose of the rhetoric of the scholars of deconstructionism, cultural criticism, postmodernism, etc..."},{"Title":"Rationalizing Culture: Ircam, Boulez, and the Institutionalization of the Musical Avant-Garde","review":"The edifice of IRCAM, Insitut de Recherche et de Coordination Acoustique/Musique, an underground mecca for the new in Paris, well Europe is to foster a marriage between the current potentialities in technology and creativity,music composition. Pierre Boulez its founder and developer said so much in 1976, as part of the publicity. &quot;The creator's intuition alone is powerless to provide a comprehensive translation of musical invention. It is necessary for him to collaborate with scientific research worker inorder to envision the distant future.&quot; This is the first in English at least, profile of this historic institutionalization of new music, or the avant-garde. Although any of these terms are meaningless today. Who can define anymore, what a progressive endeavor is with the fragmentation of culture. Ms Born lived at IRCAM, it is housed in the lower bowels of the Pompidou Centre, the well-thought out royal blue and bright red smokestacks of architect Renzo Piano punctuating the 19th century ambience which is Paris. The red light area of Rue St Denis is walking distance and composers from all over Europe who work by invitation at IRCAM never fail to find inspiration away from the sterility of their work in composition. Ms Born is quite interesting for she projects the agenda here as a social one. She sees a larger frame than the music itself by drawing on thoughts of noted sociologist Pierre Bourdieu. Bourdieu has done so much as eqaute how, who and why listens to new creations in music. And we learn it is now and perhaps will always remain an elitist cadre of those who follow and nourish themselves with culture. We learn through MsBorn, how a composer works and how she/he makes proposals,structures for a work with the scientific aid of someone who specializes in the electronic/computer end of music. There is many times a fine line which separates the two. Each the composer for one must have some knowledge of the computer potentialities and the technician should be versed in the history of c! omposition, the achievements the avnat-garde has made since the end of the War. We find quite fascinating work with multiphonics, where a soloist, say a flutist or trombonist, sings and plays simultaneously. The result varies in an out-of-tune (at least to the traditional Beethoven ear) chord, quite arresting in its effectation. All these materials have been amply indexed, the composer merely chooses, from a table,and can hear the result from an in-house musician,vigorously versed in all the extended techniques. Ms.Born also reveals the dirty laundry at IRCAM the lack of a stable agenda at times, in the beginning years the politics, jettisoning founding members as Vinko Globokar, an equally gifted composer/trombonist. And Boulez the ultimate composer. He does stand well above anyone in Europe today. I should say did ,the Seventies and Eighties were the Boulez years of high power. Now he has retired, not even conducting as much the Ensemble Intercontemporain, a select ensemble of virtuosi,who have toured the world with IRCAM's message. And what might that be? Ms Born it's quite bizarre, she doesn't mentioned specific names in her wonderful profile. She was told not to, or perhaps the insights she received might result in retributions at higher levels, a guillotine might fall unexpectedly. So as you read through this book, composers and personnel are encripted in code. Quite mysteriously haunting. Foucualt in an interview with Boulez in the early Eighties said that music (and Foucault was not one to speak of music) that music of all the arts has certainly kept pace with technology. And that's wonderful except that IRCAM seems to be an elitist endeavor. It received the lion's share of all funding for all the arts in France. And when you consider that Paris houses 70% of French composers, yet only a handfull actually receive the knighted honor to work at IRCAM, it seems the avant-garde wastes no time in acquiring the kings robes to encript its content. Of all the music I've heard from IRCAM, I can't say I can ! distinguish one composer from another. All seem magnetized toward the use of metal instruments, percussion, very cold gestures. Peter Eotvos, Boulez first conductor-successor was the first to realize the severity at IRCAM didn't make interesting music. SO Mr.Eotvos turned an ear toward the accessible yet not obviously so. His &quot;Chinese Opera&quot; for the Ensemble is quite powerful and evocative. It seems the avant-garde cannot cope with the real world, Just like the wood the ancestors of Venice once brought in 550 AD to buttress their city which is now Venice. The wood will not rot as long as it remains submerged,as oxygen hits it, the real social world, it rots. Ms Born in one chapter the &quot;Social Problems of Production&quot; draws light on IRCAM's social problems. Also there is a generous accompaniment of photographs of the instruments and computer systems used. As for the future of music and IRCAM well it will persist as long as it remains submerged ,cloistered away from the vagaries of the real world."},{"Title":"The caretaker (Gateway library)","review":"With this play which was first produced in 1960 Pinter became a well- known and admired dramatist. It is still considered one of his finest plays. It is the story of three character, Davies, an elderly wanderer who has been saved by the middle- aged Aston and brought into the home he shares with his brother Mick. The three characters in the course of the play talk at length and reveal their own respective characters. There is a sense of menace and threat in the relationships- and there is much focusing on trivialities of everyday life. The play in short is Pinteresque though it static quality, absurdity and illogic make it somewhat difficult to get a hold on.There are fine, and at times funny passages in the work. The down- and-out Davies who also goes by the name of Jenkins is frequently taunted by the younger brother Mick. Mick dreams of the apartment being elaborately restored. The middle brother Astin who has undergone shock treatments is often fragmented and broken. The play is filled with attacks on the major characters. .I have never been a big fan of the Theatre of the Absurd (Beckett, Ionesco, Pinter) and when I do like it it is because of the beautiful, lyrical passages which in my feeling Becket particularly excels in. For me Pinter is not bad, but far indeed from the status of writer whose works we would like to return to again and again."},{"Title":"The caretaker (Gateway library)","review":"Harold Pinter was born in London in 1930. In 1995 he won the David Cohen British Literature Prize, awarded for a lifetime's achievement in literature.On 30 May 1960, the play was presented by Michael Codron and David Hall at the Duchess Theatre, London, with the following cast:Mick, a man in his late twenties: Alan BatesAston, a man in his early thirties: Peter WoodthorpeDavies, an old man: Donald PleasanceThis is the story of three men. Mick is the proprietor of a shabby house in West London. Aston, his brother, is always busy with something but never accomplishes anything. Finally there is Davies, some kind of a hobo, adopted by Aston who gives him a place to sleep and - after a while - asks him if he wants a job as the caretaker. Davies is very reluctant and finds petty excuses to postpone the decision of becoming the caretaker.As the story unfolds, you ask yourself if anything will ever change and if anything important will ever happen ('No Exit' by J.P.Sartre comes to mind: four persons who will have to suffer each other for Eternity).The most impressive part of the play is the monologue by Aston in which he tells how he was treated with electro-shocks when he was a kid. This is one of the most gruesome parts I know in modern theatre.A final remark: when you read (or listen to) this play, you will soon find out that one of the most attractive parts of this play is the very lively and humorous dialogue"},{"Title":"The caretaker (Gateway library)","review":"\\"The Caretaker\\" (1960) has some of Pinter's typical Absurdist features, but this three-act three character play seems less interesting, less involving, more rambling and talky than his other early work. It has the same claustrophobic seedy one-room he has used before, but his three people don't make contact with us and involve us. Two brothers, Aston and Mick, seem to share a room or a house. Mentally-challenged Aston brings home Davies, a derelict, and sets him up as a quasi-caretaker of the property. Davies has trouble with his inadequate shoes, just as does a character in \\"Waiting for Godot\\" by Beckett, Pinter's mentorWe get so much talk, jabbering and background information from Davies and Aston that we eventually tire of it. Aston had been institutionalized because of his mental condition and been given shock treatments. At one brief moment of the play, Davies suggests he has been confined in such a place. Sinister acting Mick menaces and threatens Davies so Davies pulls a knife to protect himself.In other plays Pinter was able to get audience or readers interested in the characters because of their quirkiness and the feeling of puzzles within enigmas, but in this play he bores us because he lets it go on too long. The set is depressing which only emphasizes the tedious and stultified nature of the characters.Each of the three seems to be a dodgy type. Mick seems to be unsavory, Davies is shiftless and seems on the run, and Aston is not playing with a full deck. Davies and Aston tell a lot about themselves; Mick remains more of a mystery. They all talk in circles and repeat things. At times Mick talks like a catalog of interior design.Mick, too, engages Davies as a caretaker, but then they have a territorial squabble. The tables are turned. Later Davies tries to assert himself and throw out Aston.A very humorous attack is launched by Mick who claims that Davies said he was an interior decorator. Then both brothers want Davies out.The Pinteresque pauses that he became famous for seemed to begin in this play. Davies says to Aston, \\"You must be off your nut.\\" Exits and entrances are weird in this play.In this play Pinter goes awry, with all technique and little inspiration."},{"Title":"The caretaker (Gateway library)","review":"Thrillingly suspenseful.

It includes all forms of construction and gives very informative descriptions of each style. The history related here is invaluable to the reader, as it takes you back in time. The pictures are full color and very articulately done. I found the colors presented in the homes helpful to me in restoring our stone house, built in the 1830's.

Authors: Margaret Bye Richie, Geoffrey Gross, Gregory Huber. 208 pages. 2005.I picked up this book from the library. At the library I thumbed through the book and was very impressed with the photography. I knew from previous readings that stone house construction was more common in the Keystone State than any other of the original colonies. Stone construction was used in the construction of Georgian designs which in other colonies were constructed of wood or brick. This extensive use of stone makes Pennsylvania somewhat unique.This book did little expand my knowledge on the how or the why of stone construction. Surprisingly only about 70 of the houses in this book are actually constructed of stone, others are built of brick. Not every building in this book is a house and several of these buildings were constructed in the 20th Century. Not exactly what I was looking for when I checked the book out of the library.While the book was not exactly what I hoped it would be I will say that the photographs are beautiful, especially the interiors. The accompanying text tends to focus on provenance and therefore who and when. The text provides little as to the why or the distinctive features. A good book as a pretty coffee table book."},{"Title":"Stone Houses: Traditional Homes of Pennsylvania's Bucks County and Brandywine Valley","review":"This is a very pretty book and very well photographed. The choice of houses, however, left something to be desired and the writeups on the houses themselves were thin and more akin to a puffy decorator magazine than any kind of detailed study. The book also had utterly no floorplan sketches for any of the homes, which is really almost mandatory for an architecture book. Some of the houses selected were not of any particular merit nor were they even old. Most of the write-ups on the various houses had almost nothing to say about the architectural detail and history nor any kind of regional or sub-regional analysis. Some photos were selected obviously because they were \\"pretty\\" but had utterly nothing to do with Pennsylvania -- the New England chest on the back cover is a good example. It's a nice book to flip through but don't expect great depth."},{"Title":"Stone Houses: Traditional Homes of Pennsylvania's Bucks County and Brandywine Valley","review":"Wonderful photos and very interesting and informative text.Exceptional detail photos of insides of dwellings.

When you think of Shakespeare, you automatically think of plays -- \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" \\"Macbeth,\\" \\"Hamlet,\\" etc.But he was also a poet of considerable skill. And while he sprinkled his various plays with poetry and songs, his poems are best appreciated when they're read all by themselves -- particularly the cluster of brilliant \\"Sonnets\\" that he penned. These works just have a unique, hauntingly vivid flavour of their own.Each sonnet has no title, and is simply identified by numbers. And while Shakespeare's love poems are the best known of these works, he addresses different themes in theme -- old age, writer's block loneliness, the cruelty of the world, sex, beauty, a mysterious rival poet, and Shakespeare's own complicated romantic feelings (love that \\"looks upon tempests and is not shaken\\").And these poems are absolutely lovely. Some of these sonnets are pretty well-known (\\"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?/Thou art more lovely and more temperate\\") but most of them are a little more obscure. They have vivid metaphors and imagery (\\"let not winter's ragged hand deface,\\" \\"gold candles fix'd in heaven's air\\") and hauntingly lovely passages (\\"What is your substance, whereof are you made,/That millions of strange shadows on you tend?\\").And these sonnets really give you new insights into Shakespeare as a person -- he feels uncertainty, passionate love, unhappiness, lust and quirky humor. But while it's obvious these sonnets were deeply personal, they can still be appreciated on their own, particularly as love poetry.William Shakespeare's \\"Sonnets\\" are rich with meaning, language and atmosphere -- the Elizabethan English takes a little deciphering, but it's well worth it."},{"Title":"Sonnets of William Shakespeare","review":"Just received it today (7-12-2010). Sweet little book, would tell others about it, the nice little size allows me to carry it in my purse. This is my first book of Shakespeare, I'm more mature now, and can appreciate these types of fine literature."},{"Title":"THE UNTOUCHED KEY","review":"In The Untouched Key, the great psychiatrist Alice Miller has written another penetrating work about the manifestation of subconscious experiences into the conscious world. As far as I am concerned, most of the more recent modern writers on the subject have little to add to works like this one. Here is a highly respected and successful therapist, who went out on a limb and confessed to her colleagues, at a time when she could have been basking in the glory of seniority, that she finally realized she only went into the field to learn how to heal her own pain; and then had the courage to withdraw her membership from psyciatric associations once she realized their hypocrisy (which she took full responsibility for in herself, as well).In this very fine but brief work, Alice Miller studies pivotal works of art and compares their content with the life stories of their creators. The resulting analysis is impeccably true-to-life and highly plausible. She does not trivialize art in doing so, but makes a sound case for how artistic expression could be the great liberator of mankind, and brings us to even greater respect of the artists she discusses. Whether they knew it or not (probably not?) their unrestrained creativity is presented as a gift to teach and inspire us all, subconsciously or consciously, whether or not we choose to analyze it ourselves."},{"Title":"THE UNTOUCHED KEY","review":"I think it is time that ALice Miller recieve the credit due her for her enormous efforts in uncovering coded childhood trauma. Her tireless work has had an transformative and empowering impact on my life and the way I view my childhood and children. In this book Alice uncovers what some people want to view as a &quot;masterpieces&quot; of &quot;ART&quot;. &quot;What is really going on here?&quot;she asks. &quot;Look deeper..what is this artist trying to communicate&quot;. At times Alice observes and brings to light that the artist is screaming. THis book is SO important!"},{"Title":"THE UNTOUCHED KEY","review":"This is one of the most important books you could ever read. It takes the world of childhood to a place you will never forget. As Miller walks you through her interpretations of the lives and self expression of Keaton, Nietzsche, Picasso, Kollwitz and others, you will learn intuitively how to interpret things the way she does. There is a loss of innocence in this process so it is a kind of initiation which comes to the depths of your soul. Your life will be much richer for this knowlege and your understanding of children and the inner child of every adult you know will be that much riper. Once you have read this book, you will wonder how you could ever have been so DEAF and so DUMB and so BLIND!!"},{"Title":"THE UNTOUCHED KEY","review":"A few years ago the therapist I had gone to see durnig a particularly harrowing period of my life recommended I buy a copy of Alice Miller's \\"The Drama of the Gifted Child\\" since she was certain that it would speak to the particular challenges I faced. \\"Wow,\\" I thought, feeling flattered, \\"here's one intuitive lady. She can tell right off I'm a 'gifted' individual, one of the special ones.\\" I headed to the nearest bookstore directly after the session and bought a copy and read half of it on the bus before I even got home.No insult, no rejection, no critical barb that I'd ever experienced so quickly, nor so thoroughly deflated my ego--nor, as it turned out, so permanently.I think I had some notion that the book was going to confirm my lifelong notion that I was some sort of exceptional creature of starlight that my dimwitted and immature parents, so ill-suited for parenting, had all but managed to snuff out with their psychological buffooneries. Oh, they had crushed me alright, or nearly so, twisted me, stifled me to the point where I am practically beyond normal human functioning, but the culture wasn't thereby losing any luminous polestar of immortal significance. Ha! I was just a normal, abused little boy. There was nothing special about me except my terrible and unrelenting need to be special. If you took any ten people, the only difference between me and the other nine was that I thought there was a difference. I had to be different; I had to be special in order to win my parent's love; in order to justify to myself their ill-treatment of me, I had to be the disguised prince, the Cinderella mistreated like a dirty scullery maid.That was my drama: the drama of the \\"gifted\\" child.Unlike me, and yet, at the same time, also like me, the artists, poets, philosophers, and dictators that Alice Miller treats in her book \\"The Untouched Key\\" did become world-renowned, did achieve a cultural immortality for their achievemens, whether for good or evil--and they were also all abused as children.Ordinarily I wouldnt subscribe to this sort of psychological reductivism, the kind that traces an artist's or philosopher's ouvre backwards to the beatings he used to get as a six-year-old or his mother's pathological coldness or whatever. But Miller's argument is not only compelling it also acknowledges that the work of the adult artist is by no means invalidated because their worldview can be traced to their mistreatment as a child. The world can be understood just as Nietzsche understood it; indeed, the fact that Nietzsche's philosophy speaks to so many, seems so dead-on accurate, is because the world--full of grown-up abused children as it is--really does operate along lines of power and submission, of the strong and the weak.Somewhat more controversial, however, is Miller's claim that the wellsprings of so much human creativity up to this point in history are almost exclusively to be found in childhood trauma. Art and history are, in a sense, a record of child abuse!This seems a pretty preposterous proposition until you pause, take a good look at the world, and ask yourself if there is another more plausible explanation for the universal trainwreck that is humanity's lot, and always has been humanity's lot...and will continue being our lot for whatever future we still have as a species. What, after all, Miller argues, is the single most important common experience every human being everywhere shares? A childhood is her answer. We come out of the womb naked and innocent, knowing neither hatred nor cruelty...so how could things possibly have gotten to the point they have? Where do things go off the rails? To Miller it seems obvious. It's the way we're raised...by and large by parents who were also traumatized as children, and so it goes, and will continue going.Among others, Miller turns her attention to Picasso, Stalin, Celan, Soutine, but it's Nietzsche to whom she devotes most of her book--and a good deal of the space she devotes to him is taken up with extensive excerpts from his work meant to illustrate the effect his awful childhood had on him--an effect, she asserts, eventually drove him insane.Miller does not deny that a Picasso or a Nietzsche were indeed special; she doesn't deny that special people do exist, or that they don't possess aptitudes beyond the ordinary; they do. But she wonders what they might have been able to produce if they had been able to use their magnificent talents unencumbered by their unhappy pasts, if they hadn't been reflecting back to the world the story of their personal abuse which is also, in microcosm, the history of humanity's abuse towards its children, an abuse so many of endured at the hands of those who had the most influence in forming our view of the world and how to survive in it."},{"Title":"THE UNTOUCHED KEY","review":"Alice Miller examines in this work the early childhood of a number of creative figures, Picasso, Kathe Kollwitz, Buster Keaton, Paul Celan, Nietzsche .She also has an essay called 'When Isaac Arises From the Sacrificial Fire' and one on 'The Newly Recognized Effects of Child Abuse'.She says in her opening sentence, that she 'wanted to demonstrate that the works of writers,poets and painters tell the encoded story of childhood traumas no longer consciously remembered in childhood.' She also claims that her effort to share her findings with fellow psychiatrists was by and large rejected.My problem with her in this work is not with her general principle but rather with the way she illustrates and proves it. She begins with the life of Picasso. She says there is little material on his early childhood a period ordinarily skimmed over by biographers. But she in researching the life came across the information that when he was three years old Picasso along with his parents survived an earthquake in Malaga. She connects this with the fact that Picasso's second sister was born three weeks later. These two pieces of information then become the basis of her understanding Picasso's 'trauma' of birth .She claims that his parents enabled him to freely play and use his imagination. But Picasso resisted the discipline of school of any kind of restriction which would bring him back to the world of his trauma. I found here her argument to be both skimpy in evidence and loose in its connections.So too her treatment of Buster Keaton explains that as a child actor he was traumatized when laughing on stage. This laughing somehow led the audience to laugh less and so was strongly disapproved of by his parents. Keaton was taught he must not laugh and the deadpan disguises and suppresses his emotional life.In reading Neitzsche's life she claims that what he wrote ' was his hopeless attempt , which he didn't abandon until his breakdown, to free himself from his prison by expressing his unconscious but present hatred for those who raised and mistreated him.His hatred and his fear of it, became all the more vehement the less he succeeded in becoming independent of its objects, his mother and sister.\\"My question would not be whether this claim is valid, but rather how far it goes in explaining the whole complex of Nietzsche's world of ideas.Moreover and this a key point it seems to me that these kinds of explanations could be used in each and every person's life. They do not really provide a key to the 'special gift' of the person.Nonetheless the book contains much interesting information and speculation. A brief, easy and largely enjoyable read. I would recommend it not be taken as the 'Bible' but rather as another interpretative essay which adds to our understanding of the figures in question."},{"Title":"THE UNTOUCHED KEY","review":"This book is what I consider, next to the Bible, required reading for anyone who was born, is now a parent, will be a parent, or any of the other possibilities.

It provides tremendous insights into the family lives and traumas of Nietzsche, Hitler, Stalin and others. Her insights into the hidden or unrecognized abuses that go on in families are tremendous--but not everyone can accept what she writes, because it requires some painful recognitions about our own family lives."},{"Title":"THE UNTOUCHED KEY","review":"Buster Keaton was NOT abused as a child. He himself had stated this many times in his life. He was literally strip-searched in front of both the mayor and governer of New York of his time to show the brusies and injuries on his person which were NOT THERE. Also to think about, Buster's father, Joe Keaton, was mostly angered by the fact that the social group going after their stage act, didn't protect or help the homeless and penniless children of 1910s New York and instead went after Buster who had both parents, friends, a steady job, and thought the roughhousing was a lot of fun.

I found particularly insightful these comments from the text:\\"The psalmist knew that all being and action had their origin in God.\\"\\"To love the Lord is the path, and the only path, to hoping in the Lord. So had the psalmist found it for himself. In his changeful, perilous years of exile he had learned that the brightness with which hope glowed on his lonely path depended not on the accident of greater or less external security, but on the energy of the clear flame of love in his heart. Not in vain had his trials been to him, which cast that rich treasure to his feet from their stormy waves. Not in vain will ours be to us, if we learn the lesson which he here would divide with all those \`that wait on the Lord.'\\"\\"A parent can have no sharper pang than the sight of his own sins reappearing in his child.\\""},{"Title":"The life of David as reflected in his Psalms ([Baker co-operative reprint library])","review":"Great study book of the Psalms.

It's not the worst, either. The story line is what you would expect; girl meets boy, they fall in love, but a combination of family issues and financial problems keep the lovers from getting married. Compared to most novels of the the era, the plot lines are thin and feel contrived, character development is limited, and there is a little too much \\"sensibility\\" throughout the whole novel.However, it does have some strengths. Brooke had an excellent talent for description. You feel the winter chill, the warmth of the fires, and the mist blowing off the ocean. Brooke also had a clean and flowing writing style, especially for this period. Consequently, the reader gets an excellent picture of colonial Canada in general, and Quebec in particular. She skillfully describes interactions between English and French colonials and even has a scene or two involving aboriginal people. If Fodor or Baedecker where hiring at the time, she could have been their best travel writer.If you like novels from this period, you will like Emily Monatague.

Though it was heavily laced with symbolism, the fact that Hester Prynne showed strength and dignity throughout in a situation that is still relevant today makes this one of my favorite books. I did not like Dimmesdale at all. He was almost weaker than you would think humanly possible, but I suppose that was Hawthorne trying to make a point. I thought it was overall a book that everyone should read due to its messages about standing up for what you believe in, self love, strength, determination and confidence. Hester is a rolemodel for all women because even though she had a man with no backbone, she made the decision to stand by him and not give him away and she never compromised herself. She even regained the respect of her fellow townspeople by turning the A she wore from a negative to a positive when she became an entreprenuer, which was unheard of in those days. She was the sole source of income and support for her daughter Pearl. Rev. Dimmesdale by the way should remain an examole of what not to do for a man in his situation. Although a little corny at times, it should stay on the list of books to be read by students of all ages. There is much to gain from it on many levels."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne does an excellent job at depicting a huge 'American' characteristic; the public punishment for private transgression. Clinton was scrutinized for his private, adulterous act in the oval room, but it was Hawthorne that wrote about this public punishment through the character, Hester Prynne. Written in the nineteenth century, about the Puritans in the seventeenth century, in Boston, Massachussetts, Hawthorne sets up the cruel punishment that Hester sufferred for her adultery. Having to wear a bright, red letter 'A' on her breast at all times, being forced to move to the outskirts of town, and being treated as a whore, Hester suffered for the love that she found in the pastor, Dimmesdale. Their love did not comply with the Puritan communal laws, nor by the laws of God, in turn resulting in the scrutinization of Hester and her daughter, Pearl. Discretion and true love are not rewarded in this story, although the love was more lively, brighter, and real, in comparison to the bland, monotonous marraiges of the Puritans. If one is in the mood for long, elaborated, descriptions of plot detail, in lue of the timeless themes, then this is the novel for you."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This was a very good book. It started out about a Women names Hester Prynne who committed adultery. Her community and all who judged her made her wear the letter &quot;A&quot; on her chest to signify what she has done. Hester had been having an affair with her priest, Aurther Dimmesdale. Se was made to stand on a scaffold in the middle of town. Although it was supposed to be an embarrassing thing to have to do, she did not act ashamed at all. Pearl has a daughter named Pearl whom her husband finds out later that it is not his child but it is Aurthor Dimmesdale's. At the begining of this book it got a little confusing but once it started to pick up the pace it all fell into place. This book was set in Salem, Massachusetts, also where Howthorne was born and grew up with his puritan traditions."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"For American Literature we were assigned to read this book. When I first started reading it, I really had trouble because of the wording. But then I really got into it. Besides the wording, this book is great. There are so many things you can learn from this book. It will have you asking questions about the society back then, and even about our society today. If you ever get a chance to read this book, I would strongly suggest it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"While I was less than impressed with The Scarlet Letter when I read it in high school I LOVED it this time around. Hawthorne's rich use of language adds to what is already an intensely compelling story. Hester Prynne is a standout among a throng of submissive Puritan women and one of the most interesting heroines in literature. She steadfastly stands up for herself and her child's well-being amidst a storm of controversy surrounding her actions. Symbolically and literally, this is a beautiful novel that explores the inner workings of the human heart and various facets of forgiveness, guilt, passion, pride, self-worth, and the standards by which we judge those around us."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This novel is a very intriguing story about an attractive young woman living in a Puritan society, where she is put in compromising situations and must maneuver herself out of them. Hester Prynne (the captivating young puritan woman) has allowed herself to be put in one too many situations though, when she gets pregnant by a man other than her husband. This terrible sin caused the Puritan society to punish her for her sins against god and her husband. In doing so the community sentenced Hester to live the rest of her life wearing the letter \\"A\\" on the bosom of her dress. This entire scenario is described extremely well by Hawthorne, by using elaborate sentences with great descriptions, both of the people's opinions and of the scenery, to provide a very full and vivid picture in the mind of the reader. This story has great twists and surprises in it which draws the reader into the story, to where the reader feels as if they are actually in the society and watching how every one acts towards Hester and her daughter. Hawthorne uses advanced vocabulary to describe the settings, people, and the people's opinions. The descriptive sentences and complex vocabulary of this novel make it very attractive to any reader wishing to expand their vocabulary and even part of their history, by learning a little about how the Puritan society's belief system worked and how the society viewed people and their actions. Now granted all the information in this novel is not all factual however the reader gets a real feel of strict and moral the Puritans were during that time. This novel by far with its advanced vocabulary and wonderfully descriptive sentences is one of the best novels I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Scarlet Letter was rather dry and not very intresting at the beginning, but overall, the book was pretty bearable, if not interesting at times. Hester's daughter, for example, was quite intriguing with her &quot;witchy- sinful?&quot; characteristics and I felt really sorry for Hester. The ending was kinda predictable, but still, if you want to read it, check it out from the library."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Hawthorne's theme of secret sin and the fault of all humans is once again present in this novel. A woman, Hester Prynne, has committed adultery, with a priest nonetheless. She is made to wear this shame, by having a scarlet letter sewn on to her clothing. She is shunned by all of her townspeople as they see the scarlet letter on her breast. The townspeople however, do not know the sin was committed with their new minister, Arthur Dimmesdale. Dimmesdale allows her to bear this burden alone. Hester's husband is believed to be dead, but he comes back as a doctor for the priest with the name of Roger Chillingworth. A chilling feeling is just what he inflicts upon people. He has a knowledge of natural medicines, and becomes the doctor for the priest, only so he can seek his revenge. The priest suffers from heart troubles, a burden of the hidden sin, and is on the verge of death. He goes and sees his and Hester's daughter Pearl, a sprite like girl, and promises to sail away with her and Hester. The ending is unexpected and sudden but also appropriate. The burden of secret sin, and the purging that comes from exposing this sin reigns throughout the novel. Beautifully written and wonderfully conceived, this novel is a timeless classic that will remain for years to come."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Haven't finished the book, but love it. Little Pearl is my favorite character. The language is a little unfamiliar but very descriptive and eloquent. Recommend for anyone interested in religiosity of colonial times."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Nathanial Hawthorne is an exceptionally bright author. His use of symbolism is amazing and the plot is pretty good too. However, I must say the book is way too long and very difficult to read. Only read it if you are forced to for school. If you have to read it, try your best to appreciate it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Hawthorne's best work is central to understanding the trajectory of american culture from the Puritans to the moderns. Still, many of the book's allusions will be cryptic to contemporary readers. The footnotes and appendices make the book more available without all the weight of the Norton edition."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This book was written in the 19th century to make a point about the 19th century. To do so, however, it caricatures the 17th-century Puritans pretty badly, a people who were generally cheerful, generous, and deeply suspicious of legalism. They even wore colorful clothing.I encourage you to read The Scarlet Letter as a classic novel that speaks to a number of universal human themes, just don't expect it to be historically accurate."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"In The Scarlet Letter, Nathaniel Hawthorne tells a story of the results of sin. Set in Seventeenth Century Massachusetts, it is a tale of the life of Hester Prynne, who has been convicted of adultery. She is sentenced to wear a scarlet letter \\"A\\" on her chest, as a badge of dishonor. We follow her decisions to keep her lover secret, and how this bears down on her over time. We watch as her child (Pearl) resultant of the act grows into a wild daughter, unrestrained by her mother (who feels guilt from her sin, and who also questions the established morals of the society she lives in). All the while, her aged, learned husband comes closer and closer to discovering the identity of the man who took part in the adultery.Hawthorne describes all this with unique detail. Nearly every object -- whether it be a rose at a prison door, or a river in the woods -- contributes some symbolism to the plot. The language of the narrative is very fitting, and the dialogue is delightfully written in the correct form of the day. With small supporting details woven in (such as the few brief but important appearances of a witch named Mistress Hibbins) and the deep symbolism, The Scarlet Letter has an almost supernatural tone, while it still remains a perfectly realistic novel.Many consider The Scarlet Letter to be Nathaniel Hawthorne's crowning achievement. It has certainly stood the test of time, being a classic that is now over 150 years old, and still very well known. For anyone who enjoys this style of literature, this book is one to read.Ryan RobledoAuthor of the Aelnathan:"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Pretensions of public morality is what Hawthorne aims at--his story shows the hypocrisy of Puritan leaders imposing a legalistic, rigid morality on the community, and lifelong shame on one woman's indiscretion, to the extent that their judgmental rigidness can almost be deemed a sin in its own right. You can see the ending coming a mile away, and it's a bit too melodramatic for my taste. Even so, the real story is not just the actions of the characters but rather how guilt works itself out--Hawthorne's storytelling keeps you absorbed right to the end such that you don't want to put the book down. Very interesting food for thought on the relationship of public and private morality. Shows that refusal to forgive can be more of an evil than \\"sin\\" as society defines it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter / 1-59027-004-5The classics aren't usually considered light reading, and Scarlet Letter is no exception, but if you haven't been exposed to the story before, you might consider picking up a copy.This classic story of love, adultery, sin, and redemption is artfully written, as Hawthorne scathingly mocks the morals of his time. What good is it to deny a woman love when her husband is lost at sea? What good is it to deny a child a father because of the \\"sin\\" of her parents?Hawthorne skillfully explores the psyche of people living under the burden of an oppressive system: a lady burdened with the guilt of being a single mother, a minister burdened with the guilt of his secret love, and a child burdened with a wild temperament untamed by a father's love or a mother's discipline.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"'The Scarlet Letter' is a beautifully written and perfectly balanced classic of American literature, addressing in a lean 251 pages countless issues of the human experience: love, the nature of sin and shame and repentance, revenge and mercy, civilization and wild, society and ostracism. In bald terms, 'The Scarlet Letter' is absolutely one of the best pieces of writing ever, um, written.A lot of people seem to take umbrage at Hawthorne's affected 19th-century style. My advice to you: get over it. It's a style, no more or less valid than any other style, and though it is a kind of writing that is out of fashion at the moment, Hawthorne manages to create an extremely deep and moving story much more effectively than most of the modern authors I read. The same advice do I offer to those who complain that they were 'forced' to read this book for a class. Please, skip the next episode of 'Gilmore Girls' and sit down with a book like this one. Your mind will thank you later."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This book collects the strip from when it was started during the depression, through the war years, and into the early post war. The cast of characters, the story lines, and settings provide insight into an era fading from memory. It's a morality play from a simpler though poorer time the country is nostolgic for. Good and evil are black and white. Innocents are led astray by cold hearted killers, shown the error of their ways, and forgiven. The storys take place in a time during which the US went from facing the greatest hardships it had known to finding itself a superpower. It was physically a different country, heavily industrial, agricultural, without television, linked with railroads instead of interstate highways. Dick Tracy was the prototype of today's tough, smart cops, MacGyver and CSI in a time when a cop had little to rely on besides his own eyes and brain. He always got his man - if he (or she) didn't earn some horrible end first. Crime doesn't pay. It's great fun to read."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The majority of reviews for Hawthorne's classic, THE SCARLET LETTER, here at Amazon.com have been negative. Many of the people writing the reviews appear not to have read much classic literature. To give them credit, I don't know why this novel is forced upon young minds and influential minds. This book is not meant for the close-minded. Having lived a life as shallow as most Americans do today, it would be hard to appreciate the genius of Hawthorne's masterpiece.THE SCARLET LETTER remains as significant today as it did when it was first published. The book, though full of symbolism, is much more than a simple morality tale. It is a tale of passion and lust, truth and lies, life and death, revenge and betrayal. The story illustrates the disasters of living an unhonest and sinfilled life. It serves as a historical text in to an age that has past away and it gave us one of the first truly feminist characters in American literature. The story remains prevalent because it speaks on so many different levels, illuminating a little of each person as they read.Therefore, do not be discouraged by the large vocabulary and do not let one's inexperience in life and literatrue dissuade you from reading one of the great pieces of American literature.As a footnote, the WSP Enriched Classic edition of the novel includes a wonderful introduction, pictures, critical excerpts, notes of Hawthorne's, and a few other extras that make this a superb copy to own."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I had to read this book for English class, and I did not enjoy it. My favorite genre is scifi-technthriller, and this clearly is not it. However, although I had to force myself to flip to the next page, when we analyzed it in class the book was amazing. Hawthorne can be considered nothing less than a pure genius in his writing. We could easily spend 30 minutes talking about a single page in our class of 17. The amount of detail and hidden information is astonishing. So, if you like love stories, (which I think this can be considered), this is the book for you. Otherwise, buy a Tom Clany novel."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter is a good but long and discriptive book. I wouldn't tell anybody to read it unless they classic books or a Hawthorne fan. This book and also The House of The Seven Gables are based on the one unlying rule of Hawthorne description. His books wouldn't be so long if he would have just gotton to the plot. Now don't get me wrong the plot to this book was good but the movie is even better. If you have to read it just deal with it. All I know is that is didn't hold my attenion very long and I fell asleep a couple of times."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This book has to be one of the most tedious works of literature ever written. Hawthorne is a great writer, but I don't know how this book made it into that sacred list we call \\"classics\\". Perhaps on the merit of his name alone?"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Call me weird, but around Thanksgiving, my interests turn to ethe earlies colonial American society, the time of the Pilgrims and the Puritans, the 1600's, after Jamestown disappeared, when the Indians lived west of the budding communities in the East Coast, among them Salem, Massachussets. In Nathaniel Hawthorne's most famous novel, we are caught in the bleak and powerfully intense world of a Puritan village. Hester Prynne and her \\"bastard\\" daughter Pearl are shunned by the rest of the village for Hester has committed adultery. Her husband, Chillington, was away in England, which was in the middle of a war or something and he was away so long that he was presumed dead. Still, in those days, a widow had to remain loyal to the memory of her husband. Also, it was not known that Chillington was dead and he could be alive. Hester fell for the Reverend Dimmesdale, the spiritual leader of the community. While Hester's sin came out, Dimmesdale could not bring himself to tell the truth. Hester suffers shame, exile and disdain and through the experience attains the forgiveness of the community. She is perhaps the first adulterous heroine in 19th century literature who does not die in the end! Instead she triumphs through her innate virtue and desire for rehabilitation. However, Dimmesdale's guilt and Chillington's inhumanity are the focus of the novel. The theme of the violation of the human heart is the real strength of the novel. Dimmesdale suffers far mroe than Hester. He is eaten up by guilt, and nightly flogs himself. He is surrounded by corrupt Puritan leaders, including the Governor and his sister who is an honest to goodness witch. Chillington uses subterfuge to shame Dimmesdale and drive him mad with guilt. Dimmesdale dies of guilt. The novel is immersed in Gothic elements and in typical Hawthorne symbolism which deal with man's struggle versus sin and good versus evil. The \\"Black Man in the Forest\\" is the Devil, Pearl is a frighteningly weird girl, a comet prophetizes death, and even ghosts figure in this novel. In many ways, it is a little like Hawthorne's short story John Goodman Brown, about a man who discovers that the spiritual leaders he once believed were good were really Devil worshippers and when they come for his pious wife he succumbs to evil. The dark world that Hawthorne describes were moralizing tales. The 19th century, with its industrial revolution, capitalism and materialism, was thought by spiritual people to be in danger of losing its soul. Charles Darwin came along and rejected the idea of Creation! Atheism was spreading, science was advancing and the world was getting bigger. Hawthorne may have been spurred to write novels like this to get the message across that being godly is important in a world that is crumbling in and out."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"There is absolutely nothing captivating about this novel. Throughout the novel, only 3 major events occur: one in the beginning, one in the middle, and one at the end. The characters are flat and difficult to relate to. Overall the book was decent at best and could have been completed in no more than 50 pages or so. Hawthorne's writing is totally ridiculous. He goes on and on stating irrelevant details and fills page after page with unnecessary imagery. These pages consist of long paragraphs, some which encompass multiple pages. If I didn't have to read this for class I definitely would not have read it on my own. I'm not saying that it is a difficult novel, but it is an unpleasant one. In the end, if you are looking to read great American novels, skip over this one and go read some Steinbeck or Twain."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I did read the book in hs, so maybe that is when I bought it, but who knows. I just have to write words so that I can be done with reviewing this."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This is a tragedy in two ways. Everyone dies at the end, and if you have to or choose to read this you will experience a tragedy.I can compare this book to a lobster.People say lobsters are a delecacy and you have to get through a shell to get to the meat.This book is a \\"classic\\" and you have dissect each and every sentence to get a general understanding.Avoid this book at all costs, if you have to read it in school then you are better off faking a concusion!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I find the old english wording too hard to understand and too hard to read...haven't got into it too far yet but it is taking me forever to get here"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Very disappointed!

I did enjoy the discussions that could arise from this book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This is a very interesting book. I started reading it in my 4th period English class. I think it is a good book because somehow it relates to what people do, when they feel superior to other people. I think you should read this book, because it is very interesting. Plus, it was written by the great Nathaniel Hawhthorne!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Some people immediately dismiss the worth of this book by criticizing its seemingly clich&eacute; plot, centered around adultery and the guilt which follows. I say, Hawthorne's novel is not revolutionary or amazing in its subject, setting, or even characters, but rather in the way in which it unfolds. The story delves remarkably into the souls of several individuals in a New England Puritan town, gradually and ephemerally casting beams of soft light on new aspects of everyones personalities and struggles. Each character is masterfully and magically revealed, and the tale strives for intimacy and understanding of each point of view in a complex circle of deceit and secrecy. I think everyone who appreciates detailed and beautiful analysis of character, sentiment, thought, and human nature will enjoy it, but may not be ideal for those seeking constant action."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Everyone needs to read this classic. An amazing look into the piousness of the early settlers. I really appreciated it a lot."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Yes, I enjoyed this book. The STORY was good...I am sure you have an idea about it so I won't waste time with a summary. The SETTING was great...Hawthorne brought 17th Century frontier Boston alive with his stunning descriptions. The CHARACTERS were ok...yes, only ok, because I never found myself loving or hating any of them, which to me is evidence that the author was successful with his creation. But...The SYMBOLISM is what makes this book, what makes it a classic!...This book is a brilliant essay on how important it is to abide by a conscience. One mishap can lead you down a path towards destruction. BUT aiding in that destruction were Christians who were more unforgiving then the heathen around them...The christian who reads this book should learn that forgiveness was the #1 thing Christ taught and expects from us! (i.e. He who is merciful shall obtain mercy). BUT what I learned most from this book was how important it is to understand Gods grace! God is not some powerful ogre waiting to punish but a friend waiting to forgive. If this frontier town only could have known this how different their experience would have been!However, I think this book was cheated because I read it right after the stunning 'Grapes of Wrath' and it simply could not compare, overall, and therefore can not receive the elite five star status! Still a must read if you have never...!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Any Hawthorne work, including this one, shows why the author remains one of the most celebrated in American literature. As to subject matter, kids are more receptive to the likes of &quot;The House of the Seven Gables.&quot; Perhaps adults would be too if they hadn't been forcefed &quot;The Scarlet Letter,&quot; complete with the Customs House filler, in high school. Lest the reader find this teacher cynical, note the five stars. (I also have a dog named Hawthorne and had another named Prynne.)"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter shows us the meaning of human nature.People know that utopias never work but no one tells us why the ideology doesn't work. In the Scarlet Letter, the books based its views about the general citizens of the town, who believe in perfection of the human kind through religion, the ideology of the citizens of Boston, presented as hypocrites of harsh judgment that believes that a jail and public scaffold inside the infrastructure of Boston is necessary for the utopia to thrive. However, when someone, like Hester Prynne, was found committed adultery inside the town Boston, everyone rushed judgment that she sinned and immediately punished her for her crimes against nature, as the townspeople call it. Hester's sins are small, compared to how the townspeople perceive her since they find out she has committed adultery and how the people who knew what happened, hid it from the townspeople. She did not hide from the humiliation, but she continue to co-exist with the people who knew what she had done and hate her for it and thrive in their environment with her daughter, Pearl who has no real father to her name.This alone shows how this town would never achieve the goals that the citizens wanted, being a perfect society, since the purpose of the puritans living in the town is to be free to practice their own religion. However, how could someone be free of practicing their own faith if the very nature of the human beings is being oppressed and then released out of anger towards someone else that is able to show what they believe in? The Scarlet Letter is proof that even if a person is oppressed, he or she could still improve his or her current situation and do what he or she wants without limits and still be true to his or herself in the meantime.Overall, this book is full of ironic outcomes, but that is what is good in a novel. Of course, there are a lot more to this book than what I mention here, like the symbolism that is present in most parts of the book and the historical significance of the early history of the Americas and Hawthorne's background, but that is not as important as finding the meaning of human nature in a town that is full of hope, as well as hypocrisy combined in the life of a utopian society."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I am an avid reader, specially of books in the English language. The movie &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; has been a favorite of mine, but reading other reviews of the novel (other editions) here in Amazon, prompted me to read it. People kept saying they were dissapointed with the movie and vice versa; people kept saying they could not deal with Hawthorne's 19th century language. But I could deal perfectly with the idiom, even though it's not my first language. Both the movie and the novel are excellent, although different."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Passion, greed, lust and denial are all the ingredients that make The Scarlet Letter a novel that caused much controversy back the days where women would not even think about having committed adultry, but Hester Prynne did. In the Scarlet Letter, passion justifies nothing, while its denial that justifies all. The reason why I rated The Scarlet Letter so highly was because it was very rare that a book so racy in its content would be written in the eighteen hundreds and still be good. The reason why this book was so intriguing was because there was a psychological approach to destruct; dealing with the controversy that surrounds The Scarlet Letter that I found really refreshing and more interesting because its always better to read about a person loosing their mind rather than mere violence such as fighting. I recommend this book to people who like to read about deception and mind games to destroy the guilty."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"In many ways, this book is like an R rated movie. Sure, high school students who are forced to read it &quot;understand&quot; it superficially, but the material hits home once you have matured and experienced some of the themes brought up in the novel. I liked it in high school, but as an adult, it resonates much more. I just reread the book after having not looked at it for over 10 years. The beginning does drag a bit, but the superb chapters near the end when Dimmsdale meets Hester in the forest after having not seen her or Pearl for 7 years make it all worthwhile. Even the writing becomes more vivid. During one great scene, Dimmsdale is allowed a moment of realization when he says to Hester than Chillingsworth's sin is much blacker than his own because it was done with malice. Dimmsdale realizes that his soul is not the blackest of all and to me, this gives him some level of redemption, at least on a personal level. The last 8 chapters or so are spellbinding as they bring up themes of sin, lust, and love against the horrifying behavior of the evil &quot;physician&quot; Chillingsworth. If you are forced to read this in high school, try to get past the sometimes opaque writing and give it a chance."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I would not inflict this story upon my worst enemy"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Hawthorne's dull prose really gets to you after a while. The book is filled with antiquated language, and is basically an account of a Puritan woman who suffers because of her adultery. I was forced to read this book for my English class, and it was a terrible waste of time. Hawthorne hits you in the face with run on sentences that take up the entire page. I do have one good thing to say about this book however, for all you insomniacs out there, read it! It induces sleep in minutes! ZzZzZzZzZzZz....."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Getting through this book was quite a task. The wording and the pace make it a bit hard to follow. However, once you read deep into the plot, the web of characters and their relationships draw you in. This book is set in Colonial New England in the 1600s. Hester Prynne, protagonist, has been condemned to wear a scarlet letter (...) to remind the public of her sin of adultery. Reverend Dimmesdale, a public hero, struggles with guilt and personal hypocrisy. Roger Chillingworth is seen as the antagonist, consumed with hatred and revenge. These three characters make up a very intriguing story line that touches on controversial issues such as sin, lust, adultery, and primal human nature. This book can be easily compared to Kate Chopin's, The Awakening. Both deal with the repression of women and one woman's struggle to rebel against society. Each character attempts to broaden the closed minded views of their time and set the bar for women in the future. Although it was a tough read, I would recommend this book for its ability to relate to common issues."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I stongly dislike this book. There is too much meaninglessness to it. I can read seven pages for something that can be stated in one paragraph...it's awful. Only Webster would be able to read this and not use a dictionary.

By the end I was screaming thanks to the forces of the universe. Not only is the book periphrastic and dull; it completely drains the reader's energy and sanity. One just cannot relate to the characters--so imitative and spurious; besides, the story line is EXHAUSTINGLY and OBVIOUSLY outdated!!! I hated Hester. I cannot comprehend the concept going through some individuals' minds when they call her one of the most moving characters in American literature. WHATEVER!!!!!! And Dimmesdale's character was despicable, absurd, and ordinary. If you've read about the tremendous psychological impact of the novel, you have been deceived! You won't find any psychological force.

I'm not a 'reader' type, so this book, for me, was awful.

In my opinion, it has been the hardest book that we have read this year. I am a big time daydreamer when I read, which is why I think it took me a long time to understand. If you can stay focused, go for it! It can be a really touching and interesting book, but if you daydream like me, get a few of your friends to read it, too. It may help you to understand it better.

The story engages and puts one in the time. It requires a modern reader to stretch, but the exercise rewards."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This book is one of the last masterpieces written as American literature moved from what we call &quot;Old English&quot; (use the much cliched Olde if you must) to &quot;New English.&quot; And trust me, it shows. Virtually every book ever written during this period, (essentially, before Twain's Huckleberry Finn), bears the same markings - incredibly lavish diction, complex structure and syntax, and all the elements that make for a generally hard to follow novel. If you elevate your reading to that next level, where you're seeing beyond the simple plot and percieving Hawthorne's masterful use of symbolism and metaphor, and are able to appreciate probably the last great novel written in before the literary revival of the late 1800s, then you'll consider this book a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Like so many reviewers before me, I first read this book in high school. And, like so many readers before, I was sorely disappointed. How could this book have amassed such a legendary status in the canon of American literature?? The pacing is dreadfully, consistently slow, the characters are unengaging, the description is tedious, etc. For those of you out there who would defend these tactics, let me say one thing: while a good author would know how to use these literary techniques (as Hawthorne obviously does), a GREAT author would know how to use these techniques in MODERATION. What Hawthorne spends page after mindless page describing in agonizing detail, could have been summarized in just a paragraph or two of direct, memorable, grabbing prose.For those who still believe that this book is just too sophisticated for all of those dumb high schoolers, let me offer another example. In addition to The Scarlett Letter, my high school English classes also required us to read some other classic works of the English language, and none of these other classics brought about nearly as negative a response as the reponse brought about by this book. I remember that my classmates and I were by and large much more interested in the tragic story of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark. The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Heart of Darkness, Great Expectations, The Lord of the Flies, The Grapes of Wrath and The Great Gatsby were much better reads than The Scalet Letter ever was. Were these lesser books, because they were more accessible and often faster paced than The Scarlet Letter? I think not.As for all those people out there who profess a deep love of the book: although I'm sure that some of you actually did thoroughly enjoy this book, I fear that there are those of you who subscribe to the notion that just because something is labeled a literary classic, it must be good, and if it seems boring or longwinded, that's only the &quot;genius&quot; of it. Please don't blindly fall into this trap. Judge the book for yourself and forget about whether or not you &quot;should&quot; like the book. There's a reason that this book is despised moreso than any of the other books I've previously mentioned..."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This is a book of many challenges.

Admittedly, the original Hawthorne version is far enough over my head to cause nose-bleeds, but this version is a one-sitting page-turner.The story line is relatively simple, but the narrative pops with the juicy stuff such as adultery and guilt, as one amazing woman faces the consequences of a passionate affair with a man whose name she holds guarded in her heart, beneath the scarlet letter \\"A\\" she is condemned to wear for the rest of her life.It's not hard to figure out where the shame lies, but the story brings out the pain and torment so vividly that it just doesn't matter whether you know whodunit or not.Definitely recommended for anyone with an interest in expanding their appreciation of classic literature without breaking a sweat.Amanda Richards, March 23, 2010"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I haven't had time to read this book, but I have reviewed it & it is the version I wanted."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Upon finishing The Scarlet Letter, I would have to say that I was met with mixed emotions. While I enjoyed the storyline and reading about the characters, the length of the novel irked me a little, particularly because Hawthorne tend to overelaborate certain minor aspects of the story that are rather trivial and frivolous to the overall plot.I really enjoyed the content of the book as a whole. Hester's experience of being socially isolated due to her having a child, Pearl, with someone other than her husband evoked a kind of sympathy matched with curiosity in me. Early on in the novel, I felt disgusted at the townspeople for treating her this way, but soon discovered that Hester's wearing of her sin and the story behind it made for a rather interesting drama. Hawthorne definitely knows how to keep the reader interested, because this book contains everything we like to see in good literature: scandal, romance, an illegitimate child, irony, and the good old allusions.However, as good as this novel might seem to be, everyone should beware that this book is excessively long and at times extremely boring. While you argue that \\"boring\\" contradicts the previous paragraph, let me justify myself in saying that while the storyline itself is brilliant, Hawthorne's writing style of being overly descriptive and sentimental ticked me off a little. Something that is written in 50 pages can easily be cut to ten, since those 50 pages are mostly fluff and fillers anyway.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves good literature, and also has the patience and dicipline to stick to it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Hawthorne's \\"Fanshawe\\" was respectable and well done. But in his \\"The Scarlet Letter,\\" Hawthorne takes his writing to darker and more intense levels. The story starts with Hester Prynne being mocked and scoffed at in public for her crime of adultery. Her affair has resulted in an illegitimate daughter Pearl. And her penalty of death is reduced to wearing an A. Interestingly, if we read \\"Dante's Inferno,\\" we know that adultery is virtually the LEAST punished sin in hell. Apparently none of the authorities read this. (\\"Dante's Inferno\\" was written about 400 years before the events of \\"The Scarlet Letter,\\" so the authorities could have been familiar with it.) Moving on, Reverend Dimmesdale (Pearl's unknown father) can not bring himself to confess, but he does clearly tell Hester she can name him if she chooses. She declines. It is interesting that Hawthorne keeps Pearl somewhat disturbed. (At one point, she rips flowers, throws them at Hester's A, and dances every time she hits it. Another time she throws rocks at birds.) In comes Roger. (Step aside Othello. You've been outsmarted, outstyled, and outclassed.) Hester is of course frightened that her husband Roger has found out about her affair. But Roger makes it clear that physical vengeance is beneath him. Interestingly, Roger wants revenge for himself, but to some extent he blames himself for what happened. Naturally, Roger wants to find out who Pearl's father is, but Hester declines. Though Roger makes it clear that Pearl's father has wronged both Roger and Hester. (Can we really deny this?) Roger is by far the most intelligent and captivating character in the story. Rather than wanting revenge for himself, he seems to want revenge for both himself AND Hester. It doesn't take the sharp Roger long to suspect that the now growing ill Dimmesdale is the father of Pearl. ButRoger is no Othello. He studies the situation as carefully as possible. And when he is certain, this is when his revenge kicks in. Dimmesdale despite his crime is still a human being. His remorse is great, and even when he tries to hint at how bad he is, his anxiety only increases. Why? THE PEOPLE IN THE CHURCH LOVE HIM ALL THE MORE FOR IT! He becomes even more of a hero for it. (Why not? Fake heroes think they're above everyone. A true hero admits he has faults. Modesty actually becomes a hero more.) And, this is where Roger's revenge kicks in. Dimmesdale is growing more ill, and Roger (no simpleton like Othello) actually uses his medical skills to keep Dimmesdale alive. Roger is smart enough to know that keeping Dimmesdale alive is hurting him more than any physical revenge could have. One fault Hester has is that she doesn't warn Dimmesdale about Roger. To be sure, she promised Roger she wouldn't reveal him as her husband, but she could have (without breaking her promise) warned Dimmesdale to avoid the dangerous Roger. It is interesting that in this story, there are no real heroes. Hester is too much of a back stage player; Pearl is too disturbed; Dimmesdale helps Hester keep Pearl from the authorities who want to take her away, but at best he arguably triumphs in the midst of his fault; and even my favorite character Roger becomes too evil to be classified as the hero. It would seem even non physical revenge can leave one psychologically warped. Moving on, Hester and Dimmesdale feel that escaping to Europe is their only chance to escape Roger. But Roger (unlike Othello) is not so easily duped or defeated. The end explodes into a dark and frightening climax. Hawthorne cleverly avoids a happy cliche romance ending, but at the same time frees Dimmesdale from Roger's evergrowing hate and fury. Roger sounds almost demonic when he says: \\"Thou hast escaped me.\\" But Hawthorne reminds us that Roger was a human being. He interestingly leaves his wealth to Pearl. Overall, Hawthorne did a great job of showing his fierce edge in this book. We have rich complex characters who do NOT fall into typical patterns. He also reminds us that people are not all good or evil. They have some of each. Overall, Hawthorne's writing here is arguably very close to Charles Dickens."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"My rating is only for the electronic formatting of this book. I really feel like I don't have any right to complain since the book was free but -you get what you pay for.The book starts with an introduction to the story which goes on for 18% of the book file. The actual text of the book doesn't start until location 604-10. Unfortunately the only way to find this is to page through from the beginning. It would have been nice to have a table of contents or at least a bookmaark for the start of the actual book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This slim book is like a three-course meal, where the appetizer is yak anus tartare, the entree is three-day-old caviar, and dessert is a Three Musketeers bar. That is to say, the first part, the Customs House prelude, is so floridly antiquated and negligible, that all but the sternest high-schoolers who've never had a bar or bat mitzvah will give up and read the Wikipedia plot summary for Monday's quiz. However, once past that interminable overture, the story actually picks up a bit, though it never really takes flight, and the ending is...pat. Hawthorne's idea of the scarlet letter is much more ingenious than his execution: the seed never sprouts as high as it should."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Basically Nathaniel Hawthorne's \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" centers around the heroine Hester Prynne and her adulterous affair. She refuses to reveal the name of her lover, choosing to protect the identity of their love child's father. However Hester's husband, Chillingworth, returns from overseas and hears of his wife's sins. He makes it his life's purpose to discover and destroy Hester's unnamed lover. In a twisted love triangle,Hawthorne explores how each of the characters deal with the sins they have committed and its' effect on their lives.Though I know \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is an American classic, one of the greatest novels written by an American writer, it didn't strike me as all that great. The plot is good. There were moments in the story where the book does really live but to its reputation, but there were too few. The story just drags on. If you list out what really happens in the story, the meaningful points, there really aren't that many. But somehow Hawthorne is able to stretch that into 256 pages of really hard reading. It's not hard in the sense that the vocabulary, sentence structure and what not is hard to read, but it's hard to read in the sense of getting through the story. It just wasn't enjoyable. I kept dozing off in the middle of the story, lost in all the comma splices and semicolons.Even so, at the end, despite all the boredom, Hawthorne was still able to pass on his message through Hester Prynne. I began to admire Hester's audacious courage in dealing with her situation, especially during the circumstances she lived in. She is someone I would like to be...the post-committing-adultery part. As a woman she was already at a disadvantage, a second-class citizen in her male-dominated world, furthermore as a moral sinner in the uptight Puritan society sunk her social status to the bottom of the pyramid. But instead of hiding from society, afraid to give her A the light of day, Hester glams up the A, sporting it like a badge and not the mark of sin the officials had intended. She stands her ground, staying in town to live out her punishment . With her own good deeds, the townspeople perceive her A to represent her as an able person, forgetting it once branded her as an adulterer. Hawthorne immortalizes Hester in American literature not as the living sermon for all congregations to avoid, but as a living model of endurance and grace for the rest of men to aspire to."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The book came in in great condition- brand new.

I paid for \\"used\\" books, but the books arrived in brand new condition."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Where to start? No, really, I mean, think about it. First of all, the book is packed with, like, a walnut of a story surrounded by a husk of un-understandibilityness (pardon the mixed metaphor). Like theres this rose at the beginnins, but it doesn't really mean a rose. Oh no, so much more. Like it represents flowers as a whole--red, blue, bulb planted and seed--not just roses. The words are really big--like even the word scarlet, I had to look that up in my Websters New Dictionary for ages 6 and up. For those of you with the same problem, it means &quot;a bright red color.&quot; Who new red had another name-the book is chock full of educational goodies like that. Anyway, the plot: Demi Moore has this baby, but the baby's shunned by the villagers. He never says why though but my class thinks its because Demi had an affair and the townspeople are like repressed pilgrims who like just don't get that its cool to do things like that. Things get really freaky though when the reverend Dimsdale starts whipping himself! Yeah, he goes outside and sees this shooting star and makes a wish and then whips himself cuz he knows who the kids dad is--its him!!! Anyway, Demi keeps having trouble but at the end the pilgrims move to vermont and everything turns out all right, and the book closes with this cool ring thing--but instead of a rose symbolizing beginning, it says &quot;the end&quot; symbolizing the end. Its deep. Anyway, I recommend this book to everyone and his other book--the house of seven gables--I love gables, their dappled fur, the way the sun shines off their wet, glistening hides, their speed.

The teens of today do not want to read about the ancient customs of puritan society. If it had been about the scandalous affairs of Hester and Rev. Dimmsdale it would still be a best seller. I think this book should be only read voluntarily. If you are thinking of reading it you may need to reconsider."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I remember reading this novel back when I was in high school, and again recently when there was another film version of it done. It really is a classic tale, set in early America. However, the moral of the tale is rather timeless -- it deals with sexual morality, but more importantly it deals with honesty and corruption in society, and how we can really harm ourselves by trying to live up to what society wants from us.Hester Prynne is the main character. In a Puritan community, she breaks her marriage vows by having an affair, with the new preacher no less, Reverend Dimmsdale. This affair results in a pregnancy, something that is impossible to hide in the small community. Reverend Dimmsdale becomes both her lover and her chief accuser, given the status he has in the village. The entanglements that Dimmsdale and Prynne have with each other, in public and out, make for fascinating reading, and shows that people remain the same essentially no matter how technology and history may change.The title, the scarlet letter, refers to the big red \\"A\\" Hester Prynne is required to wear, identifying her as an adulteress. Interesting, of course is that while the whole community is full of sinners, because Puritan religion believes this of all people, they single her out. This also shows times don't change, because even today sexual \\"sins\\" are often considered worse than far more bloody or violent ones.This is a well written book, not really easy but not really difficult to read, and a fascinating look at both early America and how people interact."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Hawthorne was a complex writer that used big words --oh did he use them often-- to get his message across. He uses symbolism a whole lot. He can write 5 pages about one object or thing. If you're looking for something with fancy language this is THE book to read. If you're looking for a good story this is also a good book to read.\\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is a literary masterpiece that takes place in the Puritan community of 1600's Boston. The title character Hester Prynne commits the ultimate sin of adultery and is punished. Her punishment is fact that she has to wear a big red letter \\"A\\" on her chest for the rest of her life. So that when anyone asks her, \\"Oh... what's that on your chest?\\" She will have to answer. \\"It is proof that I am a lower being and don't deserve the respect of God or anyone for that matter. Please, kill me where I stand!\\"This is a great book that deals with human emotions superbly. The language is beautiful and full of life. The only reason I give this book 4 stars is that some of the modern readers will find the big words a little confusing. This surely is not a high school book even though they read it in high school. You need to be a good reader to appreciate it fully. If you read one page and find it horrid and shrug it off when you have to read it for class, you will never enjoy this great book. Probably because you will never pick it up again and try to read it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I usually like the classics. But when I read this book and a number of the author's short stories I couldn't escape the conclusion that Nathaniel Hawthorne wasn't a great writer. He doesn't belong among the immortals of literature. His short stories are predictable. After reading Hawthorne I read some Herman Melville and found him to be far better. The one thing in Scarlet Letter's favor is that it is politically correct. It's satisfying that the intolerant religious fanatics are the bad guys. The villain of the story is respected Roger Chillingworth, and the heroine is his wife Hester Prynne, adulteress. Would you consider it adultery if the husband was missing for years and assumed dead, as is the case here? It's not enjoyable to read about religious intolerance. The book gets quite dopy when something magical happens to Hester's boyfriend at the end, something right out of The Exorcist, and typical of Hawthorne's silly writing. It gets even dopier when Hester deserts her happy family to return to misery. Hawthorne has a thing for magical events and foolish endings."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I am a 48 year old college student reading The Scarlet Letter for the first time. In fact, I have never read any of Nathaniel Hawthorne's works before--doesn't say much for my high school. Hawthorne's use of imagery and double meanings captivated me. ANALYSE ANYTHING--EVERYTHING HAS ANOTHER MEANING. I couldn't wait to read the next page and get to class to discuss it. When I read the passages again, I found more hidden meanings. I've gone on to read more of his works since and would now like to find out more about his family heritage. His family was involved in the Salem witch trials and the persecution of the Quakers during the 17th century. It has been suggested that this has influenced in his writings about guilt, shame, sin, &amp; alienation.I loved his allegorical treatment of the emotional ramifications brought on by social, family, and religious situations. What was chillingworth's sin anyway? Who cheated on who? I would say that the &quot;goody-two shoe&quot; minister, Arthur Dimmesdale, was the real villain. He never confessed to save Hester and Pearl until his dying day; he had nothing to personally gain by keeping his secret.I &quot;feel&quot; for all the high school kids that do not appreciate or understand Hawthorne's stories. I suggest that you go to a quiet place, without interruptions--take the phone off the hook, and read. It will take time to get going; a little research would help. Coming to this site is a start.

The Scarlet Letter, unfortunately, is one of those classics that, for me, knowing the gist of it is more worthwhile than actually reading it.The story, as most American high school students know, is set in 1640's New England, and features Hester Prynne, a woman who is convicted of adultery and made to wear a scarlet \\"A\\" as a badge of shame.Unfortunately, the 250 page book could really have been about fifty pages and done the job. Hawthorne isn't just wordy, he's wordy while thinking about being wordy about wordiness, then he's wordy that he might not have been wordy enough. The first 50 pages, in fact, isn't even about Hester or the 17th century - it's an \\"introductory sketch\\" that amounts to a framing narrative of \\"I found these old notes in a box at work and wrote this story.\\" So, yeah, if you do read the book after reading this review, at least do yourself a favor and skip \\"The Customs House.\\" Trust me.Even once you get to Hester, the narrative, such as it is, just crawls. Or, rather, it ponders if it should advance, and so, wither, and if it should advance - if that be what God has ordained - by what means of Earthly locomotion it might utilize, should that be the course of events necessitated by the demands of the story, and, perchance, how many times the word \\"bosom\\" should be employed, and in what capacity.Again, I'm not afraid of long, 19th century prose. I love Dracula and Frankenstein, after all. But at no point did I really feel like Hawthorne had gotten me into the story. Other than an oppressive grayness and the sparking scarlet \\"A\\", there's no strong sense of setting or atmosphere. Worse, I never really felt like I had any idea what Hester was feeling or experiencing. In fact, more time is spent on her secret lover and his torment, but even that seems shallow.I listened to the audio book read by Dick Hill. Hill wasn't horrible, but he didn't really do anything to bring the text to life, either. I don't think a better reader would have made that big a difference, but Hill didn't really bring much to the production himself.I just can't recommend The Scarlet Letter, even for the sake of being able to say you've read a classic. If you want to read a 19th century classic, I recommend something by one of the above authors. Anything, really, before The Scarlet Letter. If you want a modern classic that's actually meaningfully about female sexuality and woman's place in society, read Margaret Atwood's fantastic The Handmaid's Tale."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter is an American tourist trying to ask one of the locals for directions; it speaks loud and slow, making gigantic explanatory hand gestures and nodding enthusiastically when it thinks you're catching on. What it doesn't seem to notice is that you speak English, you understand exactly what it's saying, and the hotel is just down the street. What could have been a meaningful, succinct five-second exchange has instead become an annoyingly elaborate, tediously awkward, and unnecessarily long social ritual. What could have been a poignantly rendered meditation on sin, redemption, and society winds up choking on its own ambitions. Indeed, had Hawthorne approached this novel with some sense of subtlety, allowing his narrative to unfold gracefully and naturally, ensuring that his characters and plot are compelling, allowing his themes to intertwine gently with the story itself, The Scarlet Letter would probably have struck me as the masterpiece that everybody else seems to think it is. But no; Hawthorne has a Grand Statement to make, and he'll be damned if anybody misses out on even a fraction of it! He loads up on symbolism, ensuring that every object that his characters might encounter is a metaphor for something or other. Nothing wrong with symbolism, of course, but Hawthorne uses it like a fire hose in a burning orphanage. He beats readers into the ground with the stuff, making painstaking effort to ensure that we don't miss a second of figurative goodness. He even goes so far as to explain what some of his metaphors represent. A bit like a magician explaining how he does his tricks, if you ask me.All of which occurs at the expense of the usual indicators of literary merit. Hawthorne structures his novel like the most didactic of parables, glossing over plot, characterization, dynamics, tension, and emotional resonance while beating readers to death with the moral. The story itself could be compelling, but it's a missed opportunity: Hawthorne describes the actual events in the novel as if he's writing a general summary of something he heard elsewhere. The prose is distant, ponderous, and dry, without a sense of sympathy or suspense. Hawthorne doesn't give a damn about his characters, doesn't even want to craft a compelling narrative. He's too busy Writing A Great Novel to write a great novel. As a result, the novel comes off as hollow, pretentious, and condescending, not to mention painfully boring.It certainly did have potential, though; the three main characters all have seeds of greatness in them, while the story itself is, Hawthorne's stumbling prose notwithstanding, a compelling one, and the author's thoughts on sin and redemption really are pretty interesting. Call it a good idea ruined by poor execution, then."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I'll admit right up front that I am stupid. I would rather enjoy a book instead of try to find my way through the maze of confusing, endless prose that Hawthorne uses. I found myself empathizing more with Chillingworth than Dimmesdale. A book should NOT have to be dissected and disscussed to be understood!!! It should clearly portray its thematic structure without having to resort to a smokescreen of vague symbols and the word &quot;Classic&quot; stamped all over it to force people to appreciate it. Yes, it was heavily thematic and full of symbolism; and it was &quot;meaty&quot; (whatever that is), &quot;deep&quot;, and &quot;powerful&quot;; but it was dry, slow, and boring. Even someone as myself, who generally enjoys the classics, will fall asleep (as I did everytime I tried to read this book). Do NOT try to speed-read this. This book has no place in a high-school English course; it needs a span of several years to muddle and plod thru, and then try to unravle."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter.Good story, but long-winded. I found the book difficult to read as the plot was tediously developed in my opinion. The long introduction did not excite me."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I am an English teacher and getting through the book was tough. Only Nathaniel Hawthorne can make sex sound boring."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Of all my orders from Amazon, I can honestly say this was the best. This book is a Collector's Edition from Easton Press. The Scarlet Letter (1850) is a great American classic and I am very satisfied with the product. The book was exactly as described, beautiful, and brand new!The seller was extremely cooperative and mailed the book immediately. Expedited shipping was great and quicker than described! The book was packaged very well and protected from any possible damage from the USPS. 10 stars."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne's prose in \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is slightly complex at first but his description of Boston and of the people during the Puritan era is vivid and strong. I disagree with an earlier reviewer that the book was boring. The description of the characters and of the situations they were undergoing was helpful. It made the story much stronger. The last three or four chapters were surprisingly suspenseful. It is a fantastic read.Moreover, \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is a classic example of why social oppression is such a terrible thing. Thanks to the oppression of those times a child grew up without her father and a man died without ever having a real relationship with his daughter. One can't help but to think about the type of oppression (ie. sexual) that goes on today. This novel is a stark reminder of why oppression of any kind is really not worth it. When oppression exists in society, good people are always bound to suffer and all because of rigid, inhumane, socially conservative beliefs. Within its own context (Puritan era), the novel delves into this topic in a very powerful way. I highly recommend it because its subject matter still applies today."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Since the 1970s I have probably read this book at least three times. It is a powerful book about sin and redemption, guilt and pardon, and revenged and forgiveness. I will let other reviewers deal with the great literary themes presented within this novel, but for this review, I want to look at Rev. Arthur Dimmesdale, Hester's lover and the father of Pearl.As an evangelical pastor, the character of Dimmesdale has always intrigued me. I can understand how godly men fail. I can understand how godly men can fall into sexual sin. Just because a man is called of God does not mean that he cannot fall for temptation, especially sexual temptation, became sexual temptation is common to all men. A quick survey of biblical heros makes this point clear. For instance, David, who is described as a man after God's own heart, certainly did not behave himself sexually. Aside from his adulterous affair with Bathsheba and the murder of her husband, David also, in addition to taking many wives, took to himself concubines for his sexual pleasure. One can argue all he wants about the cultural acceptability of such practices, but the fact remains that most Hebrew contemporaries of David did not take concubines, and although the Law of Moses does not directly address the concubine issue, the plan of God clearly states that God desires one man married to one woman for one life time.Back to Rev. Dimmesdale. Ok, the guy made a mistake. Two lonely young people fell in love and in the passion of the movement conceived a child. Sin happens. Even the godliest man can fail. The problem is not that he failed, but that Dimmesdale proved to be such a wimp about his failing. He allowed Hester (who was a better man than Dimmesdale) to bear the shame alone while neglecting his responsibility to his daughter Peal. Lets face it; this guy was a wimp, not a man. Why did he not accept responsibility for his actions and take care of Hester and Pearl? Instead, he sets on a course of self-destructive behavior that, in the end, leads to his death and abandonment of any responsibility to those whom he loved.Dimmesdale, get a life. Be a man. Quit whining and accept responsibility for your behavior- that is what a truly godly man does. Hester was a better man than Arthur any day."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"After reading &quot;The Scarlet Letter,&quot; I really wondered how such a strong woman was able to go through this kind of hardship and still be strong in her heart. Nathaniel Hawthorne is one of the best authors in all of literature, but he can really be one of the hardest authors to read. Once you pick up &quot;Scarlet Letter,&quot; do not turn away from his ample vocabulary. He is a really good writer and he knows what the reader wants to read about. Especially when he takes a woman and makes her the strongest of all the characters. I love his use of symbols throughout the novel, especially Pearl. She is one of the most captivating characters to read about. It is thought-provoking to sit and read about Puritan times and how things took place. I recommend this to anyone who not only has the time to read it, but also to those who enjoy a good story of what true love is all about."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Another one of those texts that we hated in high school, one that was almost literally shoved down our throats. Then, it was a dry, dull tale of a Puritan woman who had a penchant for a minister's black veil.Now, though, a few years later, it is clear that Hawthorne's seminal novel is more than just a tragic love story. It is yet another \\"defining\\" piece of literature, this time centering on Puritanism and its eventual decline, a decline clearly evidenced when the women first see Hester leave her jail cell, Pearl clutched close to her chest. The older women condemn her, but the youngest of them seems indifferent, an air of what could be understanding about her.Hawthorne's use of metaphor, symoblism, and the intriguing characterization of Hester, Chillingworth, and Dimmesdale as well as Pearl--who herself is a symbol of change and hope--serve to turn the mundane plot and two-hundred years of dust into an excellent work of art.We know who Pearl's father is, and the ultimate moment in the novel is not when Dimmesdale exposes his breast and reveals his own scarlet letter; it instead occurs during the juxtaposition of night and day, of Dimmesdale's refusal to admit his guilt, of Chillingworth's insidious insertion into Dimmesdale's trust.\\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is not the best novel in existence, but it is worth the price of admission, and its overtones have an impact even today, addressing many social issues and resolving them in ways that echo biases and solutions of today."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I chose to read this book because of its status as a classic in American literature. I chose to continue it because I looked with sympathy, horror, and amazement at the protagonist, the priest, the physician, and the illegitimate child. There were moments when I was downright afraid of the child, Pearl, and convinved she must be demonic. I regarded Roger Chillingworth, the antagonist, as a generally benign, justice-seeking man. The protagonist, in light of her background, appeared to have little to defend herself with.But as the book progressed, it became apparent that Hawthorne had painted the portraits of characters more human than many of the people I know! Did Hestor Prynne utter words of (gasp!) sexual liberation? Or was that just my hindsight vision? Could Mr. Dimmesdale really be such a coward? Or was he truly a benevolent, if imperfect, man?In truth, regardless of what anyone else sees in The Scarlet Letter, I found a compelling story that encoruaged me to revaluate certain beliefs, and to enshrine others. No wonder it's a classic!I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This story is a moving representation of the dissonance that can be found between the human soul and society. Hester Prynne's suffering is painful because the reader understands that though she feels the sin of her actions, it is society that has condemned her. She must forfeit her freedom to walk as an equal citizen of Boston, never allowed to forget the silent agony haunting her every moment.It is not only Hester who is affected by social expectations and custom; it is eventually revealed to the reader that Hester's crime affects those who surround her, which tells us how much of an impact a individual's actions can have on another.Hawthorne's novel displays this fallen, detached member of Puritan society, but counters it with the revolutionist, the demon, the wild rose of Puritan lifestyle--perhaps hinting at the author's dislike for Puritan attitudes. Hawthorne reiterates these two devices: depicting his personal opinion through the actions of the characters and creating characters that refract each other.This is an amazing part of American literature, reflecting on human behavior and commenting on aspects of American history. How do people today act and react to each other, dominated by our culture's expectations? How are we self-serving or self-deprecating? A tip to readers: &quot;The Custom House&quot; (the book's preface) is dense stuff, quite possible of cultivating a strong dislike for Hawthorne as a writer, so I recommend saving it for last or skipping it completely.&quot;It is remarkable that persons who speculate the most boldly often conform with the most perfect quietude to the external regulations of society. The thought suffices them without investing itself in the flesh and blood of action.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I never liked The Scarlet Letter, although I have read it many times. I never liked &quot;The Custom House.&quot; The chapter never ends! It just goes on and on. I fell asleep many times while Hawthorne described his job duties.The thing that sticks in my mind after all these readings and re-readings is the fact that Hawthorne finds the manuscript wrapped up on a shelf. Hawthorne finds &quot;The Scarlet Letter.&quot;Other authors have found the manuscripts of the book they have their name on. The author of the Arabian Nights finds the manuscript of the &quot;Arabian Nights.&quot;The blind Argentine poet Jorge Borges finds many manuscripts hidden in the library which he writes about.There must be other books where the author claims he found the manuscript on a dusty shelf.Frankly, I like the &quot;Arabian Night.&quot; I like Borges.I just wish that Hawthorne had left the manuscript of &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; on the shelf where he found it. I know how you feel if you are reading it for the first time. It doesn't taste any better as you get older."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I can't remember being so conflicted about a novel in a long time. On one hand, I admire the brilliant analysis of Puritanical guilt that pervades the lives of Hester Prynne and the Reverend Dimmesdale. On the other, Hawthorne's writing often left me more irritated than I have been in a long time. \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" seems to me both a masterpiece and a crude dime novel at the same time.I don't question that Hawthorne's exposure of the moral dilemnas and guilt man faces is indeed well done. Every page is filled with the agony of the main characters. At the novel's best, \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is spellbinding, simultaneously repulsing the reader and luring him/her onward.However, the novel suffers from several problems, not least the clumsiness of Hawthorne's prose. His sentences are needlessly complicated and repetitive. Unlike a Henry James, for instance, whose sentences are densely constructed, Hawthorne could have easily sliced the length down with no loss of meaning. The writing here is weak.Even more irritating is the lack of subtlety in the novel's symbolism. The symbols Hawthorne creates could be fascinating. However, when they're spelled out in blatant, crude detail, they lose their power. Hawthorne fails to show us his symbolic meaning, instead settling on telling us instead.So ... the novel is a worthwhile read, but it's a far cry short of what it could have been."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"So sue me ... I just don't like Nathanial Hawthorne. I think the plot is brilliant, but I find his method of telling the story annoying. I'm afraid this isn't an assertion I can back up with a lot of concrete examples, it's just that his writing gives me a vague feeling of malaise. I find this true of his short stories as well, so I never bothered with the other novels. But you'll have to read The Scarlet Letter for school anyway, so borrow it from the library."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Thank you, Erika Vause, for your positive review! I absolutely love this book! I had heard of this novel, but never considered reading it because the plot simply did not interest me. Then we read it in our academic English class (10th graders) and I was absolutely astonished!! Not only by the magnificence of the book--its themes of guilt and redemption are powerful and heart wrenching--but by the ignorance of some of my peers. It was obvious that their dislike sprung from the fact that they did not understand it! Please, please--read this book! You will not be sorry! I promise."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"After reading this classic it makes you wonder what skeletons are worth bringing out of the closet in order to clear space. The hypocritical situation that occurs in this book would never happen in the present time would it? Oh wait it does. Any political or highly esteemed official, athlete, or movie star can do what they want today just as easy as they could back then. If not even more so. They feel themselves invincible and untouchable by the consequences of inappropriate decisions. However, just like the priest, those individuals that try to fool us that they are who they are not will awake one morning to have all their sins broadcast to the world."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter, for me was just a little boring. Sometimes the description was just too long and I just started to lose interest in it. Also sometimes it got confusing as to what the relationships the characters had to each other. I would only reccomend this book to other people who liked reading lots of description, a little dialouge, and a repetitive storyline."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I'm a 13 year old kid and I just finished reading this book for an English class I am taking. Although it was a very interesting and provkitive novel. I did not like it very much. I think it maybe that I'm still too young to throughly understand this piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne, in writing The Scarlet Letter, took that which was considered so very taboo in the society and placed it in the household. He took a simple woman trying to escape her past, and a lonely man, who was also a preacher, and made them the models for the \\"it could happen to anyone\\" story.Many may say that Hawthorne's writing is full of glitches, is slow, and perhaps too ornate and verbose at times - but I disagree. In my opinion, he was an author who employed almost every literary technique, and used it well. The first chapter is probably the most difficult to get through, since it seems so detached from the rest of the book, but for those who are looking closely, it is full of foreshadowing elements and in reproducing the structure of the society in which the story is about to take place - Hawthorne is forewarning us of the limitations of said society, of how these rituals will come to be bane of Hester Prynne's existence, as the story unfolds.The story begins with Hester's public shaming,and her being made to wear a 'Scarlet letter' upon her bosom as a sign of her adulterous ways. Amongst the crowd, watching, is her husband Dr. Prynne, who now goes by the name of Roger Chillingworth. The plot is simple, Hester Prynne comes to live in a village near Boston, and there, she finds herself inexplicably for the town preacher. The town preacher, Reverend Dimmesdale, also falls in love with Hester. The husband, who was to follow Hester, a cruel and conniving man, is captured and considered dead which further fuels the level of intimacy between the Reverend and Hester. The result is an illegitimate child - although, Hester continually refuses to name the father of the child, for fear of the persecution that will result from this confession of her lover, the Reverend. While Hester remains ostracized from the society, her daughter and her both treated like the Plague, the Reverend wastes away with the guilt that he allowed Hester to take the entirety of the blame. He pines away for his love, and for his child, and becomes weak and disturbed. This only serves to add to the suspicions of Dr.Chillingworth, who is seeking to exact revenge on the man who had left his wife astray, and when he confirms his suspicions serves to fuel the Reverends self-hatred. The relationship between Hester and Dimmesdale is ever tender, but the relationship between Dimmesdale and his daughter Pearl is, although seemingly calm, tense and tortuous.Hawthorne paints his characters with such intensity, Hester's love and her patience, Pearl's innocence, Dimmesdale's self-loathing and guilt, and Chillingworth's jealousy and anger - and above all, the townsfolk's constant judgments. The novel is a classic, written in the way of a classic, full of eloquent prose, rich commentary and extremely descriptive. It is a slow and meticulous read, but also a very satisfying one. If you can get past the slow pace, and the alliterations and allegory, you will find yourself reading of a beautiful tale about love, passion, guilt, redemption...and above all, faith."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This book is a masterpiece of not only American literature, but of world literature. Reading this book was the experience that showed me what good literature is. This is easily in my top three along with Fahrenheit 451 and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"As an English teacher, I always look forward to the point in the school year when my students ask me to name my favorite book. Every year, I see their puzzled expressions when I choose The Scarlet Letter. Perhaps Hawthorne's masterpiece is out of place in our fast-paced world, our ridiculously simplistic culture where a book has no value unless Will Smith can play the hero in the movie version. If these criticisms of the novel are true, the fault lies with us, not with Hawthorne.The Scarlet Letter is a story of complexities - the complexity of love, the complexity of sin, and the struggle to find who you are in a society that demands conformity. How could anyone not identify with Hester, a woman whose only crime is in not covering up her mistakes as well as everyone around her does? How could anyone not sympathize with Dimmesdale, a man trapped between who he is in private and the mask he wears when he steps outside his door?That anyone can criticize the book as too wordy is beyond me. Saying The Scarlet Letter is terrible because there isn't enough action is like sayingTransformersis a better movie thanCasablanca. The details in the novel are there for a reason. Hawthorne is creating a world, a Garden of Eden, where the choices facing his characters are not as simple as the one facing Eve, though the effects are just as devastating.As a reader, if all you look for in a novel is \\"who did what,\\" then try the latest slop on the bestseller list. The characters will all fall into neat categories, there will be some painfully obvious moral, and best of all, you won't have to think. But if you want to read a story that forces you to define who you are and what you believe, try classics like The Scarlet Letter. Trust me, you'll find these books a more rewarding experience."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I believe that this is a fantastic book for those who have more distinguished tastes. As for others, it is a slow read with challenging vocabulary."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I completely agree with most HS students that this book should be optional reading for them because HS teachers should very well know that there are many different minds that need very different kinds of reading material and exposure to variety is not always a good thing that's why you end up having reviews of books like this by some HS students who puke on it rather then have savored it like I did. My reasons for really loving this book is because of the historical/puritan life and manners I like to read about, I love human struggle and the need to understand inner feelings of character, and I like knowing about how communities deal with religious matters. Can you blame me for being such a sentimental person? Yes, the book is written at the 5th grade level, and some people still do read at that level so this may be a reason why it's survived for such a long time. In any case, don't have it on your book shelf if it's not your cup of tea; with me, it will always be a treasure."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"First and foremost, this book felt long and drawn-out. The convoluted prose that Hawthorne uses as with his excessively long sentences help add little relief when one is lost in the mist of a page long paragraph. Written in the middle 1800s, The Scarlet Letter contains sentence structure and phrasing typical of that time, meaning there are many instances that felt unnatural or forced.The beginning of this book is anything but enjoyable. Not only was the first chapter a tedious read but it contained no relevance to the rest of the book. It is just hard to continue reading a book that begins with such a sour taste, in fact most reader would mistaken the entire book to be of the same low quality as the first chapter. Another major low point for the story is the long complicated description that Hawthorne seems to love. Even a description about a barren jail door could constitute an entire chapter. Ordinarily, details allow the reader a vivid image of the scene, but excessive details just slow down and decrease the enjoyment of the novel. It is said that Hawthorne's writing requires a great deal of concentration, effort, and strength to read and understand, and that is true.However, even through all the fog and haze that Hawthorne manages to include in his book, the overall plot of the novel is decent. It is by no means gripping but it is passable. There are moments where the reader will feel attached to the characters but those moments are few and far. For the most part, many of the characters feel static, almost as if their entire actions are scripted. It is almost as if one were watching a play conducted entirely in monotone. The reader cannot feel the outbursts of emotions, neither crescendos nor decrescendos of joy or sadness from the characters. With his convoluted, or some would say overly sophisticated style, the average reader will have a hard time connecting with the characters and in turn, will feel detached about the novel. The meaning of this novel may be deep and worthwhile to decipher, but for the average reader, this classic will provide nothing more than headaches and anguish."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter gives an excellent portrayal of not only the inherent evil of mankind but also the fatal consequences of revenge and the pains of a guilty conscience. The emotional and psychological aspects of the story provide the depth of this novel and are characteristic of Hawthorne's writing style. In addition to the riveting storyline, Hawthorne includes the psychological thoughts and reasoning behind each character, making the characters seem more realistic and allowing the reader to relate to the characters. Although the reader may not have experienced the exact events, the emotions of dread and fear, of guilt and shame, are familiar to the reader as Hawthorne expresses each emotion in his characters. When Hester argues with Governor Bellingham to allow her to keep her daughter, the emotions and thoughts that Hawthorne attaches to Hester clearly portray the mother's protection of her daughter, a natural characteristic that readers can understand even if they have never experienced the same situation. The psychological aspects of the story go beyond the plot, delving into the heart of each character. The emotions expressed in the novel allow the reader to clearly understand what the characters are going through.Hawthorne's depiction of the relationship between Pearl and her mother Hester Prynne creates a vivid description of the sufferings of a guilty conscience. Hester, burdened with the guilt of committing the sin of adultery, is forced to wear her sin, presenting herself to the world as an adulteress. The scarlet letter burns her constantly, secluding her from the rest of society. In addition to this suffering, Hester must live with her child Pearl, who continually reminds poor Hester of her sin. It is as if her sin has materialized into a child, a living memory of the guilt Hester must carry. By setting numerous scenes and conversations between Hester and her child, Hawthorne's unique style of writing clearly presents the great sufferings of a guilty conscience.Although Hawthorne's sentences may seem to drone on forever, the novel as a whole is filled with vivid images and descriptions that imprint themselves into the reader's mind. The Scarlet Letter is recommended for those who enjoy the blend of psychological and emotional aspects of a novel that provide a powerful connection between reader and character."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I am an avid reader. I have read many so called \\"classics\\". This book is just plain boring! Yawn.... I really tried to get into it. I couldn't finish it. I just kept falling asleep. This book contains some seriously long sentences. Some readers have said to just skip the first chapter or so. I couldn't do that. It just seems wrong. If you are going to read a book you should try and read it all. I am sorry to say \\"I have not read the Scarlet Letter.\\" Sorry Hawthorne.... I really, really tried."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"It was fun reading after not reading for 50 years, but Hawthorne certainly could have told the story without so much embellishment! It was interesting to compare the social mores of that time and the tremendous changes that have occurred since then."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I loved this book when I was about twelve. It was so tragic and really held me. However, on my reread I found I didn't like the characters as much. I guess I lost a believe that social pressure could make people hide and internalize something as common as a child born out of wedlock. So this book is still a good read, but I think in my more mature adult self I just didn't care for the plot as much."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Though it is a love story, love takes second place to puritan morality. Another name for this novel could have been \\"Sin and Punishment\\". The long-suffering Hester Prynne, an apparent spinster, refuses to tell the name of the man who impregnated her, though she is punished by some time in the stocks and being forced to wear forever the scarlet letter pinned to her clothes. Meanwhile, her husband, a medical scholar, who had sent her on to the New World ahead of him, turns up on the day of her public humiliation, having met with shipwreck and captivity among the Indians. He, consumed with anger, vows a revenge on her \`defiler', discovers the man, and wreaks psychological trauma on him. Hester, living a humble life alone with her lively daughter Pearl, shunned by all, slowly redeems herself by good works. The lovers come together once again, years later. The end is befitting such a story.The self-righteousness and sanctimoniousness of the Boston Puritans is well-described. The tale is one of tragedy, suffering and partial redemption rather than of romantic love. Human emotions, universal to all times and places, appear, but was there ever a society less receptive of love ? The characters are indeed well-developed, both major and minor, as befits a classical novel.THE SCARLET LETTER was a landmark in American literature and as such is an important work, but for today's readers it may not be a popular choice. First, its theme and plot line are far from today's concerns. Second, the language, especially in the dialogue, is archaic. Thus, I pray you think twice before launching your ship upon the Seas of this novel forthwith, for verily thou treadest upon difficult speech and mayest come to the end of thy tether. Even though thou wilt give this tome a full five stars, I do not, for by my troth, three must suffice."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Downloaded to read, got started then wasn't too interested in the book, had read it in school years before thought i'd reread it but never finsihed."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter is a really good book.

Really did not know all the facts it would dig into. Really liked it a lot."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Who hasn't read The Scarlet Letter in High School? I didn't, instead of reading classics such as this, my teacher had us reading books like Go Ask Alice and Jay's Journal. Did I miss out by not reading this book back then, I think I did, and I think it's a shame that teachers are taking books like this out of their curriculum.There were times where the story seemed to drag a bit, and at times it was hard to follow the dialect, but that's to be expected with a classic. I did have a hard time getting drawn into the book, as the first part of the book is a mini-autobiography of the author and how he came to write the book. Once I got past this section though, I was drawn into the story of Hester, Pearl, Roger, and Mr. Dimmesdale. How strong Hester must have been to have endured the critisism of her fellow towns people, and not allow it to stop her from being charitable to others in need. My first thought of Mr. Dimmesdale is that he was quite the weak man, but then the guilt of his secret was probably much harder mentally then what Hester went through publicly. Evil doesn't even begin to describe Roger, however a man in his position is probably not going to be thinking straight to start with. Then there was Pearl, her character was the hardest for me to accept. I think the author went a little too far with some of her persistance and insight into thing beyond her years. Overall, the book was well written, and the story gripping."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Yes, I admit it. I am a Dick Tracy fan. I loved the old serials with Ralph Byrd, and I was captivated by the garish sophistication of the Warren Beatty extravaganza. But most of all, I liked the comic strips, with the stark yellow-and-black designs, the x-ray diagrams, the cross sections, and the arrowed labels of significant clews and objects. At least once in a single storyline, the villains would put Dick in a really tight spot-- dipping him in paraffin, breaking his gun hand, stabbing him with a lightning rod, pushing him out of an airplane, handcuffing him inside a truck and setting it on fire-- but he would always find a way to escape. And eventually, he would always give his own back in return.I never had much use for the television show, because it would recycle villains much in the manner of _Batman_ or _Superman_. But in the original strips, most of the villains (no matter how colorful) eventually come to bad ends by death or disfigurement. (Though there were a few like B.O. Plenty and Gravel Gertie who eventually reformed.) This is in keeping with Dick Tracy's oft-repeated motto: \\"Crime does not pay!\\"The downfall of the villains was usually in part the result of Tracy's methods of detection. But there was usually a certain element of Grecian ironic fate that came into play as well. One gangster, for example, who dealt with black market tires during the 1940s, was dragged to his death at the bottom of a river by an old tire from a garbage scow.Chester Gould's _The Celebrated Cases of dick Tracy_ (1970), with an introduction by Ellery Queen is a sampling of Dick Tracy adventures from 1931 through 1949. Perfectionists may complain that some of the episodes are not complete and that other favorite cases were omitted. But this is inevitable in a single volume collection that spans almost twenty years.Tracy's first case is there, in which we are introduced to Tess Trueheart and her family. The central villain, Big Boy, is really a fairly stock gangster. But we quickly move into adventures with The Blank, Jerome Trohs and Mamma, Little Face Finny, the Mole, B.B. Eyes, 88 Keyes, Flattop, Gravel Gertie, B.O. Plenty, Mumbles, Breathless Mahoney, and Pear Shape. Once Gould's villains became colorful grotesques, his strip developed into a vivid morality play.Recommended, though I will admit that there is violence that even today may be a bit unsettling."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter is overloaded with many superfluous words that requires the reader to sift through them all to get to the actual story. However, the strong characters are revealed through their actions more than through Hawthorne's descriptions. The story takes place in 17th Century Boston and Puritanical Law is heavily enforced. A young woman, Hester, has been imprisoned for getting pregnant while committing adultery. Now that the baby is 3 months old, they have her stand in the center of town with so she can be shamed by the whole town. Her husband just happens to come to town as she stands on the scaffold and thus the story continues in a dark spiral of hidden friendships, revenge, immense guilt, and sin.

I needed it for my english class."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Said to be one of the first psychological novels ever written, The Scarlet Letter still captivates its readers. Nathaniel Hawthorne knew how to characterize his characters beautifully. Reading his work is like experiencing that character's life.The story is set in colonial New England. The plot of the story revolves around the lives of three individuals who lived in Puritan Boston. Hester Prynne, a brave, fierce woman bearing her sin in silence, Reverand Arthur Dimmesdale, a very respected member of the community who suffers with his guilt, and Roger Chillingsworth, Hester's husband who wants revenge, are the three characters of Hawthorne's novel. As the story unfolds, so do the intricacies of the characters and in the end the truth is proven to be the best solution.Reading this classic novel was harder to accomplish than I expected. The story starts off slow and, from my point of view, the wording of the book is hard to follow and understand. What I liked best about the novel was the underlying meanings you can take from reading the book. A person's passion for revenge and the clash between a person's private life and public life are hidden meanings shown throughout this story. The portrayal of human nature was also done wonderfully. Sin, guilt, pentinence, and lust are some of the main feelings in this book. The Scarlet Letter is a classic that continues to be read by all ages of readers and the story can teach people valuable lessons about life if read carefully."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I searched high and low for this book until I found it for sale on line through Amazon.

The cases include criminal minds like Flat Top, Pear Shape, Gravel Gerty & BO Plenty, The Blank, 88 Keys, Jerome Trohs & Mamma, Little Face Finny, The Mole, The Brow, Breathless Mahoney and Mumbles. Some color pages. This is a must read and must have for all Tracy fans and fans to be."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I don't understand why this novel has such a low customer rating, except that I can see how many would find the subject matter and elevated writing style extremely difficult and dislikable. The Scarlet Letter is not to be (nor is it possible to be) read lightly; it is actually, in the way of many 19th-century classic novels, quite painful to read. I loved it, and I still trudged through it.The subject matter, infinitely grim and distasteful, is not enjoyable in any way. It centers on the nature of morality, sin, corruption, hypocrisy especially concerning morality, and all that hackneyed bag of themes. You probably already know the general plot of the novel, so I need not reiterate it. Ironically, while criticizing the hypocrisy and sternness of the Puritans, Hawthorne seems very puritannical himself, and displays those same characteristics, including a kind of absurd self-righteousness and a pompous, austere, rigid, very Christian sense of morality. I got endless irony out of this; it seemed as though he, as the narrator, was condemning the Puritans for their harsh, hypocritical actions while endorsing Puritan principles and expressing views just as severe and ridiculously religious, if not more so, than theirs. I have to warn you that it's pretty disgusting the way he is wholly obsessed with the ideas of sin and guilt. Honestly, I think all he wrote about in his lifetime were Puritans, morality, sin and how we are all horrible sinners, etc. I imagine he could have been a fire-and-brimstone-preaching evangelist if he hadn't chosen the path of literary genius instead. And yes, despite all this, he is still a literary genius.What makes this such a wonderful piece of classic literature, and one of my favorites, is how beautiful, eloquent, gorgeous, and sophisticated the language is. Rarely have I seen such an astounding mastery of the English language and literary devices, with perfect fluency and coherence, depth, insight, passion, intensity, and power of expression. Of course, I'm sure the style of prose is not for everyone; but I find it remarkable, magnificent, admirable. I loved the rampant symbolism, the ingenuity of little metaphors found everywhere. I loved the character Pearl, who is so strange and otherwordly and complex. Dimmesdale is, well, so very pathetic; he is the epitome of the once-righteous-now-fallen, guilt-torn, utterly miserable, wretched, squirming, feeble, tortured soul, and his abject, wallowing despair adds to the overall gloomy and tormenting atmosphere of the novel.I know I ranted quite a bit in this review, but honestly, it's a superb work and triumph of English-language literature, and you should at least be able to appreciate it to some degree, in some aspects, and concede its exceptional use of language. I have a feeling that a lot of the reviewers expressing negative opinions are malcontent high school students grumbling about a \\"stupid, boring book\\" assigned to them for class. I myself had to read it for my junior-year English class, but I am very glad I was forced to do so.For those whining about how \\"verbose\\" it is - please get over your own short attention span or lack of taste or whatever it is that impedes you from recognizing and appreciating good literature. An example of verbosity is: \\"I waded along the flooded bank of the river that had overflowed its banks and along which I now waded in flood water,\\" not a sentence of graceful structure and expressiveness like (randomly selecting): \\"Continually, indeed, as it stole onward, the streamlet kept up a babble, kind, quiet, soothing, but melancholy, like the voice of a young child that was spending its infancy without playfulness, and knew not how to be merry among sad acquaintances and events of sombre hue.\\""},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Well, I didn't like this book too much at all. All of the other reviews that I have read say that it's great, it's a classic, a timeless tale! And maybe it is. For me, I found it really hard to get into. There's not much dialogue, or action. The only exciting part comes at the end, with the Reverend Dimmesdale &amp; his confession. Maybe I'll enjoy it when I'm older. I'm only 13 right now, and I don't think I could stand reading it again. My friends know me as a generally fast reader, but this book took me 8 weeks, maybe more, to finish! I found it very boring. I've been reading several books at once, and after a couple pages, I found it too much to keep reading, so I picked up another book that I had previously thought boring, and it seemed like non-stop action! And a lot easier to read, too, than the wording of Nathaniel Hawthorne. However, I will admit that The Scarlet Letter DOES convey a message of guilt, revenge, cowardice &amp; bravery, and the terrible wrong that is sin. For that, I give it 3 stars. I would rate it higher, but, like I said, I found it extremely boring and tiresome. I recommend this book to people who love to read, who don't get too frustrated with tough language, and who have a LOT of time on their hands!:) I'm sure I'll try to read it again someday, but as of now, I need a break from Hawthorne's beautiful, intricate, meaningful, yet difficult words."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This is an easy to read and comprehendible modified version of the novel Scarlet Letter that is read by high school students.

You must focus on the things said instead of the things done. With that in mind, I was profoundly moved by Mr. Dimmesdale's fears and worries, Mr. Chillingworth's cunning complexity, Hester Prynne's quiet silent attitude, and Pearl's devilish actions. Each character in the story was so amazing 3-dimensional.Yes, there are parts in the book that are more verbose than I would have liked, and that is why I rated it a 4. I just learned to ignore those parts that didn't really seem to pertain to the major ideas of the story, and instead focus on those words and feelings that Hawthorne so amazingly expressed. These ideas far outweigh the verboseness. And I actually must admit that I did not find it an extremely long book. If you focus on the reading, it doesn't take long at all (compared to many longer novels of the same class).My advice: Wait until the right time. I tried to read it three times before, and never really got very far. Finally, this summer, I was able to enjoy it immensely. If you are not looking forward to reading it now, then just wait a little longer."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"\\"The Scarlet Letter\\" gains its stature as a great work of art because Hawthorne has selected a historical-social issue, and going beyond the historical and social context, has explored and dramatized the issue in terms of its fundamental social, moral, philosophical and psychological meaning and implications - weaving an intricate pattern in which all the themes are inextricably intertwined and proceed from each other. Further, this novel becomes exceptional because it deals with such complex phenomena in a rather short story and a rather simple plot.To the theme of : \\"The conflict between the individual and society - in context of the consequences of the transgression of a well-established moral norm of society, by the individual\\", Hawthorne has integrated the theme of man's struggle to attain equilibrium-a harmony-with his own self, with society and the supreme source of morality (i.e. God - here I'm speaking from Hawthorne's perspective).Finally, he has further integrated the fundamental (and I think THE most important) theme, which I'd put as: \\"Man's struggle to come to terms with, and glorify the truth.\\"Concealing the truth, faking reality- Hawthorne has denounced all these and above all - the man who fakes the truth about his own character.Note how every event of the story dramatizes all the three themes simultaneously-the integration is impeccable.Guilt, revenge, love, hatred, rebellion, non-conformity, penitence, the nature of sin, the spiritual and psychological condition of the isolated individual - Hawthorne has delved into the nature of all these aspects of human nature and the human soul, which makes reading this novel a psychological tour de force.I'd state the plot-theme of this novel as : \\"The story of four individuals-a priest guilty of adultery-who has concealed his deed from society, thereby earning false esteem and respect of his parishioners; the married woman who partook in his sin and who has been ostracized by the society; the husband of the adulteress, consumed with hate and anger-seeking revenge; and her daughter- a living embodiment of virtue, morality and duty violated - of how their relationships with each other and the society in which they live, help them seek true penitence, glorify the truth-and achieve a proper understanding of their errors, both in terms of their values and their actions.\\"The greatest literary merit of this novel is its plot-structure, which is the most tightly constructed, superbly economized and concentrated plot structure - in fact THE BEST - I've come across - especially in terms of Aristotelian aesthetics, given in \\"The Poetics\\". Hawthorne hasn't included a single character, situation, event, scene or description which is not relevant to the meaning and the plot of the story. Not a single word can be overlooked. Every sentence is condensed such that it can be elaborated into pages of explanation.(I am not including the chapter \\"The Custom House\\" which is very boring and can be conveniently ignored and which I myself did not complete - but according to many, it is also related to the meaning of the novel).Another merit is the terrific symbolism - the deep, dark and wild forest; the beautiful & brilliant rose bush outside the prison door, and a lot more, especially the character of Pearl who symbolizes non-conformity, independence and aggressive rebellion against society .One flaw of this novel is that it is TOO gloomy - which may repel some readers who'd look for some sparks of humor or wit.Also, Hawthorne himself says too much, often coming between the reader and the characters of the story.But I think these flaws are very unimportant in comparison to the merits of the novel.In conclusion I'd say that \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is one of the greatest novels of the 19th century, in fact, one of the greatest of all times. In a story of less than 200 pages, it will give you moral lessons (which you may or may not accept or approve) and insights into human nature and human life which several books may not successfully deal with. Your library and your literary experience are incomplete if you haven't read this novel."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter was quite an adventure through a troubled outcast's mind. The characterization, descriptions, and the story its self made this book one of the best I have read. If it were not for the very advanced vocabulary and the lengthy descriptions, I might have considered this book the best I have read. Hawthorne really allowed the reader to understand every thought of an outcast in a Puritan town. The book takes the reader through interactions with very cruel, sympathetic, and forgiving people. Each encounter brought with it one surprise after another. The book not only examined society and its changing views, but it also gave a rather historically correct account of Puritan life. Before taking this book on, I recommend doing a bit of research on the eccentric Puritan culture. Hawthorne's descriptions of Hester Prynne's thoughts and feelings gave the reader a personal relationship with her. He drops little pieces of information about Hester that make the respect the reader may have for her grow. As the book progressed, Hester's character began to bloom right in front of the reader's eyes. These factors allowed the true cleverness and boldness of Hawthorne's story to shine through. There were only a few aspects that got in the way of true enjoyment of the book. The vocabulary was a bit hard to comprehend when paired up with Hawthorne's inclination to extend his descriptions of a situation for pages. Overall, the book held my attention well and made me think about society in a different way. I would recommend this book to anyone who was willing to take some time interpreting extremely advanced vocabulary in lengthy descriptions."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Emily Queenp.5One may scorn another's action, and participate in the punishment while he is guilty of the same wrong doing, resulting in mental anguish until one confesses, this is the case in \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Hester Prynne is a young woman who has a baby, Pearl, while her husband is away. She is brought before the town for all to see, and Reverend Master Dimmesdale, a clergyman of the town, with disturbing passion, reveals the wrongdoing of Hester. As a punishment for this act, instead of death, Hester has to wear the scarlet letter A on her bosom. She beautifully embroiders it. Even though she feels shame, she appears to wear it with pride. On the way to the scaffold, Hester makes eye contact with her husband, who has recently returned from England. Later he comes to her jail cell and speaks to her. To keep him safe from humiliation, she swears to not reveal his true identity, but to refer to him as Roger Chillingworth, a man of medicine. Hester passes the next seven years with little exposure to the world. She lives off her embroidery to meet the demands of the wealthy, yet she finds time to lend a helping hand to the poor. As she becomes a young girl, Pearl develops somewhat of a devilish disposition. Pearl taunts her mother about the scarlet letter thinking that her mother is a witch. She asks her mother to admit to signing the Black Man's book and that the scarlet letter being his mark. Hester doesn't want her daughter, her only companion, to despise her like the rest of the town so she never tells Pearl why she wears the scarlet letter. One day delivering a pair of gloves to Reverend Master Dimmesdale, she learns of his infirmities, and that Roger Chillingworth is his physician, who seems to be cruel to the minister. Reverend Master Dimmesdale is not only dying from a physical impairment, but also from that of the soul. He has done wrong, but refuses to tell anyone for the shame of the people. He who had so cruelly spoke of Hester's wrong doing in front of the town was guilty of the same. In order to free his troubled mind, he comes before the town and reveals the truth of his relationship with Hester Prynne. This brings a tie between the Hester, Pearl and Dimmesdale that leads to a great event.Throughout \\"The Scarlet Letter\\", Nathaniel Hawthorne uses symbolism to hint a connection between the characters without revealing answers to the questions that build suspense. The scarlet letter \\"On the breast of her gown, in fine red cloth, surrounded with an elaborate embroidery and fantastic flourishes of gold thread\\" symbolizes much more than just Hester's adultery. Pearl has always been attracted to the scarlet letter, and the way Reverned Master Dimmesdale always has his hand upon his heart. The reader knows Hester's crime, but wonders how the minister has sinned. Then Reverend Master Dimmesdale's guilty conscience leads him to the scaffold where he consequently runs into Hester and Pearl, he asks them to join him; \\"And there stood the minister with his hand over his heart; Hester Prynne, with the embroidered letter glimmering on her bosom; and little Pearl, herself a symbol, and the connecting link between these two.\\" At this point there is no doubt that they are all connected by the sense that they are the product of sin, yet there seems to be a greater tie. Then while looking up to the zenith, the minister sees \\" the letter A-- in out in lines of dull red light\\" The reader may now be wondering if the minister is suffering from guilt of being Pearl's father, and not confessing when he had helped with the punishment of Hester. It has not yet been directly revealed to the reader or any other characters, so the reader is still in suspense, and will be until nearly the end. \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is an intriguing book because of its symbolism."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Through Hawthorne's dynamic characters, he portrays the harsh Puritan society of the 18th century. This story is more than a social commentary though. The struggle of good and evil within the human soul, the concept of right and wrong, love and hate are all addressed as Hawthorne delves into the darkest recesses of the human soul. This is a classic."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Sin, guilt, shame, jealousy, dignity, reputation. These words describe the sinful past of Rev. Dimmesdale and Hester, and the aftermath of its torment and ignominy. In a Puritan Society, adultery is punished by carrying the burden of one's sin- wearing a humiliating scarlet letter.While Hester sees her sin as an opportunity to personally grow and develop sympathy toward human nature, society views sin as an obstacle that will prevent one from reaching heaven.The ironic character of Hester demonstrates her strong will and personality. Given the option to leave her town and resume a normal life, Hester prefers to stay and to wear the Scarlet Letter. She also gets upset when she is informed that she might be officially redeemed from wearing the scarlet letter. Hester's behavior demonstrates her desire to determine her own identity rather than let others determine it for her. To her, running away or removing the letter would be an acknowledgment of society's power over her: she would be admitting that the letter is a mark of shame and something from which she desires to escape.The book touches on the theme of concealment versus visibility. Dimmesdale is a great orator and respected Reverend yet no one sees the hidden scarlet letter he bears under his religious garment or facade. Hester conceals the identity of Pearl's father and thus she carries the burden of society's punishment on her own.The novel criticizes the interpretation of symbols by gradually making the scarlet letter of less importance. Despite her shameful letter, Hester is able to find a job and raise her child as she wishes. The symbol has no power over her but rather she is proud of wearing it. Even the Native Americans interpret the letter as a sign of distinction and reverence. Hawthorne criticizes the Puritan society and how labeling individuals as redeemed or sinful does not guarantee their salvation or doom."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"In high school I switched English levels, which left me lacking in a lot of classic high school reads. This includes authors from Twain to Salinger and just about every generic book that someone says: \\"Oh, I read that in high school.\\" This weekend I finally gave in to read Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlett Letter and it was brilliant. His short piece The Custom House precedes the story and it was so descriptive and funny and that's certainly one adjective (funny) that I've never heard paired with Hawthorne. Most everyone seems to be familiar with the plot (especially after the 1995 film) and it all together is a rather simple story line: a married woman whose husband has disappeared has an affair and becomes pregnant. She's forced to wear the letter A in scarlet on her bosom as punishment. From here some fabulous ideas of witchcraft and black magic pepper the story and a great ending."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This book was well written by its author, Nathaniel Hawthorne. It is considered one of the classics, hence the reason that we read it in AP Lang. But I was most impressed with the price, quality, and speediness of the delivery and book. I was also very happy to see that it was the same version that my whole class had, despite that version's absence from numerous bookstores in my area. Thank you Amazon!!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Those who read THE SCARLET LETTER tend to take its message about the evils of sin and their consequences at face value and therefore literally. It is understandable that readers of Hawthorne's dark fable think like that since he places such heavy emphasis on the letter itself, which no one has trouble labeling as the \\"a\\" in adultery. However, since sin and its ramifications have been analyzed and interpreted in nearly every manner possible, it then seems reasonable to assume that the sin of the scarlet letter is more flexible than previously thought. This flexibility of the meaning of sin does not reside within the concept of sin, which according to Puritan conventions, was pretty well fixed, but rather it lies within each person who either carries sin within her heart like Hester, or rails against those who are accused of carrying it, like the Puritan church leaders. What emerges after hearing Dimmesdale's closing sermon against sin is that in any comparison with its evolving meaning from the beginning of the book to the end with the three major characters, one is struck with the unsettling notion that the very concept of sin is infinitely elastic.The church leaders who branded Hester had no difficulty labeling Hester's affair as worthy of the letter. To them they saw an affair and compared it to their collective notion of sin and placed an equal sign between the two. It did not occur to them that they might have created a greater sin by choosing one of their own as a scapegoat--as Shirley Jackson would much later do in THE LOTTERY--and cast off their own foibles on a woman who did not deserve such branding. Nor did they consider the indefinite period of time that would inevitably accompany the branding. Finally, they made no provision for redemption or rehabilitation, which to them meant no more than the victim's extorted shouts of approval of the public shaming. In the person of the Reverend Dimmesdale, Hawthorne shows us a man with even more subtle shades of sin that Hester possesses. He sins and then tries to cover it up, clearly not what one would expect from one who supposedly belongs to the same social group as the branders themselves. If it is difficult to rationalize Hester's silence concerning the paternity of their child Pearl, then it is far more difficult to do the same concerning his own. When he agonizes over his own participation in the affair, he balances a weak desire to be honest against a much stronger one to cloak his weaknesses under his clerical collar. If Dimmesdale cannot perceive that the root source for his painful process of self-flagellation lay in the harshness of his religious training, the reader has no such problem. Had the Puritan concept of sin and adultery not been synonymous, then his pain and Hester's pain could not exist. And then there is the master manipulator of the two, Roger Chillingworth. In his own way, he twists the meaning of sin to accommodate so many hues that the word is stretched into a linguistic pretzel. Even after multiple readings, one cannot tell to what extent the desire for revenge poisons his mind, or how much his own inner demons drove him on. It is this continuous ebbing back and forth of the meaning of sin that both drives and undermines Hester, Dimmesdale, and Chillingworth that causes each new generation of reader to ponder whether sin is a quality external to them or is somehow hardwired into their collective souls. The scarlet letter then emerges more as a mirror that reflects the conscience of all concerned than it does a poor woman who must endure a few hours of personal horror in the village stocks."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"A lot of reviews here are claiming that this book is so amazing, and others that it is the \\"worst book ever.\\" I disagree with both of these.On the positive side for the book, it introduces a lot of social questions. Not just about the morality of adultery and of punishment, but others that may have been missed by high school readers just hoping to get through the book. It describes the human tendencies towards forgiveness and towards selfishness (\\"It is to the credit of human nature, that, except where its selfishness is brought into play, it loves more readily than it hates. Hatred, by a gradual and quiet process, will even be transformed to love, unless the change be impeded by a continually new irritation of the original feeling of hostility.\\") It shows how Hester's actions, along with societies response, ruined lives. It showed how sometimes it's best to move on from problems. A lot of questions about the nature of society, that can even be applied today, are posed, and some are answered.Unfortunately, the book is wordy (probably as a result of when it was written,) and it lacks action. The plot is kind of hokey, and much of the time it seems like he is writing parts of the story just so that the narrator can go on a monologue giving commentary on human nature. The monologues that follow aren't really bad, but take up much of the book. The charachters are developed, in a way, but the reader is never given the chance to really identify with the charachters. Hawthorne uses a lot of symbolism in the book, some of which is good, and adds another dimension to the story. Some, however, is pretty elementary, and generally not necessary. Oh, and The Custom House is just terrible, there's no defending it.This book provides some interesting topics to discuss, but isn't very interesting as a novel. The narrator is dry. He is rather believable (though, he kind of admits that he's making up much of the story, which makes some of the really detailed parts kind of absurd) but he is not a great story teller. Basically, high school english teachers need to stop assigning this book to read unless they are planning on having some in depth discussions about society, and not just adultery, either. I had this book covered with two english teachers (one went on leave right before we started, and came back for the end.) The better one gave it some depth, but the other seemed to think that the purpose of the book was to contain a lot of worthless symbology and just quizzed us on stupid stuff."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I've never heard of this author before so reading this was a bit of a gamble with me but I liked the sound of it. Well, I'm glad I took the risk. I was sucked into the characters lives and anxious to discover thier outcomes and fates. The plotline fell into place so well and wonderfully. Despite the fact that it wasn't full of suspense it was still SUCH a page turner. I loved the way the book was written, each line meant something and each line was meant to be there and each new page was like a new poem.It made me concentrate too. It's not the kind of book you can read half asleep before bed time, this book required my full attention."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter is a fantastic story, a story of Hester Prynne, a wife who went to \\"the New World\\" (America) before her husband, and whose husband is suspected of being lost at sea. During the couple years that she is alone, she becomes pregnant and gives birth - proving to the entire Puritan colony that she has been unfaithful to her husband.The Puritan elders madate that she wear a scarlet letter, the letter \\"A\\", upon her bosom. The story tells of how this single event works in the lives of the three, and symbolism is everywhere.This story is the story of Hester Prynne, and of her (once) husband, her paramour, and of her child. The turn of phrase is fantastic, and eloquent. The book has many memorable and quotable phrases, and more than a few colorful characters.Flo Gibson's reading of the story is exquisite, with all the nuance and emphasis one could hope for. Her character voices are splendid, and there is little doubt as to who might be speaking at any time. She never hesitates, and never sounds as if she is plodding, but rather is acting as story-teller and muse.I fell in love with this book, and Flo Gibson gives it voice."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This is the first truly great American novel. When I read it years ago I was not the ideal reader. The whole atmosphere of sin and guilt was difficult for me to take. There was a gloom in it which I wanted to escape from. It was hard for me too at that age and time of life to give full attention and sympathy to a female protagonist. What did I have to do with this Hester Prynne? Chillingworth the avenging husband was cold and unsympathetic as death . And Dimmesdale too standing hypocritically on the pulpit and preaching a morality he himself violates also did not appeal to me. In some way I did not even understand what Hester Prynne did so wrong , and why they were tormenting her so. A backward and benighted society, a narrow morality a lack of love and tenderness. Well these of course are all of Hawthorne's points as he pits the traditional, narrow morality which becomes immoral and inhumane in persecuting the person who has done wrong, Hester, but who in response to the wrong acts with nobility and humanity. I too must admit that I could not understand how Hester could give up the child, Pearl. In any case with the years it seems to me that when I read this book I was not really ready to understand it. I could not do it justice.Hawthorne's sentence,\\" Until the heart is touched we do not begin to be\\" seems to me a lesson illustrated powerfully here through Hester's 'evil ' deed and its redemption in her noble conduct thereafter."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Although I enjoyed this book, I sometimes found that the language that Hawthorne uses in this novel to be confusing and somewhat excessive. The descriptions were vivid, but sometimes were taken to the point where they take away from the story. Especially in the beginning when I was still trying to figure out what was going on, I would often read a whole page just to realize that I had no clue what it had just said because of the confusing Elizabethan words. The language does add to the portrayal of society in the mid 1600's, and maybe I had trouble understanding because I have a small vocabulary.Once I was able to follow what Hawthorne was saying, I quickly got into the book. The differences in the characters and the many twists and turns that the story takes keeps the reader entertained and guessing what will happen next until the last line.This was a great book that I think everyone should read, but I think that it would be a whole lot easier to grasp if a couple \\"thou\\"s and \\"thy\\"s were replaced with more modern language."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"As glad as I am to see in the reviews below that many high-school students have at least enough interest in reading to write a review, I am disheartened that so many of these high-schoolers have such difficulty in understanding the novel. As is usually the case, those who rated the book at one star don't have a clue as to what the story is even about; some haven't even finished the book! Nevertheless, there seems to be an alarming trend (to me, at least) toward reading Cliff notes as a substitute to actually reading the novel itself. I fail to see how anyone could even hope to understand the intricacies and subtlety that Hawthorne has woven into his greatest work through some watered-down retelling. (I don't particularly care for Cliff notes, but never mind that.) Being myself a high-school student, I feel that I must always try to represent the greater masses as something more than commonly believed, yet comments I have read lead me to wonder if the stereotypes are not more real than I have hoped. What I see when I look at the population is a group unable to understand and unwilling to try.To those who have lambasted &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; as being boring, slow, etc., all I can ask is that you not review books that you do not understand. Without understanding, certainly, no work can seem worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I read this book for my 11th grade Lit class and I must admit the book was quite a shock. Many of the books I have read have been nothing more than an attempt at delving into the inner parts of the human soul. This book does much more than that. It depicts the struggle of a man with himself and an outside enemy. He commits one of the most unspeakable acts of the time and punishes himself constantly. He lacks the courage to confess his crime and goes through a period of mental and physical torture. He also faces the wrath a cruel and vicious enemy who lives for nothing more than to torture his victim. All in all I believe it was an excellent book and I would reccomend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I am a junior in high school, and I just finished reading this book. Yes, the language and characters were stiff and formal, but at the time that this book was written, that was the convention. It is an excellent portrayal of the far reaching consequences of selfish sin, and the inner struggle that comes as a result of this sin. True, the characters had no depth, but this book was full of symbols and the characters are also symbols, representing different sins and evils, and the ways of dealing with said sins. The language does tend to bog down a reader, but remember that this was before authors began to write in the vernacular (Mark Twain, I believe, was the first) so the dialogue ends up sounding stilted and formal, especially from the children (Pearl, and the mudslinging ones). I personally did not like this book, but that does not mean that it was not an excellent work of literature. This type of book simply does not appeal to me, I prefer writers equally as thought-provoking but who write with more colorful prose, such as Dickens, or Salman Rushdie. The fact that I didn't like this book does not keep me from seeing the merit of it. It's an excellent book, though not quite a classic of the caliber of Macbeth or Great Expectations."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I was given The Scarlet Letter to read in my 11th grade English class and, as opposed to some books we've read, I was actually pleased. This novel is interesting and is a true look into the human soul. Hawthorne is not a humorous writer but he is a true to life one. He tells it like it is, including not only the strengths but the weaknesses of the human soul. Anyone who finds this book boring must be entirely niave or else the book was over their head. To those people I would suggest reading it again and this time actually TRYING to understand it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This is book is one of the greatest book I've ever read. Although the word and language of the book is difficult, the text and the theme were simply amazing. Hester Prynne and Aruthur Dimmesdale are characters that can relate to the world today, a hidden secret waiting to be solved. It is a great love story.. just simply great."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"When Hester Prynne commited adultury with Aurthor Dimmesdale she was condemned to where the Scarlet Letter A on her bosom as a reminder to herself and o other around her about her harsh deed, mean while Roger Chillinworth, her husband, vowed that he would find out with whom Hester commited the sin. This was a great book because it is full of suspense and continuous sinning. The only problem with it is that it is fairly hard to read so much time and patience must be put into it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"after years of sighing about the dull tedium of scarlet letter, i happened upon janey's &quot;book report&quot; on the novel in kathy acker's &quot;blood and guts in high school&quot;...made me ashamed to have lamented hawthorne's &quot;dullness&quot;...if scarlet letter is putting you to sleep, try acker's version (works better than coffee at illuminating the life of this novel)"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This novel is a wonderful novel, if you have the time, and open-mindedness to see why Hawthorn wrote the way he did. So what! if he spent 20 pages on explaining about a D--- arm chair! The person who complains about something like that, obviously dosen't see the reasoning behind such a writing...and therefore lacks the necessary attitude to learn of such things. With that said... The character of Roger Chillingworth, (I thought), was one of great intrigue. His thought processes, and actions,(Even though they were morbid and evil) are all done with reason and intent. Unlike our dear Hester Prynne, who seems to run on emotion, like an old car runs on sulfer. As for the Rev. Aurthur Dimmesdale I believe him to be a self-centered hypocrite who finaly, does some actual good upon the end of the book. The story itself, is one of good writing and attention to detail. It was overall an excellent novel made of good talent, good characters, good writing, and of wonderful detail."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"&quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;, by Nathaniel Hawthorne is a book about how keeping secrets can ruin a person. A very realistic view of how a society can treat others. Even though many of the towns people were no more innocent than Hester in many ways, they looked on her as one of the worse sinners in town, unable to be touched by the rest of society."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Last night I was watching a television show in which there was a high school English class scene and the students are bored to tears while reading and studying &quot;The Scarlet Letter.&quot; Few things burn my butt more than when I see this myth that &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; is boring perpetuated. This book is an absolute masterpiece and one of the great pieces of Art by an American--and I thought that in 9th grade when I read it for the first time.People who don't like the book are not immersing themselves in it. You have to shut out all distractions because every word and scene is so critical. Morality, shame, hypocrisy, redemption, righteousness and ostracism cannot just be thrown onto a page--there must be a build up. Almost twenty years and countless books after having first read &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; I consider it to be my favorite book of all time."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I read this book during a high school vacation. Although the long words and unconventional characters did not catch my fancy, the mystery involved in the story captivated me. As the story developed, I realized the profound intricacy of the plot. The conclusion of the story was not happy, nor did it even seem fair. As one who knows Hawthorne's puritan morality standards, however, I say that he communicated his message extremely well."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I have just finished reading \\"The Scarlet Letter\\"; before school ended, my english teacher gave most of her students a letter from our future AP English teacher, and it exhorted us to read two books for the summer: The Scarlet Letter and The Color of Water. I have not read \\"The Color of Water\\", but \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is a wonderful story that should not be missed. Yes, Hawthorne may use sentences that are a trifle too long, but that does not really detract any of the genious from the book. I have a feeling that I will be one of the very few people (possibly 4) that will actually read the book; because, even though it will be an AP class, most of the students are quite apathetic.The book should be read by anyone that can appreciate it; it will improve your vocabulary (as it did mine). Hawthorne contrived to write an archetype of a classic novel that will last for many more years to come."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Beyond brilliant, The Scarlet Letter is in another sphere entirely.This book is incredibly profound, deep, spiritual, eerie, and, in the end a soul-quickening experience. Hawthorne took the romantic, gothic themes popular in his day and transformed them into a new genre, the psychological novel. It may take a few readings, but eventually you will *GET IT* and when you do, you will feel a chill go down your spine. Hawthorne is delving into the psychology of evil, and the ring of truth is so strong it can be a moving experience. But as i said, it may take a number of readings before it hits you. It's kind of like those 3D drawings you must stare at until the picture resolves itself.Beside all this thematic content, Hawthorne is a master of the language, and his phrases are so delicious, I found myself repeating them just for the beauty of the expression. This book is to be read slowly, one sentence at a time. If you don't understand it, read it again. You will get it eventually.The plot itself is just beautifully realized. Many of the scenes are played out with real pathos and heartbreaking realism. Though, one can't discount the symbolism which abounds in this book.Someone has said that nothing really happens in the book. That is really not the case, but H does take numerous side trips into the minds of his characters. In this sense he prefigures the moderns like Joyce and Faulkner with their stream of consciousness technique. It is true that one often gets the feeling that time has been stopped, and we are in a moral realm that presses us on all sides until we feel claustrophobic and stifled. This is H's intent, to intimate the opressive moral imperatives, many societally coerced, that operate beneath the surface of our everyday business.While the book as a whole is a dreary, sad, almost mystical experience best read at night with a candle burning, the prologue is H at his most lighthearted. His descriptions of his fellow custom house employees are just delicious, and quite humourous. It makes a nice complement to the story. It is autobiographical up to the point where he finds the scarlet letter. That is a fictitious device he uses to introduce the novel. I believe the introduction (or prologue) was originally included to fatten up the book for publication. As it turns out, the prologue is one of H's best works, and should NOT be skipped! It can also be read on it's own.Finally, if you want more Hawthorne, try the short stories, *Young Goodman Brown* and *Ethan Brand*. They are deep meditations on sin written as allegories. Do not read if you are prone to paranoia or schizophrenia. ; )Hawthorne anticipated the psychology of the unconscious half a century before Freud, and his insistence on the connectedness between spirituality, psychology and physiology anticipates modern wholistic medicine. Plus, as I said, he is one of the greatest stylists who ever lived. You can not really understand America, unless you've read his works."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I was not assigned to read this in high school, which is fortunate because I probably would have hated it back then. I used to think that anything written before the 1950's was too old to be entertaining. But, happily this book proved otherwise. Hawthorne writes with a poetic rhythm that kept me so absorbed that I was stunned to see how quickly I finished. The story is surprisingly relevent even today because of its thoughtful distinction between moral values and human compassion.A few things, however, kept this book from being five-star worthy, the first being the introductory chapter entitled \\"The Custom House\\". As eloquent as Hawthorne is, his words alone could not energize this ploddingly dull prologue. And speaking of eloquence, one occasionally gets the feeling that Hawthorne tries to lend too grand an air to unworthy subjects by forcibly inserting wordy descriptions. I had dictionary.com up constantly in an effort to decipher certain passages. Suffice it to say, my vocabulary nearly doubled after completing the book. One final, but minor, criticism concerns his excessive use of the words 'ignominy' and 'tremulous'. I admit, I got a little tired of seeing those on every other page.These faults aside, the book is well worth a read, and I would recommend it to anyone, provided one reads it freely of his/her own will and not out of necessity."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne is a book to be read, but not certainly enjoyed. The plot, though interesting and unique, at times seems to drag on along with its characters and descriptions. Though it is a slow moving book, it is one that should be read for its insight on the past and how they compare to contemporary views.The story is about a woman name Hester Prynne who is living in a Puritan community in Boston during the seventeenth century. She has been forced to wear a scarlet letter A on her chest as a punishment for committing adultery and having an illegitimate child with an unknown man. Her and her daughter Pearl are forced to live as outsiders as Hester's husband, who is carrying a secret identity, is trying to unravel the truth of Pearl's father.Much time and concentration must be given to The Scarlet Letter in order to understand the text and meanings. When given attention, it will prove to be a good book. The plot is very thought provoking in how the life styles of the characters differ from people living today. Though it is a book that not many can relate to, it is an excellent portrayal of the past. Readers should be young adults to adults in order to grasp the sometimes difficult writing. However, it is a book that all should read at one time or another."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I found it hard to stay awake while reading the first 22 chapters of The Scarlet Letter. I thought that Hawthorne overexplained unimportant details. I really enjoyed the last 2 chapters, however, because it seemed more focused and there was some suspense. The novel is set in Puritan New England. Salem,Massechusetts to be exact. The main character is Hester Prynne, an adulteress who is forced to wear a pin, in the shape of the letter \\"A\\",made from scarlet colored fabric, hence the title. Her adultery results in the birth of her daughter Pearl. The man responsible for this is none other than the town preacher, although he keeps this secret hidden from his congregation. A complication in the plot is the arrival of Hester's husband from Germany. He is thought to be dead, and uses this to his advantage by disguising himself as Roger Chilligworth and becomes a physician in Salem. He vows to find out who Hester's lover was. The Scarlet Letter relates to Nathaniel Hawthorne's personal life, because of the setting. He spent a majority of his life in Salem, and claimed that the story originated from his discovery of a box containing the actual scarlet letter and a record of Hester Prynne while working in Salem's Custom House. Whether his story is true or not, it made me think of the novel as a real story, so I connected more with it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Now I've read the other reviews about people who were bored by this book because they had to read it for AP English, and that is in fact why I had to read this book, but rather than take a modern view at an older book and talk about how &quot;stupid it is to be embarassed by wearing a letter on your clothes&quot;, its better to not put books like this in a modern context. In that time villages were small, people very judgemental, and horribly cruel. And the fact that she had no friends or even a person to talk to and only a child to keep her company is truly sad. Now I got into AP English dreading the &quot;Summer Assignment&quot; and especially dreading have to read 2 BOOKS!!, but this book was truly great and I enjoyed it far more than expected. While it really is a tough a read, I would still recommend. I used the Cliff Notes to assist me in reading the book , and I found it to be excellent. The ending of the book was truly classic. If you've never read this book, you should!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"WHen I finally started reading this classic, I was simply astounded by the alien beauty of the language: the prose style is as dense as the best of Nabokov, with characterisations of people and nuances of emotion that are far-reaching and subtle. Even better, the psychology of the characters is so finely drawn that it begs to be read again from cover to cover. Things are never neatly and unrealistically resolved, but continually appear in their full ambiguity, so much like real life. While not exactly a historical novel that depicts a period with total accuracy, it is one of the first great psychology novels ever written, and indeed is in a league with Stendhal in that respect. As this has been extrensively reviewed, I will leave plot descriptions to others.This is a classic that truly lives up to its reputation. Highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I'm not giving The Scarlet Letter 3 stars because I think it is a mediocre book; I'm giving the book 3 stars because it is NOT FOR EVERYBODY. This is not a Jon Krakauer book that you can pick up and be gripped cover to cover. It is, however, masterfully written. Characterization is very deep and relevant, and symbolism is huge. One major flaw in this novel's symbolism is that its elements are not as relevant to society as they used to be. However, there exists no better primer on the lessons of guilt, sin, repression, and repentance than The Scarlet Letter.By the way, I'm a high school student who was forced to read this, and let me say this to all the other such people who bashed this book for being boring: Please recognize this as a work of LITERATURE and not as a basis of comparison for RL Stine books.The reason for the 3 stars is because this is not the type of book I reccommend you buy for an airplane trip or anything of the like. This book is masterfully intricate, artistically complex, and worthy of more than just a passing glance over the words on the page..."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"...I looked at the back cover and saw that Henry James called this \\"the finest piece of imaginitive writing yet put forth in the country.\\" For those of you who have read James and find him tedious, prepare yourself for much of the same here. Like James, the prose is robust and at times almost poetic. And like James, it is amazing how a 250 page novel can easily feel like 500 pages.That said, this is a must read for anyone trying to check off the list of American literary classics. Hester Prynne and her scarlet 'A' are cultural references so recognizable that you will surely feel like an outcast among the literary cognoscenti if you happened to avoid this one in high school. There is a reason, however, that they force us to read this in high school, and it's because no reasonable adult would actually choose to read this book of their own free will. Well, except me.It's actually somewhat amusing, in our era of rampant adultery and other forms of sexual promiscuity, to read of a time when a seemingly victimless transgression would cause so much of an uproar. Hawthorne has created quite a period piece with this novel, a vivid, if unidimensional, portrait of the Puritanical roots of our country. Oh, how far we've come..."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Scarlet Letter was rather dry and not very intresting at the beginning, but overall, the book was pretty bearable, if not interesting at times. Hester's daughter, for example, was quite intriguing with her &quot;witchy- sinful?&quot; characteristics and I felt really sorry for Hester. The ending was kinda predictable, but still, if you want to read it, check it out from the library."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This product requires a stereo player in which the balance is turned totally to the left. Most auto systems have that capability. However if you have Dolby or SurroundSound, it can be difficult (and maybe impossible) to play the cassette without hearing two recordings at the same time. Unfortunately neither the packaging nor the website will warn you of the problem. You therefore should think before buying. Once you have opened the packaging you may be unable to return the product."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"With so many allusions in literature and culture to the infamous &quot;A&quot; worn by Hester Prynne, I was very excited about reading Hawthorne's &quot;masterpiece.&quot; Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed. I did find the symbolism that dealt with Pearl's fascination with her mother's &quot;A&quot; interesting, but the rest of the book I did not. Other than to be more literaraly savvy, I would not recomend the book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"i am reading this book like many of these reviews for a class in highschool. i started off the book thinking the writting was almost witty and sarcastic enough to hold my attention (if you know much about the peritans). as i got farther into this book however i found that the story is boring, the characters 2 demensional having every person have the same kind of dialog whether it be a grown adult or a 3 year old child.many adults rashtionalize the the lack of talent in this book saying \\"it was written along time ago, so for the time it was good.\\" by going by that rational, all the buildings in europe,churches, cathederals, ECT, should be nothing more than minor buildings of no great importans or splendor, but if you've ever been to europe, you'll find it quite amazing, unlike this book that was written so long ago. i say stop living in the past, maybe 100 years ago this was a pretty exiting book, but now its 2005 almost 06' and i find this book probably the worst thing iv ever read."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This is my mom's account. I had the pleasure of reading this book in English this year. I can honestly say, it is the single most boring book I've EVER read. You will NEVER find someone my age that enjoys this story. It has no action! No suspense! It isn't deep! Things don't symbolize anything. If they do, then you're thinking too hard. This book is not a classic. It is the worst. I'd recommend copying a dictionary before I'd ask you to read this pile. DO NOT EVEN THINK OF BUYING THIS."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"My 11th grade English teacher tortured me with this morbid book and I can't say if I'll ever forgive her. Not only was this this book boring but Hawthorne unnecesary uses all sorts of complex language to convey one simple thought. The only reason that I didn't give this book 1 star was because there was some art in the book and symbolism. WAY OVERRATED."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I hate Hawthorne's style of writing. It's over-bloated and self-indulgent. I wish he'd just get to the point and stop blabbering on and on. The plot of the book seems like a modern melodramatic soap opera. All of the characters are one-dimensional. I'm not going to say the book is poorly written, but it's written in a style that makes the book kind of boring and tedious to read. Overall, a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I was truly amazed upon completion of the Scarlet Letter. In no way was I mesmerized by Hawthorne's brilliant imagery, or even his sublime command of the english language in which the general book reading community seems to revel. On the contrary, I was mystified at how one seeming normal man was able to select the exact combination of phonemes necessary to initiate a neurological cascade leading to an undebiably unconscious state. It was unbelievable really. I would literally pick up this book at noon, and be quite asleep and 12:15. Forget valium folks, this is cheaper and more effective. The &quot;A&quot; on Hester's chest should have stood for awful. Or better yet, anteater. No relation to any themes really, I just think that it's a funny little mammal. At least if this were the case, Hester's plight would have been slightly amusing. As it was, however, the only treacle to the unending dolor was the last page. Not the actual ending mind you, but just the quality of actually being done."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I found it preachy and long and got.very bored to claw my way through the very wordy prologue.Then tried to find the.actual novelFinally gave up!!!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I had to read this book for my high school English class. I hated every bit of it actually I never finished it. This book does not belong on the list of classic must reads. As a college student now I thought I would give the book a second chance just as something to read for my own personal joy of reading. This is still to this day the WORSE book I have ever read in my life!! How could anyone actually like this back enough to rate it 3 star much less 5. This should be rated in negative stars."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This book was very different from any other book that I have ever read. I was very impressed with the way Hawthorne put such a deep meaning into his novel. I have never read a book like it. It's definitely different from a book like Harry Potter--there's not any deeper meaning in that book, it's cut 'n dry. It's neat also how much influence Nathaniel's Hawthrone's own life has influenced this book. I did not like the the plot or setting so much of the book at first. You really have to think about it and concentrate on what is being said at the end. It's kind of neat the things that you could say about it, the things you could relate it to. Basically the only thing about it that I didn't like was the the plot wasn't action-packed. I like books that have more action and dialog. I think it was a good experience for me though to read it just to get the feel for reading a book like that--the Old English and the deeper meaning. I would recomend it to people who enjoy the 17th centry and its society, because I think it reflects that very well. As well as reflecting the society of th 1850's--the time when Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote this book. It was a pretty good book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"It is a travesty that this novel is even classified with the classics. This is by far one of the most boring and pointless novels in existance. The plot dribbles on about sin and adultry with few arguments. The contrasting of light and dark, with shadows, light and color is overdone and quite childish. Any third grade student can classify purity as light and sin as darkness. More over, there is over a hundred pages of belaboring the point, with no real conclusion. At the end of the novel, all I had was a headache, and I had fallen asleep more than a dozen times."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"i couldn't listen to this book because the women reading it has such a screechy horrible voice so i can give no review of the actual book but whatever you do try to find a version with a different reader if you're into audio books"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"On first glance, such a slim volume would seem to be something you could read quickly. Not so! The turgid and heavy prose is over-ornamented and complicated by ye olde New England Puritan syntax.I suspect that even when it was written Hawthornes prose was never accessible, and in the modern context it is so far from spoken english that reading it is like wading through treacle. It is sweet, cloying and ultimately sickening.The underlying story is simple, a universal enough theme to span the ages, and could easily be rewritten well into the modern context.It is never easy to be harsh with a book that is listed as a \\"classic\\" but in this case I feel I must be truthful about it. This is not an easy nor an enjoyable read. It is hard work. To be oxymoronic I suppose it is the heaviest light read and the fattest slim book I have encountered.Read it at your peril!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":".I enjoyed this book very much. And it is not outdated for our day especially since fundamentalism is so overwhelming modern civilization subordinating flexibility and lowering tolerance to a zero level. It is here that a story that takes place in the early American Puritan culture is surprisingly not far from today's anti-sexually neurotic society. While the Puritans appear far harsher, it is only because the fundamentalists were in control. It is no different today, except they are not the majority, not yet anyway, but are growing in vast proportion as can be seen in the censorship of media, music, advertising and entertainment.And so this story would have been revolutionary during the puritan era, it is a valuable lesson and honest when pertaining to the human animal, something which we all are, even if we cease to admit it in our Christian or religious pietism.It is here that a Hester Prynne, apparently a \\"liberal,\\" had relations with a man and subsequent illegitimate child and refuses to tell the court who the father is. And for this she is labeled as an outcast and sinner. She is publicly humiliated and for the remainder of her life must wear a scarlet letter on her garment that identifies herself as an outcast. And you know people, the jealous woman who love to see others humiliated, the ignorant that may not even understand the nature of the so-called crime but are quick to follow the herd mentality.In the meantime, her prior husband, Roger Chillingworth, is seeking revenge to the father of her child, who turns out to be the most well respected man of the Puritan town, the ever so idolized and admired preacher himself, Arthur Dimsdale. But Hester maintains complete dignity through out the entire novel. And it is only in the end that the poor mentally distraught hypocrite preacher finally admits his Christian sin, this due to the internal guilt and hypocrisy that Christian insecurity so often does, as it almost always debilitates a person's courage to be with self-beating analysis and repression from externally determined codes.And today, there it is, watch the news programs and you will see more than one Hester Prynne who will receive just as bad treatment, if not worse. Currently there are two women who had sex with minors, one being jailed, her beau still loves her and is waiting for her, the other, a young 23 year old, about to be punished severely I'm sure.I can just imagine the severe beating other societies, such as the intellectuals of the ancient Athenian Greek culture, would receive in our modern day Augustinian society. Puritanism lives in the right wing conservative morality that is permeating our present culture. Please Mr. Dimsdale right wing conservatives, Mr. & Mrs. Evangelical Christians, let go, admit your hypocrisy, cease judging others, and let's evolve to higher levels of human consciousness, not regress."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"i strongly advise you to skip the entire introduction. it is boring and pointless. it explains the author's inspiration to write this...let's say...not-so-good book. in fact, this book was probably the most boring and uneventful book i have ever read. i only did because it was a &quot;required reading&quot; assignment for school. actually in my opinion it starts out interesting and gets worse as it goes along. this is most likely due to the fact that it contains so many useless pages of description that i quickly lost interest. if the author removed these extra pages, the book would probably be half the size, but much better nevertheless. there really was nothing in the plot that made me want to finish the book, maybe with the exception of why the minister kept his hand on his heart. ON THE OTHER HAND, the message was somewhat interesting and got me thinking. i'm sorry if i offended anybody who enjoyed the novel with my negative feedback. i mean, it might be a good book to some, but extremely boring to others. it really depends on ur tolerance level and how easily amused u are. also, this book and is quite hard to comprehend because of the old english and difficult concepts to grasp. that may be another reason why some find it not amusing; the story is boring because it might not make sense to them."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I hated this story. It was long. It was preachy. It was boring.

Most people in today's society don't get pointed out for commiting adultery. It's like an everyday thing now. People just don't do that anymore. I do think that is was great to see how the people back then viewed certain quailties and how they carried out their religious beliefs. To me, this was a story about a woman named Hester Prynne who was caught up in a bad love triangle. She was married to a scholar who had sent her ahead to Boston. She got caught up and fell in love with the minster Dimmesdale. She got pregnant and had a daughter who she named Pearl because she was the most precious and expensive thing in her life. All of her earnings went towards her. They made Hester and baby Pearl sit out on a scaffold allday to let the people come by and look at them and ridicule them. Hester had to wear a scarlet A on her bosom from hence forth. She made the most of it, though. Pearl had an intuition and she could recognize how was good and who was bad. She knew the Chillingworth, Hester's husband, was a bad man. She felt a connection with Dimmesdale. One day when Pearl was about seven years old, she asked her mother what did the scarlet letter mean and why did Dimmesdale always cover up his heart. Hester had still not revealed who the father of her child was because she loved him that much. As far as I have read the guilt is eating Dimmesdale up and he wants to tell the people but he doesn't know how. In the end you should try your best not to keep hurtful secrets inside because in the end it will be the thing that destroy's you the most!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Like most of the poor souls subjected to the forced reading of this book, I had to read this in my freshman year for a Lit 9 class. I'm torn between saying it was the worst 3 weeks of my life or the most wasted 3 weeks of my life.The writing was drier than the 18th amendment, flowerier than a gay bar, and more boring than watching paint dry. Reading it was like reading the dictionary, but with a horrible plot and descriptions that are horribly specific.Additionally, I got the version WITHOUT the random house opening, and I STILL hated this book. If this is the peak of Hawthorne's literary 'genius', I don't want to read anything else he's written.The story itself has 24 chapters. About 20 of these are pointless and are just there for Hawthorne to flaunt his ridiculous writing style. In the end, the only things about the book that are even partway of a mystery are 1) Who adulterated with Hester Prynne, and 2) why Hawthorne even wrote this book in the first place.This book is the worst waste of ink and dead trees I've ever seen. If you're a person who heavily supports the eco-stuff, don't protest fossil-fuels, protest the use of trees to make this horrible monstrosity of human imagination put into words. I can't even imagine how Hawthorne lived with himself after writing this.During the weeks I read this, I experienced the only mood-swings I've EVER had. There's both a correlation AND a causation going on here. This is the literary equivalent of \\"Crazy Frog\\"; it sounds like crap, and only insane people like it. This is not a book you read for fun. If you have read every book on your shelf/Kindle, don't even get this book for FREE. Buy something comical by an author who is underrated (I personally recommend 'John and the King' by Liam McMahon) and don't waste precious memory on this horror. This is the kind of book you read when a scary man with a big axe stands over you and says \\"If you don't read something within ten seconds, it's curtains for you,\\" and even then you look for something different.In the end, the only redeemable fact about this book is, if you order it paperback, then you're going to have a LOT of fun destroying it.BTW: here's the book I recommendJohn and the King (The Incredible Adventures of John)"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This book was in excellent condition for the price.

It gets dragged out and is suppose to be realistic. Then he throws Pearl in there, she is like some super-human and belongs in fantasy. I never really did believe in the whole 'they completely ostracized her but let her stitch everything.' That is just a bit hypocritical, either she was excepted as prat of the society *which she was not) or she wasn't (which she almost was. See that just doesn't make any sense.

The Scarlet Letter is not to be (nor is it possible to be) read lightly; it is actually, in the way of many 19th-century classic novels, quite painful to read. I loved it, and I still trudged through it.The subject matter, infinitely grim and distasteful, is not enjoyable in any way. It centers on the nature of morality, sin, corruption, hypocrisy especially concerning morality, and all that hackneyed bag of themes. You probably already know the general plot of the novel, so I need not reiterate it. Ironically, while criticizing the hypocrisy and sternness of the Puritans, Hawthorne seems very puritannical himself, and displays those same characteristics, including a kind of absurd self-righteousness and a pompous, austere, rigid, very Christian sense of morality. I got endless irony out of this; it seemed as though he, as the narrator, was condemning the Puritans for their harsh, hypocritical actions while endorsing Puritan principles and expressing views just as severe and ridiculously religious, if not more so, than theirs. I have to warn you that it's pretty disgusting the way he is wholly obsessed with the ideas of sin and guilt. Honestly, I think all he wrote about in his lifetime were Puritans, morality, sin and how we are all horrible sinners, etc. I imagine he could have been a fire-and-brimstone-preaching evangelist if he hadn't chosen the path of literary genius instead. And yes, despite all this, he is still a literary genius.What makes this such a wonderful piece of classic literature, and one of my favorites, is how beautiful, eloquent, gorgeous, and sophisticated the language is. Rarely have I seen such an astounding mastery of the English language and literary devices, with perfect fluency and coherence, depth, insight, passion, intensity, and power of expression. Of course, I'm sure the style of prose is not for everyone; but I find it remarkable, magnificent, admirable. I loved the rampant symbolism, the ingenuity of little metaphors found everywhere. I loved the character Pearl, who is so strange and otherwordly and complex. Dimmesdale is, well, so very pathetic; he is the epitome of the once-righteous-now-fallen, guilt-torn, utterly miserable, wretched, squirming, feeble, tortured soul, and his abject, wallowing despair adds to the overall gloomy and tormenting atmosphere of the novel.I know I ranted quite a bit in this review, but honestly, it's a superb work and triumph of English-language literature, and you should at least be able to appreciate it to some degree, in some aspects, and concede its exceptional use of language. I have a feeling that a lot of the reviewers expressing negative opinions are malcontent high school students grumbling about a \\"stupid, boring book\\" assigned to them for class. I myself had to read it for my junior-year English class, but I am very glad I was forced to do so.For those whining about how \\"verbose\\" it is - please get over your own short attention span or lack of taste or whatever it is that impedes you from recognizing and appreciating good literature. An example of verbosity is: \\"I waded along the flooded bank of the river that had overflowed its banks and along which I now waded in flood water,\\" not a sentence of graceful structure and expressiveness like (randomly selecting): \\"Continually, indeed, as it stole onward, the streamlet kept up a babble, kind, quiet, soothing, but melancholy, like the voice of a young child that was spending its infancy without playfulness, and knew not how to be merry among sad acquaintances and events of sombre hue.\\""},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"200-300 worddI really liked this book because of Hester.

The way in which Hawthorne captures the shame that Hetser , the wearer of the scarlet letter, feels everyday and the utter torment that the weak Dimmesdale is in by not coming forth and saying he slept with Hester and the revenge ridden character of Chillingworth is spectactular.The way in which Hawthorne describes the setting and the actions that characters do is truly outstanding. Hawthorne has a huge flare for the dramatic which is great for the reader. Since Hester the main character concieved her daughter Pearl through an affair she has been snetenced to wear the scarlet A on her chest for the rest of her life. The story starts on the day Hester is to stand infront of the town and wear her badge of shame and all the drama in the small puritanical town of Boston starts from there.

This simply means that a life of love builds plentiful character & is joyous in the end, no matter the hardships, & that such a thing constitutes a revelation. Also, I've never quite used the kindle dictionary the way I used it while reading this book.The plot isn't all that magnetic but the writing brings out many flavours of the puritanical life in Boston around the 17th century. The character development, except perhaps that of Roger Chillingworth, is first rate. Its brash historicity, according to me, is a wonderful thing & matters your learn about the society at the time are very insightful. Since romance underpins the themes of sin, guilt, revenge, & the psychological implications of these primeval human emotions, I'd have to say that the plot is more dramatic than you might expect at times - but this could be an aspect of my own sensibilities than that of the novel.Its a good work to read, so I'd recommend pressing on with the page long sentences & phrase long words.@souvikstweets"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This is a review for not the novel itself but the various Franklin Library editions available.The Franklin Library issued a number of different editions of the Scarlet Letter.

Through his extensive use of lengthy diction, Hawthorne examines how so-called \\"pious\\" people immediately close their minds when faced with the \\"devil's work.\\" Hester Prynne, an average everyday Puritan woman, finds herself in a set of unforeseeable events as she is excluded from the rest of the town. Hester has given birth in a prison cell to a daughter named Pearl, whose father remains nameless. While Hester's previous husband was deemed dead, she found comfort in her romance with the town's minster Dimmesdale. The resulting child is forced to grow up apart from the rest of the children. She and her mother are now considered outsiders and Hester must wear a Scarlet-embroidered \\"A\\" upon her bosom. Dimmesdale, as the town's minster, is viewed by most as a man free of sin. By deceiving his followers with his hidden identity as Pearl's father, he maintains his high status in society. As public shame becomes an imminent part of Hester's life, Dimmesdale must face the burden of guilt as the love of his life is forced to endure such dreadful circumstances while he remains completely righteous in the eyes of the town.The Scarlet Letteris an excellent source of literature for students who are looking to enrich their curriculum with high-level diction. Hawthorne shows us how superficial impressions give us false portrayals of how life truly becomes as individuals in a \\"caring\\" society suddenly turn against one certain individuals in the moments of their greatest needs."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I too was a long-time fan of Dick Tracy ,who at age 18 got a copy of Celebrated Cases...for Christmas.

Money would be better spent on IDW Publishing of \\"The Complete Dick Tracy\\"."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"When people think of a \\"scarlet letter,\\" we immediate think of a person outwardly branded for something they have done. Credit Nathaniel Hawthorne's \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" for that -- it's an intense, impassioned (if slightly hammy) story of a strong-willed woman in Puritan New England, who is branded for her sins and her love for one weak man.In the mid-1600s, a passionate young woman named Hester Prynne has been accused of adultery -- she recently had a baby, even though her husband was abroad. Just as damning to the elders is the fact that she won't name baby Pearl's father. Even her estranged husband -- a cold-hearted older man calling himself Roger Chillingworth -- wants to know her lover's identity, but Hester steadfastly refuses to even hint at the man's identity.We learn early in the book that Pearl's dad is actually the local minister Arthur Dimmesdale, who is wracked with guilt, hallucinations and sickness because of his secret adultery. Chillingworth slowly deduces who his wife's lover was, and begins to scheme revenge on Dimmesdale. Will the former lovers manage to escape their guilt-ridden lives, or will they reveal the truth to everyone?It sounds like \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is JUST a story about guilt and sin, but it's also a story about love and steadfastness. Hester remains strong and kind throughout her life despite others' cruelty to her, and her love for Dimmesdale and Pearl is what gives her that strength. Chillingworth (symbolic name!) is a cuckold, but it's impossible to like him because of his lack of love -- he loves no one, and lives only for revenge.And at the same time, Hawthorne reminds us that goodness can overcome your past sins. Hester slowly overcomes the Puritans' loathing for her by simply being charitable, kind, helpful and loving, until eventually her sin is eclipsed by her virtues. On the flip side, Dimmesdale is annoying because of his weakness and cowardice -- I know he's supposed to be wracked with guilt, but he's so pathetic compared to Hester that it's just infuriating.Hawthorne's writing may take a little while for modern audiences to get used to. It's very 19th-century in style, with staid, slightly stuffy prose gilded with hauntingly poetic moments and intense passion (\\"Never, never!\\" whispered she. \\"What we did had a consecration of its own\\"). At times Hawthorne's story gets a little... hammy (such as Dimmesdale revealing his \\"A\\" burn scar), but the power of his story keeps this from getting silly.\\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is used to describe outward signs of guilt, but Hawthorne's novel is actually about strength and love, and how they can blot out misdeeds."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel HawthorneThe deep and controversial tale of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne, was first published in 1850 by the company Ticknor and Fields. From there it became more and more famous and made many people reflect on what is right or wrong. Nathaniel Hawthorne was born on July 4, 1804 in Salem, Massachusetts. After being laid off from his surveying occupation, in 1848, he wrote The Scarlet Letter in the free time that he then had. Unfortunately, he died at age 60, on May 19, 1864, due to failing health. Throughout his life, his mother, who was widowed, had an impact on his life. She made him realize that it was better to make something out of his life, rather than stay in solitude. Many of his life experiences, like this one, contributed to quite a few of his stories. The historical fiction book, The Scarlet Letter is no exception. While the interesting plot shows lessons, such as sinning, it also shows how, that although it may be bad, it's really up to you to choose the way to handle those mistakes. Although there are no illustrations, this tale is certainly not lacking in vivid descriptions and the play of emotions. It is a page turning tale of love, sin, guilt, and self respect.In the middle of the seventeenth century, in Boston, Massachusetts, the intriguing characters of The Scarlet Letter unfold their tale. The main character is Hester Prynne, who is a young woman originally from Europe, was sent ahead of her husband Roger Chillingworth to go to America. He was delayed a long time and while he was still in Europe, Hester had an affair with a man who is known as Arthur Dimmesdale. Together they had a child who Hester named Pearl. The moment that society heard news of the crime Hester had committed, they out casted her, looked down upon her, and shamed her for what she had done. Hester, who is inside a strong and loving woman, must endure the shame and guilt that she has put on herself. In the beginning she is ashamed of what she has done and wishes, more than anything, that she could provide better for her baby. Although, she is doubtful that she'll be able to endure herself, Hester proves she is willing to make the most out of things. By the end of the book, Hester comes to grips with herself and realizes throughout that she is a good mother and caregiver. Her husband Roger Chillingworth is a frightening man who attempts to take revenge on Dimmesdale. He torments Dimmesdale, who begins to develop a heart condition from his self torture and heavy emotions. Dimmesdale, too, has a burdened heart. Pearl is a mature little girl, who is caught in the middle of things. She is very intellectual and painfully is an outcast because of her mother's actions. She tries to help her mother stay strong, although she is aware of the red letter \\"A\\" on her mother's breast. The main characters create a triangle of dismay and emotional strain, which leads to a moving plot.The conflicts and plot of The Scarlet Letter are painful as a reader to hear about. Hester Prynne is sent to America before her husband Roger Chillingworth. While waiting for her husband to arrive, who ends up taking a long time, Hester has an affair with a man named Arthur Dimmesdale. Hester gets pregnant with a baby girl and when the town finds out, the leaders decide that as her punishment, she must display a red letter \\"A\\" on her chest indefinitely. Everyone in the town condemns her for her actions and they outcast her. While Hester takes all the ridicule for the sin she undeniably committed, her lover takes none, however he is slowly eating away inside because of his extreme guilt. Hester keeps the identity of her baby's father a secret, but soon her husband Roger Chillingworth gets the feeling that Dimmesdale is the dad. Chillingworth begins to torture Dimmesdale emotionally. Towards the end, Dimmesdale develops a heart condition and is fated to die. The feelings within the story, rise and fall, because of the difficult conflicts that must be faced.The theme of The Scarlett Letter is intertwined with the climax of the story. Throughout the majority of the book, every thing is a secret. You know that Hester has a husband, but for some time, it is unclear who it is. You also know that Hester Prynne had an affair and a child with some unknown lover. Over the chapters, you begin to get apprehensions of who might be the father and who is her husband. When you find out that the cold Roger Chillingworth is her husband, it is quite surprising. Although, when you find out that Arthur Dimmesdale is the father, it is even more astonishing. These are very exciting moments in the book leading up to the big climax, when Dimmesdale publically announces that he is the father of baby Pearl, who is Hester's baby as well. This climax corresponds with the theme of the book. I feel that the theme is about sin, and if you sin, then it is truly best to be honest about it. Dimmesdale took part in the crime that Hester also committed and while Hester had to publically admit to it, Dimmesdale didn't. He kept his secret sin to himself for a long time, when eventually it became too much for him to keep inside and he had to come clean about it. He felt better that he admitted to it, although it brought along some difficult problems. Inside, though, he felt as though it was needed. He couldn't see Hester suffer from the crime he equally committed. The climax teaches us a lesson about life because of the way in which characters admit to their mistakes.I personally found this book very interesting. I thought that the characters all had unique and specific characteristics that made the story more complicated. I loved how the plot was told in such a way that was able to keep secrets from the reader, yet give clues about who plays what role. That was my favorite part. It kept me turning the pages because I wanted to know how things would unravel and come together in the end. The ones who would enjoy this book the most would be people in their late teens or early adulthood. You can make comparisons to the way life is today and how it was then and it teaches valuable lessons about sinning. When I started this book, I was unsure about how it would be, since it was a hard read. The Scarlet Letter was written quite awhile ago, so some of the terminology is hard to grasp. I'm glad I read it though because it was a book that I could choose how deep I wanted to make it, which are the type books that hold my interest. Overall, I feel that this was a very good book, with an interesting topic, and I would suggest it to lots of people."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This is one of those novels that everyone feels they &quot;ought to read&quot; to be a well-read, educated reader. Well, that's certainly true. It can be dense, and it can also be a hard read-- Hawthorne's characters are not really &quot;likeable&quot; and we have to pay close attention to the language of the novel to really appreciate the richness that has earned this book a firm position in the &quot;literary canon.&quot; When I have taught this book to non-English majors, one of the most important pieces of advice I have given is, at first, skip the Custom House sketch in the first chapter-- then go back to it. It's unclear until you've read the whole thing why the Custom House sketch is there-- and since the chapter is there first, you don't get right into the &quot;meat&quot; of the story. This is what makes an awful lot of people put the book down. Skip that, and then you'll find an engaging story. (Do go back to the first chapter, though!)But the classic novel of betrayal, of sin and redemption and of society's focus not on 'people' but on 'behaviors' it considers wrong is definitely worth more than one reading.Also, the history behind the novel is important-- check out some of the history of Anne Hutchinson-- a real life &quot;Hester Prynne&quot; type... you'll learn that Hawthorne's imagination wasn't as fanciful as we'd like to think."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This novel is a very intriguing story about an attractive young woman living in a Puritan society, where she is put in compromising situations and must maneuver herself out of them. Hester Prynne (the captivating young puritan woman) has allowed herself to be put in one too many situations though, when she gets pregnant by a man other than her husband. This terrible sin caused the Puritan society to punish her for her sins against god and her husband. In doing so the community sentenced Hester to live the rest of her life wearing the letter \\"A\\" on the bosom of her dress. This entire scenario is described extremely well by Hawthorne, by using elaborate sentences with great descriptions, both of the people's opinions and of the scenery, to provide a very full and vivid picture in the mind of the reader. This story has great twists and surprises in it which draws the reader into the story, to where the reader feels as if they are actually in the society and watching how every one acts towards Hester and her daughter. Hawthorne uses advanced vocabulary to describe the settings, people, and the people's opinions. The descriptive sentences and complex vocabulary of this novel make it very attractive to any reader wishing to expand their vocabulary and even part of their history, by learning a little about how the Puritan society's belief system worked and how the society viewed people and their actions. Now granted all the information in this novel is not all factual however the reader gets a real feel of strict and moral the Puritans were during that time. This novel by far with its advanced vocabulary and wonderfully descriptive sentences is one of the best novels I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"&quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;Nathaniel HawthorneReviewer: Marion LaganaThe classic novel &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; by Nathaniel Hawthorne was written in the 1800's about a small Puritan town in New England--the town is now known as Boston. This was awhile before America was free from England. In this is town everyone knows everyone and their beliefs are all the same. nothing out of the ordinary happens until one Puritan girl, who has just moved to Boston a couple years past and has been waiting for her husband to join her, has a child with another man. This baffles the community to say the very least.The book goes on to tell about her pain; the pain of adultery and the pain of her other secrets that she has kept throughout the novel. The story brings you on a sad trip through one woman's pathetic and lonely life, from the loss of love and friends to being finally respected as a person and being &quot;able.&quot; I put quotes around able because in the book, the letter A turns from showing shame and a sin, into showing a womean who is able to do something despite what she has done.Although the book sometimes seems rather long, and there are things that you may feel are not neeed, or understand, you learn to enjoy it in the end, as well as understand it. It is a book that you will want to pick up and read again to understand it that much more. It's a touching book of forgiveness, hatred, love, and deceit."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"(...) I groaned when I heard that my AP English class would read The Scarlet Letter - it seemed so overused, out of date, and boring. Well, that's what I thought until I started reading. This is an amazing novel. The themes explored - sin, guilt, revenge, cowardice, bravery, compassion, intolerance - apply not to just Puritannical society, but also to today's. I questioned my own morality and integrity - what would I do if I was Hester Prynne, Arthur Dimmesdale, Roger Chillingworth, or a member of the Puritan community? Can a sinful act of passion be purged through repentance and self-sacrifice? Or is it forever damaging to accountability and integrity? This has become one of my favorite books - the ability to explore morality beyond surface characters is a stimulating experience."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I liked the book. It incorporated many different angles into a fairly short novel (its about 250 pages.) Despite what you might expect, and what some might tell you, it is not at all difficult to understand the book. Its language isn't so different from today's as to be unreadable, or need footnotes, such as Dickens and Shakespeare.As far as plot goes, it was very good; straightforward, yet not overly simple. Hawthorne also managed to sneak commentary about the Puritan lifestyle, especially regarding the view of &quot;sin.&quot; One of the book's flaws however, was its characters. The villain was relativly passive, yet he was portrayed as this horrible, detestable person. His victim, who was probably worse than his &quot;tormentor&quot; was portrayed as sympathetic. The &quot;bad guy&quot; was fairly unrealistic in his passiveness, as the victim was highly exaggerated in his suffering. The two come off as rather contrived. But, some more real characters, such as the daughter, serve to make up for this.Overall, this is a very good book. I'd recommend it for anyone interested in reading the classics, or who enjoys 19th century literature."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I enjoyed reading this novel, and learned a lot about thePuritan way of life in the colonies from it. It was verysad, but a good read."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I have had the displeasure of reading this book twice so far in high school. Before continuing with my actual review, I should note that I am a little weary of romance novels in general. First of all, anyone eager to read this book for its romantic theme, forget it! In the modern sense, this is not in anyway associated with romance or (for the most part)love. In reality, this book is more about Christian motives, betrayal, and depression. I cannot nor do I wish to reveal anything specific about the plot, yet let me emphasize that this novel centers more around hate and contempt than love. Although I despise stories with a lustful or romantic appeal, I would have been far better satisfied had that been the case of this novel. Don't misinterpret me, Hawthorne is a terrific and classical writer, but this novel IS NOT CLASSICAL! Having read some of his other works, I must say how uncharacteristic this novel is of him.It does have its merits, however; it is full of imagery and symbolism that can greatly improve a reader's reading and writing skills, but so do a lot of other &quot;real&quot; classics.I'm not trying to hammer this book into the ground, I'm just being as objectively honest as I can. The truth is that this novel is very tedious and deep (as are all of Hawthorne's works), yet unlike is better works, there is virtually no action or interesting plots to the story. I can't put it any better than to say that it is just plain, old-fashioned BORING. I like to think I have an open mind, but you sit down to read this book and you get through the first chapter (if you get through it) and then through the rest until the end; and then it's like &quot;it took 250 pages to tell a one-paragraph story?&quot; Not to reveal anything, but the ending is a terrible let down, though not at all shocking either.Although I didn't like this book, it has its merits; and if you are thinking about reading it yourself, do yourself a favor and get a short synopsis of the book and really see if it's something you wish endeavor into. E-mail me freely if you have questions."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"One would expect a novel written in the 19th century about the subject of adultery, penitence, conscience, and puritanism to resonate far less with the modern reader than this one does. Granted, the language is somewhat stilted to a modern ear, but not nearly as much so as most of its contemporaries, and while the characters are made to suffer for their &quot;sin&quot;, it is clear that Hawthorne feels that the punishment far exceeds what is just. The novel is more a condemnation of the sort of society that the Puritans were, rather than a condemnation of Hester Prynne. And while her paramour is not a very sympathetic character, it isn't because of his part in the &quot;sin&quot;, but rather because he's coward and hypocrite enough to allow her to bear the full brunt of the punishment, while keeping his own good name and reputation intact, up until the moment of his impending death.All in all, a surprisingly good read, and a very worthwhile book to discuss; there are many concepts involved which are capable of being seen in more than one light."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter is an interesting book. While reading the book I was filled with many feelings about it. I enjoyed some chapters, but loathed the ones describing the characters. I felt as if Hawthorne could have told the story more efficiently if he had described each character as they came onto the scene. The book made me feel inferior and uneducated. I made so many trips to get the dictionary that my legs got tired. I enjoyed the general story-line, but I could have left the adjectives behind. Pearl was my favorite character because she had a priceless intuition that helped me read the book. I would have been lost without Pearl's hints. I would not have read this book if not required to by my English teacher. Attack it if you dare!!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"the scarlet letter has been sitting on my bookshelf for about 2yrs now so earlier this summer I decided Imight as well read it since it was considered a classic and all. It was a pretty good book overall but definitely nothing like the movie. I hate to say it but, I suffered through this book. It was one of the most boring books I've ever read in my life. But, after I finished it and thought about it a while I decided it really was a good story eventhough the book itself wasslow. But then again I read the unabridged version."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Just look at a portrait of him as a young man, note the noble brow, the handsome features, the sensitivity, how romantic......... Curl up with this book and let Nathaniel tell you his tale in his beautiful poetic language . This is a book to be read quietly, alone, not in an airport lounge or on the subway, but preferably in a beautiful garden or sunroom with the windows open. Let the beauty of his language flow over you and transport you back in time.It is over 200 years since Nathaniel Hawthorne was born in Salem Massachusetts, his great great grandfather officiated at the Salem Witch Trials. He was both disturbed and intrigued by his ancestry. One day when working at The Custom House in Salem to make ends meet as a struggling young author, he discovered in one of the upstairs rooms some dusty old boxes, on opening them he found them to contain relics from the past, long since forgotten. Yellowing documents and an intriguing piece of embroidery, a scrap of faded and torn material with the letter A embroidered on it. He picked it up, and while wondering what it was, he held it up to his chest, and at that moment he claims to have felt a burning sensation which caused him to drop the piece of cloth. It gave him inspiration for this story along with documents he found about a woman called Hester Prynne.The scene he sets so vividly is somewhere around 350 years ago 150 years before he was born. In a time when behavior to which we can hardly be bothered to raise an eyebrow was in that day considered a punishable sin. A disgrace for life. Branded by having to wear a scarlet letter on the chest for all to see.It is a feminist novel, (Nathaniel Hawthorne supported women's rights). Briefly, the protagonist Hester Prynne has a child from an adulterous relationship and refuses to name the father. Her husband a physician much older than she has never been a \\"proper\\" husband to her so she had looked elsewhere for love. The husband vows to find the father of the child, and in exchange for her freedom makes Hester swear she will never disclose who her husband is. Her husband being a physician quickly deduces who the father is from the way he is wasting away under his burden of guilt. He sets about a long period of torment of the young man of which Hester is aware but can say nothing because of her promise. Finally she has had enough and decides to come clean, shaming the devil, (her husband) and redeeming the young man. I do not want to spoil anything by divulging the name of the father of the child in case you do not know.This is such a simple and brief account it would make Nathaniel wince to read it. There is so much more to the story. It states in the blurb that it is a psychological novel before there was a science called psychology. The way the characters in the story interact with each other, the symbolism, the different values of the day from Nathaniel's day, and then again to this day. The religious aspect in Puritan times, the emotional ups and downs as you empathize with first one and then another of the characters. It is a wonderful story and well deserving of its position as one of America's great classics."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I just finished The Scarlet Letter in school. Hawthorne does an excellent job of describing every nuance of this story, and that is why at times it is a little hard to follow. But the very heart of the story is one that we all can compare with. Hester Prynne has committed a terrible sin, and bears The Scarlet Letter on her breast. This classic tale begins with Hester on the gallows platform, alone with her baby, Pearl. Throughout the course of thise novel, Hawthorne weaves his way through characters so that you feel you are a part of this story, and by the end you have no doubts in your mind how you feel about each character. This is a book that you will either love or hate, and it really depends on when you read it. Try to take your time through the book the first time you read it, then everything will make much more sense, and you won't throw down the book in disgust. On a side note, you can really skip the introduction chapter entitled &quot;The Custom House&quot; because it has little to do with the rest of the book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Hawthorne's novel of sin and the quest for utopia is sublime. The language is rich, and the novel is filled with religious symbolism. No work of American literature quite captures America's search for 'the Holy Land' while showing the affect that such a myopic quest can have on the individual. Hawthorne, while roundly criticizing the more zealous of his faith, never leaves us wondering whether or not forgiveness is possible for the penitent. Through the strength of the lead character, Hester Prynne, the author conveys to us the power of love that exudes those of us who have recognized our own faults and worked to heal the wounds our ill deeds have caused. This book is a must read for anyone who is interested in American literature."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"\\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is one of those books you start out reading because you had to finish it for a class assignment; or because you never got around to reading it in school but you feel you should because it's a so-called \\"classic\\", and end up getting hooked and realizing it's a classic for a good reason: it's a timeless story that resonates as much in our own time as when it was written, centuries ago. At the center of the book is Hester Prynne, a young wife in puritan New England, trapped in a loveless marriage with a man old enough to be her father, sent ahead of him to the new world while he takes care of business in the old. But before he can join her, she falls in love and into an affair, and nine months later, the result is born for all to see. In colonial New England, where religion controls every aspect of everyone's life, Hester and her lover have committed a horrendous crime, never mind a sin, for which they could both be executed; the powers that be feel they are being lenient with her by condemning her to wear a scarlet letter A, for adultery, prominently displayed on her clothes. Hester shocks the whole village by embroidering the scarlet letter with gold thread and wearing it like a badge of honor. Is this her way of spitting into the eye of the village, or is she making her public dishonor deliberately more shameful as a penance?And who is Hester's lover? The village demands he show himself; Hester, out of pity, love, or contempt, or more probably a mixture of all three, isn't saying. We know early on it's the reverend Dimmesdale, a young preacher beloved and respected by all, but if he doesn't have the courage to come forth himself, Hester will keep his secret. The story isn't a whodunit, who done it is obvious almost from the beginning. The book is about love vs. lust, courage vs. cowardice, and the hypocrisy of public piety covering up a shameful secret. Reverend Dimmesdale can flagellate himself all he wants in private; we can't help but feel contempt for him for not having the guts to share Hester's public humiliation.But as bad as things are for Hester and Dimmesdale, they are about to get infinitely worse with the appearance of Hester's husband, Roger Chillingsworth, who arrives in the new world to find he has been cuckolded by his wife, who has given birth to another man's child, and wants his honor avenged.Hawthorne tells a compelling tale which captures our imagination as much as it did when it was written. We realize these star-crossed lovers don't stand a chance in the uptight society they lived in. The book moves slowly, but in doing so it gives the reader time to think about the timeless issues of love, betrayal, deception, and the social mores that controlled the protagonists lives. Hawthorne raised plenty of questions; the readers will find their own answers."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I clearly remember when this was first published. I snapped it up and devoured it. This was the first time I had ever had access to these legendary pre-1950s Dick Tracy comic strips, and I kept hoping that more books like this would come. As it turned out, one did follow a decade later, covering the first two years of Dick Tracy (The Thirties, etc.), but none followed that one until the current comprehensive series of books. I'm now going on age 65, and I guess it was worth the wait, but boy! That was some wait!There has always been a real downside with this book, and now that the complete strips are being published, this book is definitely obsolete. That downside is the fact that none of the Sunday strips is included in it. Therefore, there are major continuity gaps in the story, with the reader feeling frustrated about missing something every six strips. In fact, some of the stories end prematurely, e.g. The Brow appears to be heading off to jail in this book, whereas his real end comes when he becomes impaled on a flagpole (American flag flying from it -- very symbolic and graphic!). It's nice that the daily strips about The Blank have been colored in this edition, but once again lack of continuity ruins it for me.My suggestion is to buy the current series of the complete strips and forget this relic. Starting with the upcoming Volume 7, the very best of the Dick Tracy strips will be published. These editions suffer from lack of color and small images for the Sunday strips, but they are complete!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"\\"All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,\\" might well be Nathaniel Hawthorne's theme in The Scarlet Letter. Certainly, by all community standards Hester Prynne's adultery is a sin. Worse yet Arthur Dimmesdale has triply sinned since he has had carnal knowledge of a member of his flock, and through a deep and abiding cowardice has failed to acknowledge his sin; and what is even worse yet, he allows Hester to bear the weight of public condemnation alone.However the worse sin of all belongs to Roger Chillingworth, Hester's husband who is not dead at all, but returned in disguise as a physician who has learned the efficacy of various medicinal concoctions from the Indians during his captivity. He pretends to befriend Dimmesdale in order to extract his long and torturous revenge. But it is Chillingworth's character itself more than anything that marks him as the worse of the sinners. He lives only for revenge and to give pain and suffering. He cares nothing for his wife and her child. He cares nothing for anyone, not even himself. He lives only to avenge.Dimmesdale's sin is that of a weak character. In a sense Dimmesdale is Everyman, the non-heroic. We see the contrast between the proud bravery of Hester and the all too human weakness of Dimmesdale who cannot bring himself to confess his sin, but looks to her strength to do it for him. We see this in the first scaffold scene as he pleads along with Chillingworth for Hester to reveal the father's identity. \\"Reveal it yourself!\\" we want to say.While some have seen Chillingworth as the devil incarnate--and indeed I suspect that was Hawthorne's intent--it might be closer to the truth to see him as the vengeful God of the Old Testament with his lust to mysterious power and his desire to see the sinful suffer. At any rate, Hawthorne's masterpiece--and it is a masterpiece, one of the pillars of American literature, to be ranked with such great works as Melville's Moby-Dick and Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn--is about sin and the effect of sin; and this is only right since the central tenet of Christianity itself is sin and the forgiveness of sin.By employing and investigating deeply three types of sin--Hester's from love and even something close to innocence; Dimmesdale's from lust, pride, neglect and cowardice; and Chillingworth's from hate--Hawthorne came up with a most felicitous device for examining the human soul.The Scarlet Letter is regularly taught at the high school level, but surely this is a mistake. The novel is difficult and challenging even for honors students. The architectured sentences, with their points and counterpoints, their parallel construction, their old school rhetorical cadences are strange and even wondrous to the modern eye. It is a good practice for the teacher and for the student to read aloud Hawthorne's prose so as to grow accustomed to his words the way one must for Shakespeare. If this is done and the edifice of Christianity and especially the fatalism of the Puritan mind brought to bear, then with leisurely pace and a steady concentration, the terrible beauty of Hawthorne's novel might be made immediate.Although the story itself is compelling, and the prose rich and poetic, the real strength of this great novel is in its characters. How true to life are all of them including even little Pearl who is defiant and willful in her beauty and her promise, so like a heroine-to-be of a modern novel. And how despicable and loathsome is this bent old man who embodies the very soul of the despised! And how attractive on a superficial level is this pretty young pastor whose actions are not the equal of his looks. And how strong and faithful and heroic is Hester who invites both envy and admiration, something like a flawed goddess of yore.What stuck me when I first read this, and remains with me today, is that it is those who presume to punish sin who are the real sinners. Chillingworth's life is one devoid of human feeling, devoid of any real joy as he lies in the stone cold bed of hatred and revenge. And to a lesser extent so it is with Dimmesdale who cannot forgive himself, who secretly flagellates himself so that his life becomes a hell on earth. On the other hand there is Hester who finds forgiveness and love with good works and in the joy of her beautiful and precious Pearl and in her unstinting love for Dimmesdale and her hope and faith that a better life will come.This is a deeply Christian novel although it is usually seen as a criticism of Christianity in the sense that the Christian community condemns the least of the sinners while the hypocrisy of its clergy is made manifest. Looking deeper we see that it is forgiveness of sin and the redemption that comes from good works that is exemplified. Hester knows the joy of life because she is a loving and giving person; and on another level she is forgiven because we the reader forgive her. How could we not? And most of the Puritan flock also forgave her since it came to be said that the scarlet \\"A\\" she wore upon her person stood not for \\"Adultery\\" but for \\"Able.\\"It is also good to realize that when Hawthorne published the novel in 1850 the scene of the story was nearly two hundred years removed. Thus Hawthorne looked back at Puritan America from the standpoint of a more secular society greatly influenced by Jeffersonian deism and the transcendentalism of Emerson and Thoreau. In some respects, Hawthorne's brilliant treatment of the ageless theme of sin, guilt and redemption was a serendipitous, even unconscious, artifact of his literary skill. No artist composes a masterpiece without some deep talent at work independent of his conscious efforts."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"A story about the eternals: passion and love, compassion and hate, hope and fear, forgiveness and revenge, strength and weakness all qualites of the human heart, set in Puritan times, times not known for its love,grace and forgivness, for its humanity.Much like \\"Les Miserables,\\" a story of grace set against a story of the unforgiving law with a strong element of revenge. This one also pulls at the human heart. After all these years, the reader still mourns the tragedy, the grief, the unnecessary senselessness of it all.Features a heralded but weak man of the cloth, a good hearted but strong woman and a villan, a villan equal to any in literature, even Shakespeare's Iago.Action and emotion are riveting and strong, but writing style and word usage, products of the time in which it was written, slow down the read at times. It doesn't matter. A good, good book, a great book, a classic that has withstood the test of time, one for the ages. The \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" of its time."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The novel has been in the household since I was a child. At some point I undertook to read it, though my mother wisely suggested I wait a while. I did not and got puzzled what the letter A stood for. Oh, adultery, what's that? A boyhood friend explained. I read it again in my late teens and appreciated it. Today, at age 77, I finished it again with tears in my eyes. The human qualities surmount the brittleness of Puritan Boston and still impress me. Hawthorne's ambivalence about his ancestral Puritanism (which caused him to change the spelling of his last name)comes out powerfully.High school readers, many of them at least, should put it aside until they grow up a bit. Reading Amazon reviews evokes moments of cynicism when I want to suggest that high school students should be banned from reading serious books, such as this one, which hasn't got a single car chase in it, but then I note that there are perceptive reviews by high school readers and clueless reviews by adults who have technically reached the age of maturity."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"On the positive side, the story is O.K. (the plot hangs together structurally) and the language is rich and flowing (if not repetitive; witness the clumsy word &quot;ignominy&quot; and its variants). On the negative side, I have the following criticisms:(1) The narrative style is uninvolving. The best writers SHOW their readers what is happening; mediocre writers TELL their readers what is happening; and, bad writers feel they must explain what they are telling their readers. Hawthorne, in this novel, falls in the mediocre category for the most part. A good writer tells a good story; a great writer makes you feel as if you are there as the story unfolds.(2) The settings are sketchy. I was not able to reconstruct the layout of the town, its situation with respect to the forest, or even the precise location of the main buildings (the church, Hester's house, etc.). I kept contrasting this element of Hawthorne's style (unfavorably) with Austen, Proust, Nabokov, Tolstoy, Flaubert, Melville, Robbe-Grillet, etc.---with these great writers, I become so familiar with the settings that I feel as though I grew up in their make-believe worlds where everything seems to be one of a kind. In The Scarlet Letter, the settings are seemingly taken off the shelf.(3) The story and its characters are one-dimensional. Virtually every single scene (covering about seven years in the story) concerns the scarlet letter and its impact on the main characters (it's like watching a prize fight where the boxers only jab---tedious!). While the primary characters are fuzzy and ill-defined, the secondary characters are all but nonexistent; we are told what impact they have on the main characters, but rarely allowed to witness the specific actions of the supporting characters so that we can appraise their influence for ourselves. In other words, the character development stinks.(4) Finally, the symbolism is abstract and obvious. The silly &quot;forest=freedom&quot;/ &quot;town=oppression&quot; school of symbolism always annoys me. In the best novels, the words (after all, that is what literature is about) pull double duty: they inform and evoke. Great writers use all of the various qualities of words (rhythm, tone, secondary connotations, etc.) to create mood and imagery, allowing the attentive and imaginative reader to sense the story. Bush-league scribblers use only the literal meanings of words, devising dreary word-equations (abstract, or literal, symbols) to manufacture connections when their artistic talent comes up short.I know my less than enthusiatic review may be further evidence of the &quot;dumbing of America&quot;. But, I like dumb people more than I like middlebrow parrots, with their enthusiastic but empty cheerleading, hand-me-down sensibilities, and tiresome blather. You go!...and take this book with you!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Set in seventeenth-century Puritan New England, Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter is the story of an adulteress, Hester Prynne, and her struggle to maintain a functioning relationship within the Puritan orthodox community she lives in. She must cope with the wild nature of her imp-like daughter, a physically and emotionally twisted husband, and the adulterer, Reverend Dimmesdale, who remains unknown as Hester's lover and the father of her child until late in the novel.After giving birth to a daughter she names Pearl , Hester is punished with the scarlet letter \\"A\\" which she must wear on her breast and marks her as an adulteress. The shame she bears is immense. The village looks upon her with scorn and ridicule. Her husband, Roger Chillingsworth, whom Hester had presumed dead at sea, sent her to Salem, Massachusetts two years previously to await his later arrival, but sent no word after. He appears unexpectedly as she is being publicly displayed upon the scaffolding in front of the church, which serves as a punishment for criminals. He sees this public humiliation and is enraged. He sets out to find her lover and get revenge...Hester must deal with her husband's evil nature and with her own daughter, who's erratic behavior doesn't improve the village's view of her.The scarlet letter is a symbol for the shame which Hester Prynne is burdened with. As a confessed adulteress she deals daily with public humiliation while the Reverend Dimmesdale is left to bear the shame inside his heart, shut away in the confines of his lodgings, living out each day as a lie. Hester is depicted as being strong, self-reliant and courageous in contrast to Reverend Dimmesdale who is weak and guilt ridden. He is a hypocrite, a man of God , living a lie.Hester's suffering is easier to bear than Dimmesdale's. She is hardened , refined, made almost heroic by her punishment and all the ordeals it brings with it. Dimmesdale is irreparably broken apart, suffering his own judgment, living in a daily personal hell. I was impressed by how Hawthorne managed to convey so many truths about contemporary society in general by focusing on one incident in Salem Massachusetts that transpired a hundred years in the past. I would recommend The Scarlet Letter to anybody who is willing to face the character of human beings that remain unchanged throughout time. The truths about evil, lies, love, beauty, courage and the heroism of the human spirit which can not only survive, but endure for generations."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I had a friend who used this for one of her dissertations. If you're one who enjoys classic literature then there are few works that top this book. The symbolism of this relatively short novel gives Hawthorne the ability to write a story with an incredible amount of depth. One of my favorite things about Hawthorne is his focus on characters. The development of all the key characters is simply amazing! Grief and religious zeal are obviously major conflicts and themes in the work, but that's just barely scratching the surface. This is just one of those books that you can take so much out of and still find that there is more to learn about it.I'll warn you now, if you haven't already read this book, this is not for everyone. Hawthorne writes pretty densely, and so if you're not one who enjoys that style then look for a different book. He is known for creating very vivid scenes and part of that means that he spends a large amount of time describing the setting. If you don't mind to reading about what the room looked like or Hester's prowess with a needle then you'll find that Hawthorne weaves a lot of symbolism in with those descriptions.There is so much to say about this book that I don't know where to begin or end. It is a great work done in the spirit of early American movement of transcendentalism. Nature is a major component of this work while the corrupting tendency of society is demonstrated through the near-fanaticism of early American religious communities. THE SCARLET LETTER is a brilliant and powerful work. There are very few authors who are as capable of developing characters as believably, or effectively for that matter, as Hawthorne does and this work is his masterpiece in regard to character development. If you're interested in reading classic literature and don't mind that such books tend to be dense then this is a must read. There are so many layers to the book but the story line still maintains an extremely exciting structure. The last few chapters are simply brilliant in regard to power and emotion that they bring to the plot. This is a classic for a reason!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I was quite pleased with the condition of this book, as well as it's hardcover, and the footnotes, definitions, and reading reviews for beginner readers of the genre. I am, of course, a huge fan of the Scarlet Letter itself and this copy served its purpose well. One of the few disappointments was that the color of the cover seems to look a little more coral, or pink, than scarlet or red. Also, the back cover is white, and I am most definitely one for appearances. I would have like a slightly more classic looking cover. Nonetheless, the binding will look fair on my bookshelf. Over all the book was clean and well taken care of, and was shipped to me with great haste; A Good Buy."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I have no less than fifty books literally waiting on the shelf in my bedroom for me to read them. Sometimes when I'm in the middle of a less-than-fantastic book for a review, I look longingly at that shelf and then hurry myself along (I'm also a one-at-a-time kind of girl). So, when I finished the book last week and needed something to read, it shouldn't have been hard to pick something. I surprised myself by reaching for my Nathaniel Hawthorne collection and opening up to The Scarlet Letter.I read (or skimmed) The Scarlet Letter in high school. B-O-R-I-N-G! After I fell in love with The Peabody Sisters (which I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys biographies and literature) several years ago, I was anxious to try some more Hawthorne (he was married to the youngest Peabody sister). I started The House of the Seven Gables but put it aside when I just couldn't get into it after fifty pages. Even though I really really wanted to like Hawthorne, I figured it was hopeless.Perhaps I just wasn't ready or mature enough then. I devoured The Scarlet Letter this time. I was enthralled and fascinated with the story, themes and the beautiful language (makes reading most novels now seem like fifth grade work). I almost wish I was back in high school college so that I could discuss it with a group. I definitely have some ideas to contribute this time. And I apologize to my mom's friends--I shouldn't have laughed when I heard you were reading it for book club.It just goes to show, that some books are worth another try."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I, too, read the Scarlet Letter in high school because it was part of the curriculum, but I have to say, from the very start, this has been one of my favorite books. The subject matter is deep for its time, I doubt too many books were written about the topics of sex and adultery in the mid 1800s! Hawthorne was ahead of his time. But adultery and lust are not the only sins on display here. Greed, vengenence, jealousy, hypocricy, shame and guilt are all touched on in great detail. I always thought this was a brave choice for the curriculum of my all-girl Catholic high school honors English class! The class was not taught by a nun, thank goodness, and it most likely would not have been, given the subject matter. We were uncomfortable enough to have our male English teacher address the topics of this book! All that aside, though, the book is a timeless classic and I hope that it is still on the high school curriculum reading lists across the country. It gives us all something to think about and it does teach us, indirectly perhaps, how to deal with the fall-out of our actions and choices. We are mere humans and the flesh is weak -- that's a given. How we deal with the consequences and the guilt determines our character and our destiny, as much, if not more so, than our acts themselves. To commit adultery like Hester, and OWN it, by admission (or accusation), is HONORABLE -- because Hester didn't cover it up or lie to save face for herself or her child. They both held their heads high, or learned to eventually, which is why they were able to live their lives. Hester's lover, however, hid behind his act -- lived in shame and tried desperately to cover up his (and Hester's) actions. This is the same as denial. He therefore denied Hester and their daughter. His outcome was not so good. And the Puritan community revealed their own dirty laundry in how they treated Hester and Pearl. Life lessons for us all -- I think the worst anyone could be is a hypocrit. Don't pretend to be something you're not. Hypocrits are among the worst of sinners. (and THAT can be found throughout the Bible! Sinners who admitted their sins and owned up to them were always saved. Those who hid behind their sin and acted self-righteously, were almost always condemned). There's a bit of Hester in all of us, no one is without sin. Hester had enough dignity to admit it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I bought this as a present for my dad and he really loves it. It shipped very quickly and I had no problems at all with the order."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This classic novel holds up extraordinarily well more than 150 years after it was written. A staple of middle school and high school reading lists, it carries lessons for both youth and adults, despite being premised on a notion that is completely foreign to our present culture, even the religious wing of the culture.The plot centers around Hester Prynne, a beautiful young woman who has a romance with an unknown man and becomes pregnant. Since this takes place in Puritan America, roughly the 1650s, in Salem, Mass., Hester is shunned by society. Physically, she is unharmed -- though author Nathaniel Hawthorne makes it clear that branding her or killing her would not have been out of the question at the time -- but she is made to wear an embroidered \\"A\\" on her clothing for the rest of her life. In a defiant move that few women would have dared, Hester refuses to name her lover before a public inquiry.Over the next seven years, Hester goes about her business as well as she can. She moves to a hut on the outskirts of the city; she suffers the scorn of preachers and townspeople; and she does not even seek any playmates for her daughter. Gradually, she earns respect from the citizens of the town for her remarkable embroidery skills, her willingness to accept her punishment without complaint, and her dedication to the poor and downtrodden.Meanwhile, Hester's husband -- to her shock and dismay -- arries in Salem. He was presumed to be lost at sea, and it was, presumably, why Hester had her romance with another man. Her husband swears her to secrecy, and he becomes a respected doctor in town. Quickly, he realizes that a brilliant young minister in town was the man who loved Hester -- and that minister is withering away from guilt. The doctor befriends the minister and becomes his physician, yet it is apparent that the doctor is really bent on torturing the doctor for his sin.Matters eventually come to a head. I won't reveal the outcome. But I will make a few observations about the lessons in the story.1. The idea that an affair would leave a person an outcast is hard to imagine in our culture. But, of course, homosexual affairs have ruined the careers of many religious and political leaders (those who made their marks with anti-gay rhetoric). And other countries and religions still punish adulterers viciously: see Iran, for example.2. While the book's premise takes some work for today's teens to understand, it delivers other lessons nonetheless. The first is that a secret, a betrayal has a strong emotional component. It hurts people, regardless of whether it is \\"right\\" or \\"wrong.\\" That's a lesson that all teens should learn as they start dating. Second, nobody is perfect. Though we don't learn about sins of other people in the town, Hawthorne makes it clear that there are other adulterers and sinners of other types. The third lesson is that a person who is wronged (the doctor) cannot use his hurt to then hurt others (the minister and Hester). Ultimately, the doctor is the least sympathetic figure in the book; and that's a remarkable perspective for Hawthorne to provide 150 years ago.3. The book feels contemporary because the narrator (Hawthorne) regularly interposes his comments that, to paraphrase, state, \\"In those old, unenlightened days, the following was done, but we have moved behond it today.\\" However, as savvy readers will note, there's more than a touch of sarcasm in Hawthorne's comment, as he is using the past to comment on the problems of contemporary society, too. And those problems are still with us, albeit in altered form.So, read the book. Work with the difficult language and compound sentences and lengthy allusions to how our appearance and the random events of nature reflect our inner emotions. Revel in the descriptions of dress, architecture, speech, and daily life that are so far from our own -- and yet, raise the same emotional issues that we face today."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Much to my amazement, this book has been placed on banned lists in several states. It's an excellent study of the devastation caused by guilt. Although the story does allude frequently to adultery, there are no graphic details that would make it unsuitable for use in a high school classroom. Both the illnesses caused by guilt and the good health of those who overcome it are made clear."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Is \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" worthy of being considered a classic? Why do some love it and some hate it? These are questions that played through my mind when I picked up this book. I'm a fan of some of Hawthorne's short stories--\\"Ethan Brand,\\" \\"The Bosom Serpent,\\" \\"Young Goodman Brown,\\" among others--but I found his novel, \\"The House of the Seven Gables,\\" long and plodding.Boy, was I in for a surprise!Yes, this book employs an antiquated style of English dialogue and sentence structure. True, the introductory chapter about the Custom-House can seem tedious. (And, if your edition comes with a modern introduction, please skip it till after you've read the book, since many of these misguided pages give away the book's key twists.) Once I got into the actual story, though, I was hooked. I took my time. I invested in each page, each paragraph, giving myself to the story of Hester Prynne, a woman whose child out of wedlock has revealed her adultery and subjected her with a lifetime of wearing a red A upon her chest, a fair warning to all, a constant reminder of her sin and shame.Hester faces her guilt and tries to amend her ways. Hester's husband, who was thought lost at sea, makes an anonymous appearance in the community, even as the man responsible for Hester's child tries to bear the weight of his own sin in secret--and begins to physically and emotionally wither beneath that burden.Despite Hester's reputation as a worthy seamstress, the town leaders want to take away her young daughter and give her to parents who will set a better example. Hester confronts the leaders head-on, feeling that her daughter is the one thing she has left to live for, and the one good thing that has come from her mistake. This issue becomes minor as her former husband sets into motion his own plans for revenge, and as her former lover faces the loss of his position and title, if not his very soul and breath, should his identity become known.This is a novel full of symbolism, dealing with the legalistic, harsh world of the Puritans, and the religious mindset that can become focused on shaping lives for God instead of letting God shape lives. It was written around the time of the Salem witch trials, a time when stocks and pillories were still in vogue. It is a world unfamiliar to most modern readers, particularly high school students forced to read this cumbersome style, but it shows stark parallels with the fundamentalism that still rules in much of our world today.Can sin be paid for by personal shame and humiliation? Can sin that remains hidden dissolve, or does it eventually come to light? What happens when family secrets become public? Even worse, what happens when they are buried?I loved this book, once I committed myself to enjoying its older style and prose. Hawthorne creates unforgettable characters in Hester, Pearl, Mr. Dimmesdale, and Mr. Chillingworth. He imbues his writing with a respect for faith, yet a disdain for the religious guises that often try to walk hand in hand with it. He shows great respect for women and their struggles, far ahead of his time. He challenges readers to move beyond the harsh judgments of others and look into our own souls. Who does not bear the stain of wrongdoing? Is it better to bring such things into the light, or to hide them in darkness and await the results? These are still timely issues in politics, church, and homes, issues that Hawthorne addresses with much courage considering his own setting and upbringing.Should this be considered a classic? Yes. Will most high school readers appreciate it? No. This is a story to be savored by those who will invest their time, as well as their mental and spiritual energy, to its ideas. If that's you, then you will come away richer for the experience. I certainly did."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"In seventeenth century Boston, scholar Roger Chillingworth returns to the Puritan colony after two years in England. He is stunned to find his much younger lovely wife Hester Prynne with an illegitimate daughter Pearl, a resident of Prison awaiting trial for adultery. Hester refuses to betray her lover for his condemnation for violating one the God's Commandments. Her punishment is to wear a capital Letter A on her breast for the rest of her life. Roger vows to expose the cretin who dishonored him. For refusing to reveal her lover's identity, she is condemned to wear a letter 'A' sewn onto her clothes. Driven to madness, Roger resolves to discover and destroy the man who has stolen his honor. Over the next few years, Hester does her best by her daughter while suffering poverty, humiliation and guilt for what she cannot offer her beloved Pearl; while the two men not in her life fail to cope with crippling guilt, remorse and cowardliness.As he did with another classic Jane Eyre, Wayne Josephson provides a modernization of the syntax of the language while adhering to Nathaniel Hawthorne's powerful moral message that rings true today with for instance the abortion controversy. Purists will insist if it isn't broke don't fix it, but Mr. Josephson makes a strong case that the 1850 published novel is going the way of the Canterbury Tales (let the purists read that in ye olde English). The re-touch is a bit more than desired, as part of the original is the overdrawn atmospheric background of a martinet paternal society invoking God's wrath. Still Mr. Josephson does a super job of making this great classic starring a brave heroine much easier to read and very entertaining while enhancing the strong message of forgiving oneself as well as others for \\"sins\\".Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne's famous book THE SCARLET LETTER has been transformed into cinematic versions both for television and for theaters, having been written about one of the first feminists in history! But how many have actually read the 288 page Hawthorne original? Few, likely, for as interesting and classic the story is, it is a bit inaccessible to the modern reader who finds Hawthorne's prose bogged down by interminable sentence structure and heavy paragraphs. Yes, there is charm in reading the original, basking in the old version of English verbiage, but many readers feel the bulk of the narrative burdensome, making the very original tale of a blighted female's courage a strain to discover.Enter Wayne Josephson who has taken the devotion to the classics and the drive to make the great novels once again part of every learned reader's library to heart and is in the process of editing the great books (his JANE EYRE is remarkably fine!). Here Josephson has gently removed the weighty verbiage that stops the eye and what results is an immensely readable, still atmospheric, 208 page version/condensation of Hawthorne's THE SCARLET LETTER. Now, without the unnecessarily redundant adjective and references too heavy to dissect, is a version of a novel that reads even better than the original - as though Nathaniel Hawthorne had submitted his manuscript to an editor of his times, this being the revision that results in publication for the public. This version is some eighty pages shorter than the original, a size that allows the reader to comfortable digest the book in one evening. That is the joy of reading Josephson's intelligent, sensitive editing: none of the pleasure of the novel is removed, but the story now flows smoothly and is far less stilted. Hopefully Wayne Josephson will continue his quest of resurfacing the great books. These versions should be attractive to all types (and ages) of readers. Highly recommended.

I couldn't get into the root of the story, but some people probably would like it"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This novel is an Opera, pure and simple.Granted it is not the easiest novel to read, and Hawthorne can be slightly repetitive with the metaphors, similes and analogies that sometimes go on for several lines. Not to mention you could probably read half of each chapter and still keep up with the plot.Nonetheless, the themes are so strong it is no wonder The Scarlett Letter has been deemed a classic. The story tackles the issues of how one deals with his/her sins, and how honesty, for some, comes at the price of great shame.The novel does take patience, but it moves along at a very neat pace. Had the novel been written with more scenes, and less exposition, it could have been even more gripping.I read the Reader's Digest edition, which comes with about 12 lovely illustrations, which capture the essence and the mood of the novel. So that was nice eye candy.Look out for the last three chapters - talk about a fall-to-the floor, clutching-at-the-heart climax; it's all here!

Then again, I've never really been a big fan of the classics. But I got bored way too easily, and I honestly thought the last thirty or forty pages were the best part."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Because a member of my book club chose The Scarlet Letter as her selection for the month, I reread this classic tale of love, heartache, loss, and the seamy side of human nature. Although I enjoyed Hawthorne's novel set in Puritan New England, I found much of the writing so dense that I had to read some of the passages twice, and while I have a fairly decent vocabulary, I'm glad I read the book on my Kindle Fire so that I could immediately find the definitions of words I didn't know.What I admired about the novel was Hawthorne's gift for telling a tale so masterfully and for his powers of description. Because of his powerful use of langague, I could see and feel the darkness of the forest, sense Hester's humiliation, feel Dimmesdale's guilt, and view the faces of the judgmental townspeople. Then there was little Pearl, a lovely little child often portrayed with sunshine around about her person. Even her name seemed symbolic to me. She was the pearl cast before swine (in the village) AND the pearl made beautiful by friction. Chillingsworth, the other major player, appeared evil from the first day he appeared at the scaffold.Throughout the book, I found myself wondering what Hawthorne would think about the world of today! Reverend Dimmesdale would be an anomaly in today's \\"love \`em and leave \`em\\" climate. Hester would be accepted rather than stigmatized, and she'd likely receive some sort of support, either from her \\"partner\\" or from the government, and she wouldn't have to live on the outskirts of town, ostracized by society. I rather enjoy thinking of Hester with an attitude!As a whole, my book club enjoyed The Scarlet Letter except for the extremely long chapter, \\"The Custom House.\\" The book generated much lively discussion, and all admired Hawthorne's plot and his depiction of life during that era. This review is based on a Kindle edition with pictures, something that added a lot to my enjoyment of the book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The book The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne was a interesting book. This book is a story about religious and other beliefs. The main women in this story whims name is Hester Prynne. She decides to move to America and start a new life, she is still stays married to her husband though. While she is living in America she has a child with another man. She has to attend trial because of it. After the trial she has to wear a scarlet letter A on all her clothing. Her real husband tries to seek revenge on her. Hester is pretty much hated by everyone so she has to teach herself and learn how to live her life and raise her baby alone. This book takes place in the 17th century during the Puritan time period. This is definitely a book filled with suspense. Some things can be a little boring but all in all a pretty great book. I would definitely recommend this book to people who are wanting to learn about things in the Puritan time. Also I would recommend this book to a mature audience. This book truly shows how people were treated dring this time period. It is a great book and everyone should read it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter is profound piece of literature, and the characters and imagery are beautifully written. Hawthorne takes the concept of morality and adultery and just descripts the struggles from the effected parties extremely well. The one thing that stood out most for me was just how well written all the characters were, you can't help to feel their pain and understand what they are going through.Hester Prynne, the bearer of the Scarlet \\"A\\" on her breast, her badge of shame. Branded for adultery for everyone to see, Hester still has a desire to redeem herself. She never reveals her lover's identity and for that she has been publically shamed.Her lover is a well respected member of the community (I won't reveal who it is just in case people aren't aware and don't want a spoiler). He is faced with carrying the burden of his sin in secret, always putting his hand over his heart, an expression of the pain that is dwelling up inside him. He lives with his sin until it all begins to unravel and he breaks.Roger Chillingworth is Hester's husband; ashamed of the betrayal, he had changed his name so no one would know. He takes up the role of the local doctor, in an attempt to find and get close to his enemy. He has asked Hester to keep his true identity a secret, while he searches for her lover and the father of Pearl.Pearl, Hester's daughter, known as the demon child, is a devilish by nature. I have the feeling that she is very aware of what's going on and knows who her father is, and she is just baiting them all to reveal the truth. I always thought of Pearl as the-demon-on-the-shoulder type character.Each character is simply amazing and with the judging townsfolk, the struggle feels so real and you can't help but feel for the characters.

The story always gave me reasons to think about were values originated. All faiths have a system and justification. Puritan outlook is still threaded in our American culture but diluted. I can't escape the mindful link to politics and the human condition. Politicians call for values and virtue in the name of handed down value systems that are humanly flawed and unsustainable. This classic piece will never fail to give one pause to reflect on the human condition ever present in individual values that can't be overlooked in a judgement process.

The unusual characters in the story are well described and I liked the writers attempt to portray a \\"fallen woman\\" in a sympathetic light - and with unusual strength. I appreciated it for the insights, but won't be recommending it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This is a wonderful classic. I recommend this to anyone. The scarlet letter is a great tale of love lost for fear of how others view them. The only judgement that should matter is that of God; he is m e merciful unlike man. The reverend and Hester are heroes because they were strong and understood why the things that happened to them happened. Although they came together towards the end,the child still suffered, and then again she gained a lot because of that silent love."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I had to read this for 10th grade English and it was very interesting.

Betrayal, adultery. It can't much better than that in a classic novel"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"In high schools around the country, The Scarlet Letter is a required novel for students toread. Some enjoy it, while many others dread the task of reading this ?classic Americannovel?. I can relate to many who have felt as though they would rather do anything butread this novel; I too was required to read The Scarlet Letter as a junior in high school.However, after having read through this intricate novel more than once, I believe thedread that many feel can easily be turned to fascination and interest, if this novel is readcorrectly and intuitively.Throughout The Scarlet Letter, a web of intricate plots and themes arises. In thebeginning of the novel, the reader is given a detailed description of the New Englandsetting in which the novel takes place. A series of contrasting images is provided, suchas the ?ponderous iron-work? of the prison door, and the ?wild rose bush...covered indelicate gems?. Although these images may become confusing to some, contrastingimages such as these offer insight into the characters that are described in the next fewchapters. Some of the major characters in this novel include Rodger Chillingworth, theReverend Dimsdale, and Hester Prynne. However, the protestant women described in thesecond chapter are quite frequently overlooked, yet play an integral role in theadvancement of the novel. These women are first seen waiting at the prison door forHester Prynne to exit, and are described as ?goodwives?. They are portrayed as a moredelicate and briefer beauty than their ancestors had. Characters like these women arecrucial to the advancement of the plot, but are too often overlooked. While majorcharacters are most often examined, minor characters can carry the plot in crucial ways.Utilizing complex and witty characters within the novel, such as the women by the prisondoor, adds depth to the themes, which is something Hawthorne is very good at doing.As the story line deepens, we find ourselves in the midst of a nineteenth centurylove triangle, between Hester Prynne, Dimsdale, and Chillingworth. Hester, who ismarried to Chillingworth, has had an affair with the Reverend Dimsdale. Because of thisaffair, she becomes pregnant with an illegitemate child. When the community uncoversthe sin she has comitted, she is forced to wear a scarlet letter ?A? on her breast. Whilemany believe and teach that the letter stands for ?adultry?, it can be argued that the ?A?stands for something other than this theme.When Hester leaves the prison, she is described in a completely different mannerthan the women who awaited her at the prison door. In the second chapter, Hester isdescribed as ?...tall, with a figure of perfect elegance, on large scale?, which is starklydifferent from the description of the other women. The ?A?, in this case, could mean?admirable?, or even ?American?, unlike ?adulteress?. I have not heard this optiondiscussed or even acknowledged; it is only insisted in high schools that the ?A? onlymeans one thing, even though it is never even stated what the ?A? stands for.One of the biggest misses in the high school teachings of this book is the absenceof the Custom House Essay in the course syllabus. In the Custom House Essay,Hawthorne lays the plans for the entire novel. He carefully describes the New Englandtown he grew up in, and offeres readers an inside look at the men who worked in thecustom house. While never stating his dislike for these men, Hawthorne uses ironicdescriptions of these men to give the reader a true depiction of the leaders of their time.The Custom House Essay also contains Hawthorne?s definition of a ?romance?, anddescribes for the reader how he created the novel. Hawthorne appeals to the readerssenses by using both fiction and truth in this preface to his novel. It sets the stage for therest of the book, and plays upon the idea that the ?A? on Hester Prynne?s chest couldstand for more than just an adulteress.One of the major downfalls to The Scarlet Letter is the language style used in thebook. At times, certain words can be hard to understand, and the language used todescribe the setting can slow down the reading of the novel. However, this is not thefault of either the writer or the reader, because this novel was written in nineteenthcentury America, which is quite different from the world we are living in now.One of the biggest problems a reader could surface from reading the novel is theunderrepresentation of women and minorities. While the novel is centered around awoman, she is not given a distinct voice in the story, nor is she represented by a woman.She is forced to live on the outside of town, and is forced to wear a letter ?A? on herchest. When confronted by her husband Chillingworth, she is not even given the choiceto acknowledge him as her husband. Instead, she is told by him that she should notreveal his identity to anyone.Not only are women underrepresented, but minorites as well. There is nomention of any African American people in the novel, yet they were quite present innineteenth century America. The only minority mentioned is the unnamed Indian, wholike Hester, lives on the outskirts of town.Although certain aspects of the novel can confuse and hinder the reader, TheScarlet Letter is a novel which transcends time and location. It has become a majorAmerican novel not just because it was written about American life, but because itsthemes question what it truly means to be an American. I highly recomend reading thisnovel, and stronly encourage readers to include the Custom House Essay in their reading.Whether it be the first time, or one hundredth, The Scarlet Letter carries themes whichremain prevelant throughout American literature."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I first read this book in college, and I have purchased it again to read. I think the book speaks volumes about society that was slow to be tolerant of differences and finds it easy to pile on when someone is ostracized. I found many parallels to today's society, where many people still exist who like to judge first and ask questions later. You will look at today's world with new eyes after reading this story crafted many years ago by one of America's best ever writers.Jeffrey McAndrewauthor of &quot;Our Brown-Eyed Boy&quot;"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Some people immediately dismiss the worth of this book by criticizing its seemingly clich&eacute; plot, centered around adultery and the guilt which follows. I say, Hawthorne's novel is not revolutionary or amazing in its subject, setting, or even characters, but rather in the way in which it unfolds. The story delves remarkably into the souls of several individuals in a New England Puritan town, gradually and ephemerally casting beams of soft light on new aspects of each's personalities and struggles. Each character is masterfully and magically revealed, and the tale strives for intimacy and understanding of each point of view in a complex circle of deceit and secrecy. I think it will be enjoyed by everyone who appreciates detailed and beautiful analysis of character, sentiment, thought, and human nature, but may not be ideal for those seeking constant action."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I came up to this book (a reading assignment for school) with a bit of dread, having heard that Hawthorne's writing could be hard to read. Actually, it was a delightful suprise to find it was a captivating plot, very well written, and very easy to read. I enjoyed it thoroughly. This book is about a woman who has an affair, choosing to bear the scarlet letter than reveal her lover's identity. Along side her is her ilegitamate daughter, a delightfully and hillariously strange character in the book. The scarlet letter is a good book having a melancholy but redeeming ending. A definate classic. Check it out... it'll be better than you expected."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"&quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; is about a young woman named Hester Prynne who has a child out of wedlock. Set in Puritan, Boston, the people shun Hester, especially when she refuses to divulge the name of the baby's father. Her punishment is to wear a scarlet A on her dresses, which is where the title comes from. This book is one of the first true romances written. The main character, Hester, is a very strong, very independent woman character. I think the book is an excellent romance and social defiance.The first appearance of romance shows up in chapter 3, when the stranger shows up in the market, asking why Hester was standing on the platform. A townsperson then spins Hester's tale: Of how her English husband had sent her to Boston before he himself moved, of how no word had been heard of the husband in the two years that she had been there, and how she had had a child. The man then asks who the baby's father is, and the good townsperson answers by saying that Hester refuses to give the name, but that the man is undoubtedly in the crowd. In the end, we discover that the father is really Arthur Dimmesdale, her preacher and the stranger is really her long-lost husband. All throughout the book, this romantic triangle comes to play, giving this book depth and character as one of the first true romances.It is also a story of social defiance. The first instance of this is in chapter 2, when she walks out of the prison. Instead of being humble and meek, as the townspeople had expected, she holds her head up high and refuses to avert her eyes. All during the book, she wears her mark of shame with pride. In the end, the A no longer stands for adultress, but angel. She refuses to be beaten down, and this is such a strong statement. In those days, women were expected to be meek and subservient. It is a great example of social defiance.I think that Nathaniel Hawthorne should be given a medal of honor. During his time, women were not entitled to be strong. Basically they were there to cook and have children. If they didn't have a husband, they were basically expected not to be able to do anything. But the character of Hester Prynne proves them all wrong. She manages to defy the townspeople, raise a child, and become a heroine to other women. She managed to accomplish all of this all on her own. It is a wonderful portrayal of a woman's spirit.For a book written in the 1800's, it is actually quite easy for a teenager in the twenty-first century to read and relate to, especially for a girl. Most girls like romances, and a strong female character. It is an outstanding piece of work that is sure to be around for years to come."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I trudged through this wordy book, like many others, in high school. I previously thought the coolest part was that a married woman had had an affair with a priest. This time around, however, I actually got sucked into the book itself, not into what had happened before.Yes, this book is extremely descriptive, but it isn't a book of what happened, but why it happened. Instead of having the reader determine or deduce the motives and minds of the characters, Hawthorne comes out and tells you. That's what makes it so timeless. Had he not written it with such density, I don't think it would be what it is today simply because times, customs, and opinions have changed so much. For many people, I think Dimmesdale's (somewhat hypocritical) pious behavior would have just been dismissed as simple cowardice.However, I'm not trying to say that the events of the story are those that only fit into past culture, many of these things happen today, but the treatment is different; it's much more open. For me, even knowing the ending of the story, I almost couldn't bring myself to read the rest because I felt transported into the mindset of the characters. I didn't feel the need to interpret, just observe."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Hester Prynne and much of the framework of the story is modeled on Anne Hutchinson who in 1638 was imprisoned and then banished from Boston for being Antinomian, (anti-law), her belief being that love and personal religious experience were greater than the elderly Puritan authority. Hawthorne describes the rosebush by the prison door as springing up under the footsteps of the sainted Ann Hutchinson. Hester and Anne have several parallels, the dignified manner of facing their trials, rumors that each had a child by the devil, strong relationship and betrayal by a well respected Puritan clergyman, defiance of Puritan elders, punishments of prison and banishment, and both were advisors to other women. Hawthorne takes the A of Antinomian and makes it the A of adultrey because he wants to shine a brilliant spotlight on the workings of the human heart in the course of the narrative.Witchcraft plays a role in the Scarlet Letter. John Hathorne an ancestor of the author was one of the judges at the infamous Salem witch trials where most of the condemned and executed were women. Govenor Bellingham's sister Mistress Hibbins, an historical figure later hanged for witchcraft, believes herself to be a witch in this novel. Many believe Hester's child Pearl to be fathered by the devil and that Hester's A glows red in the dark. Hester tells Pearl she met the blackman in the forest once and that the A is his mark. Chillingworth ,Hesters elderly husband, practices alchemy or something close to it and his heart is darkened the most of the players in this tale. As Dimmesdale stands on the scaffold at night he sees a display of lights in the sky and it looks to him like a giant A marked out in lines of dull red light for his adultrey.Dimmesdale cares more for his ambition than for Hester and Pearl. The Puritans think him saintly and the truth gnaws away at him and weakens him. Hawthorne tells us at one point to \\"Be True Be True\\" meaning genuine, real, to show and be yourself warts and all.As in Hester's great art with her needle Hawthorne has crafted great art with this masterpiece.Some have confused the heralds description of what was on the tombstone thinking the words were on the stone. Only the red A on a black background is on the stone. The Heralds description is \\"On a field, sable, the letter A, gules\\". Gules is a heraldic word that also has a root meaning flowers, so a rendering of this in plain english would be: On a background, black, the letter A, blooms red."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I loved this book, the structure of it, the characterization, etc, etc! It contains so much symbols, conflicts and all kinds of literary terms you can think of that it's the best book for the introduction to serious literature. It's the foundation to other American novels as Hawthorne paves the way of how a book should be written- with passion and interest.I just find Arthur Dimmesdale so fascinating while some people might disagree with me. It is his mind that intrigued me to evaluate him and as my subject for my paper.This is definitely an American masterpiece by Nathaniel Hawthorne. I wish that this classic book would be more highly appreciated. Just don't see the movie! Appreciate the beauty of Hawthorne's writing style."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I'm a high school student who had to read this book for school. Yes, it is hard to read sometimes because of the outdated language and sometimes difficult to understand writing style. But if you read a book that is easy to understand and always entertaining, then you are probably not learning anything. This book is a classic that everyone should be exposed to, and hopefully learn to appreciate.I stumbled over parts of this book, but in the end, I got a better appreciation of Early American Puritan life. I also really enjoyed watching the movie of the Scarlet Letter."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I read this book as an assignment for my American Literature class. Outside of school, I would never read in this genre, but for not being my style, it was actually very interesting. The reading moves slowly, more because of the lack of dialogue and action, and the long spiels of description and analytical discussion, than difficult wording. It offers a deep insight into how the human mind can so torture the body if the soul is afflicted, and how bottled-up sin and lust for revenge can destroy a person. If you're interested in what makes the human mind tick, then I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This is such a touching and inspiring, yet heart-rending, story. Hester is such an amazing character, beautifully presented by Hawthorne. One of my favourite reads during my student days, and loved to this day."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The book was wonderful and in good condition. I purchased it for my daughter, who is in highschool. The book arrived around the time it stated it would. Above all of that the price was great."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This book is a masterpiece of English (not just American) literature. It is as beautiful as prose can be, showcasing the amazing technique and depth that Hawthorne could communicate. It isn't trite story of a puritan scandal; rather, it is a penetrating exploration of shame, redemption, and true love. Melville had it right when he dedicated his book to the \\"Genius of Hawthorne\\". Not surprisingly, this is one of the few American novels on the list of Great Books, which should obviate any needless disputes about the quality of this novel constantly brought up by sophmoric readers that have little experience in literature.This edition is nicely bound and quite affordable. For such a great book, the introduction is unfortunately shallow and unscholarly. Instead of exploring the themes or structure of the piece, the write opts for a bland biography of Hawthorne, a light summarization of the novel along with the Custom House prologue, and finishes her essay with some obstuse comparisons of Hester Prynne with Monica Lewinksy. Making such idiotic references to pop culture prompts the reader to wonder if this person understood the book at all.Fortunately, the comments at the end of the novel are what makes this edition valuable. Reading the reviews of contemporaries, including Melville, add to the reader's understanding and they are nice pieces of analysis in themselves. The essay of Hawthorne's own son, Jullian, superbly catches the nuances of Hawthorne's style and should be held as a template for literary analysis.For the price and the reviews at the end, I highly recommend this edition of a timeless classic."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"\\"The Scarlet Letter\\" by N.

I am a straight &quot;A&quot; student and I love to read, but one of, no wait, THE worst book I have ever read would have to be The Scarlet Letter. It has been more than I year since I read this book, but the suffering is still fresh in my mind. I don't want to sound like I didn't like it because I was forced to read it in English class(which I was), because many of the other pieces of literature that I have been assigned to read I have enjoyed.This is not the case with The Scarlet Letter, however. I DID &quot;get&quot; this book, in that I understood it, but there was a lack of an interesting plot and characters for whom you could care. The Scarlet Letter was filled with unnecessary language, which, even for me, was overwhelming at times.Another thing about this book that I dislike is its ability to tire and put to sleep. Many times while I was reading this did my eyes get tired and eventually shut, and I awoke later having to re-read some of the text. I tried a lot of things to keep this from happening, such as blasting my stereo, getting caffiene, etc. none of that seemed to work.All I can say is that when I was finally finished with this mind-numbing novel, I was relieved of a great pain in my neck. I cannot nor will I ever recommed this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I teach high school English, and was required to teach thisto my students. I don't know who suffered more, me or them.To be fair, as one of America's first novels, it has interestingelements and Hawthorne does a good job.On the other hand, it is excruciating to read. There is nosuspense, little to sympathize or empathize with, and evenless to enjoy. A better writer could have told the samestory in half the number of pages. Some have labelledthis book a tragedy; they are right only in the sense thatit is tragically bad."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter has long been lauded as a \\"classic,\\" sure, but any avid reader knows that just because a novel comes bundled with this title, does not mean the story guarantees excellence. This is the case with Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, a mundane, tedious read that stretches across an insufferable 250 pages. I don't see much in this novel that merits it the \\"classic\\" label; despite a small collection of praiseworthy subtleties in language, insufficiently engaging characters, plotlines, and writing styles turn this book into an undesirable story.Beginning with a needlessly long, unnecessarily convoluted introduction, The Scarlet Letter immediately discourages hopeful readers searching for an excellent read. Most of the introduction is superfluous, as are most of the words in Hawthorne's sentences. Not only is the beginning impossibly lengthy, it is also annoyingly uninteresting. I am not exaggerating when I say the introduction is completely uneventful; instead of beginning with an engaging prologue, Hawthorne chooses, for some reason, to bore his readers with a thirty-page explanation that readers just beginning to read the book will have no reason to continue on with. By starting out with such a dull preface, Hawthorne immediately cuts his audience in half. I'm sure that most people who pick up the book for fun quickly put it back after reading the first few pages of pretentious yet trivial garble. Hawthorne's droning on about nonsense that few people can understand, and even fewer can sympathize with, sets The Scarlet Letter off to a terrible start.Even worse, as the book picks up pace and moves on towards the main plot, there seem to be few signs of improvement in the narrator's mundane droning. You would think that the characters, including a vengeful, mad doctor, an audacious, rebellious Puritan outcast (who is, by the way, a female), and a seemingly saintly minister who safeguards a horrid sin, would greatly contribute to the excitement of the story. Unfortunately, these characters remain, for the most part, distant from the reader. They are developed fairly well; it's just that a typical reader in the current era can't find much in common with a Puritan minister, doctor, or outcast. This absence of engaging characters detracts significantly from the entire novel, keeping the reader from fully absorbing the story.To be fair, quite a few chapters are intriguing, and Hawthorne does write several noteworthy excerpts in his otherwise flat novel. His style is highly sophisticated, which is most likely the reason many people find the book boring. Filled with hidden symbols, allegories, and themes, The Scarlet Letter is not a simple book for passing the time. Hawthorne's writing often drags, and ends up sounding very mediocre. The novel seems to become more riveting at trivial times, and excessively dull during parts with elevated examples of symbolism, which a typical reader will have to trudge through.If you are willing to devote time and effort to reading the novel, you will probably find it decent, or possibly even worthy of being called a \\"classic.\\" Casual readers, however, will not find this tale a good read, and will probably shy away from it after the first chapter."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"that I don't like this book. I read it in high school, when all I did (and still do) was read everything I could get my hands on. I love literature, I am even majoring in creative writing in college. I UNDERSTOOD the book, what it was trying to say, the plot, etc. I just thought it didn't do a very good job of saying what it was trying to say. It was unnecessarily vague (what is the reason behind trying to confuse somebody?), wordy, high-flown and just too big. The story could have been told more effectively as a short story, even half the length. I don't reccommend."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"the way the characters in this book speak makes it too dificult to follow along. i tried to follow along, but too boaring. also the book is mainly based on her thoughts. there is not a lot of human interaction with the main character."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The novel is the story of a woman of Colonial America, Hester Prynn, who bears an illegitimate daughter. Her community does not approve; what she has done requires trial and punishment. She suffers terrible guilt, but she treasures her child, Pearl, and keeps her secret (who is the dad?) to the end. The Scarlet Letter has a horribly overwritten and boring beginning, describing the inspiration for the book, to wit: a document found in the narrator's workplace. (A customs house in Salem, Massachusetts in the 1800s, where newly arrived ship captains must check in and pay a fee for docking their vessels.)The beginning goes on and on and on and on describing the narrator's fellow workers and circumstances and surroundings. All of which has almost no bearing on the plot. I'm guessing the author, Nathaniel Hawthorne, was putting several manuscripts together, or maybe he was just being paid by the word. Anyhow, I already knew the bare bones of the plot and kept wondering -- have I got the wrong The Scarlet Letter? When is the story going to start?Finally it begins. Here's the first scene: hapless Hester, babe in arms, is punished for her sin publicly. She has been sentenced to wear a symbol of her shame, a scarlet A for adultery. She has sewn it on the front of her dress and she stands in front of a sneering crowd of Puritans, wilting, guilty. Though ashamed, she does not weep or beg forgiveness, and she adamantly refuses to name her lover/the baby's father. By an amazing coincidence her long-lost aged doctor husband arrives at that moment! In time to see her shamed! Later when they meet face to face she won't tell him who the dad is, either. But he says he'll figure it out, and he does: it's the town's beloved minister. Dr. Prynn gives himself a new name, swears her to secrecy, and sets out to make the minister suffer.Misery commences and goes on and on for some time, as well, to the point the reader may think of abandoning the book (at least this one did). We learn of every pang of guilt and sorrow of Hester and the minister, of Hester's isolation and humiliation, of her lover's terrible guilt, of her husband's persecution of her lover, of her pretty little daughter's odd personality, which Hester attributes (possibly; it's hard to be sure) to the evil influence of her illegitimate birth. Finally the situation is resolved in a scene so well-written and captivating it seems hardly possible that the same author who wrote the rest of the book could have written it. Also it seems hardly possible that Hester could suddenly arrive at a sensible solution to everybody's problems. Also it seems hardly possible that the wussy minister, who should have confessed he was the dad at the start, is able to even think about saving himself. It is a wonder.The rest of the book is so hurried, no more than a summary of events, that I got the impression that an editor had taken Hawthorne in hand and said, \\"no more, you've written enough!\\" My sentiments exactly. If ever a book could have used some judicious cutting, The Scarlet Letter is that book. Perseverence in reading the whole long list of classics is what made me stick it out to the bitter end. I'm giving this novel 3 stars just because it's a classic, not because I think it's actually that good a read."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter is a fascinating story about guilt, revenge, and the faults of the Puritan community. But even with this interesting plot, Hawthorne's verbose style with excessive detail makes the novel difficult to read quickly.The book begins as Hester Prynne is being punished for adultery by having to wear the letter \\"A\\" and being publicly embarrassed. Her strong personality is displayed as she does not break down and reveal the person she committed adultery with. Minister Dimmesdale is her lover, but is weak and scared to face his responsibilities. Roger Chillingworth, Hester Prynne's husband, returns after disappearing for years and secretly plans to destroy Dimmesdale because of his desire to avenge his injured pride.By setting the novel in a 17th century Puritan colony in New England, Miller is able to full examine the effects of guilt and sin on a person's soul under a pressured environment where religious beliefs and laws are strictly enforced. This is displayed through Dimmesdale's deteriorating health as he faces an inward battle. He fears the condemnation of the townspeople, but at the same time, feel obligated to take care of Hester Prynne and their child.The plethora of symbols and allusions in the story add to its profoundness.Hawthorne has a verbose and formal style, as shown through his diction and syntax. He uses antiquated words, even in the dialogues between Hester Prynne and Pearl, her young child. The lengthiness of the novel is due to excess of detail given.The Scarlet Letter has an intriguing plot that makes us reflect on our ethics and teaches us about revenge and guilt, but Hawthorne's proper diction and lengthy descriptions prevent readers from reading it continuously in one sitting."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I am truly amazed at how one novel can stir up so many emotions from its readers. Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter emphasizes the cruelty that people are capable of treating against others. He also demonstrates the toll that guilt has on people, restricting themselves from performing daily tasks in fear that they have to acknowledge their wrongdoings.Although I am very intrigued and captivated by the plot of the story, I found his writing style to be too descriptive and elongated for my liking. An important scenario that happens within fifty pages could be cut down to ten, but he tends to describe about every single detail possible, which irked me at times. Hawthorne's focus on such minute details may appeal to other readers, but it certainly did not have a positive effect on me.On the contrary, I applaud his utilization of allusions to the bible throughout the book. By encompassing the biblical allusions, he heightens the effects of certain actions such as Little Pearl's repetitive questionings towards her mother. The reader begins to fear Pearl, although she is only a child, because of her close resemblance to the devil. These allusions also enhance Hawthorne's development of the characters. Hawthorne really did do a thorough job of exposing the strengths and weaknesses of his characters to relate to his audience. Because the readers are aware of how a certain character acts, they are capable of recognizing the significance for Hawthorne to portray the character in a different light.Although the readers may have to put up with the extensiveness of the novel, I recommend this novel to anyone that is willing to take the extra time and effort to fully understand Hawthorne's themes, which are cleverly entwined within the novel; it is futile to toil through the lengthened plot without delving deeper into the text to comprehend its meaning. Reading the book the first time, I honestly believed that it was a decent novel despite the many complaints and criticisms that others gave me; but after I analyzed the novel myself for some considerable time, I almost considered it a classic tale of all time, with its many symbols, themes, and other literary elements that were hidden among the text that all lead to the Hawthorne's ingenuity at the very end, if I had not been reminded of his unnecessary tedious style. This should not hinder anyone from picking up the novel and reading it though because, in actuality, it really is an amazing piece."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The book was really good if you like to read of old times and how the &quot;ways&quot; were back then. The whole Puritan way of thinking is just different and kind of intriguing. I recommend to people who like to read slower books with some different words that might be difficult."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter is the best Hawthorne book ever written. This book has a good moral value to it and when you read this book you need to let your emotions take over. If you let the emotions take over you will get more out of the story. Through out this book Hawthorne shows his unique writing style. His writing style is long sentences and good vocabulary words to describe what he means. This book talks about how two people of different backgrounds can get along and fall in love. Their town doesn't accept people like that so therefore the women had to wear a scarlet letter \\"A\\" on her chest. In this book there is a lot of guilt, revenge, and pride. There is a lot of guilt involved because of the lady having an affair and she has to wear the letter \\"A\\" on her chest. This book shows pride also because she does not let the letter and the people of the town bring her down. Her life stayed the same as it was before her affair with another man. The ending in this book is really good. It is weird how they find out that the preacher is the one who had the affair with the lady.Hawthorne wrote this book many years ago and now it fits perfect into our life. We have a lot of relationships in this world of people with different ethic and religious backgrounds. So this book puts into perspective of what it was like to have a relationship with someone not like you back in the late 1800's early 1900's. Who would have ever thought that this book would be so close in relationship to how we live now? This book is such a great book to read. So I think that everyone should read this book and let their emotions take over and they will feel this book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The book I downloaded on my Nook and Kindle doesnt seem like the same one I read in school.

I do not really like how the author writes but I enjoy the story line."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter is truly one of literature's greatest triumphs, its characters and themes reverberating in our collective consciousness more than 150 years after its initial publication. Few novels inspire as much contemplation and feeling on the part of the reader. Hester Prynne, American fiction's first and foremost female heroine continues to haunt this world, inspiring a never-ending stream of scholarly debate. Even in our less puritanical age, some doubtless see her as a villainously great temptress, but to me she is a remarkably brave hero indeed. Her sin is known to all, and she never runs away from it, bearing the scarlet letter on her bosom bravely for all to see; she realizes the true measure of that sin, fretting constantly over the effects it will have on young Pearl, remaining steadfast in her beliefs while at the same time envisioning a new society where women and men can exist on more equal terms, free of the stultifyingly harsh punishments meted out on even the most repentant of souls by Puritanism. She shows her noble spirit by refusing to name her partner in sin and goes so far as to allow the ruthless Roger Chillingworth to torment the man she loves deeply enough to protect him for all time. Little Pearl is somewhat of an enigma, truly manifesting traits of both the imp and the little angel; her questions about the letter her mother wears and the minister who continually holds his hand against his heart reflect an insight that amazes this reader. Chillingworth is a thoroughly black-hearted man; I can certainly understand the blow he sustained as a result of Hester's sin, but his actions and thirst for prolonged revenge on the so-called perpetrator of the wrong he suffered can only be described as roguish and unpalatable.Of course, the most complex character in the novel (and literature as a whole) is the good minister Arthur Dimmsdale. One is compelled to both like him and despise him. He is basically a good man and an unquestionably fine soldier in the army of the Lord, winning many souls to God with his impassioned sermons. He is more aware than anyone else of his sinful nature, and he punishes himself quite brutally in private in a useless attempt to make up for the public ignominy he lacks the moral courage to call upon himself with a public profession of his deed. Dimmsdale is a coward and a hypocrite. At one critical moment in the latter pages of the novel, he blames Hester for his state of misery, and it is that comment in particular that makes this tragic character a man I can only commiserate with to a limited degree. Even at the penultimate moment of the novel, as he finally bears the mark of his shame and guilt for all his parishioners to see, the very men and women who have viewed him as a saintly man of God rather than the brigand he knows himself to be, he does not openly confess-his words and deeds do make plain the secret of his heart, but it is his lack of a thoroughly bold confession that causes some of his most devoted followers, so Hawthorne tells us, to blindly judge his final act as an illustrative parable on the danger of sin threatening each member of his congregation rather than an admission of guilt and self-condemnation."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Thought I was getting a book received book on tape. a little deceiving. Rather than that the process went as expected. If it had been what we wanted would have been great."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne shows his expertise in delving into the human emotion: probably the best at psychological analysis of his characters next to Shakespeare!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Too long. Re-read this and remembered how much Hawthorne's style irritates me. There is an interesting story within but he takes WAY too long to tell it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This book has a nice plot, but it just isn't exciting. It's not riveting enough, maybe because it was written in the 19th century. Things that are exciting more than a 100 years ago just don't seem all that interesting to me. It's hard to read because most of the book is composed of metaphors and other examples of figurative language. If you had to read it, I'd say give yourself at least three weeks."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This book really expresses any feelings of shame that I may have ever had, but I still cheer on its hero and heroine."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"In Nathaniel Hawthorne's tale of seduction, betrayal, adultery, and the consequences following these turn of events, Hester Prynne, the heroine that succumbs to her passions and in doing so reaps the punishments of her &quot;sins&quot;, finds herself trapped in a lonely Puritain colony whose inhabitants hold only disdain, pity, and disapproval toward her. As a demonstration of her will and furvor, she sews and wears a scarlet &quot;A&quot; which stands for &quot;adultery&quot;. Perhaps this &quot;A&quot; also stood as a reminder to the man who also committed these &quot;sins&quot; with her, the &quot;pure and religious&quot; Reverend Dimmesdale. Hester's unforgiving and avenging husband, Chillingsworth, soon finds that his unfaithful wife has borne a daughter from her &quot;sin&quot;, a child she calls &quot;Pearl&quot;. This even moreso enrages him, and causes him to seek out her lover. In life, our actions may not be condoned by society and there are certainly consequences to everything we do. Just as Hester Prynne wore her scarlet letter &quot;A&quot; on her breast so do we in our everyday lives (though of course our letters aren't tangibly displayed as was hers). The Scarlet Letter is a book with many lessons to teach. I read this book first when I was in fifth grade, a second time in high school, and now I own a copy. It shows us that not everyone is perfect, even the Puritains had their faults, and that if we truly love one another, we can look beyond these faults."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I thought this was a great book, years ago, and it still is, but I think it is outdarted for those living today and this modern world. There are so many new, contemporary novles. If you want to another read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I think that The &quot;Scarlet Lettter&quot; is a very well written book. One of the things that I would watch out for, is the vocabulary and how it is used in the context. The vocabulary is very confusing at times. However, it can lead you on to another world by wisking you off in the times where the&quot;Scarlet Letter&quot; took place. Other than that, I think this book is very good. I personally liked the characters and their roles in the story. The main character,&quot;Hester Prynne&quot;, is written very carefully and it shows how she struggles to go on with her life. That is the only thing I can say about this book. You have to read the rest to find out what happens....."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This book was very good i had to read it for school I didn't really understand it the first time but each time i read it, it gets better."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"In writing the Scarlet Letter, Hawthorne brought up a few good points. For example, there were many instances in which he describes the suffering of secret sin through the eyes of Arthur Dimmesdale, Hester's child's father. As Hester grows stronger throughout the novel as a result of her repentance, Dimmesdale, the man with whom she cheated, grows weaker and weaker until he finally gives in at the end of the story. To reach these fine conclusions from the book, however, one must stay completely focused and search long and hard for the evidence. Buried beneath Hawthorne's dull insignificant speeches on content that literally has nothing to do with the story, one may be able to find a moral. In saying this, I am referring of course to the 54 page introduction that is almost totally irrelevant to the entire story. He describes everyone that works in the custom house with him and what they wear and eat and do in their spare time, and then in the last 4 or so pages, he talks about the importance of the scarlet letter. What a waste of paper! With all of the trees that he killed writing his intro, you would think that it would actually serve a purpose. Overall, my opinion on the novel is that it could be summed up in about 3-5 sentences, although Hawthorne drones on for about 250 pages of frequent symbolism and aristocratic dialogue. If you really want to read a story about the shame and suffering of secret sin, then I highly recommend reading &quot;The Minister's Black Veil&quot;, also by Hawthorne. This is a much shorter story with a lot more meaning and fewer words. It basically sums up all that he really wished to say in the Scarlet Letter in a different plot and setting."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I read this &quot;Classic&quot; novel for a class, and must admit I was thoroughly disappointed. Hawthorne should have stuck to writing non-fictional books about the Puritan settlers. This book was a pill. There are so many American authors, and novels that could be taught in schools that could far exceed the entertainment level of this out of date story. Two thumbs down."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I am not one who enjoys romance, however Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter is truely an unshakable landmark in American Literature. Unlike most people, I read this novel in college (I don't know why junior high teaches this book; it's way to advanced for that intensity of reading) and depicted it as a soap opera in Puritan society. The novel inhibits sex, suspense, drama, and romance all in one pakage. I found the invidious Roger Chillingwoth to be an extremely interesting aspect about the novel's well-rounded plot. The theme of the novel is sin, and how tragically easy it could destroy a normal town denizen. I mean, all 3 main characters are virtually consumed and eventually destroyed by their own private sins. Read this book; by doing so, one will appreciate truly powerful literature that still shakes our foundation today."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I am a third year law student who read this work in the tenth grade (11 years ago) so I am working from memory here. I did not enjoy it, despite the grand themes that the author addresses. Frankly, I felt that the work was entirely too dense to be an enjoying read. I get the same feeling now when I am trying to dissect some obscure statute...in other words, it needs to be done, but it isn't any fun. I feel that some reviewers on this page are unfairly haranguing people who could not read the book without a dictionary. I feel that this is the wrong attitude. When I am writing a legal brief, it is expected that my work be crafted in such a way that it is READABLE [e.g. tell a good story]. If you do not write in such a way as to engage the greatest number of people, you will be less likely to get your audience to appreciate the merits of your case. The same is true with this book. The author does not allow our minds eye to fill in any blanks. His prose is dense and he fills in so many of the details that it is impossible to let your imagination add the finishing touches to the work. In the end, most students are drained and bitter at the author for pushing us into his overly descriptive morass. This has nothing to do with the fact that there are so many &quot;dictionary words&quot; in the book. That is another matter entirely. However, I would note that most people who are complaining about the difficulty of the individual words would probobly not be complaining if the author had not so totally preempted the reader's imagination. The words individually are not so difficult as the density. There are those who love this work anyway and i have no problem with that. But I assure you that If one of the senior attorneys here refers to my work as &quot;dense&quot;, I am bound to have to do a rewrite. That said, i still believe that this is a worthwhile book as much for the revolutionary readings that are possible as the traditional themes for which it became famous. Who has re! ad this book with an eye toward dissecting the nature of the subordination of women in western culture? Or to examine the ways in which Hester rebels (however modestly) against the strictures of her station?

There is WAY too much detail where it doesn't matter, and the detail is VERY lacking in some places that it would really be good to have it in! At the VERY beginning, Hester goes to jail for (about) 3 years...the WHOLE TIME was totally skipped, and replaced with describing a door...this wouldn't tick me off so much if Hawthorne also described the jail but noooooo let's just talk about a door for about 20 pages and then move on to some other unimportant symbol. But like I said at the beginning, the STORY is actually VERY good and keeps you wanting to know what happens but by the time you FINALLY fight through all of the detail, you find yourself wondering if it was even worth it.

In the story Hester Prynne had to deal with her sin of adultery.Hawthorne described how things were in that day and time. More than likely Hester would havebeen killed for her sin, but she was not because of the child. The era of time that Hester lived inwas very strict on actions and were very religious about every thing. \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" was astory that revealed a life lesson in it. I believe that Hester was treated wrongly by the people ofthe town because all the people treated her as an outcast.Ms. Prynne had been in prison while she was pregnant. Hester had to stand among the townspeople and they all wanted to know who the father was, but Hester would never tell them. Hesterhad committed the sin of adultery with Reverend Dimmesdale. When Hester was standing beforethe towns people she noticed that her husband was in the crowd of people. Her husband had sentHester to America before him so that she could find them a place to settle, but Mr. Prynne nevershowed up so Hester thought that he was dead.Nathaniel Hawthorne described how the towns people were by what their actions.Hawthorne let us read to find out the characters and how they were as a person. Hawthorne letsus know that religion was very strict in the lives of the people. The people followed the laws ofthe bible and if you sinned you had to deal with the town. Some of the punishments were cruel,but the punishments that they had to deal with then is much different from today. Some of thepunishments may have not been fair, but the people did what they thought was right. HesterDethloff 2Prynne was isolated from everyone in the town except when she had to go to the marketplacebecause she did not go to church any more after her sin. It could have been a good thing forHester and her daughter, Pearl, to move out of the town. The move was good in different ways,Hester would not have to put up with the humiliation from the towns people and Pearl would nothave to deal with being the child of sin.I have different views of the treatment that Hester and Pearl. Hester should have beenpunished if she did not know that she was doing wrong, but Hester knew she had sinned. HesterPrynne had sinned and she knew her consequences. Pearl was just a child and the people of thetown treated her as if she was a made of the devil works. Pearl was a child without friends andplayed by herself mostly outside. I believe most of the women of the town wanted Hester gonebecause she was very beautiful and even when she got out of jail Hawthorne describes her asbeing as beautiful as ever. By Hester being beautiful that made the women jealous therefore theywanted her punished. I believe that Hester's looks had some to do with her punishment.In conclusion Nathaniel Hawthorne points out the importance of religion and sin. Religionhad a large impact on the \\"The Scarlet Letter.\\" Religion had to do with most of the punishmentthat Hester Prynne received by the people of the town. Also sin was one of the main focuses ofthe story. The sin of adultery that Hester Prynne and Mr. Dimmesdale committed was the reasonfor the whole story. The sin that was committed acted out to be more of a life lesson to people.Hester's punishment was made some what upon her looks along with her sin. In the era of timewhich \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" took place mostly everything was based on the bible.ISBN 0 14 24.3726 3 ASIN 0671006207ISBN 1593080123 ASIN 0844606863ISBN 0151795681 ASIN 0801012139"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"had to read it for class to pass a test the next day... anyways bored me to death but hte whole plot was interestin tho it had too many stupid details thas not very relative. so id tell u to go read cliffs tho its not wise if u have some strict teacher who gives cliff proof tests."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Oh man, where do i begin with this one?

The book started out with excellent twists and turns, and I would constantly wonder about what each character would do, and where the book was going to go.

A sixteen year old can not even begin to fathom what that entails. I recommend to those who have given this book poor reviews, to wait a few years and then reread this amazing novel which is an insightful journey into the one region that is worth exploring: a woman's heart! Also, the way females were mitreated at the dawn of our great country's rise to equality is a lesson worth pondering."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"If this book is so great, then why are there so many people who give it only one or two stars? Should a great book not be able to be enjoyed on some level by everyone? To the best of my knowledge, only erudites and scholars enjoy this book. A good book, but one with a limited audience. Don't read it unless you don't mind wading waste deep through overly long sentences, antiquicated words and flowery prose. Personally I like an author who gets to the point."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Perhaps this is not exactly a review of Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter; rather, it is a commentary on the Amazon.com reviews I've read on this book. I was absolutely shocked by the responses I found here. Come on, people. Wake up! This ain't MTV. As an instructor of literature, I am becoming increasingly disgusted at &quot;students'&quot; and &quot;scholars'&quot; inability to pay attention to a book that requires them to slow down and think -- and for longer than 3 minutes. I'm thinking career change here . . ."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"For as much as I adore Nathaniel Hawthorne, I couldn't really &quot;get into&quot; this book. I've always liked Hawthorne, I visited The House of the Seven Gables, and the house he was borne in. Even one of the houses he lived in. But this novel, it just isn't for me. I love the way he writes, but I didn't like the omniscient/1st person point of views that flip-flopped throughout this novel. I read it because it was required."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"A good book with an admirable heroine. It is somewhat dull and confusing but there are some bright spots. Some of it is written beautifully, especially when Hester and Dimmesdale confess their love for one another."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Being in high school, it took a little bit to understand it, but after a while, I was able to get the basic point of the story. If you know you'll have to read this for school in the future, read it ahead of time. That way, you won't be reading on a deadline, which makes it worse. Read it at your own pace and you will understand it more. Also, the second time through, when you have to read it, you will see many things that you missed, and the story will be much more meaningful to you. (You'll do better on tests and quizzes, too.) Even if you're not required to read it, check it out-it's not called a classic for nothing!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"this book represents a time in the past of our country in which we should be ashamed. not only was this a time of &quot;witchcraft&quot; and witchunts, but the society was willing to ostracize a human being for adultery. as if it weren't punishment enough for hester to have to wear the &quot;a&quot; on her chest, everyone stared at her peculiarly and did not accept her into normal society. i think this is overly harsh, yet this whole book reflects the time in which it took place very well. i would recommend it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Although it suffers from the expected trappings of Romantic literature ( authorial intrusion, verbosity, etc) and the blatant didactic tone of the author, this book is an essential for anyone wishing to have a full appreciation for American literature. Hawthorne creates a masterpiece of social commentary, cross-applied symbolism and overall beauty. The chief virtue of this book is the question posed by the line &quot;what we did had a consecration all its own.&quot; It is this line which continues to spark discussions among English teachers everywhere. The implications of these words also seem to elude students across the country. The issue is this: did Hawthorne imply, in paroxysms over the sanctity of nature, that the adultery committed by Hester and Dimmesdale was holy because it was wild like the forest beyond the austere village of the Puritans? The symbolism associated with the product of their sin, Pearl, seems to support this conclusion. The book is worth the read merely to contemplate that question, let alone the fact that The Scarlet Letter is a near-perfect example of American Romanticism. I do have to admit that it would be a bit more enjoyable if Hawthorne had used a synonym for &quot;ignominy&quot; once or twice...."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"We have just finished reading this book in school and I for one loved it. Hawthorne is showing how one sin, adultery, changed the lives of Hester, Dimmesdale, Chillingworth and Pearl. There is so much more to this book than what appears on the surface. On the surface, Hester had an affair, was found and had Pearl. But what is hidden below is Hawthorne feeling about the novel. Hawthorne defines sin as &quot;the falsification of human relationships&quot;. While adultery jumps out at us, there is more hidden underneath. Dimmesdale is one who falsifies being a father, lover and friend. He denied Pearl the joy of having a father, could not come forward to admit his part with Hester and lied to Chillingworth who was supposed to be his good friend. On Chillingworth's part, he committed the biggest sin. Once he found out who Dimmesdale really was, he tried to do everything in his power to take over the minister's soul. He hurt both Dimmesdale and Hester, which in Hawthorne's eyes was the biggest sin of them all. Hester never married Chillingworth because she loved him; she did it because she had to. Once she found love with Dimmesdale, she realized that it was real and she made a huge mistake by marrying the leech. It is a great book, which is hard to read, but once you get below what is obvious, it turns into a story that is still real even after all these years."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"&quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; is a superior book that explodes in emotion, passion, love, hatred, and crime. Hawthorne's choice of vocabulary is absolutely perfect to suit this novel. However, like all great classics, the reader must be patient. The story is very powerful, like an iron fist, telling of sins of adultery, and the great Dimmsedale, a character in this book, &quot;who keeps is hand over thy heart.&quot; Full of fierce yet excellent story telling, this book is a must for all lovers of classics and American Literature"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter is one of the more famous books in American Literature. It will appear in many survey courses because it has historical significance. That being said, this book is horribly boring and very archaically written. By modern standards, The Scarlet Letter is a pain to read. In fact, I would rather eat the book than read it a second time. As one of my English teachers once commented, \\"The Scarlet Letter is a piece of crap. It almost single handedly made me want to stop studying literature.\\" Given that this teacher speaks six languages and has probably taught in twice as many countries, I defer my judgment of what constitutes good literature to him.I am not attacking this specific edition of the text. It seems well annotated (though i prefer annotations as footnotes rather than as appendices in the back). However, the original text remains the same. If you die in a horrible car accident and burn off your face while loosing all your limbs, the mortician can only do so much.Thus, if you are planning on reading this book for pleasure, I assure you there is something better to read. If you can't find anything, then obviously you are completely inept at reading and need a new hobby. May i suggest knitting?"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This book literally put me to sleep. I could wake up at 2 in the morning and find the book in my lap, and then have to stress over finishing the assigned reading for my English class. I mean, some of the sentences are about 15 lines long, and the plot, if there is a plot, is incredibly slow. If the author would just tell it like it is, and not drag it out for pages, the book would be only about a third of the length that it is. Boring, boring, BORING!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I just had to read this book for a class (making the third time I've read it). There are not many books I re-read (too many others to get to), but this is one I could read over and over again (and have!). Every word counts, every scene is moving, every theme important and involving. Okay, so it's a little too obviously symbolic here and there, but what the hay! Hawthorne was one of the first truly American writers and had important things to say, plus he found the perfect story to clothe his beliefs and concerns in. Read it! And then, if you like it, go for \\"House of Seven Gables\\" and \\"The Marble Faun.\\""},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I will recommend that if you read this book, to not skip the introductory, it's crucial. (I did and I had to start over when I was almost finished.)To sum up the introductory: it's long and talks about the nameless narrator and how the story started. The narrator finds some documents in the unoccupied second floor of the building he works at. After going through the documents he finds a large scarlet \\"A\\" with beautiful embroidery wrapped around some manuscripts, which he later rewrites. He soon discovers that the manuscripts were 100 years old and written 100 years before he found them.If you are seeking for a book with more meanings then one and a harder vocabulary you might have found the book for you. The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne is aimed for an audience with a higher vocabulary and a good understanding of irony and symbolism. While reading this book it also might be helpful to know that motifs are recurring structures, contrasts, or literary devices that can help develop and inform the text's major themes; because they are throughout the story and occur from the beginning. This book would be good for either male or female of an age that can do well in a 12.0 accelerated reader book. Just remember that is a 24-chapter book with a long introduction.I had a hard time enjoying this book because I didn't read the introductory and had to start over. I also wasn't prepared for the vocabulary and all of the symbolism. Another thing I didn't understand was that there was more meaning to the book then just the words. If anyone asked me I would give it a 3 on a scale of 1-5. It's not that The Scarlet Letter was a bad book, because it is very well written, but I just didn't get into it.12/18/03"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne's mid-19th century novel reflects the strict Puritan Enviornment two-hundred years prior to the release of the book. What can be a tedious read at times is ultimately a redeeming piece of literature exposing the hypocrisy of the \\"godly\\" Puritan Communities.Much of the novel gives us inductive information forcing the reader to either ignore or figure out much of the background of the story for themselves. Regardless, Hester Prynne, the Protagonist, is portrayed as a strong women who has a extra-marital affair with an unknown man of the Boston Community. While raising her eerie bastard child, \\"Pearl\\", Hester refuses to compromise or openly break down for her crime. There are numerous plot twists, including a perverted love-triangle, that gives this novel it's romantic characteristics.Although there was probably hundreds of novels written during this time period that are stylistically superior to Hawthorne's masterpiece. This work has remained a mainstay as required reading because of its radical notions that women are equal and sometimes stronger than men emotionally, and deserve respect for the works they perform for society. It's a dark novel with many redeeming qualities, if you can get over the lofty-archaic English this should be an interesting read."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter is a very good book. It would be much better though if we were alowed to read it on our own and draw our own conclusions. How well can you appreciate a book if you have to hurry because you must read 40 pages in one night while making sure to remember details that may be on the test. Read it in highschool or not, it doesn't matter. But make sure to pick it up later in your life when you are ready for it, and you can draw your own conclusions instead of regurgitating what the teacher told you so you can pass a test."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Having re-read this book for the first time in two decades, I have no trouble understanding why it is a staple of high school literature classes everywhere. It's a great book for teaching symbolism, foreshadowing and some of the themes of the romantic movement. However, as an adult, I pretty much found it to be an excruciating reading experience, and I'm not just talking about the fact that the language is dense and dreary. The very things that make it a valuable teaching tool can be very annoying to a more experienced reader. As I was reading I kept wanting to scream every time Hawthorne talked about the scarlet letter burning, glowing or being like a painful brand. I got it already! I can put up with slogging through the nineteenth century prose if I'm going to be challenged a little, but this book no longer did it for me."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter By Nathaniel HawthorneHere's a book that Monica Lewinsky definitely hasn't read but perhaps she should have. Nathaniel Hawthorne's classic masterpiece, The Scarlet Letter , explores the shame, isolation, and ostracism that a woman, Hester Prynne, endured as punishment for her transgression in Puritanical New England. Hawthorne's criticism of Puritanical society is a constant theme that runs through his writings and is a reflection of the scorn he felt for his ancestors who played a crucial role in the Salem Witch Trials in 1692. This common thread is evidenced in his other works such as his short story, \\"The Minister's Black Veil\\" that once again focuses on a character who is isolated from society due to a personal indiscretion. In The Scarlet Letter , Hawthorne's depiction of a shunned woman reveals his insightful understanding of this complex character and the shame she had to endure for her transgression. One can't help but notice that such punishments are outdated in today's desensitized society, a society in which, on the whole, hardly an eyebrow was raised in response to the modern-day Hester Prynne character, Monica Lewinsky."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This is probably the most confusing and worst book I have ever read! The author uses incredibly large words and you constantly have to use a dictionary or else you most likely won't know hat you are reading. From my point of view as a high school (with mostly A's and good at English) student I would not recommend this book to any other high school age students. The author needs to get to the point and not drag on for pages about things that are not important at all. Long setences also makes the book drag on. If I didn't have to read this book for a book report I would have put it down after the first page or two and usually I finish every book that I start. This book had me in tears because it was so difficult. I had to ask my English teacher to explain this to me.

A simple phrase of action (Hester walking down the street) would be 4 pages of reflection. I read alot and am a huge fan of John Steinbeck, J.D Salinger, Mark Twian. I hated this book. It was took long and nearly impossible to read. If you have to read it for school, good luck. Otherwise, avoid this. There are much better classics than this."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Three words to describe my feelings of this book...I HATE IT.Hawthorne's writings are dull, dry, and other words that mean bad that start with D. The character's a boring."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"In this powerful and moving piece by Hawthorne, he reveals the presence of societal pressures which affect character judgment. Set in the late 1840s and published around that time, Hawthorne's story takes place in Salem and Concord, Massachusetts. He writes in an omniscient point of view, revealing the thoughts and prejudices of each character while interjecting his opinion along with the side.After the rather boring and tedious introduction which made me almost not want to read the book, the story opens with Hester Prynne holding an infant begat by immoral means emerging from the prison door and onto a scaffold for all to bear witness to the letter \\"A\\" for adulteress on her chest. Throughout the story, the focus will be on this symbol, and how it evolves over time with different perspectives.I won't get into much detail as that may ruin the book for your readers, so I'll move on to Hawthorne's awesome and abundant use of imagery used as symbols for the hypocrisy of the times and so forth. With his use of imagery, he criticizes the mankind for their ignorance In addition he adds transcendentalist views into the story the show the ability of nature being able to outlast and survive over some of the whimsical presumptions of man, such as what the symbol represents.Much of the book rely on symbols and what the characters represent. Reading and deciphering their meaning is not hard, but is not entirely obvious. What makes Hawthorne so clever is the way he shows the attributes of each character that define their symbol.Initially, I almost gave up on the book due to the rather long and tedious introduction about the narrator of the story, but I stuck through since it was part of a reading assignment for my reading class. When I finished, I can honestly say that I thoroughly enjoyed it, as I provides an insightful view of mankind's ways and our faults. Hawthorne created a timeless masterpiece and I suggest you guys to read it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"BrittleeMs. Self's English HonorsKickapoo High SchoolJunior11/21/05Warning: The book has a very high level of vocabulary!The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne is a book about sinning and dealing with the internal and external consequences of natural sin in a society of Puritans. The book is about a woman named, Hester, who commits the sin of adultery. Adultery is not acceptable in the Puritan society. They view it as a sin. To punish Hester for her wrongful acts, they place a scarlet A on her chest to let everyone know that she is an adulterer. Hester has a baby girl and names her Pearl. Pearl soon starts to grow up and realize why her mother has the A on her chest. Pearl starts questioning her mother about the A. Hester then realizes that the A on her chest is not a symbol of shame but of identity. Identity in a world where everyone is the same, they act the same, believe in the same virtues. The scarlet letter only made Hester stronger."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"As always, it is difficult to describe a book (or rather novella) as intricate as The Scarlet Letter. On the surface its story of adultery may appear plain, longwinded, and uninteresting, but Hawthorne never wrote primarily for the \\"mob\\" reader who only likes action and suspense. Instead, what he wrote is a book that captures the zeitgeist of the puritan era, both stylistically and figuratively.

Hawthorne, in this novel above all, is a master of character development. Hester, Roger, and Arthur are all powerfully depicted, and the moral conflict facing each of them is, for two of them at least, overwhelming. Hester is a strong person, stronger than Zenobia in The Blithedale Romance, and, unlike Zenobia, not manipulative. She carries the greatest burden of the book because were she to tell the truth, she would destroy the father of her child. Back when I read the book, and now also, I admired Hawthorne for depicting the evils of strict, damning, religion, which tortures and shames those who don't conform to its dogmas. And I found it ironic that in order to have a better life, Hester leaves the New World and goes to the Old.

There must be a lesson in there somewhere...\\""},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"There are many books that are considered classics, but often times it may seem difficult to read them because of the language and the time setting in which the book was written. The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne is one of those classic tales. Although the book was written in 1850 and set in a 17th century Puritan Society, the issues of morality, deceit, romance, and guilt make the novel an interesting and captivating read, even in modern times.The work of Hawthorn illustrates the question of humanity and morality. His vivid use of language and third person narrative style allows the reader to have insight into the lives of the main characters. He allows the reader to sympathize with both Hester and Dimmesdale. Although society has deemed their sin immoral and made Hester an outcast, Hawthorne is able to capture the reader's humanity and empathy toward the human condition.Hawthorne is also able to capture the essence of the Puritan society. He skillfully utilizes language, such as this, while Hester speaks to her daughter she states, \\"We must not always talk in the market-place of what happens to us in the forest.\\" This symbolizes the shame that is forced upon those who are judged and the need to escape from public scrutiny. Most readers will be able to relate to the characters and understand the tragedy of the times and circumstances.I highly recommend this book. Although the introduction may seem slow and somewhat disinteresting, the storyline will prove to be enticing. This novel challenges the reader to question his/her own moral views and values. The reader will see why this novel is a timeless classic."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne is certainly one of the most famous American novels of the 19th Century, and though maybe not as accessible as works from the likes of Twain or Steinbeck, it rightly belongs in the same realm of great American literature.The book begins with an introduction called Custom House. It can be skipped for all but the most enthusiastic readers of classic literature.The main story begins in a Puritan village in Massachusetts with a woman named Hester Prynne being forced to stand on a scaffold in front of a crowd as punishment for the sin that resulted in her child she is holding. She also must permanently wear a letter A as a mark for that sin. Hester continually refuses to disclose the name of her child's father. Back in prison she sees a doctor, a deformed man named Roger Chillingworth, who has a significant connection with her past unbeknownst to others in the village. Another man, a young frail minister named Arthur Dimmesdale, is also a significant character in the story in respect to his connection with Hester and his close but uneasy relationship with Chillingworth. Hester's daughter, Pearl, is an elfish mischievous child and becomes a symbol as much as an actual character; a symbol of Hester's past and hope for the future. Hester spends in the years afterward being a seamstress, doing charity, and eventually becoming an excepted if not beloved member of the community.The book deals with sin and redemption, religion and revenge in beautiful but often ambiguous ways. The story itself is simple, and the book is not long, but the inner emotions of characters are explored with rousing detail. The novel hardly ever meanders needlessly, though as I mentioned it's not the most (though certainly neither the least) accessible book, especially to an audience not well verse in classic literature. Do not be intimidated though because it's an experience well worth having. It's Hawthorne's masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I just read this book for the second time, at age 43. The first time was at age 15, as a school assignment, and boy, did I not get anything from it back then!But this time, I was enthralled. I gasped, cried, jumped up out of my chair. I read it in ONE SITTING.It is exquisitly written, deliciously horrifying, agonizingly suspenseful, overwhelmingly compelling. Afterword, I could not start another book for days while I thought about the experience I had just had.Read this book as an adult. It is a true great of literature. It is a life experience that everyone should have.And now some warnings: It is set in Puritan America -- not the most relevant setting for modern readers. Those looking for universality may find the setting remote and hard to relate to.Also, the first chapter, The Customs House, is really an introduction, rather that a chapter contributing to the story. It is forgivable to skip it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"It shocks me that the Scarlet Letter is the most taught book in the nation. It may have much symbolism and so on, but it is a convoluted mess. The author is completely detached from his audience, and for some bizarre reason, he feels he has to explain every little thing that happens in great detail. It is also irrelevant to our modern times. In our days people need to be reading things like Huxley, Orwell, Fitzgerald, Bradbury, Hemmingway, Steinbeck, Salinger, and many other great 20th century writers. This book is only relevant to those interested in the time period which it discusses."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I didnt realize when I ordered it that the type was turned side ways. I bought this as a gift, but not sure I will give it.I guess someone might like the format, but I dont."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I read this book in high school - nearly 20 years ago now - and I have yet to forget the storyline. In fact, although written in a language of a different time, we can find some of the same types of actions happening today - albeit in a more subtle manner.Overall, this is the story of a young woman who committed adultery, and is caught because she becomes pregnant at a time when abortion was not an option. Although many other people in her puritan community have committed the same \\"transgression\\", they haven't been caught yet (i.e. haven't become pregnant), so they participate in ruining this woman's reputation by forcing her to wear a scarlet \\"A\\", to symbolize her adulterous nature.I believe that in our society, people tend to do the same thing - they participate in gossip/making fun of people who have been unlucky enough to be caught doing the same thing many other's are doing day in and day out. For this reason, I feel as though this story is as relevant today as it was when it was written.I do have to agree that the writing is a bit difficult to get through, as the language is quite different than what we are now used to. But, if you have the time and patience to work through it, I think you will find it to be quite an eye-opener."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter is a work of genius. Nathaniel Hawthorne tells his story with astonishingly perfect art. The plot is flawless (except for the final chapter). His prose style, though difficult, is entirely appropriate to the seriousness of his themes. We are taken into the mid-seventeenth century world of the Puritan New Englanders with brilliant economy, the social and natural scene is superbly rendered, the drama is immediately and vividly brought before us.In a holier-than-thou community where the sinner (a person who has broken one of God's commandments) is forever judged, damned and punished, a young woman, Hester Prynne, has been found guilty of adultery. She will therefore be made a permanent example of. The story of the rest of Hester's life is one half of what the novel is concerned with, showing us the goodness and healthy rebelliousness of the human heart that must, and does, prevail.The other half of the story concerns Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, Hester's lover (the father of their 'unnatural', illegitimate child), who only near the end reveals his crime to the people of the town. Before this occurs, unlike Hester, who is almost completely ostracised and forced to always wear a scarlet letter A, for Adultery, he is venerated as a saint by the community. His confession exposes the whole compromised, hypocritical system - outcome of a movement which began (history records) with hopes of being a 'new Zion', 'a city set on a hill'.The novel is at its most intense when revealing Dimmesdale's profound spiritual torment as he struggles with his feelings of guilt and need to both confess and keep hidden his 'fallen' state. Our appalled identification with him, as he recognises his utter damnation (his conscience continually pricked by Hester's vengeful, cold, intellectual husband, whose true identity only she knows), shows us the full horror of believing sins are never forgiven and must be defeated through suppression of 'corrupt' human nature.As well as the justly famous symbolism, the story is composed of many other elements, including fable, psychology and the simplest down-to-earth realism. Reading it is to feel that all life - however circumscribed - is here. The characters, especially Hester and Dimmesdale, are so well drawn they rise above symbolic limitations. They are fully realised human beings, with recognisable flaws and virtues.The Scarlet Letter is a book for all humanity and all time. It took me to a world which I sometimes found oppressive and very nearly life-denying, yet due to Nathaniel Hawthorne's artistry an infinitely enriching and always enjoyable experience. These are, after all, the surest signs of a great novel."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Ok, like a fair number of other people, I read this just recently as a highschooler. My highly qualified judgement: Its has beautifully worked prose, and an intriguing plot (I wont try and say whether its good or not), and is a great study of symbolism, but at that point its redeeming qualities stop.The real trick is that the work is fundamentally a tableau. I like my characters to develop, to possess hidden (TO ME) traits; that is to say, I care much more for a story that evolves. The problem is, The Scarlet Letter has and does none of these. The characters, from about the third chapter, are as revealed as they ever become. I sat through the entire book waiting for something to suprise me, for some prediction to prove false, BUT IT NEVER HAPPENED. Take the worst qualities of ancient Greek fiction -and even samples of Shakespeare (predestination, the end is basically known from the beginning)- and remove nearly all traces of excitement and drama. Those two happen to be what makes getting from the start to the finish of those pieces enjoyable.I don't know what makes people love this book so. It represents many extremes (high morality, deep religious piety, clear boundaries of good and evil) that, while different from much of current \\"cultured\\" literature, are no better for their excess than any modern, overly-muted, grey-area tales.The overdone symoblism begins to irritate a reader, particularly when they have recently been reading many of the generally acknowledged classics (as numerous highschoolers have). Interpreting is all well and fine, but for even the mildly observant reader, the meaning of EVERYTHING is carefully explained at one point or another. Where lies the educational value in that?I also happen to think that the current new audience, that of my generation, have a wholly different perspective on the story than the people who originally dubbed it a classic. In the story, I found my own interest and empathy to be in and with Pearl, the fairy-child. Her caprice is the only wisp of life, of vibrancy, that I could find. My personal world is niether as austere, melodramatic, or dull as the place this book wishes to send my mind, so I miss the passion that might have been there. All I read is the art of the words.Lastly: Nate's opinion of the Puritans as a whole is blatantly transparent to anyone who takes the time to notice. This day and age, I already have enough people, places, and things that I'm subconciously being taught to hate without reason. I can live my life without the bitter thought that my own country was based in the ideals of the harsh, drab, and narrow-minded weevils Hawthorne paints the Puritans to be.In summary: in The Scarlet Letter, Hawthorne exquisitely delivers an utterly hamhanded tale. I dont need to be told the moral of a story at the end, thank you very much."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Frankly, in reading the negative reviews it is clear to me that there is a growing body of illiterates among us. It seems too, that the more a book makes one think the more negaive review it receives from some readers.I do agree that this particular Kindle edition is cumbersome to navigate due to the format but it is still an exceptional book and very worth reading. Not only is the character developmet quite thorough and enjoyable but it gives us a glimpse of the society in which it was written. What I always find fascinating is that this, like most other classics, is about human nature, power and the consequences of actions. So in the end these themes are enduring and feed our desire to look into the hearts and souls of others- to be voyeurs-which is what makes a classic a classic."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I was always skeptical when teachers used the term \\"classic\\" when referring to a book. It always seemed to me to be a term to describe books I had to read that were going to suck. The Scarlet Letter was a happy exception; one that actually has meaning today as it did when written.I really enjoy historical fiction. Hawthorne easily puts a reader into the time period by laying out the facts of puritan life and laws, the dress of the time, as well as with the old-fashioned dialog. Hestor's husband is \\"away\\" at sea and she has become pregnant. Normally, adultery would carry a very severe punishment, but the town can't prove her husband is alive. So, she is forced to wear a scarlet \\"A\\" (for adultery) on her chest whenever she's in public. This stigma will pass on to her daughter, despite her innocence in the matter. Hestor's stoic perseverence in the face of this humiliation is even more poignant when you learn who the father of her baby really is. This tale of a town forcing its morality on a person is still valid today. Women aren't forced to wear a scarlet A (at least in the US), but we still label people who are different or don't conform to our values.Unfortunately, at the time this was written, authors were paid by the number of pages in their books. Readers can easily guess this caused uncessary bloating in stories and this book suffers the same. There is a lot of description and fluff that I found myself skimming over, but the heart of the story is still excellent. This tale is powerful and meaningful. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Hawthhone's \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is literature at it's finest. The attention to detail for both settings, and especially the thoughs of the characters will chain you to this book. Sin, regret, guilt, self-punishment, and revenge are all detailed in relation to an extramarital affair resulting in a pregnancy. The symbolism is beautiful, the plot tragic, the characters engaging. The \\"Scarlet Letter\\" is a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"As an eleventh grader I was assigned The Scarlet Letter to read. When I finished, I was glad I had read it. It was a great book which had me guessing, or should I say wondering all the time. It was somewhat hard to read and completely understand. Published in 1850, there were words and sentence usage I wasn't familiar with (having CliffsNotes helped a lot), but the plot and points Hawthorne made were wonderful. It was a little confusing trying to figure out how Hawthorne felt about certain aspects such as; sin, adultery, Puritans, and whether or not he thought Hester and Dimmesdale were right or wrong in the things they did. Not knowing his thoughts are what make the novel the way it is. It was fascinating to see Hawthorne's use of symbolism in this novel; the way he would take something simple, such as the letter A and turn it into the focal point of the entire novel.If you like mystery, scandal, and an all around classic read The Scarlet Letter!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The story of hester is by itself a master piece worthy of its highly commended status, however the annotated version really helps the reader understand the historical references and many archaic words."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Although this book can be challenging to read I find it extremely well done.

If it had been assigned in school I don't think I'd have made it through."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"*Spoiler Alert*I really enjoyed this book. At age 41, I decided it was about time I read \\"the book\\" I somehow avoided reading in high school. It is interesting to find that it represented something entirely different from what I believed. This is not a social commentary on single parenthood or adultery. Rather, it is a comparison of choices and their effects.Regardless of who we are, each of us has something we believe in. We don't have to share the values of others to see how their beliefs drive the consequences of their choices. We can learn from them, even if we don't agree with them.This story contrasts the choices made by the three main characters: Hester Prynne, Reverend Arthur Dimmsdale, and Roger Chillingworth. Each sin against his/her own puritanical beliefs then make choices that profoundly affect their lives.Hester has an adulterous affair with another man. With the birth of her child and an absentee husband, her sin is laid bare for everyone to see. As punishment, a scarlet \\"A\\" is fashioned that she is always to wear upon the breast of her gown. This letter was to represent the stigma of her crime and compel others to treat her as an outcast. Hester lives her life and never stops trying to atone for her sins. In fact, near the end of the book we find that others have started to look upon the \\"A\\" with another meaning, \\"able.\\" She tended the sick, gave assistance to the poor, and offered comfort and relief to souls on their death bed. The \\"A\\" became as Mr. Hawthorne said, \\"the symbol of her calling.\\" (p183) Once rejected and ridiculed, she was now a respected member of her society. Hester, openly, took responsibility for her actions and never again sinned against her beliefs. She found true healing to her soul through service and compassion of her fellowmen.Reverend Arthur Dimmsdale, Hester's pastor, is compelled to pass judgment on her soul. In addition, he is called upon to persuade Hester to give up the name of her fellow-sinner. From his words to her, it is obvious that he is the guilty party. His words, coming from the depths of his soul, confess his part in her sin. He, in effect, is begging her to help him out of his cowardice to stand, once again, in the light. He says, \\"Take heed how thou deniest to him--who, perchance, hath not the courage to grasp it for himself--the bitter, but wholesome, cup that is now presented to thy lips!\\" (p77) After Hester refuses to speak his name, he makes the decision to secretly retain his guilt and gives his soul over to darkness. In the seven years that Hester transforms into a respected member of society, Arthur's guilt causes him to physically become very fragile and weak. In the end, though he finally frees himself from the burden and reveals his secret, he dies. He throws away everything he believes in, and preaches about, to dishonesty, cowardice and fear.Roger Chillingworth, the absentee husband of Hester, shows up the very day she is publically shamed in front of the community. She sees him, while she stands publicly humiliated on the scaffold. Mr. Chillingworth is an old man and admits to Hester that marrying her was wrong. He does not condemn her for her transgression saying, \\"Between thee and me, the scale hangs fairly balanced. But Hester, the man lives who has wronged us both! Who is he?\\" (p85) When she refuses to tell who he is, Roger promises her that he will find out. In addition, he demands that she tell no one of his true identity as her husband. She agrees. Thus, Roger sets in motion his plan of revenge. He recognizes that the pastor is gravely ill and moves in with him. As he investigates he is certain that Reverend Dimmsdale's illness is connected to Hester. He learns the truth one day when the pastor is sleeping. He discovers the \\"A\\" burned onto his chest. With satisfaction, he turns his plans for revenge directly on the pastor. As he comes to his greatest moment of triumph, he is robbed of it when the pastor confesses publicly his sin. Kneeling on the scaffolding, with the Reverend close to death he says, \\"Thou hast escaped me!\\" For seven years Roger's life has been consumed with revenge; after being robbed of it, he dies within the year. Hatred and revenge steal the life he could have known.The purpose of Hawthorne's text is to show that we become a product of our choices--choices governed by our own beliefs. No matter what those beliefs, if we violate their laws, the consequences will be profound. Our strength of character will shine through as we respond to the consequences of our actions. Through those responses we have the potential of gaining or losing many things, including: our self-respect, our reputations, our souls, and even our lives. In short, how we respond to unfavorable consequences will make us stronger or eventually destroy us."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"How dare I review a classic?

I remember reading this book in high school and thinking it was a fantastic read. I'm sure high school kids all around the country are still reading this book today."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter\\" by Nathaniel Hawthorne is a story that takes place in the Boston, Massachusetts in the seventeenth century in a Puritan settlement. The story starts off with a young woman by the name of Hester Prynne being lead from the town prison with scarlet colored embroidery A on her chest and a newborn baby to the center of the town to be judged and scolded by the town's ministers. Hester had been sent to Boston by her husband whom she was to later meet up with however her husband never arrived with many thinking that he was lost at sea. During the time that Hester was waiting on her husband she met someone, had an affair and now had a baby out of wedlock and she was being punished for adultery. Hester's punishment was to wear the scarlet A and public shaming because she refused to tell the identity of her child's father.When Hester was taking the shameful walk to the center of the town an elderly man by the name of Roger Chillingsworth wanted to know what the young lady was in trouble for and one of the crowd bystanders told him that it was for adultery. Soon it is revealed that Roger Chillingsworth is the husband of Hester Prynne that everyone thought was lost out to sea. Roger Chillingsworth was now in Boston practicing medicine and set on getting revenge on his wife. Roger then revealed his true identity to his wife Hester however he makes her swear to secrecy and not tell his true identity.The puritan community tried to take Hester's daughter Pearl but with the help of a young minister by the name of Arthur Dimmesdale Hester is able to keep her daughter and live on the outskirts of town. Arthur Dimmesdale however had suddenly come down with a heart problems and health was steadily declining. Chillingworth moves in the Dimmesdale so that he can provide around the clock care for his patient while at the same time trying to see what information he could get from out the minister because he had suspicions about the minister and Hester.One Night when Hester and her daughter Pearl were returning home the found Arthur Dimmesdale standing on the scaffold in the center of the town trying to punish himself. Pearl, Hester and Arthur held hands and during this time of the story we find out that Arthur is the father of pearl. Pearl asked her father to publicly acknowledge her and when he refused a dull red A light up the night sky. Hester then asked Chillingsworth to stop adding to Dimmesdale torment that he was taking himself through and Chillingsworth so filled with anger and revenge refuses to. Hester planned a meeting with Dimmesdale in the forest because she figured that Chillingsworth knew she was going to tell Dimmesdale that Chilllingsworth really was her husband. They planned to go to settle in Europe and raise their daughter Pearl there and live as a family. They were supposed to leave in four days and the day before they were supposed to leave Dimmesdale delivered his best sermon and Hester found out that Chillingsworth had found out about their plans and had bought a ticket on the same boat to follow them to Europe.After leaving the sermon the minister saw Pearl and Hester standing on the scaffold in town so he went up there and joined them revealing a red A on his chest and publicly announced that he was Pearl's father. Then Arthur falls dead after Pearl kissed him. Chillingsworth was so angry with revenge that he died a year later. Pearl and Hester left Boston and many years later Hester returned alone to live in her little cottage on the outskirts of town still wearing her scarlet A. When she died she was buried next to Dimmesdale and they shared one headstone that had just a scarlet A on it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The classic psychological romance novel, \\"The Scarlet Letter,\\" offers panoply of moral dilemmas that make the book influential today, but Nathaniel Hawthorne presents a detailed, if unfavorable, portrait of Puritan society in the 1650s that makes the novel engrossing to buffs of American History. The challenging vocabulary and obscure historical references make this story a bit harder to for today's readers to digest, but this classic is worth the effort to read.The Chamberlain Brothers edition from Signet Classics is loaded with extras. The ten page introduction from a professor of Modern Literary and Historical Studies at Union College gives the reader some insights into Hawthorne, and explains the Preface and The Customs House that precede the actual 24-chapter symmetrical novel. The signet version concludes with a short story, \\"Endicott and the Red Cross,\\" which introduces the scarlet letter punishment and provides the basis for some early scenes to the \`Poverty Row\\" movie that accompanies this book.The DVD of the 1934 production of \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is a nice accompaniment to the novel, since it is largely faithful to it. A short afterword by a screenwriter, film producer, and teacher compares and contrasts the movie's adherence to Hawthorne's story, and provides interesting insights into the actors that star in the movie.TheCliff's Notes to Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letterserved as a useful companion to the story. Rather than lug around a dictionary to look up complicated words, the Cliff Notes made it easy for the reader to look up the challenging vocabulary in the story. In addition, the obscure historical references are explained in the context to the story. The chapter summaries were also useful, particularly in deciphering the middle chapters (9-11), which focus on the psychological battle between the two male main characters of the novel.Hawthorne's portrayal of Boston in the 1650s includes several real-life characters who were Puritan administrators, such as Richard Bellingham and John Winthrop. The Puritan Clergyman John Wilson was also a real-life character, as was the Puritan Missionary to the Indians, John Eliot. Even the character Ann Hibbins was the sister of Governor Bellingham, and was executed by the colony for witchcraft. Although Hawthorne's use of these real-life characters was a literary device to make his story appear more real, they also help the reader understand some of the important personalities in the Massachusetts Bay Colony.Reading classic novels such as this one help the reader obtain useful cultural details that the history books don't necessarily provide."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The beauty of this book rests in its simplicity. On the surface, the story might seem dated (even out of date) and a cliche, but it's not. The sheer clarity of the writing, coupled with the wonderful characterizations and unparalled setting, make this a riveting read on many levels. I also enjoyed Harper Lee's &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird,&quot; &quot;The Bark of the Dogwood&quot; by Jackson McCrae, and &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; by Fitzgerald."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet LetterSet in Boston in the 1640s, The Scarlet Letter is the story of three people who suffer for their wrongs and a strict Puritan community which enforces obedience. The author, Nathaniel Hawthorne, writes the story of Hester Prynne, Roger Chillingworth, and Author Dimmsdale who each commit wrong and suffer for it.The Scarlet Letter begins before the door of a jail on a gloomy day in Puritan New England. Hester Prynne, a woman who has committed adultery, is being led out to public view on the town scaffold. According to Puritan law, Hester should have been burned on that scaffold for her wrongdoing, but the townsmen have been merciful to let her live. However, she must always wear a scarlet letter A, made of her own needlework, as a symbol for adultery unless she tells who her partner was. She refuses to divulge this information and is dispatched to live awall the town in a cottage in the nearby woods. There she keeps herself busy working as a seamstress and raising her daughter, Pearl. During the same day that Hester was viewed on the scaffold, a physician named Roger Chillingworth appears in the town. The townsfolk immediately think him to be a blessing, for their well-loved minister, Arthur Dimmesdale, seemed to be growing weak, and a well-learnt physician was what they thought he needed. Unknown to all the townsmen, Chillingworth was Hester's rightful husband. When he sees her on the scaffold for committing adultery he vows to revenge her partner. This kind of revenge reduces him to a kind of demonic work which he begins on the minister once he becomes his live-in physician. The minister seems to be suffering from something more than physical infirmity. Hester Prynne begins to feel bad about her own quietitude and tells Dimmesdale who Chillingworth really is.I think that this a good book for anyone interested in reading an exciting story that has a moral lesson too. It contains some particular information about Puritan Boston although it is not an in-depth study on this matter. Nathaniel Hawthorne also wrote The House of the Seven Gables, a novel that takes place in the Regional New England era. It is also a good book and contains a moral lesson."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I first read The Scarlet Letter in high school-required reading of course. Even though I enjoyed other works by Hawthorne (\\"Rappaccini's Daughter\\" for instance), getting through \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" was true drudgery. At that time, the book's wordiness and description density got in the way of the plot. Also, I thought the Rev. Dimmesdale was a dwerb (I still do). It wasn't until my son transferred to a new school and complained about having to reread the book that I picked it up again. If he had to suffer through it twice, I figured I would too--and it was worth it.This time around I listened to the book on tape. It was a much better experience. Yes, the characteristics I had complained about earlier remain-the density of description relative to action, the seeming irrelevance of the long prologue to the body of the book, and the antique language and culturally alien setting. But hearing the words rather than seeing them on the page gave them an immediacy and an impact that I had missed earlier-there were even (gasp!) occasional hints of humor in the turn of a phrase. In fact, Hawthorne seemed strikingly modern in his understanding of the subtleties of character; notions of guilt, repression, and revenge; and even his thoughts on the role of women.As a writer, Hawthorne frequently made use of supernatural themes and references to convey psychological truths. \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is no exception. Chillingsworth's researches are those of an alchemist; Mistress Hibbins believes herself a witch; and Pearl, Hester's preternaturally perceptive and occasionally perverse child, is compared to an elf. These Gothic elements are descriptions of the exterior world, but they help form our understanding of the interior world of the characters on which the plot of the book turns. Chillingworth's vengeance, because it-like the work of an alchemist-- is undertaken by choice, is seen as far more evil than Hester and Dimmesdale's adultery, a sin of nature and love. Hester's acceptance of her crime and its punishment becomes her strength. Dimmesdale's decline, in contrast, results from his own weakness and guilt in not acknowledging his role in the illicit affair. Hawthorne's description of his descent into a madness that destroys both mind and body is a stunning and even clinically relevant piece of writing.All in all, \\"The Scarlet Letter \\"is not an easy book and definitely not a book for everyone. But for those who are willing to undertake its complexities of language, allegory and symbolism, it is an extremely rewarding one."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This book will enrage you, and help you understand the characters more then you ever thought possible.

As classics go, this is definitely one you shouldn't pass up."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Warning: Some minor parts of the plot revealedThe first thing you will notice when you start reading this book is the words used. This book will certainly drain your mind, and force you to look up many words they used in Nathaniel Hawthorne's time, but are not used today. The work pays off though with a good story.It tells the tale of what happens after an adulterous affair between a young women (Hester Prynne) and a preacher (Dimmesdale) in Boston's Puritan society. Chillingsworth (Hester's husband), a scholar from England, comes into the story when Hester is being punished in front of the town. He makes it his mission to find who did this with his wife.The story turns out to show what guilt and revenge can do to people. Chillingsworth and Dimmesdale are both affected by their obsession. Both men allow their obsession to put both pysical and mental pain on them. The effects can be seen in their actions and how they deteriate.This is a story you will long remember. Do yourself a favor though, have a dictionary close by. I warn you: Do not expect an easy read."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Two months ago I had never even heard of Nathaniel Hawthorne or his famous novel, The Scarlet letter. I feel that the novel was very helpful to me. After studying the time period in which the Puritans lived in both my History and English class I feel that I got a good sense of what life was like for the Puritans. This book was certainly not the best book I have ever read. The book was great for a book that you have to read in highschool. i thought the plot moved along quickly in this story. I feel that nothing really ever happens in alot of those books that we are forced to read. This novel is diffrent. If your about to fall asleep something will happen in this book that wakes you up. There are elements to this book that constantly keep you thinking and wondering who did what? or who is who? or what!?Besides just being a decent novle, this novel is fun to analyze.I had alot of fun pulling this book apart with my english class.I realized that something as simple as a rose bush can mean so much for the meaning of the story and the lesson it teaches. This book taught me alot about sin and what sin is all about. I I learned that sin can have some positive affects. Many positive things happened in this book through a child that was a product of sin.This book was a pretty good read. I wouldnt go read it again, but I'm glad I read it mainly becasue it taught me alot. For a book that you are forced to read in school I give it 10 stars but it is definatley not one of the best books I have ever read. I think you will enjoy it for a book you read in school.Happy reading!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I'm sure most of you have heard of the book by Nathaniel Hawthorne, &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;. Hawthorne weaves a tale of hardship, struggle, and victory as we follow the life of Hester Prynne, a woman who has had a child out of wedlock, whom she names Pearl. She is shunned from the community, refuses to confess the identity of Pearl's father, and is forced to wear a letter &quot;A&quot; on her dress, the symbol for adultery. Fighting against the stifling and hypocritical ways of Puritan life, Hester rebels in her own way, first by embellishing her letter with fine embroidery. This book gives us a look at what it is like to live in Puritan America from not just a woman's point of view, but a so-called &quot;sinner's&quot; point of view as well. As we read this book, we come to see how the letter becomes a symbol of strength and freedom for Hester, in a fight against facades of piety and hypocrisy. A very good novel, and Hawthorne does a wonderful job in the portrayal of his characters. Another little known fact, Hawthorne's grandfather was a judge at the Salem witch trials and Nathaniel was so embarassed by the affiliation, that he changed the spelling of his last name to distance himself from his grandfather and what he stood for. A very good novel, definitely something that everyone should read. Besides, don't you want to know the identity of Hester's lover? Go and read this book!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Many claim that classic literature is a relic of the past that has no relevance to the present, however, Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter perfectly depicts how classic literature is classic because it is timeless and not simply timely. We do not live in the Boston, Massachusetts of the mid 1600's, when people were cruelly ruled by hypocritical Puritan law, nevertheless, persecution, \\"sin,\\" truth, justice, mercy, revenge, isolation and perseverance reign as powerfully today as they did over 200 years ago.In The Scarlet Letter, Hawthorne beautifully develops the story of Hester Prynne, a young woman who dares to violate the public appearance of Puritan propriety, by bearing a daughter out of wedlock. She is forced to wear the ignominious letter \\"A\\" upon her chest as a constant reminder and lesson to all, of the burden of sin. The reader follows Hester through seven years of suffering, persecution, and isolation, to find that she is far more sinned against than she has sinned. The truly provocative idea in this book, however, is that it is one of the first books in which the reader sympathizes with the supposed culprit, and only Hawthorne's masterful use of symbolism and allegory do honor to such an undertaking."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"In its prime, there never was a strip like Dick Tracy. With rare skill and inventiveness driven by a personal fire, this comic blazed a new trail in subject matter.

However, I have to mention that since the sunday strips were not included in this reprint, stories in the strip's prime have gaping holes that those colour ones were supposed to cover. It is not fatal, but it hurts the collection.Otherwise, if you want to see what this strip at its best was like, then this can be a good example for you.
