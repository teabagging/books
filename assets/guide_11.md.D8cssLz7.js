I truly hated this book, didn't understand it at all, at all. The symbolism, the racism, the class system, the whole period of the British raj - it all went right over my head. Then, to discover it in adulthood! Well, it was an awakening. It was as if I'd never read it before, and indeed on most levels, I hadn't. What really happened in the Marabar Caves? Was it an assault? A dream or hallucination? An actual rape? Nothing? A case of mistaken identity? This mystery, unanswered at the end, lies at the heart of A Passage to India. We have Muslims, Hindus, and the British Christians mixing within the society. Dr. Aziz is a good and gentle man, a friendly, open-minded, highly educated Indian who is eventually accused of assaulting a British women - and that sort of thing doesn't go over well with the high-mucky-mucky of the era. According to the political sensitivities of the era (1920s), there's always bound to be trouble when you mix the races within society.Passage to India presents British colonialism at its worst with a marvelous and deeply-layered cast of characters. This is probably Forster's best book."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Set in the British colonial outpost of Chandrapore, this novel begins slowly ,examining the complex relationship between the British community and the native Indian population. The underlying arrogance and prejudice of the club membership Brits is established early on through the eyes of two newly arrived women who are insistent on seeing the \\"real\\" India. They have stepped into a situation that they don't quite understand and the delicate balance of the community is nearly shattered by events which occur during an innocent enough day trip to a nearby attraction.Forster's book is a serious fictional account of how people of different backgrounds can live in close proximity but still have little understanding of each other when the cultural divide is kept intentionally wide. One of the better novels I've read on the subject of British Imperialism."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"I kept waiting for this novel to begin. Forster sets the scene, develops the characters, creates tension (not dramatic tension; just tension), and then...And then the characters realize that the tension isn't going to be easily resolved and decide that the best course of action is to abandon the effort and drift aimlessly for the last 100 pages or so towards an unsatisfying d&eacute;nouement. I was almost finished with \\"A Passage to India\\" when it dawned on me that the novel's climax was long past and I'd somehow missed it. I still was waiting for the story to begin. I eventually resigned myself to the fact that Forster's intent in \\"A Passage to India\\" is to describe a situation rather than tell a story. Yes, there is a plot of sorts, but Forster's real aim is to depict two cultures at an impasse at a particular point in history: 1) indigenous Indians chafing under British occupation in the early 20th century, yearning for independence but unable to envision a unified nation of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs; and 2) British colonists determined to maintain the status quo, and genuinely convinced that their presence in India is necessary because the natives are incapable of ruling themselves. Forster's refusal to provide the reader with a sense of resolution serves a symbolic purpose, emphasizing the impossibility of bridging the cultural divide so long as the relationship between the British and the Indians remains one of ruler-and-ruled. The novel's unconventional structure (the climactic moment takes place relatively early on; the novel's chief dramatic complication is never worked out; loose ends are not tied up) also serves a purpose, underscoring Forster's view that there are no easy answers to the complex racial and cultural issues examined in the novel. However, though these elements may be useful from a symbolic perspective, they make for frustrating reading.The novel's action takes place in the fictional Indian city of Chandrapore, which is under British colonial rule. There is a great deal of latent hostility floating around Chandrapore. The native Indians resent the presence of the Anglo-Indians and engage in subtle acts of rebellion against them while maintaining a surface-level politeness. There is friction between Indian Muslims and Indian Hindus, who do not understand each other. The British colonists, most of whom regard the native inhabitants as inferior beings, are deeply suspicious of the few Brits who treat the Indians with respect. Finally, there is painful awkwardness in each and every attempt at social interaction between the friendly Anglo-Indians and the natives. Courteous gestures are misinterpreted and come across as insulting or gauche. Conversation is strained, rife with blunders and cultural misunderstandings. The tension is palpable. Reading about these social failures becomes agonizing after a while and the reader begins praying for a reprieve, hoping for just one successful picnic or party or even a few moments of stress-free small talk. But the prayers go unheard. Forster is unrelenting, and there is no relief. One-third of the way through the novel, I began developing a nervous tic.Often in my book reviews, I complain that the author didn't spend enough time on character development. Forster certainly cannot be accused of this, particularly when it comes to his Indian characters. If anything, these characters have too many layers, too many contradictory qualities; they are too multi-dimensional to be quite believable. I got the impression that Forster was trying to embody the characteristics of an entire country in a handful of characters, to convey all of the nuances, complexity, and contradictions of India herself through them. It doesn't quite work. For example, the character of the Indian physician Dr. Aziz tells us much about Forster's view of Indian Muslims - they are emotional, touchy, mercurial, proud, fond of practical jokes, impulsive, insecure, wary of outsiders, pious, tied to their land and culture, etc. - but Aziz as a person, as an individual, is lost along the way. He becomes too diffuse to seem real. Forster achieves more success with the character of Cyril Fielding, a British man who tries to maintain a friendly relationship with the native Indians. Fielding's personality undergoes subtle and not necessarily positive changes during the course of the novel. These changes, which are connected to the novel's larger themes, are revealed in a deft, understated manner which highlights Forster's skill as a writer.I am glad that I read this novel. It certainly was not a waste of my time and it gave me some insight into what life was like for both Indians and the British during this particular period of British colonial rule (tense!). However, I'm a little puzzled as to why it is hailed as one of the greatest books of the twentieth century. To me, this is the weakest of the Forster novels I have read."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Two well-meaning English women - Mrs. Moore and Adela Quested - go to India some time during the first two decades of the last century with the desire to see and experience the real India. They do not share the disdain for the natives that prevails (except for the schoolmaster and freethinker Cyril Fielding) throughout the community of British administrators who govern and run the nondescript town they visit, and they accept an overture of friendship from a Moslem, Dr. Aziz, in the form of a tour of a local geological curiosity, the Marabar Caves. But the expedition to the Caves goes awry in numerous ways, culminating in a mysterious insult to Adela Quested, which leads to charges against Dr. Aziz, a trial, civil unrest, and further polarization of the British and their colonial subjects.The most common and most facile reading of A PASSAGE TO INDIA is as a critique of imperial Great Britain, its colonial policies, and its treatment of the native Indians. And in fact the novel is an understated but nonetheless searing indictment of British imperialism as well as expos&eacute; of British racism. It is one of the foremost \\"anti-colonialist\\" works of literature. But it is much, much more. It is one of the richest, deepest, and most multi-faceted novels I have ever read - and one of the very best.E.M. Forster borrowed the title from Walt Whitman. In 1868, Whitman, excited by the soon-to-be-completed Suez Canal (and similarly excited by the transcontinental railroad in the United States and the undersea transatlantic cable), wrote a poem \\"Passage to India\\". He celebrated these technological and engineering developments, and not simply because they facilitated trade and transportation. More important, they enabled\\"The earth to be spann'd, connected by net-work,The people to become brothers and sisters,The races, neighbors, to marry and be given in marriage,The oceans to be cross'd, the distant brought near,The lands to be welded together.\\"In his exuberance, Whitman also expressed the further hope that these developments provided passage to \\"more than India\\" - to wisdom and even to God.Another facet of Forster's novel - in addition to the anti-colonialist one - is as a rueful rejoinder to Walt Whitman. For A PASSAGE TO INDIA highlights the gulf between East and West, between the suspicious mind of the Oriental and the \\"hypocrisy\\" of the Westerner. Cyril Fielding (to my thinking, the principal character of the novel, who surely is modeled in many respects after Forster himself) believes that the world \\"is a globe of men who are trying to reach one another and can best do so by the help of goodwill plus culture and intelligence\\". A noble and enlightened sentiment. But try as he might, despite bounteous goodwill and culture and intelligence, Fielding is unable to bridge the gulf with Dr. Aziz, the novel's most prominent Indian (though a Moslem with an Afghan heritage).And it's not just the West versus the East, or the British versus the Indians. Even amongst the Indians, there is a divide between the Hindus and the Moslems, and between the Brahmans and the non-Brahmans. But that is not all. On a personal level, even among individuals of the same race and culture, there are repeated failures to connect, failures of communication.And still, I have barely scratched the surface of the novel. It has a depth and complexity that makes me think of the best of Joseph Conrad. (I wonder what Conrad thought of it, assuming he read it.) A PASSAGE TO INDIA also touches on the broad concepts of religion and civilization and the even broader ones of Infinity and Eternity; it raises, implicitly, the question of whether humanism is illusory; at times it assumes a rather mystical atmosphere; it contains marvelous descriptions of India (on a par with those of Kipling); etc. That \\"etc.\\", by the way, is not so much laziness on my part as a signification within the confines of an Amazon review that the novel is extraordinarily rich.In addition to all that, the underlying story is a very engaging one; the novel's major characters are fully and sensitively developed; and it is gracefully, and superbly, written. I first read it more than 35 years ago. I have been spurred to re-read it because my youngest son is currently reading it as part of his high-school English class - a very wise choice of curriculum indeed. A PASSAGE TO INDIA may be even more relevant to today's world than it was to the world of 1924. Moreover, it is a masterpiece of English literature - certainly, one of the very finest English novels of the 20th Century."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"E.M. Forster is truly one of the giants of early modern literature with his novels that bridge the gap between the traditional and the much looser modern forms. \\"A Passage to India\\" was the last book published in his lifetime, the concluding chapter in a brilliant career centered around a handful of novels. It makes one wonder if Forster had felt used up after the subjects he tackles in \\"A Passage to India\\" or if he felt that he could do no better.\\"A Passage to India\\" is set at the peak of the British colonial era and is rife with the racial tension that lurks beneath every mean aspect of daily life. It is the tale of various characters. One of the main characters is Dr. Aziz, a Moslem Indian who desperately wants to befriend certain English people but knows he may be overstepping his bounds. One Englishman he successfully befriends, for a while, is Mr. Fielding, the principal of the local school who seems not to have developed the racist attitudes of the other English people who dwell in Chandrapore. It is also the tale of two visiting women - Mrs. Moore, an old Christian lady who innocently befriends Dr. Aziz by accident. She has brought with her Adela Quested, a young woman eager to see the \\"real\\" India who finds that she will not do so if she agrees to marry Mrs. Moore's son, Ronny. In an attempt to bridge the gap between the races, Dr. Aziz sets in motion a series of events that will have near-fatal consequences for himself as well as those he tries to befriend.Forster had a rare gift for storytelling that is natural and unforced. His writing is a mix of subtle humor and astute observations about human nature, raising questions of philosophy and religion in an attempt to ponder the nature of racism that bored so deep a root in British colonial India. What is remarkable about \\"A Passage to India\\" is that while it is set in a very concrete time and place, the themes it raises transcend time and offer some insight into present conflicts. It is easy to see why \\"A Passage to India\\" is considered to be one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century, for Forster was at his peak form in this eloquent ode to the impossibilities and the improbabilities of friendship."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"This is an excellent book, but it is not the easiest of reads. If you do not understand Hindi, then you may have learn a few words, but there aren't too many. I do not think that the novel has a straight-forward moral that says, &quot;The English are bad. Good bye.&quot; Instead, the novel shows the ambiguity of human life and the fact that there is no column in which you can put all of the good guys and another in which you put all of the bad guys. The characters in this novel are complex and show different weaknesses. The book offers excellent insight into the world of colonial India and the many different social strata that existed.This book is best read in long sections - don't read a few pages or one chapter at a time. I hope you enjoy it."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"This was one of those books with which I could tell after a half hour that I would love it forever. It is hard not to sympathize with the characters. This is a story of humanity constrained by artificial barriers; of love, friendship, spirituality, truth, and the problems they face from hatred, jealousy, deception, and pride. Forster is clearly a close observer of numan nature and his words resonate with our own lives and thoughts. The caves made me think as much as anything I have encountered in literature. This book has all the elements of a captivating novel - plot, imagery, narrative, characters. Though there may appear to be some thin characters and a reductionist view of good and evil, it is all to an end. And there is a very strong message - evil there may be, but there are stronger bonds it cannot break. It is up to us to fight the forces acting to destroy those bonds, forces that are within us."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"A passage to India was a very good book. It is artfully portrayed. And the author has richly described the land. The author's idea of having the English being friends with the Indians is a concept that was revolutionary for his time.

The whole concept is enthralling."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"One review said that entire sections were missing so I contacted Rosetta books and they said that comment was not true, that the entire book was digitized. I loved the David Lean movie and I am very much enjoying the book."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"This classic by E. M. Forster was written in 1924 but could have been written today, for its complexity of viewpoint on the issues of empire, race, cultural divides, and the possibility or impossibility of friendship under those conditions. I found Forster's viewpoint quite modern--there are no good guys or bad guys in this book, just human beings, some hopelessly blind to anything that doesn't fit with their world view, some bumbling along in an effort to break the stereotypes, some honest, some not.Two Englishwomen arrive in India and resolve to experience it without the prejudices their compatriots exhibit. The picture Forster paints of the relationship between the English and the Indians, and how the English change once they arrive, is quite compelling. The English are masters of the subtle put-down, avoidance of eye contact, keeping staff waiting. They smile indulgently at the ladies' desire to meet real Indians and experience the country, knowing they will change quickly. A trip to the Marabar caves turns into a disaster, quite predictable, with everyone accusing Aziz, their escort, of assaulting Miss Questead. No one knows what really happened.Miss Questead changes her story at trial and Aziz goes free. But no one knows how to handle this unexpected turn of events. One would think things would go back to status quo. But the trial has unearthed all the conflicting feelings the races have for each other--the English are convinced of Aziz' guilt based solely on the fact that he's Indian, the Indians are confirmed in their view that the English cannot be trusted. Miss Questead is ostracized for telling the truth, the Indians break off their small attempts to form friendships with their occupiers. Aziz retreats from all contact with the English and irrationally suspects his only English friend of betrayal.In the end both sides retreat, but ominous signs of a profound conflict to come are all around them. Knowing the history, we see that the eventual ouster of the English is inevitable--what is amazing is that Forster saw it more than 20 years before it happened."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"I picked up E.M. Forster's classic work as just something to read while on a trip. Having not seen the movie nor knowing anything about the novel other than the recommendations of others, I was surprised and at the same time disappointed. While I enjoyed the details of period India and the basic plot of the book, it was a bit of a slow read for me. Some classics don't hold up well to modern times. Why I can't say. This is a great but somewhat dated book. I'm sure anyone interested in history and period locals will find A Passage To India much more appealing.BJ NeblettElysian Dreams: Where the Past Meets the Present"},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"This novel opens new vistas in a previously unknown landscape at a vantage point of another century.

It's easier then say - Tale of Two Cities, but it's ambigous and open-ended leaving nothing wrapped up in the end exceppt your mind on what might happen."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Written in 1924, this book offers an excellent presentation of social constructs in Colonial India from both the British and Indian perspectives. It was fascinating to see how various actions and situations were interpreted by members of the two different civilisations. When one reads this book keeping in mind the period in which it appeared, it is amazing to note just how ahead of its time it was. Ideas presented, such as the notion that India might one day be a nation instead of several very different groups of people-Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, are really quite revolutionary. While events did not transpire quite as the book may have alluded to (Colonial India was made of up the present-day nations of India and Pakistan, which came about after a very bloody war- hence two nations not one), they are nonetheless far ahead of their times.While I encourage everyone to read this book for the very candid insights into the mindsets of British Colonials and Indians of the time period, I did not give this book a 5 for several reasons. Firstly, the use of many foreign words (of Urdu origin I presume), while adding flavour to the story also made reading a bit difficult as I was unfamiliar with many of them, and could not find them in and English dictionary. It was a bit confusing as many of the words were not explained. Secondly, in my opinion there were large passages where nothing of import was said. This, unfortunately, did not add to the reading experience for me. This aside, I do think it is a book worth reading, especially for its status as a modern classic and the unique point of view from which it is written."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Forster makes a lot of wonderful points highlighting the relationship between imperial England and India.

For a good half of the book I was fully expecting a nicely written standard story of colonial injustice. Thankfully, the story turns a different way and is thus saved from what at the time might have been controversial, but now is merely banal commentary. Forster's writing is decent, and he did a really good job of conveying the psychologically confusing aura of the place. However, the ending is very weak and oddly done compared to the rest of the book. I'm glad I read it, but I don't foresee reading much else by Forster."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"The plot is simple and average.

It starts so promissing, so unusual. It takes you to a different world and different time and you expect a fine journey. But somehow as the story progresse I was still waiting for some more excitment, more interesting characters, developing of deeper feeling. But unfortunately I never found it in this book. The language, the discriptions of India are beautiful. But I expected so much more from it! It's like those Marabar caves around which the plot revolves: you see them from far away, think about them, find them beautiful, but when you come to visit them they are just caves with nothing to make them special.There was nothing special for me in this book, except that everything in it happened in India. And I can understand why so many readers are struggling through it.The major plot is flat, the characters are plain and uninteresting, they look like cartoon caricatures sometimes. There are a lot of possibilities to make this story shine like a real gem stone. But Forster didn't use any of them. Though I appreciate his idea, his wonderful work over the details and mastering the dialoges."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"This having been praised as one of the great works of literature, I thought I was in for something more enriching.

I really tried to like it. Perhaps I've played too many video games, but it was just extremely plodding, and the dialogue was not interesting enough to justify its length. It's a shame because it's books like this that make me shy away from reading more &quot;classic&quot; literature, some of which I really love, but some disappoints me as Passage did.

This was a \\"must read\\" book for our Lit course in high school, and I remember that we had a hard time comprehending the contents of the book. All the nuances of the book were lost on us! We were puzzled on why Dr. Aziz was treated the way he was. We did not fully comprehend on EM Forster approach to India, and the British in India. Forster liked to visit India if I recollect correctly.A few years later, I watched the film, and many of the loose strands came together in my mind. Sometimes, a visual interpretation of a book helps, and it certainly did for me. But, my confusion never really went away because of the way in which the novel ended. It was left to the readers to decide what had happened to Miss Quested in the caves, and having Dr. Aziz along on the trip certainly did not help him.This book might be a difficult read if the reader is not informed about India, and how the nature of the colonial rule went through some fundamental changes in the early 20th century.EM Forster writes well, and it might be worth reading because of that. Hopefully, you will not be confused like I was when I read the book. I have not had the heart to read the book again. One of these days I just might, and then maybe I shall post a revised review of the book."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Forester portrays India through a few main characters in an Indian city called Chandrapore. He describes an incident concerning an English school teacher, a local Muslim doctor, and two English woman. He tries, and the keyword here is &quot;tries&quot;, to show the racial and cultural tensions between the English rulers and the Indian locals.The way the people are presented in this book is a joke. The main character, Aziz, is laughable. He's unbelievably subservient. Also, the portrayal of Hindus is almost clownlike, and the English are presented as extreme snobs. Forester's India should not be taken as a true representation of India at all.The first half is barely readable. The language is not too fluid, and the action is slow. One of my main gripes is that Forester interludes a lot dialog without referring to who is speaking. It's quite disconcerting. The second half is much better. It concentrates on a trial, and the aftermath on friendship. I was able to read this half in one sitting.The story itself is enjoyable. The aspects of justice, prejudice and friendship penetrates this novels story in every way. If this book was about some anonymous countrymen in an anonymous country, this would be well worth the price.I recommend this book, but as a story, and not as a cultural portrayal."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"I purchased this book for class. The teacher had given specific instructions for which edition to buy, although he himself was uncertain of all of the publishing details. One of them was page count. He had mentioned 362 pages.

This was not useful for my class when the professor wanted us to go to a particular page, which was often.The plot of the book itself is decent: the trials (literally) and travails of intercultural exchange in colonial India circa early 1900s makes for a decent read for a schoolbook. The dialogue was generally good, and the descriptive text evocative. At times, though, I wanted to throw my book against the wall. Some of the characters seemed pure caricature, annoyingly so, and I did not care for how Hindus were viewed at an authorial level.

Unfortunately, Forster lacks so much imagination in creating the story it is unbelievable! Forster (...) fell in love with an Indian living in England prior to writing the book. This young man would tell Forster about India and it's culture fascinating him to the point he had to write a book about it. This is what A Passage to India is about and nothing more, the writers fascination with Indian culture during British rule. The story is painfull, I repeat, PAINFULL! absolutely nothing happens, there is no climax, nothing worth ever remembering. Unless you are an English professor forget it! Shooting oneself in the foot would be less painfull than reading this book."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Ok, that I live in Italy, but even if a whole month's already elapsed, I haven't gotten yet this book...Honestly, I had hoped for a quicker delivery."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"I had to read this book in 10th grade for my history class and it was one of the worst, most confusing books that I have ever read in my entire life. For one, it was very difficult to understand who was talking because Forster's narration was incorrectly phrased, in my opinion. Secondly, all types of foreign vocabulary was introduced to me, and lastly--Forsters whole way of writing was just too complex. Then to add to all this, the story was not interesting at all. Who (but boring people, of course) cares about those boring people anyway. Maybe I didn't like the book because it was so difficult and I was not grasping the deeper meaning behind it. All I know is that this book was certainly not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"This book threatens meaning badly.DONT BUY THIS BOOK. NOW !!!(too bad it isnt possible to give less then one star)"},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"There is little I can say in this review that can't be found in other reviews: many readers have provided good summations of the plot, as well as appreciative commentary on Forster's prose, in their reviews of this novel. And, of course, there is the usual griping from students for whom \\" A Passage of India\\" is required reading. I can only offer this bit of perspective. Once, a few decades ago, the novel was required reading for me, too, and I recall liking it well enough to want to see the film when it came out. Then, \\"A Passage to India\\" gathered dust on my shelves for quite a while. Recently, I picked it up again, wondering how a novel published in 1924 would hold up, especially compared to some of the fine novels about India that have been published in the last decade: Mistry's \\"A Fine Balance,\\" Adiga's \\"The White Tiger, Roy's \\"The God of Small Things, Desai's \\"The Inheritance of Loss,\\" among others.It held up. I enjoyed it thoroughly, probably more than the first time I read it. So if it has been a long time since you read\\" A Passage to India,\\" pick it up again. And if you're at student struggling to appreciate it, finish the novel and put it away for a few decades. You'll like it better the second time. \\"A Passage to India\\" is one of those great books that, like Conrad's \\" Heart of Darkness,\\" is indispensable to an understanding of imperialism"},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Almost a century after the book's publication the most crucial problems it discussed are as current as they were during Forster's life. The impossibility of communicating across the divide of culture, religion, and race, seems to be even more alive then when he saw it. The value of the novel lies not so much in representing it but in the fact that Forster offers a way out - personal contact.The story takes us to India of the 1920s - we follow the path of a young Englishwoman who goes to marry a British official but wants to know \\"the real India\\". This she never achieves but she gets to know something by far more important - herself. Her inept attempts at connecting with India and Indians make other characters of the novel learn more about themselves, force them out of safe shells in which they lived. The lesson is painful but at least for some of the characters opens the door to a better life.There is little chance people will suddenly like Muslims, Pakistanis, gays, lesbians, Moroccans, Turkish, Kurds etc etc - there is a chance (a very slim chance, Forster would be quick to add) that a specific American and a specific Muslim, a Turk and a Kurd, an Israeli and a Palestinian can be friends. The world may not want it, the people that surround them may not want it but the results depend on us alone. If we do not try we only have ourselves to blame."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Beautifully written. this book's main character is not one person or even persons; it is the Anglo-Indian relations of early 20'th cen India; a story of hubris in men, easily riled, and a domineering government. written during the bridge between romanticism and realism, it is supremely realistic - showing the bare bones of humanity and nature,it is unromantic. Also,it is laced with oriental mysticism - which is not glamorized; merely allowed to appear briefly. a masterful work."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"A PASSAGE TO INDIA reminds me of an article by Gayatri Spivak, &quot;Can Subaltern Speak?&quot; If I am not mistaken, basically what Spivak says is that Subaltern cannot speak because the dominance will not listen whatever it says. Thus, subaltern's speech and voice lose their power as a method or medium to present themselves to a society governed by the dominance. Losing its voice, subaltern remains as a voiceless/ powerless existence. In this theory, certainly, subaltern is subject to the dominance, and the chain of subjectivity cannot be broken by subaltern.The English people in the novel seem to present as the dominance A PASSAGE, and Indians as the subaltern. The English people's conception/ conceptualization of Indians -- Indians are so uncivilized and uncultivated that they must retain as inferior to English -- are so firm and stubborn that it cannot change. Even Dr. Aziz who on some level is educated and civilized in the English measure, whom Forster seems to present as a protagonist to find an intersection between Indians and English and to tries to offer a certain possibility of reconciliation between subaltern and the dominant, is a mere Indian who cannot/ shall not &quot;be a channel of communication between two English people&quot; (83).Like many (post-)colonial writers, Forster seems to present power (economical and political) as a capability to define the others' identity, culture, and social role. Indians are simply defined as &quot;savages&quot; by English. No matter how educated they are or no matter how civilized (in the English/ European measure) they are, Indians are still savages who cannot be equally compared to any other English (the dominance). Dr. Aziz would be a good example of this case. The English also has the power to evaluate/ judge or even devalue subaltern's culture. The English conception of Indians, which Forster partially present throughout the book, is that Indians live in an unclean atmosphere, they smell bad, they are irresponsible so that they don't keep promise (ex. Indian ladies promise to invite Mrs. Moore and Adela to their place but do not keep the promise). Indians always remain as servant in the Colonial society. Regardless of their willingness, they are always subject to the English and their judgment. For example, Dr. Aziz dresses a shirt with collar when he rides a bicycle so that he wouldn&iexcl;t be stopped by an English policeman.What bothers me most in A PASSAGE was Indians' attitude toward the English colonization. Indians seem to me that they are pretty indoctrinated by the English colonial conceptualization/ ideology. Indians themselves often thinks in A PASSAGE like the English, such as these thoughts: they are incapable to do certain things, they are inferior to the English, or they should be happy as good servant to the English. They don't seem as challenging as many African American protagonists in African American (post) colonial writings. This bothersome brings me to think of Forster's intention of this novel as well. Does he insist a separation between two powers? Is he saying that subaltern and the dominance can never mingle together like oil and water? What does he want to say through this novel? What make this novel good literature? Is this because the novel accurately presents the inevitable reality?....Over all, the book offers me an interesting experience about Indians who have been strangers to me. Although having a couple of Indian friends, I have not thought about their colonial history and culture at all. This book makes me think in different areas that I have never adventured."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Deserving praise near and far, A Passage to India takes you to a world that isn't as far as you might think.Forster is able to create a beautiful novel about the perseverity of friends, the truth of colonization, and a stark look into the realm of Orientalism. Forster emerges from the book as open-minded and progressive as anyone could have been in the 1920s.In some ways similiar, yet vastly different, Forser explores the truth of India in many of the same ways as Africa was &quot;opened&quot; up to English readers in Heart of Darkness. However, A Passage to India is much deeper than I can express.If you want a look into a beautiful novel about friendships and relationships (loving and intimate). Then buy this book because I promise it will touch your heart and remind you of the sanctity of the human spirit."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"One reviewer mentioned that Forster probably never visited India. This is untrue...as he visited the country at length several times. His fascination with India started when he was a private tutor to an young Indian man that he fell in love with...his feelings were not reciprocated, however. He later went on to visit India because of those feelings. Just FYI."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Did you ever get the feeling that E.M. Forster didn't like people?That's certainly the feeling I got while reading this book. It's not that it's a bad book, per se, it's just that, well...you kind of get the feeling that Forster doesn't really care about his characters. Instead of pulling you in and making the characters come alive so that they are real to you, and familiar, and friendly, Forster tells his story as if he were a zookeeper describing to you the behavior of the bonobos. There is an unbreachable glass wall between the reader and the characters that makes it hard to connect with or relate to the story. To make matters worse, Zookeeper Forster only seems to describe the bad behavior of the bonobos. He dwells continuously on the bad traits of his characters. He seems to think nothing of ruthlessly pointing out their faults and foibles, and dwelling on them incessantly. He completely humiliates the characters in the eyes of the readers, thus making even the \\"nice\\" characters, such as Dr. Aziz and Mrs. Moore hard to like. The moment you do begin to like any of the characters, Forster immediately returns to his critical mode, and once again exposes and harps on the faults of the characters, driving you quickly back to your former \\"who cares what happens to Adela Quested?\\" feelings. All this combines to result in a cooling of the reader's interest...at least it did in my case. While the story is interesting, and not completely dull, it is hard to get really caught up in a story where you don't care about any of the characters. While I have read worse books, I have also read books that are much better, with more likeable and realistic characters, and more gripping plots. However, this book is a classic, and provides an excellent and compelling look at race relations in 1920s India, and so I would reccommend it for those reasons. But, on the other hand, you can get a better written and more enjoyable read with essentially the same plot by reading \\"To Kill A Mockingbird.\\" You'll like the characters better too."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"A book can be read and enjoyed (or despised) on many levels. I enjoyed &quot;A Passage to India&quot; because of its authentic historical flavor and largely accurate portrayal of the English colonial mindset.&quot;A Passage to India&quot; is essentially a trial of attitudes. These include the prejudice and disdain of the British toward their Indian colonial subjects, the fear and confusion the British experience when confronted by a cultural and artistic sensuality that vastly contradicts their own, and the hatred a victim feels toward his antagonists' entire race. The British accord the Indians with an inferior status and consequently are unable to treat them in a just or fair fashion. As a result, the British legal process becomes more of a persecution pageant than an instrument of justice. Similarly, the British cannot accept or comprehend the sensual quality of Indian art and culture. The stiff, repressed Ms. Questead is overwhelmed by her exposure to the erotic paintings of the Mahabara caves. When she experiences a mental collapse, the British assume that her condition is the result of sexual molestation and falsely accuse Dr. Aziz of this crime. When Dr. Aziz is acquitted he develops an implacable hatred not only for the British but also for his own attorney. Dr. Aziz's attitude is a direct response to his persecution and in this sense is, itself, a product of English colonialism.Eventually Dr. Aziz realizes that he must judge and accept English people on a personal and individual basis. To accomplish this, his attitude toward them must be based on his direct experience with individuals, not on either party's identity as a European or an Indian."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"This novel by E.M. Forster (1879-1970) was first published in 1924. E.M Forster had visited India twice before writing this novel, and had become an opponent of imperialism.Summary: Adele Quested visits India with Mrs. Moore in order to make up her mind about marrying Mrs. Moore's son Ronny. Adele wants to understand the 'real India', so she befriends an Indian: Dr. Aziz. Mrs. Moore, Adele and Dr. Aziz go on an expedition to the Marabar Caves which turns out to be a disaster. Mrs. Moore undergoes a psychic experience and never recovers from that, and Adele believes she was sexually assaulted by Dr. Aziz. After the arrest of Dr. Aziz tension arrises between the British and the local population in town. On the way back to the UK Adele admits that she was mistaken.The main themes in this book are the misunderstanding between Adele and Dr. Aziz, the mystery about what really happened during the expedition to the caves and the colonial rule of the British in (then) British India."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"This book is a book that is deeper than it first appears. It deals with the tension between the British and the native Indians of India, as well as with the tension between the Hindus and the Muslims. It also deals with the mystical in its portrayal of characters in search of the infinite and eternal. The book is divided into three sections which correspond with the seasons of the Indian year - the Cold Weather, the Hot Weather and the Rains. Each section of the book is dominated by each of the seasons. Each section also focuses on one of the three ethnic groups found in India during this time (1920's). They are Muslim, Anglo-Indian and Hindu. This is a very deep book, that has to be read at least a couple of times in order for the reader to pick up all the nuances."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"On the splendid visual backdrop of turn-of-the-century India, 'A Passage to India' is a timeless and classic masterpiece of English literature, poetically exploring relations between rulers and subjects, men and women, Englishmen and Indians. Forster's lucid style and unsurpassed technical ability comes together in a carefully crafted and delicately balanced work. With great sensivity and sincere love of the country, he conveys to the reader the full emotional spectrum of the cultural mosaic of India, from the most deeply felt pious devotion to various religious duties, to the unfathomable chasm of misunderstanding between natives and colonial rulers. On an higher impersonal level, Forster weaves an exact and finely constructed plot with almost supernatural undertones, as if the characters are drawn imperceptibly and unknowingly towards their fates by forces within the land itself"},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"There is much to appreciate in Forster's exploration of two cultures in A Passage to India. To what extent can British and Indian people coexist when you factor in beliefs and values? Are there biases that we form against outsiders, either internal or external? Forster undoubtedly raises important issues about colonialism, and the efforts of two sides to respect each other, and for this I can see the literary value and relevance attached to his novel.Still, there was something lacking about this reading experience. Part of it was the characterization. The characters were not only flat and forgettable for the most part, but also were unsympathetic and rather annoying. I know that Forster, to an extent, gave each of these characters flaws, but some of the main characters seemingly lose their heads and collective reason at the most inopportune times. Aziz is a curious one: his bitterness towards the British knows no bounds, yet his has this bizarre compulsive adoration of Mrs. Moore after only having seen her two or three times. The only one that seemed to have any sense was Fielding. Another issue was the dry writing style. The way it is written you feel so disengaged from everything that is going on. You feel distant from the experience, and hardly sympathize or care for these characters, even when Aziz is trying to uphold his name after being falsely charged. There's moments where the narrative moves at a plodding pace, especially in part one. It's only in part two that things finally get going, with the trip to the caves and subsequent trial.Forster is able to finish the novel strong, and there are some wonderful and poetic descriptions of the landscape, the Marabar Caves and Chandrapore, however this was still a mediocre read. As this was my first Forster book, I'm still anxious to try another one from him. In the end, I can see the literary significance of A Passage to India, but maybe it's a bit overrated."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Sam Dastor's reading/enactment enlivens this classic novel that lays out the contradictions of British colonialism in personal terms. Forster gives amazingly nuanced attn to the Indian (Moslem and Hindu) characters as well as the British principals. He navigates well between male and female characters and sensibilities - a hallmark of insightful gay artists, who find themselves between 2 worlds.The result is that the reader is able to view multiple situations, characters and attitudes, coming away with both the complexity of colonial society and the pratfalls - large and small - that its participants undergo as they try to hang on to status while seeking understanding. They also consciously MISUNDERSTAND things, with near tragic outcomes.The final chapter has a memorable encounter with Aziz and Fielding, a Moslem \\"vs,\\" an atheist Britisher, as they jockey (they're mounted!) for position and understanding. Not a neat ending, but a satisfying one.Dastor is brilliant in his characterizations, rivaling the guy who does the Harry Potter books, Jim Dale."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"The book was for Keylynne's class. It had a couple of markings in it but overall she is able to get the job done. Interesting book. Enjoyable!"},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"The first hundred pages or so move at a sluggish pace, but then, almost abruptly, it jolts itself into some very regaling story-telling.Events, characters, and their motivations are drawn and presented with an air of imprecision and almost comical exaggerations, which causes one to question the essential reality of the events as described."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"I enjoyed this book, as I had enjoyed the mini-series 20+ years ago. The twists and turns of the plot are carried off with aplomb, the characterizations are sharp (I guess -- there aren't any people today like the characters in this book, for a variety of reasons), and the dialogue is well-crafted. In the end, alas, it's a whole lot of fuss and bother about ... about what? It's never made completely clear. The fact that Forster was gay, and had to repress it, screams from every page; one just wants to reach in there and pull him into the 21st century somehow. It is abundantly clear that the relationship of Dr. Aziz and his friend the school superintendent is the only one about which Forster really cares -- and yet since this is after all a Victorian novel, Forster has to equip Aziz with a dead wife and a taste for Calcutta rent-a-ladys -- has to make him hetero, in other words. Everyone says, \\"This is a novel about sexual repression,\\" and that can't be disputed; however, it's not first-rank stuff, and Forster himself knew that. At times things just sort of lumber along, and the machinery is visible. Still, if you're interested in India or planning a trip there, this is an excellent way of finding some things out about the country's history. Forster fouls his own nest -- he hates the English -- and if that sort of thing doesn't bother you, you'll be just fine with \\"Passage to India.\\""},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"This is a classic tale by E.M. Forster about the clash of cultures in British India after the turn of the century. This book is one series of misunderstandings after another that ironically convey the feelings of people in these places at the time. The most dramatic misunderstanding of the book leads to a very harsh and dynamic climax that leads readers to really understand the repercussions of what was happening in India at the turn of the century.At first I found E.M. Forster's writing style to be very different and it took me some time to get used to the way he writes. I don't think I can accurately describe how he does it but his topics are so to the point but still portray so much meaning and depth. Once I got used to this style, I found this book to be beautifully written and crafted with the perfect balance of humor and irony plus times of complete sadness, anger and despair. Similarly, the cast of characters in the book are all rich from the enlightening Dr. Aziz, and the nave Adela Quested to the characters that display the most humanity: Mrs. Moore, Mr. Fielding and Professor Godbole. I can understand perfectly why this book is considered to be one of the important reads of the 20th century as it gives readers a very clear and dramatic picture of what India must have been like during British occupation.Even though E.M. Forster claims that one can never understand India or describe what it is really like, I felt like I was able to get a very accurate portrayal through the eyes of all of the characters in this book as they all see aspects of the land, times and the native people differently."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Along with the Raj Quartet, A Passage to India tells you everything you would ever want to know about life in India under the British Empire -- both from the points of view of the Brits and the Indians - and it tells you all about it in the context of extraordinary human experiences and traumas.The point might be that you need not be interested in -- or even heard about -questions of the Empire or whatever: this is an extraordinary page turning drama.No wonder A Passage to India still sells year in, year out, today --- 87 years after it was first published.Robert BottomeCaracas, Venezuela"},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"A Passage to India, written by E. M. Forster in 1924, is on many short lists of greatest novels written in the 20th century, and deservedly so. It is a period piece, set in the British Raj of the 1920s. It is rich in imagery and symbolism, focusing on bigotry, hypocrisy and mistrust among the various nationalities and religions present within the story. Idealism, naivety and human nature also play parts.At its heart, is the friendship between the Muslim Indian professional, Dr. Aziz, and the English dowager, Mrs. Moore, who has accompanied her son's presumptive fianc&eacute;e to meet him in Chandrapore. Aziz, Mrs. Moore and Mr. Fielding, a British schoolmaster, struggle to bridge the abyss existing between the British and native cultures. For their troubles, they are punished, each in distinctive ways.Having seen the movie, an excellent flick by the way, I was intimately familiar with the tale. The Victorian style of writing, however, really brought the story to life and breathed life into the characters. Some may find the writing too florid or archaic for their tastes, but I found it beneficial in setting a mood for the story.While the driving force behind the book is the social interaction (or lack of) and the cultural divide between the British administrators and what they view as their morally and intellectually inferior native Indian subjects, a subtext is the mistrust and tension existing between the Hindu and Moslem religious communities.As Aziz becomes increasingly disenchanted with his British overlords, he begins to fall in with Indian nationalists. The question of the viability of an \\"Indian\\" state, in the presence of such a politically, ethnically and religiously fragmented populace is periodically raised. Very perceptive writing, coming as it does over twenty years prior to Indian independence, civil war and ultimately partition."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"I enjoyed the book; I found myself engrossed in the story and eager to find out the ending. The 3 stars are more for character development. Very few of the characters, or their relationships, were believable to me. An example: Aziz develops a deep affection and respect for Mrs. Moore -- feelings important to the overall plot -- however, they have only met maybe 3? times. Ok, maybe Aziz is an open-hearted man but Mrs. Moore's son also says Mrs. Moore 'loved' Aziz. For me, it required the willing suspension of disbelief. Miss Quested's revelation about the case was surprising and not well explained. Convenient, it seemed. Even Aziz's and Fielding's friendship suddenly existed without much foundation amid a great deal of misunderstanding and awkwardness.However, the picture the book paints of colonial India and the behavior of the British was fascinating. I felt despair on behalf of Aziz and intense frustration and dislike of the ruling British. The book certainly transported me, despite the issues I have with it."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"I have just finished reading this book in my Indian Lit class, and although it was a challenging read, it was satisfying, and well worth the effort. Forster gives us unbiased, amazing descriptions, as well as mystical and mysterious adventures in ancient caves. This does not fall into the &quot;good beach read&quot; category....one must concentrate, discover, and question...the rewards are well worth your time!"},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Whether you visit another country the intent is often to \\"see\\" the place. But how does one go about it? What can you learn of place from the geographic features or urban landmarks and settings? What can you learn from talking with the locals? Can you ever really understand them?These are some of the questions that Forster uses to shape the message of his novel. Some of the English in \\"A Passage to India\\" seem to feel that they can get a feel for India by physically experiencing some of the geography. Others believe that it is possble by meeting and talking with the Indians. Yet either approach is stymied one way or another - India is vast in its geography, cultures, languages and religions. \\"A Passage to India\\" asks readers what are the barriers to and limitations of to comprehension and even friendship between peoples in an environment of unequality under colonialism and diverse cultures?\\"A Passage to India\\" is Forster's parable of race and identity and the locale of India, as a crossroads of cultures, provides a remarkable apt setting for getting his points across. The plot is slim but detailed, the timeframe in which the events occur is specific, making the pace of the novel relatively easy to follow,read and analyze. There are a handul of characters in the novel, which allows Forster to more fully develop them. In their dialogue many of the themes that Forster explores and points of view that he relates - the colonial English and their Indian subjects - come out in complex, rich detail.Moreover, since the novel is set in India on the verge of its independence, other questions present additional complexities. How do countries with various, strong ethnic and cultural identifies form a single nation? This theme emerges as Forster delves into dialogues between the indigenous characters who all share superstitions, fears and misgivings about one another based on ethnicity, culture and religion but above all share a strong, common loathing of the British. Is a distrust and dislike for \\"the other,\\" the \\"outsider\\" strong enough to build a national identity? Read \\"A Passage to India\\" and think through this question and others. These questions are relevant to today's societies as they were to the India Question in Forster's age."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"E.M. Forster's 320-page novel probes the intimate workings of the human heart and mind, especially when brought into the stark, Victorian contrast of cross-cultural prejudice. Set in India during the Raj (British imperialsim at its height and worst), the story reveals how Anglos strive to maintain a proper distance from the natives they felt destined to rule. The frustrated Indians--themselves fragmented by religion and caste--struggle in various ways to be accepted as fully-accredited persons by the dominant race, who dismiss them categorically as &quot;niggers.&quot; Each sub-society seeks to perpetuate its social survival, for self-image is precious to all members of humanity. Still the Anglo community has a long memory of perceived disloyalty, while that of Indians is even longer. Despite decades of uneasy coexistence between the Masters and the Conquered, sparks of rebellion quickly ignite when fanned by the flames of confusion, false accusation, racial bigotry and social polarization.The two naive Englishwomen who have booked passage to India should have read a manual on social survival skills; it simply will not Do to upset the proven status quo--however it seems tipped in the favor of Western power. The herd instinct must prevail or all is lost; woe to those Anglos who defy experience and tradition in dealing with treacherous, scheming, unreliable or childlike natives. Whom to trust and whom to defend--whom to choose as a loyal ally, a friend or even a life's partner? How can one make these critical decisions in an atmosphere of mutual suspicion,cultural snobbery and religious extremism?The normally straightforward British lifestyle is suddenly complicated in a myriad ways as soon as one is transported to the steaming sub- continent. What is it about India which brings out the worst or hidden weakness of the British? Is it safe, wise or even possible for natives to seek lasting relationships with Anglos?Will it ever be an equal partnershp? Can the East truly accept and peacefully coexist with the West and vice-versa? This is a novel of deep instrospection, as readers are forced to analyze the devastating ripples of human error and frailty. Despite many instances of captivating dialogue and fast-paced events, PASSAGE TO INDIA remains a classic psychological novel."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Miss Quested and Mrs. Moore are good Brits in turn of the century India. They have the best intentions and want to meet real Indians and see the real India. When Dr. Aziz takes them to visit the Marabar Caves, they seem to be penetrating deep into the heart of India. However, Miss Quested is overwhelmed by the caves &amp; accuses Aziz of attacking her &amp; for all their good intentions, they are shown to be just as incapable of understanding Indians as the worst of their fellow Brits.This is certainly the best of Forster's novels. The clash of cultures makes for interesting reading. However, after a century of decolonization and independence, it's legitimate to ask whether places like India are better off today, as independent nations, than they were in 1900, as colonies. Forster makes the point that the English will never understand the Indians &amp; can never be friends with them, but will Hindus ever understand Moslems &amp; can they ever be friends? More importantly, even if the English never could befriend the Indians, wasn't their governance, at least, enlightened &amp; constructive? Whereas, the Hindus who feel actual hatred towards the Moslems (&amp; vice versa) have governed in a backward and destructive manner? Should ethnicity be the deciding factor in who governs a country or are governing principles (democracy, capitalism, religious tolerance) more important to the welfare of the population?It seems to me that Forster &amp; his ilk bet on ethnicity &amp; events have shown them to be catastrophically mistaken.GRADE: B"},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Excellent story.

I can certainly think of a good many novels I'd rather read or reread. In the film version, the novel's exotic setting springs to life, of course, and that is 99% of the novel's appeal. Otherwise it is a rather dull social drama, which bears remarkable resemblance to the inter-sex squabbles D.H.Lawrence was so good at. Americans have a need to be liked that prevents them from going for the jugular in quite the same lacerating way the English can, unless, of course, it is with a knife. This novel is really about the disappointment women feel for their hypocritical men: husbands, brothers, and fathers. The ladies saw through the facade of English decency and authors like Lawrence (a woman-hater) and Forster (a man-lover) were on to it. Their men promised to treat Indians as though they were Englishmen but, of course, never did. Nor did they treat their women as ladies. Everybody except white Englishmen got ordered about senselessly and the women recognized the stupidity of it all and the mindless inhumanity of it. This is Forster's subject really, and when they go at it, his men and women sound astonishingly like the characters in \\"Women in Love.\\" They could be anywhere, no where. By putting them in India, Forster created a classic."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"I think this is the first book I have EVER put away without finishing.

SNOOZER!"},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Forster's portrayal of Dr. Aziz is exactly how Indian men behave worldwide. They have this vague notion that White women are very 'available' and in the process end up either being slapped for indecent propositioning or worse- get jailed or deported from foreign countries"},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Forster writes this book taking the history of India for granted. He does not cater to the needs of his western readers, rather, he tries to portary a short event in Indian history. This book leaves India misunderstood-to the western reader-and makes an Indian angry."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"How could a novelist with as high a reputation as Forster take such a major theme and make so little of it? British rule in India and its consequences constitute one of the most interesting and important aspects of world history. It is strange, therefore, that British novelists have rarely tackled the subject. But if this is the best they can manage, then it's probably no bad thing. Forster has no insight to offer on the nature of colonialism; how it affects the characters of the exploiter and the exploited; on the nature of racism; on conflicts of culture; or, indeed, any of the major themes suggested by a subject such as this. None of the characters seem fully realized, and the Hindu festival in the final part of the novel seems to me particularly embarrassing. Perhaps it's time that novels written in Indian languages were translated into English: they are bound to offer more insights than this hugely disappointing book."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"E.M. Forster paints an exquisite picture of India during the era of British Imperialism. His language is beautiful with many stylized passages that create vivid mental pictures. The pages are full of rich and detailed images that I have found unparalleled in many cases.But I do not understand how this book can be praised as much as it is. Beautiful prose is like movie cinematography. Great cinematography can make a good film greater, but if the movie is bad to begin with, the cinematography, no matter how excellent, cannot help the picture. Forster seems intent on portraying the conflict between the English culture and the Indian culture, and while he does an excellent job, this is all he does for 362 pages. The brief extent of the plot is approxamately one-third of that and hardly interesting.The plot, to summarize, constitutes the assult of an English woman in the Marabar Caves by an Indian. The Indian is arrested and put on trial. The trial ends with the English woman saying that she was hallucinating and the Indian is acquited. The briefness of this whole incident appeared to me as if Forster was scared of delving into a trial and wanted a quick escape.The most disappointing part about this is all the preparations for the trial. The English collect all these pieces of evidence to use against the Indian, but nothing is ever used. I, for one, was hoping for a nice trial, where we could have a little interesting action. Nothing on the scale of Grisham, I don't expect Forster to have a law degree, but let's actually PROVE this man's innocense instead of just saying &quot;he didn't do it&quot;.I can understand how some level of praise can be given to this novel. Forster does have good prose. And after having multiple years experience with English teachers and professors, I know that they enjoy figurative language and it's applications in a novel. I enjoy it myself, too, but not to the same extent. A story with a good plot is much more valuable to me than a story that is packed with figurative language and colorful prose.I could not, under good consciousness, recommend this book. Despite the prose, this novel is a tiresome read and focuses almost all of it's time on the clash between the British and the Indian cultures, and while that does provide for some well-rounded uses of irony in a novel (some of the best I have seen) the whole premise gets boring and overused after the fourth chapter. Forster could have been more successful with this novel had he expanded more on the trial and used the culture difficulties to enhance that, instead of the reverse."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"This book never grabbed me the way I had hoped it would. None of the characters is particularly engaging, and indeed some are barely tolerable. This is a 360 page book that reads like a 600 page book. I'm not what you'd call a plot-junky, but this book was just too slow and too boring. There are only three or four memorable scenes in the whole book, and only one of them possesses any dramatic tension. I think Forster set out to make a statement about relations between colonial power and colonized people. Certainly he accomplished that, but then again he could have done it in a page or two. Instead he threw together a mediocre work of literature to demonstrate his point."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"I first read this book about 20 years ago and it blew me. At the risk of sounding culture-vulturish, I would say that it is not only a novel, it is music with its leitmotifs, it is architectural in its structure and it is a book with a profoundly (sorry about this overused word)humanistic point of view.I disagree, strongly with other reviewers who have reviewed this book as a political manifesto. Forster does not condemn the English in India, but rather by allowing us to be flies on the wall to their behaviour and attitudes he allows us to observe them. The condemnation is ours. I don't feel that Forster wrote this novel in order to conform to today's political correctness and to point out &quot;Gee, weren't the English nasty&quot; or &quot;Aren't White Anglo-Saxons dreadful&quot;.The English in India are a convenient metaphor for his themes of inclusion and exclusion, acceptance and rejection, love that comes from knowledge and acceptance or hate that arises through fear and ignorance.Don't read this book with a mindset of &quot;What is going to happen at the trial&quot; or Whodunit. Within the first few pages of the book, the central question around which this novel revolves is posited - &quot;Can an Englishman and an Indian become friends?&quot; and by extension can any two people break down the barriers and come together in friendship. Read the book with this question in mind."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"I read this book when I was thirteen and fell in love with it. It is my favorite classic that I have read yet. It is a story of racial tensions in the steaming, exotic land of Chandrapore, India, where the British have a Cantonment with clubs, and the natives have villages with muddy roads and mosquitoes, and are expected to submit to the will of their dominators. Yet in the early 1900's, at the time Gandhi was still in South Africa, after two centuries of British rule, the native people, Hindus and Muslims alike, are growing tired.When Adela, a young woman engaged to a British magistrate, and Mrs. Moore, the magistrate's mother, come to India to plan for the wedding, they are hopelessly enthralled and terribly naive. When Dr. Aziz, a young Muslim physician, meets Mrs. Moore in a mosque, he is charmed by her reverence in that she took off her shoes upon entrance. From here, a great friendship is formed. Adela, too, desires to befriend the natives, yet her efforts are regarded with contempt by both British and Indians, as both sides know and agree that it is impossible to be friends with both natives and Europeans. Only one has suceeded in that account, and his name is professor Fielding, known as Cyril by his students. A single, eccentric college professor, Fielding teaches Hindu and Muslim university students, while still mingling with British socialites. When he meets Adela, he too, scorns her aspirations. Thus, he also warns his Muslim friend, Dr. Aziz, not to bring her to the Marabar Caves.It was supposed to be a very simple excursion to one of the most beautiful sites in local India. Aziz had not really meant it about taking Adela and Mrs. Moore there--had thrown it out as a casual suggestion--but being British, Adela and Mrs. Moore take him at his word. The trip turns to disaster, though, when a mysterious figure tries to rape Adela in one of the caves. Since no one has seen the attacker and no one can account for Aziz's whereabouts, he is soon blamed. In a climax that is chilling yet realistic, A Passage To India shows us what the best and worst of human nature and human prejudice can lead us to."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"The love-hate relationships weave throughout this book to an extent unlike any other that I have ever read.Major characters and young lovers, Adela Quested and Ronny Heaslop, love and hate and love and finally part from one another. Their engagement sizzles out in the heat of the Indian summer. Other major characters, Dr. Aziz and Professor Fielding, are great friends, to the point where Fielding severs relations with his separatist British friends in honor of his wrongly arrested Indian friend. But, through strange facts and circumstances, Aziz begins to hate, then detest and ultimately love him again.Perhaps the greatest love, with no hate, is Mrs. Moore. She loves Indians - not just India. Indians respond with a loving chant of her name - Esmiss Esmoor. She rises to the divine. But, alas even she must demure to the almighty British imperialistic state - this is a 1924 novel when India and Britain were in a love-hate relationship of their own.This novel is Forster's great rebound. Thought to be a severely suffering writer-blocked novelist, he could reach no more for Italy to spur him to the typewriter (\\"A Room with a View\\" and \\"Where Angels Fear to Tread\\"). Unlike \\"Room\\" or \\"Angels\\", he does not deliver an ethical question to the reader as handled by British aristocracy. The moral or ethical question here is directed to all Brits -- rich or poor, new to India or born to India -- and asks if what they do to others is devastingly harmful, let alone inappropriate.Divided in the three parts, the book sets you up [Part I: Mosque], slams the British [Part II: Caves] and sums it up [Part III: Temple]. To his credit, Forster's delivery of this book may have been as recklessly brave as Fielding's protection of Dr. Aziz - the British with whom each associates would not kindly take to each's allegiance to the \\"other\\" side.Much akin to America's great \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", this novel deals with the classic trial of a great citizen of the oppressed who allegedly acted wrongly to one of the young white women. Unlike \\"Mockingbird\\", this book concentrates more on the victim of the allegations and allows him to receive true justice - the white woman in this trial has a great deal more character and saves his day.I can only wonder how this book affected Britain. Like Upton Sinclair's \\"The Jungle\\", people were probably enlightened by this book's revelations. British people would have had to discuss the atrocities contained within the pages of this novel and social change would inevitably follow. Written strongly with great drama, this book unfortunately remains applicable to today's world and probably still would be discussed if delivered to themainstream reading masses."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book (even though it was a requirement for school!), but it left my mind a &quot;muddle.&quot; I've searched the web for commentary and analysis, but haven't found much. Along with the intricate themes and messages of the book, I was intrigued by the character of Mrs Moore. Can she legitimately be called an individual on the verge of an existential crisis? She starts out as such an understanding, loving, religious figure, but progresses toward an apathetic one. The Caves obviously affect Mrs. Moore to the very depths of her soul and being. She wonders if there is anything in life that really means anything at all. She feels physically sick. She is emotionally withdrawn from the rest of the characters in the novel. She believes Aziz to be innoncent but does not speak out or make her opinion known; as if she feels, &quot;what difference would it make?&quot; So, although Mrs. Moore realizes that there is no inherent meaning to life itself! , she never gets the chance to create her own meaning after her existential crisis. I'm not sure if this is a correct analysis, but it intrigues me. Maybe other readers have been curious about the same thing."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"&quot;A Passage to India&quot; is one of those novels many of us avoided reading in high school. You know the ones on the &quot;Recommended&quot; book lists? We were wrong to have avoided this one so long. The novel takes place during the colonial occupation of India. An Indian doctor is falsely accused and imprisoned for the attack of an English women. It is a multi-layered story about how cultures clash and predjudice repels and destroys relationships. The author, weaves elements of Indian language, religions, and customs into the story from his travels to India.DO READ this book if: -You like a story with a moral. -You enjoy exploring subtle symbolism. -You like to read and ponder as you go.Do NOT read this book if: -You can't be bothered learning a few foreign words. -You like to read with &quot;put your brain on hold&quot;. Those who are unwilling to carefuly reflect on what happens in this book will be very disappointed."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"When I read any worthwhile book, I write down memorable quotations in my Moleskine notebook in an attempt to fight the inevitable mental atrophy that comes as college recedes further into the rearview mirror. With this book, I wrote down over ten pages' worth--yes, it was that good, and there are so many choice phrases I despaired of trying to find a representative one and hope you will instead discover them for yourself. It was funny, it was painful, it satirized the British while also inspiring sympathy for any people out of place in a land not their own.I was slightly skeptical at how relevant a book about the British Empire could be sixty years after Indian independence, but like any great book, this one both evoked its time, and spoke with timeless lessons (and on second thought, a few decades is an eye-blink for one of the world's oldest civilizations). As long as we have different civilizations coming into conflict on this planet, this book should be required reading."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Set in India during the British colonial era (and published twenty-some years before Indian independence), Forster tells the story of an Indian surgeon, Dr. Aziz, and his sometime gratifying, sometimes harrowing, and always complicated interactions with the British. He also gives the perspective of several of the British residents and guests, and through this ensemble assembles a compelling picture of how colonialism affects the colonialized, the colonializers, and the relationships between the two. Some of the ideas remind me of Paolo Freire'sPedagogy of the Oppressed, in which he explains the dehumanizing impact of an oppressor relationship on both the oppressor and the oppressed.The prose is beautiful, and Forster contextualizes his message with lively dialogue, beautiful images of rural India, demonstrations of the difficult relations between Hindus and Muslims, and other elements of conflict within Indian society as well as between the Indians and the British. The story isn't fast-paced, but with a little patience it draws you in. And the language is delicious. I listened to the audiobook narrated by Sam Dastor, and he does a very good job with distinctive voices and accents in a book filled with essential dialogue (except in the one paragraph when an American missionary makes an appearance; his accent was unlike that of any American I've ever met).A reviewer for The Guardian wrote when the book was first published in 1924 to \\"congratulate him [Forster] upon the tone and temper of his new novel. To speak of its \`fairness' would convey the wrong impression, because that suggests a conscious virtue. This is the involuntary fairness of the man who sees.\\" Forster's vision is well worth reading.[The Guardian review is available online: C.M., \\"A Passage to India,\\" Guardian Unlimited, June 20, 1924.]"},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"A great book, but this version is marred by far too many typographical errors; moreover (and what's worse), entire sections are missing!"},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"At its core A PASSAGE TO INDIA is a darkly pessimistic view of the future between India and Great Britain. When E. M. Forster published it in 1924, England had but recently begun to divest itself not only of its overseas colonial empire but also the attendant mind set that was proving more difficult to eradicate. Many English still believed, even if subconsciously, that Indians, in their swarthiness and what to the English seemed like their grubby living conditions in Bombay were utterly incapable of carrying on in any meaningful way without the constant assistance of Britain. It was against this background that Forster wrote of the bitterness and harsh feelings that he saw as deeply ingrained on both sides. Ironically, for those who view his book as a raw but honest portrayal of this mutual acrimony, Forster himself is guilty of the same underlying assumptions against which he so eloquently rails.The dramatic focus begins with Dr. Aziz, an intelligent Moslem physician who sees the English as arrogance personified but is inclined to think that with a growing understanding and compassion, the walls of prejudice may be breached and India and England may co-exist in reasonable harmony. He is aided in this belief by his association with Mrs. Moore, a liberal Englishwoman, and Cyril Fielding, an equally understanding principal of the British Government College. However, when Aziz attends a bridge party given by various English personnel, he is rudely treated and is humiliated, causing him to rethink his earlier optimism. The climax of the book occurs when Aziz invites Mrs. Moore and her friend Adela Quested to visit the mysterious Malabar Caves, where wind and echoes resound. During their trip, Adela hears the wind and becomes disoriented. She later claims that Aziz assaulted her, a crime for which he is arrested and tried in court. This trial becomes a national event, and when Adela recants her accusation, Aziz is freed, but he is terribly embittered, and India itself sees the accusation as yet another example of English condescension. The novel ends with Aziz breaking all ties with his friend Fielding.Early in the novel, Forster clearly states his belief that it may not be possible for English and Indians to live in harmony. He suggests that in the early and friendly relations between Aziz and Fielding such a harmony may be realized, but as the book's events reveal, that this harmony is but an illusion, as wispy as the sounds echoing from Malabar Caves. The friendship between the two is not strong and is based more on shared philosophical goals than personal affinities. During the course of the bitter trial, this friendship proves incapable of supporting the strain and is finished. The other liberal, Mrs. Moore, is conveniently spirited out of the book so she need not testify on Aziz's behalf. When Forster closes with Aziz defiantly proclaiming that he is now staunchly in the camp of those who oppose social reconciliation, there is a tendency to overlook what undercuts what otherwise might be Forster's surface sadness at his view that matters between England and India are irreparably breached. Forster is so relentlessly insistent in his belief that this gap is permanent that the reader begins to wonder whether Forster's reasons lie more with subliminal agreement with the \\"white man's burden\\" rather than any objective assessment of undeniable fact. Further, when he allows Mrs. Moore to so conveniently avoid helping Aziz during the trial, Forster may simply have found the path of least resistance and thus not have to worry about questioning his own underlying assumptions. The problems, then, in identifying and confronting the issues that Forster raised in 1924 are as elusive today as were the echoes that resonated so loudly in the Marabar Caves the day Adela Quested opened that can of racial worms."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"At the end of A Passage to India, the British hero, Cyril Fielding, and the Indian doctor, Aziz, attempt to fully reconcile and restore their friendship before they part ways for good. With that their horses swerve apart, the path divides, rocks jut up and all the obstacles, from the sky to the town below \\"said in their hundred voices, \`No, not yet,' \`No not there.'\\" Forster, like Kipling, wrote of an unbridgeable gap between East and West.Cyril Fielding is an educator who as the audacity not to take the British stance that Aziz, a respected doctor, tried to violate Adela Quested in the Marabar caves. What really happened is the book's question, and to show its complexity we visit the world of the British club, and begin to understand its expatriate members and their opinions on the locals. We see the national challenge that the Hindus and Moslems face with each other, and are privy to what to many would be a very confusing Hindu worship ceremony. We also hear and see the perspective of the nationals to the Britons and to their control, and see them dream and strive for some type of workable nationalism. Written in an engaging prose and helped by solid character development, A Passage to India is the work of a gifted writer. I discovered Forster by confusing him with C.S. Forrester, the author of The African Queen, and discovered that I was familiar with his works from the films A Room with a View and Howard's End, both adapted from his books. Forester was an insightful writer of the human condition, and I was impressed with many of his comments:\\"Mrs. Moore did not take the disappointment as seriously as Miss Quested, for the reason that she was 40 years older, and had learned that life never gives us what we want at the moment that we consider appropriate. Adventures to occur, but not punctually.\\"\\"There is no harm in deceiving society as long as she does not find you out, because it is only when she finds you out that you have harmed her; she is not like a friend or God, who are injured by the mere existence of unfaithfulness.\\"\\"Most of life is so dull that there is nothing to be said about it, and the books and talk that would describe it as interesting are obliged to exaggerate, in the hope of justifying their own existence.\\"\\"She was only recommending the universal brotherhood he sometimes dreamed of, but as soon as it was put into prose it became untrue.\\"\\"Although her hard schoolmistressy manner remained, she was no longer examining life, but being examined by it; she had become a real person.\\"\\"After 40 years' experience, he learned to manage his life and make the best of it on advanced European lines, had developed her personality, explored his limitations, controlled his passions-and had done it all without becoming either pedantic or worldly. A creditable achievement, but as the moment passed he felt he ought to have been working at something else the whole time-he didn't know at what, never would know, never could know, and that is why he felt sad.\\"The question of the Marabar Caves is the central point around which the book revolves. Yet as important are the cultures, history, religions and way of life between groups of people, all expressed adroitly by Forster. As he himself said, his work is \\"about something wider than politics...about the universe as embodied in the Indian earth and the Indian sky.\\""},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"A chance encounter between Dr. Aziz and two English ladies at a mosque in Chandrapore, India would be uneventful if the elderly Mrs. Moore hadn't been so taken with the charming young doctor, and he with her. Mrs. Moore and her future daughter-in-law, Adela Quested, are captivated by the country on their visit and want to see more of the real India. Unfortunately, they get more than they bargained for during a planned visit to the Marabar Caves outside the city, which leads to misunderstandings and courtroom drama that changes lives forever.A Passage to India is E.M. Forster's most famous novel and for good reason. The book says a great deal about British attitudes toward the Indian culture and people during the 1920's. Forster portrays a love-hate relationship among key players. The difference in cultures and lack of understanding is superbly drawn, as is the barely concealed disdain between the British and locals. You can almost feel the simmering animosity threatening to erupt into a full explosion.The book is fairly long at 421 pages, yet I wished I'd known more about how secondary characters dealt with the aftermath of the trial. Forster barely mentions some of the characters afterward, which is a shame. Still, this is my favorite of his collection, and well worth reading."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"While not my favorite Forster story, this is still perhaps my favorite Forster novel. If you consider his articulated and thorough denouncement of British Imperialism in the context of India at the turn of the last century, the power of the book really comes through. As ever, Forster's language flows like fine silk. His characters are all accessible and understandable. And of course, no one explains the muddle of human emotion and chronicles his characters' escape from it quite like Forster."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Mrs Moore travels to India with Miss Adela Quested, a romantic interest of her son,Ronny,the city magistrate of Chandrapore.By chance ,Mrs Moore meets Aziz, a young Indian doctor,whilst looking around the city mosque, and wins his confidence and respect.At a tea party attended by Aziz at the school principle's home,Cyril Fielding,he makes a rash promise to arrange a picnic for Mrs Moore and Miss Quested to the Marabar caves, to sate Miss Quested's romantic idea of 'seeing the real India'.It goes against the unspoken apartheid that exists between the British and the Indians, and when Miss Quested returns from the caves startled and dazed,Aziz is arrested and racial tensions in Chandrapore rise....A book that truly captures the themes of racial prejudice,as a damning crtique on the British Raj and colonialism;'justice' administered by a ruling foreign class to a people outside of their social scope or cultural understanding.Written (or at least completed) in 1924,'Passage to India' foresees the collapse of the British Raj-and even how.('The next European war. Then will be our time' says Aziz)and also the difficulties of India's diverse peoples becoming a united nation;a process that is still evolving.That this book is still relevent underlines its strength, and as a novel it is superlative. William Maxwell listed 'Passage to India' as one of his all time favourite books. Its both easy to agree and to see why."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Reading \\"A Passage to India\\" this time, the novel struck me as surprisingly spiritual. At the crucial encounter between Mrs. Moore and Aziz at the mosque she tells him \\"God is Here.\\" Part of the spiritual quality of the novel is found in the spiritual exploration of various religious points of view - from the Muslim, Hindi and Christians. One example is between Mrs. Moore and her son, the City Magistrate. For him religion is about keeping order, particularly important when you are in charge of \\"natives.\\" While his mother has a deeply spiritual view of a Christian God, believing that \\"God is love.\\"There is also the interesting struggle for Aziz to embrace the spiritual but as a doctor not fall victim to the superstition. For him superstition is the past and he worries that India will remain backward if it doesn't free itself from magical thinking. Yet he doesn't embrace Christianity, the religion of the hated English who are not just the rulers of India but the exemplar of the Westernization, the form of modernism Aziz and progressives like him look to as creating a modern and even free India.Yes the novel grapples with colonialization and while sympathetic to the Indian cause - more than a generation before India frees itself from the British Empire - it isn't blindly sympathetic. Aziz is not terribly sympathetic - desperate to please the English yet also rebellious and full of hatred for them. He constantly shoots off his mouth and gets himself in trouble, particularly in his invitation to take the English ladies to the Marabar caves. He had never been there and had no intention of following through on his invitation except that the ladies insisted on his honoring the invitation. Hence we have the plot of the novel. Other Indians are presented in even less flattering light.I like the ambiguity of the incident at the caves. We see the events through Aziz and not Miss.Quested eyes. And later we have to piece it together. We never really know how she came up with the story that Aziz was to blame. Probably Ronnie, Mrs. Moore's son and Miss. Quested's fiancee engineered the thing but we aren't told that directly. Perhaps Fielding's refusal to stand when Ronnie came into the club room is some evidence of his suspicion and ours."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"There are few books as well constructed as this one. To add to its structure, one finds a important critique of English society and London's role in Empire. This is Forster's best work."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Through Mrs Moore and Adela I reviewed my own life. How I saw the world and other people. It also made me rethink God. I liked the controling figure of the perfect specimen condemed to the lowest caste. How people were calling God to come when he was already there. How the God they knew was not the true God and the name they gave him was not his true name. How the English were superfical yet mighty and the Indians were thourgh and considered a lesser being. Forester wove these themes into an intricate thread of a story."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"EM Forster's A Passage to India is, at first, a challenging book to digest. A study in contrasts: Indian and British, Moslem and Hindu, male and female, it offers one final contrast to the reader: near boredom and high intrigue. It is as if Forster intentionally brought his audience to the brink of apathy before springing the event of magnitude upon them. Startled from languour, Adela Quested's misfortune in the Marabar Caves becomes more pressing, more imminent, more real. Aziz, the hapless facilitator, finds himself accused of a nefarious plot and, from there, the plausibility of British colonialism is explored in microcosm.Sluggish for fully one half of the book and paced expertly in the other, A Passage to India is an ambivalent reading experience that provides, perhaps, more of the colonial experience than we first assume. Given time, we recognize that an indolent, entrenched bureacracy jolted from routine suits the pace of this book to a tee. I prefer Kipling's Kim when it comes to novels of the British Raj, though, on the whole, I found Forster's \\"Passage\\" a very worthy read. 4 stars."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"\\"A Passage to India\\" combines a story of friendship with insightful social commentary which remains vital to this very day. It is the story of Aziz, an Indian, and Fielding, an Englishman, and the friendship between the two men that develops in the wilderness of India. \\"A Passage to India\\" is shot through with issues of power politics, class, gender, religion, and even truth itself; Forester takes on quite a lot in this book and handles it quite well.Perhaps the most striking feature of \\"A Passage to India\\" is how well it has aged through the years since it was first published in 1924. In describing the Indian people, Forester touches on two issues in India which continue to this very day: unity and religion. Considerable time is spent on describing the Indian people and the challenges they faced in unifying such a large and diverse population, challenges which continue to exist to this day. Even more pertinent, Forester describes the mutual animosity between India's Hindus and Muslims, their mistrust toward and misunderstanding of each other, and the resultant difficulties.Of course, at the heart of Forester's book is India and her conquerors, the English. Aziz and Fielding's friendship plays out like a microcosm of this relationship and through it Forester explores the potential for reconciliation between the two civilizations. Several aspects of colonial life, from the degradation of the natives, to the mystery of \\"the Orient\\", to the inexplicable metamorphosis that is worked on Anglo expatriates, is brought to life and analyzed in clear, sometimes poetic language. For his own part, Forester seems intent on Indian independence, yet cautions that the Indians of which he writes may not yet be ready to assert their independence.The dichotomy between the isolated, existentialist Europe which tramples upon the organic, wholeness of India is also examined. Europe is presented as technologically accomplished and all-powerful, yet lacking the love of life that the Indians take for granted. Forester asserts that in Europe it is always work or rest, and that only in the East is the meaning of leisure understood. Forester further presents us with a view of a society which is slowly being transformed from community to isolation: Aziz cautions Fielding that every third servant is an informant, while the natives and expatriates alike are aware of the rigid class system that is slowly solidifying, and the attendant politics and rules that come with it. Although Forester is aware that class issues existed in India long before the arrival of the Europeans, he also understands that something peculiarly Eastern is being destroyed along with the Indian way of life.Forester's book is one which captures the best of both worlds. It brings together a very human story of friendship which will appeal to the emotions and hearts of anyone who has ever built a friendship. Yet it also presents a beautiful portrait of a colonized people and their colonizer, appealing to the intellect of anyone who wonders what it was like back then, or even what it is like now in subjugated nations. If you like fiction at all you should read this book."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"A Passage to India is the quintessential British novel of the twentieth century. It is E.M. Forster at his finest. Forster uses his experiences as a foreigner abroad to vividly display the strained relations between colonial Brits and their Indian subjects. The importance of this cross cultural novel is as relevant today as it was when first published in the 1920's. The descriptions of India are striking and beautiful, told with a simplicity reminiscent of Hemingway and an honesty I thought peculiar only to Capote. Easily Forster's most memorable and engaging novel wherein the author shows that with age comes a kind of excellence."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"&quot;A Passage to India&quot; contains some of the best imagery and character development of any book I have read in quite a long time. This era of writing is definitely in a class by itself. The overall plot and storyline is somewhat dissapointing though. Forster should have spent a little more time in developing the climax of the book. Overall, I would definitely suggest this book to anyone looking to get a birds eye view into India during Englands dominance."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"At the end of A Passage to India, the British hero, Cyril Fielding, and the Indian doctor, Aziz, attempt to fully reconcile and restore their friendship before they part ways for good. With that their horses swerve apart, the path divides, rocks jut up and all the obstacles, from the sky to the town below \\"said in their hundred voices, \`No, not yet,' \`No not there.'\\" Forster, like Kipling, wrote of an unbridgeable gap between East and West.Cyril Fielding is an educator who as the audacity not to take the British stance that Aziz, a respected doctor, tried to violate Adela Quested in the Marabar caves. What really happened is the book's question, and to show its complexity we visit the world of the British club, and begin to understand its expatriate members and their opinions on the locals. We see the national challenge that the Hindus and Moslems face with each other, and are privy to what to many would be a very confusing Hindu worship ceremony. We also hear and see the perspective of the nationals to the Britons and to their control, and see them dream and strive for some type of workable nationalism. Written in an engaging prose and helped by solid character development, A Passage to India is the work of a gifted writer. I discovered Forster by confusing him with C.S. Forrester, the author of The African Queen, and discovered that I was familiar with his works from the films A Room with a View and Howard's End, both adapted from his books. Forester was an insightful writer of the human condition, and I was impressed with many of his comments:\\"Mrs. Moore did not take the disappointment as seriously as Miss Quested, for the reason that she was 40 years older, and had learned that life never gives us what we want at the moment that we consider appropriate. Adventures to occur, but not punctually.\\"\\"There is no harm in deceiving society as long as she does not find you out, because it is only when she finds you out that you have harmed her; she is not like a friend or God, who are injured by the mere existence of unfaithfulness.\\"\\"Most of life is so dull that there is nothing to be said about it, and the books and talk that would describe it as interesting are obliged to exaggerate, in the hope of justifying their own existence.\\"\\"She was only recommending the universal brotherhood he sometimes dreamed of, but as soon as it was put into prose it became untrue.\\"\\"Although her hard schoolmistressy manner remained, she was no longer examining life, but being examined by it; she had become a real person.\\"\\"After 40 years' experience, he learned to manage his life and make the best of it on advanced European lines, had developed her personality, explored his limitations, controlled his passions-and had done it all without becoming either pedantic or worldly. A creditable achievement, but as the moment passed he felt he ought to have been working at something else the whole time-he didn't know at what, never would know, never could know, and that is why he felt sad.\\"The question of the Marabar Caves is the central point around which the book revolves. Yet as important are the cultures, history, religions and way of life between groups of people, all expressed adroitly by Forster. As he himself said, his work is \\"about something wider than politics...about the universe as embodied in the Indian earth and the Indian sky.\\""},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Forster writes about the ruling British and their tentative relationship with India in the early part of the 20th Century. While Kipling wrote of an India of intrigue and adventure, Forster's India is one of mistrust and racism between the British and the natives.The main charcter is a Moslem Indian, Dr. Aziz,who is abused by his British superior and learns to mistrust all British. Aziz meets Mrs. Moore , a new arrival, by chance at a mosque. After first ridiculing her, Aziz develops a deep respect for Mrs. Moore who he believes possesses more Oriental qualities than European qualities. Through Mrs. Moore, Aziz develops a frienship with Fielding, an educator, very interested in discovering what India is all about.Mrs. Moore's is accompanied to India by her future daughter-in-law, Adela Quested. Although extremely naive, Adela has the same inquisitiveness as does Fielding. Aziz desperately wants to impress his new British friends and he invites Adela, Mrs. Moore, and Fielding to be his guest as he shows them the Marbar caves, a local landmark.On the fateful day all parties realize that the tour is not a good idea but each is reluctant to cancel the event. The mystery of what occurred within the caves and the aftermath is the crux of the story.The incident at the cave does irrevocable harm to each of the main characters but particularly Mrs. Moore whose spirit totally disintegrates and Adeala who is rediculed and villified by the British.Finally at the end, Aziz and Fielding repair their friendship as best they can, each realizing that Indians and Brits will enjoy a suspicious friendship at best."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"A Passage to India explores the clashing of two different cultures during the British rule over India. It starts out with Mrs. Moore and Miss Adela Quested coming to India to visit Mrs. Moore's son and Miss Quested's future husband, Ronny. Both ladies are wide-eyed and want to see what the \\"real\\" India is like. They long to have conversations with real Indians and to experience the life of India without British influence. Eventually, they meet Dr. Aziz, a local Indian physician, who tells them that he will show them the \\"real\\" India. Part of Aziz's \\"real\\" India is the nearby Marabar caves. He takes them to visit the caves where something happens that changes the entire story. As a result, relationships between the British and Indians are tested.The writing style of this novel is so eloquent in describing the world of British Raj in India in the early twentieth century, that it is also able to be applied to life today. Take this quote from page 272 of the novel, \\"Truth is no truth in that exacting land unless there go with it kindness and more kindness again, unless the Word that was with God also is God. And the girl's sacrifice - so creditable according to Western notions - was rightly rejected, because, though it came from her heart, it did no include her heart.\\" This passage stuck in my mind because it reminded me that even though this story was written over eighty years ago, its core and main message could still be applied to life today.E.M. Forester, the author of A Passage to India, writes in such a way that he pulls the reader back to India under British rule in 1924. Through his speech and way of describing the interactions between the English and Indians, I felt like I was actually in 1924 watching everything taking place. Forester is a perfect example of a \\"classic author.\\" His style is so polished, yet unique that he was able to create a novel that draws the reader in and makes the reader question life and humanity in general. I was especially impressed with Forester's sarcasm and his ability to be cynical of British rule of India, even though he was British himself.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. Although, at times, I did feel that some parts just dragged on and on, I do think that I was then able to truly appreciate and learn from the lives of Aziz, his friends, and the British. In the past, I have always heard of the British Raj in India, but I never truly understood the impact of the British on India until I experienced A Passage to India."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"With all due respect to Rudyard Kipling, E.M. Forster's \\"A Passage to India\\" seems likely to remain the definitive novel about British Imperialist India written by an Englishman. It does not merely see India as a picturesque land in which to set an exotic adventure, but examines the complicated relationships between the British and the Indians with penetrating wisdom, astuteness, and fairness. Forster is not shy about portraying the British attitude towards the Indians as one of bigotry and condescension, but he also notes the considerable cultural and religious conflicts between the Muslims and the Hindus.Most of the action takes place in a city called Chandrapore and concerns the friendship between a British school principal named Cyril Fielding and a Muslim physician named Dr. Aziz. The novel's events are set in motion in an empty mosque, where a praying Aziz meets an elderly Englishwoman named Mrs. Moore. After some friendly conversation, they take a liking to each other, and Aziz learns that Mrs. Moore's son is a man he knows well -- Ronny Heaslop, the Magistrate of Chandrapore. Later, having tea at Fielding's house, Aziz meets Mrs. Moore again and her companion, a young lady named Adela Quested, who is vaguely affianced to Ronny. Eager to see the \\"real\\" India, Adela enthusiastically accepts Aziz's offer to go on a picnic to the Marabar caves, a nearby tourist attraction, and Mrs. Moore is convinced to accompany them.Forster lavishly describes the journey to the caves -- by train and then elephant -- and the caves themselves, each of which apparently is shaped somewhat like a frying pan, with a short corridor ending in a circular chamber. The outing proves to be much more eventful than the three spelunkers expected. Mrs. Moore, haunted by the eerie echos the caves propagate, crosses the threshold of insanity. And upon their return to Chandrapore, Adela claims that she was sexually assaulted in one of the caves and accuses Aziz, who is consequently arrested and tried for the crime.Of course, there are a few different explanations for what really happened to Adela in the caves, but the British are prejudicially biased against Aziz. This puts Fielding in a quandary, as his defense of his good friend Aziz infuriates his British compatriots and gets him kicked out of his club. When Adela later admits that she can't confirm Aziz's guilt, Ronny acknowledges that a retraction of the charges would embarrass the British; he even hustles his mother out of India because, as a witness, her increasing incoherence would damage the case for the prosecution.Although the cave incident and the subsequent trial drive the plot, the novel is more about the clash of three headstrong societies (Muslim, Hindu, and Christian) forced to dwell together amidst political turmoil, and how certain members of these societies manage to reconcile themselves to each other's differences. The final scene between Fielding and Aziz, in which Aziz uncannily predicts an independent Indian nation resulting from British dissolution, is a poignant display of this theme; for all the trouble and conflict in the world, there is always room for friendship and understanding."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"A Passage to India vividly demonstrates the psychology of how people avoid those who are different than themselves. The litmus test of this problem is identified by how even friendly people assume the worst about others, rather than keeping an open mind or assuming the best.The book is less successful at providing a model of how to overcome those weaknesses. Mrs. Moore, a visiting Englishwoman, in the book successfully establishes a friendship with Dr. Aziz, a Muslim physician in Chandrapore, India. The connection is deeply embedded in her sincere interest in all other people and their feelings. She arrives in the book with that empathy, and only one of her sons also seems to have the same fineness of emotional connection. Another son clearly doesn't. So, it's a rare trait, even in families. There is no evidence of how to create that attitude which leads to such rapid and firm trust.More typical is the friendship between Dr. Aziz and Cyril Fielding. Both are committed to each other, but are quick to suspect each other's motives. A continuing effort allows them to reconcile. One has to suppose that their relationship is the model that E.M. Forester had in mind for most of us. We can connect with others we respect and like, and with hard work can overcome miscommunications and suspicion.Dr. Aziz is portrayed in a very thoughtful way. He wants to have friends across the cultural divide, and makes enormous efforts in that respect. However, his intentions often have unintended consequences. He bears up and moves forward. I was impressed from this character about the need to have many people who seek friendship in order to make connections possible.The plot builds around the arrival of Mrs. Moore, the mother of a local English magistrate, with Miss Adela Quested, who is considering whether to marry Mrs. Moore's magistrate son. Like many newcomers to colonial India, they are interested in meeting native people and seeing the local sites. In attempting to respond to their interests, the various connections take place. Both are initially appalled by the attitude of those English people who have long lived in India towards the Hindus and Muslims there.The book raises important questions at several levels, such as:(1) Can people with very different religious beliefs live in peace with one another?(2) Can colonialism ever be anything other than bad for all involved?(3) How should one adapt to the local community in which one lives, if it is different from one's own background?(4) What should people be willing to do to help one another?(5) What should people not do to help one another?(6) How can mistrust be dispelled?(7) How does racism harm the person who is a racist?A major drawback of the book is that many of the characters are usually unappealing. Even Mrs. Moore, who serves as the ideal in many ways, retreats into self-centered inaction as her health fails. Miss Quested repays Dr. Aziz's hospitality with putting his life and finances in great peril. Cyril Fielding seems to often do too little to bridge the cultural gaps. Dr. Aziz often comes across as a toady. The other English people have severe drawbacks. The characters are often surmounted by their agendas.One aspect of the book that I liked was the way it showed how those accused of crimes bring out the fundamental social flaws of the community. This happens in fiction in Gone with the Wind in the sequence where Scarlett has some problems driving her carriage, and her complaints lead the white men to attack the African-Americans who live in the area where her problem occurred. In France, the trial of the Jewish Captain Dreyfus created a similar split in the community and rise in racist feelings and actions.The story also seems a little dated, so that the characters seem too extreme to us today to be credible. They more often seem to be caricatures than characters.After you read this story, think about whom you ignore. Why do you do that? What effect does it have on those you ignore? What effect does it have on you? What should you do?Seek friendship and mutual understanding among all those you meet!"},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"I have long been a huge fan of the works of EM Forster, and I also loved this novel. What fascinated me most in this study of cross cultural differences, was how well Forster could get inside the heads of all the different characters and describe things from their perspective. He created sympathy for his characters and had the ability to describe an incident from many different viewpoints.From what I have read about Forster, he had been living a rather lonely life as a repressed and closeted homosexual when he at the age of 27 he began tutoring an Indian college student by the name of Masood. Masood introduced Forster to his other Indian friends, and with these people Forster found acceptance and friendship. He later wrote that he feels most \\"at home\\" in the Indian community. Forster wrote that this friendship with Masood \\"opened him up to a much wider experience of the world\\". He credited Masood and his friends as being the major inspiration and source for ths novel. In fact the dedication to A Passage to India is \\"To Syed Ross Masood and to the seventeen years of our friendship\\".After six years of friendship, in 1912 Masood and Forster traveled to India together. During this trip Forster finally realized that although he had fallen in love with Masood, Masood did not share his feelings. When Forster was 33 he returned to England and Forster wrote his first draft of A Passage to India, with the theme of the difficulty of sustaining a relationship across racial and cultural divides. The character of Aziz was based on Masood and the character of Fielding was based on Forster. When I read the novel, I noticed that many of the lines Fielding says are actually things that Forster has said or written. An example is when Fielding says \\"I enjoy the company of Indians. They trust me.\\" After learning this whole history, the lines in the novel about how an Indian and and Englishman can only be friends in England and not in India, took on a new meaning for me.One interesting side note is that in this original draft of the novel, Aziz does actually assault Adele in the cave and is found guilty at the trial. If this had stayed in, it would have made for a very different novel. After this initial draft of A Passage to India, Forster abandons the novel and goes on to write Maurice, a positive portrayal of a homosexual love affair. Unfortunately, it could only be published after Forster's death.In 1915, during WW I, Forster worked for the Red Cross in Egypt. There he met Mohammed el Adl, an Egyptian Muslim. This time both men fell in love and had a relationship that lasted until el Adl died of TB. It is as his lover is dying in 1922, when Forster is 43, that he begins to rewrite A Passage to India, this time changing the character of Aziz to more resemble el Adl. Before, the Aziz character had been middle class and very Westernized, knowing how to fence and ride. This new Aziz, to more closely resemble el Adl, had impoverished beginnings and had a home amidst the mud. The personality of the character also changed to become very passionate and eager to please. Another development during these years was that Forster had gone back to India in 1921 to serve as a secretary to a Maharajah of Dewas State. Thus Forster was able to see how India had changed after the war and he could see how prevalent the racial oppression still was by the British. One thing that Forster wrote about in his letters was how easily cultural misunderstandings could escalate to something bigger. This reminded me of the custom described in the novel of Indians making a friendly overture of inviting you to come visit them at home, but not expecting you to ever take them up on it.One of the things I loved about Forster's novel Howard's End was its motto \\"Only connect\\". I see Aziz as a passionate character desiring of making deep connections with people. I see Forster as a lonely disconnected man, who was brought to life by the power of connection and acceptance. I think this is why he makes the connection between disparate people such a theme in so many of his novels."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"I won't add to the other positive comments about this book. It's wonderfully written. But the formatting on Kindle is deployable. In particular, the paragraphs breaks are hard to discern, making it difficult to know who is speaking.I hope the publisher will update the book to make it a better Kindle read."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"I have always been a fan of E.M. Forster. His ability to understand the way that society and humanity works has always managed to astonish me. This work is thought by many to be the greatest that he ever wrote. I tend to agree &quot;Howards End&quot;, &quot;A Room with a View&quot;, and &quot;Where Angels Fear to Tread&quot; were stepping stones to this novel. The story is simple. A man is accused of doing something his friends believe him to be innocent all others believe him to be guilty. Yet, the story is not at all simple. It explains how horribly off things in India were when Britain still maintained an empire there. That man accused is an Indian. The person accusing him is an English woman. In these two characters, Britain and India are made real. The reader sees how wrong the whole situation was . Be prepared to leave the book angry at the British for doing what they did in India. Read and learn this book!"},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"First of all, I should say that as I grow older I'm learning that everything I read more than five years should probably not be included in the list of books I've read. I first read A Passage to India in 1994. I know this because in my quasi obsession, through most of the nineties, to catch up on reading the important books years I had never read, I wrote the dates at which I started and finished each book on the inside cover. When I picked A Passage to India up again this summer, I was stunned to find that, except for a few hazy vaguenesses, I had forgotten the book completely. I certainly had no memory of its beauty. At the heart of A Passage to India are the issues of race, friendship, decency, and the clash of cultures in British India at the turn of the 20th century. Forster's story is polyphonic, which is to say it is told from a number of voices. His prose is beautiful enough to stop you, and the novel's larger questions are ones that continue to resonate with the world's denizens even at the turn of this century."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Being the \\"Orientalist\\" that I am, I simply loved \\"A Passage to India\\" E.M Foster does an excellent job on character development and the relationships that build up to fall; then of course, build up again. The entire book is a rollercoaster of friends and foes. The book will keep you puzzled at who really is the antagonist and protagonist of the story. The book has many symbolic meanings within itself that deal with humanity and conflict in general.My favorite character in the book was Mr. Fielding. He related to my own character in so many ways. He seemed to be one of the few who wanted to understand the Indians (Muslim and Hindu).The book is dealing with the conflict that the British and Indian people had when the British Raj was in power. Looking from both sides of the spectrum, it really exposes the prejudice one had for another. Not only is it a matter of separation in India by the Indian and British, but it also deals with another internal conflict in India with Muslims and Hindus. Truly, it was a divided India.While sometimes a tedious read, \\"A Passage to India\\" plays out to be a very well-written story full of rich history, interesting characters, and very opinionated peoples. This book is highly recommended to anyone who would like to understand some very interesting customs of India. Check it out!"},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Forster writes late in the book,&quot;...composed in English to indicate His universality.&quot; But does using English really make one belong? In the book, all the primary characters communicate with one another in English but miscomprehension abounds; there is a disconnect. The disconnect is both vertical and horizontal: a disconnect between the English and the Indians but also one among the English and among the Indians. And, here, there, moments of reaching out to the other interrupt the prevailing tension.This is the first Forster book that I've read completely. I have seen all the movie adaptations of his books (except A Pssage To India) and have enjoyed them thoroughly. But an attempt at reading A Room With A View wasn't at all successful (stopped twice at chapter 3) and I gave up (perhaps a little too hastily) reading any of the books themselves. Recently however, I have become intrigued with Indian authors and books about India and suddenly, A Passage to India popped into my mind and I picked up a copy. Forster's prose reminds me of F. Scott Fitzgerald's in itsnuanced simplicity although the former can at times become somewhat abstract. Forster conveys the complexity of colonial India but the read was spectacularly easy, aided by many humorous points. Halfway through the book, I was so impressed by the book and wondered if it had made it onto the Modern Library's best 100 works of fiction in the 20th century. And it did."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"I wasn't particularly looking forward to reading A Passage to India. Forster, in my mind, seemed to suggest implausible romance, pretty scenery, and Helena Bonham Carter, and I'd never actually bothered to read one of his books.Now I can hardly wait to read another. I absolutely loved this book, without quite knowing why it was so magical. I do know that I found the first chapter absolutely perfect, as it allows the reader to go into a &quot;descriptive section&quot; daze, and then jerks are attention suddenly back to the Marabar caves. And with the exception of one or two patches that dragged a little but were soon over, I found the rest of the book equally magnetic.I enjoyed Fortster's deftness in portraying all the characters, not so much as individuals, but in terms of how they felt about each other. In particular I loved the relationship between Fielding and Aziz, while understanding completely the dislike each had for aspects of the others character.The ending is marvelous. So often books that hold your interest like this just peter out, but it's refreshing to find an author like Forster who understands that what makes for an ideal conclusion is to give the readers a taste of what they want, and then hold back the last little bit."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"The book I chose was A Passage to India by E.M. Forster. The book was based off of the author's own experiences in India. Forster is able to tell the tale of an attempted friendship between a an Englishman and an Indian. The Englishman (Fielding) and the Indian (Aziz) are constantly stuck with having problems trusting one another making the friendship a very difficult one to have. The book shows us about the interactions between different cultures and it gives us a greater understanding of human feelings and emotions. Forster is able to tell the reader a lot about India through this book. The novel takes place primarily in Chandrapore. The main character of the novel is Aziz. He is a Muslim doctor and a widow. Aziz meets Mrs. Moore, (a British woman), at at a local Islamic temple. Mrs. Moore is visiting her son, who is the City Magistrate. They find that they have much in common. Aziz brings Mrs. Moore to find her friend Adela. Mrs. Moore and Adela go to a bridge party. For Adela and Mrs. Moore, the party is a failure because only a few of the English guests behave kindly towards the Indians. One of these guests is Fielding, who suggests that Adela meet Aziz. Mrs. Moore scolds her son because he is impolite to the Indians, but Ronny feels that he is not there to be kind because there are more important things to do. Mrs Moore is offended by this. Aziz has tea with Fielding, Adela, Mrs. Moore and Professor Narayan Godbole. During tea they discuss the Marabar Caves. Aziz plans a picnic at the Marabar Caves for Miss Quested and Mrs. Moore. Adela tells Ronny that she will not marry him, but he nevertheless suggests that they take a car trip to see Chandrapore. During the trip, Adela speaks to Ronny, and tells him that she was foolish to say that they should not be married. Both Aziz and Godbole fall sick after the party at Mr. Fielding's home, so Fielding visits Aziz and they discuss the state of politics in India. Aziz shows Fielding a picture of his wife, a significant event considering his Islamic background and an important demonstration of their friendship. Again, we see the friendship developing between Fielding and Aziz, despite the forces that are against them at the time. They are able to develop this friendship even though there are large differences in their cultures. Aziz plans an expedition to the Marabar Caves. During the day when they are to leave, a friend of Aziz's, bribes Adela's servant not to go on the expedition because he is a spy for Ronny. Although Aziz, Adela and Mrs. Moore arrive to the train station on time, Fielding and Godbole miss the train. Adela and Aziz discuss Adela's marriage, and she fears she will become narrow-minded. When they reach the caves, an echo in one of them frightens Mrs. Moore, who decides she must leave immediately. The echo terrifies her. Aziz and Adela continue to explore the caves, and Adela realizes that she does not love Ronny. However, she does not think that this is reason enough to break off her engagement. When the group returns to Chandrapore, Aziz is arrested for assaulting Adela. Fielding speaks about this charge, and says that Aziz is innocent. The Collector feels that this is true because disaster always happens when the English and Indians interact socially. Fielding requests that he see Adela, but he is denied this request. Aziz hires a Hindu as his lawyer who is notoriously anti-British. Godbole leaves Chandrapore to start a high school in Central India. The Anglo-Indians are on Adela's side and call a meeting to discuss the trial. Fielding attends, and makes the mistake of actually referring to her by name. The Collector advises all to behave cautiously. Adela wishes to see Mrs. Moore, who kept away. Ronny tells her that Fielding wrote her a letter to her pleading Aziz's case. Adela admits to Ronny that she has made a mistake and that Aziz is innocent. Mrs. Moore wishes to leave India, and Ronny agrees, for she is doing no one any good by remaining. Lady Mellanby, the wife of the Lieutenant-Governor, secures Mrs. Moore quick passage out of India. Adela admits that she made a mistake about Aziz. The judge releases Aziz. Adela is asked why she made this charge, but she cannot answer. Adela seems to believe that she had a hallucination because she thinks she hallucinated getting a marriage proposal when there was none. Fielding asks Aziz not to sue Adela, for it will show that he is a gentleman, but Aziz claims that he is fully anti-British now. Fielding reminds Aziz what a momentous sacrifice Adela. Adela decides to leave India and not marry Ronny. Fielding gains new respect for Adela. Adela leaves India. Aziz thinks that Fielding and Adela had an affair and the friendship between Aziz and Fielding hits a rough spot. Forster presents us with the setting of the town of Mau. Fielding visits Mau after he gets married. Aziz believes he married Adela. Fielding married Mrs. Moore's daughter. They resolve their dispute, but they realize that because of their different cultures they cannot remain friends and leave each other cordially. There is a question about what happened in the Marabar caves when Adela and Aziz are together. Forster shows that it is not really an issue because it outcomes of what did or didn't happen that are important. The trip to the caves made the emotions that the characters had even stronger. The proceding events following the trip to the cave are direct outcomes of this trip. This book deals with the relations between the English and the native population of India during the colonial period in which Britain ruled India. The idea of friendship between the English and Indians was radical at Forster's time. Forster is able to show just how radical this is by presenting the reader with the reactions of both the Indians and the English to the friendship between Fielding and Aziz. He does not pretend to understand India. He believes that it is a 'muddle', which is a theme here, just as it is in Forster's A Room with A View. With this book, however; Forster is able to bring some aspects of India to life to give us a greater understanding of the differences in culture."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"We can read this book at several levels. Jung said somewhere that a dream can be interpreted at many levels, and every interpretation is right. (If Jung didn't say it, I did, and he would have said it.)On the surface, Passage informs contemporary England of the state of affairs in India. At the same time, it shows how East and West differ. It also leaves a record for later generations about English colonialism, the relations between Hindus and Muslims in India, social practices, and speech, and the historian may even infer quite a bit about the industrialization and technology of the early twentieth century.In &quot;Homo Aestheticus,&quot; Ellen Dissanayake says, &quot;Behavior is, essentially, choice.&quot; To analyze Forster's book (or any work of art), we have to ask, why did the author choose these particular elements to express whatever was in his mind? (A novel is more than Stendhal's mirror; it expresses what the author sees, and what the author sees is decided by what the author is.) Here we slip into deeper strata.India, the dark, amorphous, timeless, ancient land, represents the unconscious, peopled by unknowable, unreachable, dark-skinned masses worshipping an accumulation of gods in a number of tongues. The identity of India as the unattainable contents of the unconscious is indicated by the very first conversation in the book, in which two Indians tell the third that they are dead, in &quot;another and a happier world.&quot;Adele Quested, the noble quest, is an intrusion from the known, civilized conscious. This female character goes past the outposts of light into the darkness of India, where, because she is introduced by aged Mrs Moore (more), she is escorted into the womb of the rock at the Malabar caves by Dr Aziz (A through Z is everything). Dr Aziz may escort her because he is not a true denizen of the inner world (he is the third Indian, not &quot;dead&quot;), he is a modern healer who originated in Muslim Afghanistan: a bridge.When Quested enters the cave, she is, or is not confronted by a shadow which may have been guiding her. In her struggle to avoid the union of male and female, conscious and unconscious, she loses her vision (her field glasses) and, because she rejects the shadow, the injuries she suffers (earns) are only skin-deep; her compatriots do not permit the cactus spines to enter her blood.Since Mrs Moore, the prescient old woman, does not assert Dr Aziz's innocence, she dies as soon as she reaches the sea, the eternal, unfathomable depths of life and psyche.Fielding, the educator, ego, wishes to befriend Aziz, but Aziz, wounded, enters deeper into polytheistic India, the unconscious which he hopes to unite, but the horses, the earth, the temples don't want it. Fielding never marries Quested. Although the book is titled A PASSAGE to India, practically the whole book takes place *in* India, and yet, passage is never realized.Now it would be absurd to suggest that Forster sat chewing his pencil thinking, &quot;What symbol am I to use to show the quest had only superficial results? Cactus, that's it!&quot; The book succeeds because his mind was ordered and open enough to dredge up the effective symbol: effective for him, effective for us.What I propose is that work which delves deep into the unconscious cultivates psychological growth and, by inspiring internal harmony, alleviates problems, if only by facing them. This is the standard I would raise to distinguish good (successful) art (art which succeeds in promoting psychological growth) and mediocre art, the product of shallow minds."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"I had to read this book as a recommendation by my tenth grade English teacher for an Independent Study project. I was excited about reading it; everyone says it's good and I think India is interesting. However, having read the book thoroughly, even the confusing first half, I am not sure what the focus was supposed to be. Other reviewers said it was a look at the culture of India, my English teacher said it was a portrayal of different kinds of people, some people say it's the mystery of the trial concerned with racism and prejudice... I am not sure what I am supposed to be left feeling at the end of the book.This was not a &quot;bad&quot; book - I am glad I read it and I would recommend it to others. It doesn't have an exciting plot or particularly likeable characters, but Forster has good insight into society and what makes people make and break friendships. I was left feeling confused on almost every level from this book, but in some ways it was an eye-opener. It should not be read to learn about India, since Forster seems to mention customs and interesting places offhandly and as a matter of course; it should neither be read as an investigation into what makes people tick. If you want to save yourself confusion, don't read it at all.However, I liked the book because it was puzzling. I had to really think to figure out why there were such problems between Aziz and his English friend Fielding. I finished this book last night, and it has helped me understand something, though I can't yet put my finger on what."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"I knew I wanted to read A Passage to India when I heard about it. That's where it ended--as soon as I started to read it. The book was long, and tedious, begging for more action. As I trudged through the book and finished it, I realized that its significance lies not in entertainment, but in the thought provoking questions it raises. This is its one area that totally redeemed my painful experience.The book focuses on the racial tension during the British occupation of India in the early 1900's. The story develops emotions and feeling within its characters based on their perceptions of others through distorted racial prejudice. It raises the question: Is it possible for the natives to befriend their English occupiers?When two women, Mrs. Moore and Adela Quested come to India, they seek to see the &quot;real&quot; India. They soon befriend Dr. Aziz, who is Indian. As Aziz shows them the country, racial tension soon creeps in. Much attention surround the Marabar Caves, and from this the central crisis arises. The fleeting romance between Adela and Mrs. Moore's son Ronny, plays an integral role in the racial accusations brought against Aziz.Relationships prove to be the focus of the novel, and shows what prejudice does to them. This theme is one still being fought in the Middle East as Western influences clash with Muslim Arab culture. Can we be friends?"},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"I'm seriously conflicted about this book. Is it a masterfully told tale of complicated characters and compelling moral conundrums and gray areas? Yes. Intellectually, I appreciate it very much. But . . . I just. don't. like. it. And mostly I don't like it because I couldn't help feeling that Forster didn't much like it either. He wrote his characters, even the sympathetic ones, with borderline disdain. It's rather a grumpy book, for all its brilliance, and so I find I'm as glad to be done with it as I am to have read it."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"In the 1920s, British officials were living in India, in an insular community in which they could enjoy the comforts of British life while dictating proper rules and justice to the inferior Indians. Problems abounded from both sides, naturally.The British officials feared they were not well respected enough. They didn't make an effort to get to know individual Indians, and stereotypes ruled their thinking.The Indians were resentful of the occupation, but unwilling or unable to do much about it.Into this touchy atmosphere a young British woman and her older female escort materialize. The young woman is the potential fiance of a British official, and has come to India to decide if she truly wishes to marry him. The older woman is the official's mother.As newcomers, the women are fascinated by India; it is far more interesting than the British community plunked down in the middle of it. They don't understand conventions, don't understand why they can't mix socially with Indians, don't understand the rules that the other British seem to take for granted. As a result, they end up going on an outing with a friendly and eager-to-please Indian doctor.While on the outing, something strange and frightening occurs. The British community use the opportunity to villainize the Indian host, and it appears that the tenuous peace and harmony between Indians and British might be lost.The themes of this book and its overall story are though-provoking and well written. I had a very difficult time with the characters, though, who seemed completely unreal. Aziz, despite being a doctor, seemed so weak and childlike, unable to take a stand or make up his mind about things. I couldn't figure out Adele's motivation at all, either for being in the country in the first place, since she seemed to have no feelings for Ronny, or for letting herself be steamrolled into accusations she didn't mean. I could see clearly, being able to peek into the thoughts of both the Indians and the British, the misunderstandings that occurred throughout much of the book, but I wish I'd been able to gain more insight into what actually motivated these characters, and get a deeper sense of who they were as individuals."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"This is an accomplished novel. Beautifully written and interesting, it portrays a very believable world of people who quite probably no longer exist. Everything is visualized, from the tedious monotiny of the 'proper British sort' of the early 20th Century to the haunting menace and lingering sense of doubt that such a shallow and repressed existence must struggle with. Add to that the mysterious and incomprhensible alien nature of a foreign society the lead characters never imagined and the force of the book can take on a fascinating sociological spin.Of what I've read, this is my favorite book by Forester, an author whom I regard as a pretty and absorbing writer of generally dull moments. This book simply succeeds in keeping the reader rivited on numbness in the face of catastrophe more consistantly than Howard's End or A Room With A View."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Being an Indian I was indeed rather perturbed by the treatment of the natives of the land by the outsiders. The scene at the open house showed the demeaning manner in which the locals were treated. To compound the second class treatment, the Marabar incident echoed the subjugation the natives had to bear with despite their status and education which equated the British if not surpassed theirs. The saving grace was the 'not guilty' verdict but that too was tarnished as Dr.Aziz was thereafter under constant supervision, a prisoner in Mau. On the converse, the likes of Mrs.Moore and Mr.Fielding helped to balance the pathos of the Indians as these two could both relate to and had earned the respect and admiration of the locals. Thus on the whole, to a large extent, Forster was able to portray the predicament of the Indians and the anxiety of the Bristish as realistically, nonchalantly and objectively as possible. However, as he later admitted the Indai of the 1920s was a far cry from the India after independence. On a personal note, I feel that the Indians still look at the British with a mixture of suspect and awe to this day. Novels such as these should be read by all, especially this generation of Indians and British."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"There are times, I'll admit, when Forster's novel seems a bit dry, a bit lacking in character (and character development), and a bit prolix. Nevertheless, some of the prose is absolutely stunning, and the end of the book (in my opinion) is one of the most beautiful achievements in any novel. A book I would highly recommend."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"This book is a fabulous book that deals with a political and spritual realms. Througout the novel these two relams remain separate untill the end of the book where they alomost join and form something that is unimaginable. But in the end they are unable to join, but although they do not join there is still a hope in the future"},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Beautifully woven and written story about the relationships between a small group of Indians and English and the larger issues preventing durable relationships among them. Offers an realistic and intriguing picture of British colonialism and colonists in India."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"E.M. Forster is definitely an artist, but in A Passage to India his artistry falls short of the mark. As in all of his novels, the themes of this book are both timely and yet eternally relevant; however, the composition of the story doesn't live up to the standard he set with Howard's End. The echoes of Forster's philsophical standards are here, but there is a sense of cynicism and hopelessness that obscures the moral value of the book. Whereas in A Room with A View Forster managed to stamp the entire novel with a certain ideology through a few well phrased and placed passages, A Passage to India is more of a \\"muddle\\". And while that metaphoric fog adds to the picturesque effect of the story, it makes the thematic elements more obscure and less open to the reader.This book is good, as far as the story goes, but Forster could and did do much better."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Well, five stars for me lasting until the end, one star for the book. I've read classics I actually enjoy but this wasn't one of them, I don't care how beautiful the prose or profound the understanding of human nature. I was thirty pages from the end and almost put it down but that would have been like quiting a marathon at mile 25. I tried to be engaged, I tried to marvel at the insights, I struggled to untangle the language and to follow the conversations, I tried not to treat it like an old lady's doily. Maybe the movie is better because this cries for a languid, immense cinematic treatment."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"As one of Forster's greatest fans, A Passage to India is undoubtedly his greatest work. His abillity to conjure characters so different and yet so solidly entrenched in 'englishness.'Don't let the film version disswade you, indeed, Merchant &amp; Ivory are masters in adapting Forster's words to images, but if you like Forster's writings, then by all means choose this one!"},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"A Passage to India is a very clever, intelligent book that brilliantly describes the racial tensions between Anglos and Indians. The troubles Mr Fielding (an anglo) undergoes in making friends with the indians are very real. It is very moving to read of these problems, as they represent the many racial/economic bridges between people which, sadly, don't seem to close up. I can identify with Miss Quested's feelings of not knowing the real India.(I've never been to india, but i've read many books about it) So, while this book is very thought provoking and describes many situations that are easy to identify with, it is often extremely slow reading. I confess to skimming through many parts of the book, and I could not keep my mind focused throughout the whole thing. There are exciting points, such as the events following the mystery of what really happened in the Marabar Caves, but the plot is too extended and the book would have been much better if it were more compressed."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Watched the movie which prompted me to purchase the book. The book 'filled in the gaps' that the movie created. Interesting historical information, from E.M. Fosters point of view. I was easily transported to India by this book. A good look at a different day in time."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"How this book, and Forster's work in general, can be so highly rated by critics who actually appear to be intelligent at the expense of genuine geniuses of the time like Joyce, Huxley is amazing. Just because I find something dry and boring doesn't mean it isn't great literature, but this does not apply to Forster, who is dry, boring, shows no psychological insight whatsoever, has wooden, unrealistic characters and dialogue and very few redeeming features at all. This novel has been described as &quot;enchanting, epic and profound&quot;; if you've heard this and are thinking of buying it then you should direct your attentions to Joyce's &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, Huxley's &quot;Point Counter Point&quot; or T.S. Eliot's poetry, all of which are far superior to this aristocratic, narrow sighted rubbish."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"I wonder how this book was received when published in 1924 during the stirrings of Indian independence from Great Britain. Did it accurately reflect the depicted stereotypes and prejudices of both Indians and British colonialists? Or did Forster attempt to explode those stereotypes and prejudices? I saw David Lean's 1984 film (which I, in parts, confused with \\"Jewel in the Crown\\" - understandable since both starred Peggy Ashcroft and Art Malik and both take place at the Marabar Caves), and I recall the film being a subtler portrayal of Forster's characters and events. While this is a slow, talky book, emotions, speeches, and prejudices are front and center and overly magnified. The British are cold and reserved, hotheaded when it comes to England and the sanctity of their women, superior, insecure, scornful of Muslims and Hindus alike, and wearily bearing the White Man's Burden - including the well meaning school principal who does his best to go native but remains British to the core. Indians are lazy, cunning, treacherous, noble, mean, rebellious, subservient. Muslims are poetic; Hindus are superstitious. Quite frankly, I don't know what Forster was trying to achieve, reflection of reality or explosion of stereotypes. Does the book retain whatever importance it had in 1924? I don't know, but it did not engage me fully."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"A Passage to India by EM Forster is about two women, Miss. Quested and Mrs. Moore who take a trip to India in order to have Miss. Quested married to Mrs. Moore's son. When they get their Mrs. Moore meets a local doctor named Aziz, and the two strike up a friendship. Their friendship however is criticized by the British in the area but they arrange to have a picnic in the caves near by. In the caves Miss. Quested is seemingly assaulted and we see the full brunt of racialist thought in India.As entertainment, this novel was decent. I wasn't compelled or bored, it was simply ok. As a satire however it was fairly weak. I found it unconvincing and a weak portrayal of an important subject. The crime against Miss. Quested was ridiculious and it's hard to believe someone would be that hysterical.Technically I found the novel to be decent. I wasn't blown away by Forsters writing even though he wrote it in obvious poetic undertones. Overall I wasn't greatly impressed with this novel and I wouldn't call it a classic or any sort of statement about racism. Read some Richard Wright or To Kill a Mockingbird for insight into racialist thought."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"This book is written with 4 different narrators. I liked the voice of the first, but could not get past the second. One more book labeled as a wonderful classic that seemed better in memory of other people than in my actual reading.

I found the characters confusing and couldn't relate to the story or understand a lot of the terminology used. I didn't feel compelled to make a study of it. I loved Mistry's A Fine Balance and hoped for a similarly well-developed story and characters."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"The book \\"A Passage to India\\" was based on two English women by the names of Adela Quested, Mrs. Moore Who traveled across lands from England to India. The two women wanted to see the \\"real\\" India, during their visit, instead of the cultural institutions back at home. In the novel Ronny, Mrs. Moore son was to be married to Adela Quested. A lot took place during the visit. Miss Adela and Ronny had a slight fall out a little after the beginning of the story. They had agreed to not get married. Shortly after they had agreed to not get married, they had gotten into a car crash, and I guess that the shock or excitement of the moment had changed their minds. Aziz, a young Muslim doctor in India, was accused of sexually assaulting the young Miss Adela Quested in the caves of Marabar. Miss Adela went back to Chandrapore in India to tell what supposedly happen in the caves. What really went down was that in the caves Adela had finally realized that she didn't love Ronny, so she tried to bust a move on Aziz. She messes up by in sulting Aziz by asking how many wives does he have. Aziz had gotten up set and left Adela in that section of the cave. That's how things had gotten twisted. Miss Adela then went to the court with that lie and had gotten Aziz arrested. That little lie had gotten out of control because it then turns to a civil case like England vs. India. Latter on Ronny sent his mother Mrs. Moore home to England because she knew that Adela was lieing, on the trip back to home Mrs. Moore had passed, but before she did she realizes that there is no \\"real India\\", but rather a complex multitude of different Indias. Miss Adela Quested then confessed in court, Aziz was released, Ronny left her, and Miss Adela Quested was exiled from England and was to never return."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"This story is light, funny and adventurous.

Bored with sesame street picture books, i read it. I felt rather violated by it at first because many of the poems were impossible for me to comprehend and seemed rather nonsensical to me at the time. Yet I was intrigued. This untraditional book challenged me in a way no robert frost or ogden nash book ever did. Convinced that there was some deeper meaning that I wasn't picking up on, I read the book many times over . The more I read these poems the more i understood them and they began to take on definite shape and character. They began to make A LOT of sense. This book may be a difficult read for a seven year old, but i grew to love it then and i havent stopped loving it since. Now ten years later, at seventeen, let me tell you this is a phenomonal book. I've read a lot of books over the past decade but none of them compare to this one. These poems are so beautiful, so unique, so powerful that they will haunt you for an entire lifetime...Richard brautigan was a genius."},{"Title":"Rommel Drives on Deep into Egypt","review":"I love Brautigan. This poetry collection is the best I've read of his. There's something about his poetry that distills everything down to a simple unique thought and gives it the attention it deserves. While his prose is beautiful (and poetic) as well, I like his poetry better for it's amazing simplicity and depth. If you've never read a Brautigan, start here, then go to TROUT FISHING IN AMERICA."},{"Title":"Rommel Drives on Deep into Egypt","review":"I found this book on my father's shelf when I was about thirteen and just beginning to be interested in poetry. Opening it at random, the first three poems I flipped to still sum up today the way I feel about Brautigan: the imagery of \\"Late Starting Dawn\\" made me fall in love with poetry, the ideology of \\"Shellfish\\" made me fall in love with creation, and the verbiage of \\"It Was Your Idea to Go to Bed with Her\\" made me fall in love with the English language. Though his poetry is simply constructed, that simplicity is the perfect format for his beautiful understanding of and attraction to words. Richard Brautigan puts human life, from the intellectual pursuits to sexual endeavors, into such physical proximity with the reader that one is left with the feeling of looking someone in the eyes and understanding them for the first time. His passion for the aesthetics of words and life is astoundingly apparent. These poems will make you want to live your life beautifully, and help you see that you already do."},{"Title":"Rommel Drives on Deep into Egypt","review":"Richard Brautigan was crafty. I read once that he wanted to write the perfect poem and that poem would be about the shortest period of time one could imagine. That poem would be one word. Nobody has ever heard the word yet. It hasn't been created. Everyone knows what it means. We've always known. If you are buying your first Brautigan book I highly reccomend starting here and finishing when you own everything he's written."},{"Title":"Rommel Drives on Deep into Egypt","review":"Do you think of me as often as I think of you?R. BrautiganThe photo on the cover would be worth the price of the book even if the poems were awful, and they're not. In fact, they're great. Light, withought being trivial, this one's a quick read that stays on. Brautigan's uniqe humor is pervasive and nothing is quite as simple as it might seem at first glance. Warning: Don't think about them too much. These are not grab on and chew kinds of poem-lettes. They're funny ineffable little beasts. I especially like Donner Party and Clad in Garments Like a Silver Disease. A great book just to have knocking about the house.

He has done other shows as well which may or may not have been aired in the US yet, namely &quot;Fantasy Rooms&quot; and more recently &quot;Home Front - Inside Out&quot;. (Both of these series have books to accompany them.)In &quot;Fantasy Rooms&quot;, Laurence creates rooms which draw their themes directly from the passions/lifestyles of his clients. For example, one of my favourites is the Art Nouveau Bedroom in which he takes the client's love of Muchas/Art Nouveau and creates a bedroom to die for! Everything from the headboard on the bed, the subtle stencilling on the wall, to the peacock coloured throw was just perfect - and the book not only shows you gorgeous pictures of the finished rooms, but a bit of how to do it yourself. I would say that they are not quick do-it-in-a-weekend type projects though...(at least not the way I decorate!!) What it should do is give you the inspiration to dump the magnolia walls and make your house reflect your own individuality and style.I can also recommend the newly published &quot;Home-Front Inside Out&quot; in which Laurence teams up with Diarmuid Gavin, with Laurence doing one room inside the house, and Diarmuid doing the garden (Diarmuid is to gardens what Laurence is to interiors and together they are absolute magic!) You must see Diarmuid's mirror-tiled, egg-shaped refrigerator in one of his designs! Incredible! At the moment this is not available at amazon.com, but is available on amazon.co.uk - but keep checking as it has only recently come out in the UK (Nov 2001) and may find its way to the US in the near future."},{"Title":"Fantasy Rooms: Inspirational Designs from the BBC Series","review":"My previous experience with Lawrence Llewelyn-Bowen comes from his presence on BBC America's &quot;Changing Rooms&quot; therefore, I am not familiar with the show upon with this book is based.

In the process losing much of the joy of flow.(None of which is required here)More than a handful have tried to reach the wider community in such works. However, the writer/analyst who has truly entered the patient's hopes, fears, dreams with the patient is the one whose writing bears the truth in reading.Michael Eigen is one such writer.He seeks to clarify and illuminate for me and as I read his words I become as much part of the emotional fabric of his stories as he the analyst and in turn-his patients.His feelings toward his patients make me wish if I were in need of analysis(and many might say I am) that I would not hesitate to work with him. To entrust him as the guide beneath the layers to the most sacred spot- the soul.How apposite is the title in light of his role.... His words set the readers mind along a feeling pathway. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in this journey we call life.He has such a simple way with such complex subjects and words that unfold a story not soon forgotten. His writings remind me of my homeland in Ireland where these brilliant narrators would show up and draw chairs about the fireside in a circle of hope.....there was an anticipation and a longing to hear those stories...not so much that they were unique but the way they were told and long before they opened their mouths to allow the words to reach one's ears.In his books its a similiar feeling, to open and read and know one will come away far, far more enriched by his words.I have just ordered two more books."},{"Title":"The Sensitive Self","review":"This is one of his best books, and I am enjoying it immensely.

Capturing a time long past, a serene turn-of-the-century Vienna, Dr. Emil Mayer has preserved street scenes perfectly representing individuals often seen, such as sidewalk vendors, window shoppers, a scissors grinder, a carriage driver, and more. All of these photographs are artfully composed, beautifully rendered. Most amazing, perhaps, is the intimacy and sympathy these images convey. It is almost impossible to view them without being moved.Born in 1871 in Bohemia, Dr. Mayer was a Jew who was the victim of Nazi oppression. Following his suicide at the age of 66, his possessions, including his photography collection, were lost. Thus, regrettably, little is left of his great work.Nonetheless, &quot;Viennese Types&quot; is mute testimony to his photographic artistry. This is a rare volume, one to be treasured."},{"Title":"Viennese Types","review":"In photography when things turn out well it's often because there's been an especially graceful coalescence of art and science. The photography of Dr. Emil Mayer (the &quot;Dr.&quot; was an honorary title in common use by lawyers in Austria) is a sublime example of that happy merging. Mayer was an enthusiastic practitioner, teacher, and proponent of bromoil process photography - a method that allows for a freedom of expression via a series of laborious chemical manipulations of the negative, and produces a monochrome print that has a softly grainy appearance, and a sort of quietude, in addition to effective, evocative painterly depth. From this collection and the essays that accompany it one comes to understand Mayer had the soul (and the eye) of an artist, and the patience and skill of a scientist. The results are terrific.Rudolf Arnheim's Foreword offers an elegant preview of these atmospheric documentary photographs of a vanished time and place: turn-of-the-century Vienna, a city and a culture that has been called a &quot;uniquely civilized world.&quot;Edward Rosser's sensitive accompanying biographical essay, &quot;The Life and Art of Dr. Emil Mayer,&quot; is both an appreciation and a fine critical piece. Mayer, a Jew, was born in 1871 in Bohemia. His family moved to prosperous, bourgeois Vienna when he was a child. He was well-educated, and became a lawyer and a passionate hobbyist photographer, leading a large Viennese amateur photography club for 20 years, from 1907 to 1927. Mayer published numerous monographs (some in the US) on bromoil process.Rosser explains that Hitler's annexation of Austria intervened, however. In June 1938 Mayer and his wife committed suicide. Their possessions, including of course most of his photographs, were confiscated, lost, or destroyed. Rosser's essay elaborates: Many if not all of the Europeans who would have remembered him after the war fell victim to the Holocaust themselves. Mayer's disappearance, then, was nearly assured in a scenario replicated - unthinkably and by the millions - in our time.But in fact Mayer's photographs were rediscovered, and the facts of his life reconstructed by the hard work and efforts of several people (credited in Rosser's essay).The complete portfolio of the 51 photographs in this collection reside in the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum in New York. They are of everyday street life - a sort that vanished with the coming of the First World War. They are portraits: at least one interesting person is in each. People conduct all sorts of business on the streets. Horses pull wagons and coaches. (Most everyone wears a hat, a cap, or a kerchief - and aside from a group of men in bowlers, the hats are quite thrilling - to this modern eye). The cobblestone streets are for people, goods, and horses - and there are many. The profusion of things to buy and to sell, so emblematic of the bourgeois ideal that was Vienna, caught Mayer's eye - and caught mine, too.This book engaged, challenged, and delighted me. Anyone with an interest in European street life at the turn of the century, in the deep and absorbing technique known as bromoil process, and the sensitive, artful, and deeply humane photography of a man who very nearly disappeared - will appreciate this fine book."},{"Title":"Viennese Types","review":"Viennese Types :: Wiener Typen is a remarkable compilation of the photographs taken by the late Dr. Emil Mayer in Vienna around 1910. A lawyer and photographer active around the turn of the century, Mayer's photographs are exceedingly rare because most of his prints were destroyed by the Gestapo after his death (Mayer and his wife, both Jews, committed suicide in June 1938, soon after the Anschluss). But two copies of a remarkable portfolio of his original prints survived the Holocausts, and it is this portfolio which has now been published by Blind River Editions, augmented with an informative essay by Edward Rosser and a foreword by Rudolf Arnheim. Viennese Types :: Wiener Typen is a unique and outstanding contribution to the history of photography in general, and the memorable, impressive, beautifully executed work of Emil Mayer in particular."},{"Title":"Viennese Types","review":"Despite its rather blunt title: VIENNA TYPES is Dr. Emil Mayer's surviving masterwork of street photography.

He acknowledges that living in a modern world is often like straddling a gulf created by inner and outer tensions. Michaeli's teachings suggest that we stand in the center of all directions and energies. From this center, we can create an axis of equilibrium. It is not required to read this book from front to back. It may be enjoyed by topic or simply page by page. This is not an ordinary self-help book. It does not include written rules or recipes, but if you are open to sensations and perceptions, it may open a door of self-understanding."},{"Title":"Battleship","review":"H.P.Willmott has written a brillant account of the steel behemoths which changed the face of naval fighting equally thoroughly as the rise of the aircraft carrier or the submarine did half a century later. He shows the interested reader through the fifty years between the battles of Manila Bay and the Japanese surrender at Tokio Bay - the singular events he makes out as the start and finish point of the era of the capital ship.He doesn't just give the account, though, he also presents it before the political, economic and military background of the time. In an analysis of outstanding brillance he explains, for example, how Japan walked into national desaster, and how inevitable this development was before a fabric of service rivalry, nationalism and largely unmitigated economic failure.The author is no disciple of the theory that history is the history of great men and so he does away with the loving reverence we've come to accept for several men who influenced the history of the battleship, for its better or worse. For instance, he portrays Sir John Fisher as \\"the subject of some of the most extravagant praise, blatant sycophancy and vituperative disparagement, and it is difficult to know which he sought and liked the most.\\" The author does away with the myth that HMS 'Dreadnought' was Fisher's brainchild (it was, in fact, anticipated by the US Navy in their vastly superior 'Michigan' class and by the Japanese Navy's 'Satsuma', both laid down even before the 'Dreadnought') and shows how the whole idea of this type of ship had been around for quite a while. The Battlecruiser, however, which truly was Fisher's brainchild, is referred to as \\"an utterly disastrous idea\\", and in this context, the author's judgement of Sir John Fisher is really terminal: \\"The great tragedy was that Fisher was retained as First Sea Lord after 1906, when he had clearly outstayed his welcome, and thereafter contributed nothing of value but was a profoundly disruptive and negative influence.\\" This is definitely not the mainstream way Fisher is seen, and there are other people earning (perhaps deservedly) similar treatment, among them Admiral Sir David Beatty (\\"Of Beatty it could be truly said that the surest way to make his eyes light up was to shine a beam of light into one of his ears.\\") whose bad performance he blames for the British losses at Jutland (again, different from 'official' history) and Admiral William F. Halsey (who \\"was never noted for his cerebral capacity and indeed was well-known for his lack of it\\") whom he blames with turning the US Navy's complete superiority on all counts into near defeat at Surigao Strait.The inner flap text states that the author \\"takes issue with the orthodox view of Jutland and claims it as a great British victory\\" but readers looking for such heart-warming be warned that he, in fact, admits that the Germans - holding the advantage of position for most of the day - laid their guns better and maneuvered much more expertly than had been anticipated. He admits that the Germans escaped their annihilation (which would have taken place for sure the next morning) and thus were able to exact a tactical draw from the Royal Navy, albeit after a battle that had occurred in the first place because the High Sea's Fleet was searching a tactical solution to a strategic cause already lost. This Jutland has been looked at for at least three decades now, and Willmott has not really to add something new, at least not on this count. What he sheds new light on is the assessment of John Jellicoe's and David Beatty's performances, respectively, and he finally does justice to Sir John Jellicoe's leading of the battle.I found one flaw in the book, and it is in the author's description of the battle of Tsushima. In the last paragraph on p. 36, it is, of course, the 'Oryol', not the 'Oslyabya' who was severely damaged at the end of the day - the 'Oslyabya' having been the first ship to be sunk in the action.What I didn't like about the book is the fact that it already starts to lose its binding, the book coming apart, literally, and this despite my using only paper bookmarks. A hardbound book should do better.In my conclusion I rate this book full anyway, the errors likely to be corrected in a revised edition hopefully due to follow. The book makes great reading and it educates the interested auditory with quite some new information and insight. Recommended!"},{"Title":"Battleship","review":"I am a big fan of Willmott, this book does nothing to revise that opinion. In one volume Willmott traces the invention, construction, deployment and fate of the battleship. Along the way he examines and revises several bits of conventional wisdom, especially about the origin of the battleship which is generally ascribed to Sir Jackie Fisher, although Willmott makes a strong case the the US Navy actually invented it since USS South Carolina was designed and order before Dreadnought, although it entered service later. Willmott also has interesting things to say about David Beatty (\\"the best way to make his eyes light up was to shine a light in his ears\\") and naval matters in general. I should note that this book covers much of the same ground as the same author's prior two-volume (so far) Last Century of Seapower, so readers of that could profitably skip this work. On the other hand, if you don't have time for the nearly 1300 page Last Century of Seapower, at only 350 pages, this book is a neat summary, almost an abridgment of that work.

I have some free time on my hands and figured I'd share my review of the author, his school, and the book to add to the party...I have been involved in non-professional tracking for a number of years thanks to my grandfather starting me off young following animal tracks in the backwoods of southeast Texas. I had on occasion toyed with the idea of mantracking, starting off with Jack Kearney's book Tracking A Blueprint for Learning How, but I was never able to receive formal training in the science. Back in my early 20's (I'm now mid 30s), I purchased this book - Tactical Tracking Operations by David Scott-Donelan. It opened my eyes to a whole new realm of mantracking that I never knew existed. I was sold out and was inspired to be a tactical operator. Several years later, I became exactly that after joining a large Agency and eventually making the SWAT Team. After completing my basic qualification courses, I still didn't have the formal training I was looking for in mantracking, especially the specialized field of tracking called combat/tactical tracking described in this book. It didn't take a rocket scientist to see tracking had a place in law enforcement, even though some of my tactical peers didn't agree. Little did I know that one day I would have the honor of being trained by David Scott-Donelan himself, and my peers would be begging (literally) for the training as well.Several years ago, after approximately 4 years on SWAT, I was introduced to Mike Vaught by my SOTTO (Special Operations Team Training Officer) Rob A. Vaught offered several members of our SWAT Team a 3 day Basic Mantracker Course at Osage Hills State Park in Oklahoma. I jumped on it and was happier than a secret squirrel in a nut shop. Within two weeks of completing the Course, I had a tracking success on patrol. Bam! I was stoked! Needless to say, I wanted to go deeper into the rabbit's hole of the tracker world. A buddy of mine gave me information about a DHS grant that was available for LE to attend the Combat Tracking Course in Ft Huachuca. Since our SWAT Team had success using these DHS aids in the past, I figured I'd give it a shot. Within short order, I was told the waiting list was over 6 months long and there was no guarantee. It was kind of disheartening at first, but I pressed on looking for options to keep moving forward.It didn't take long using trusty Google to see there were A LOT of \\"tactical tracking\\" schools out there. So how do you decide which one to choose? Well, just like my grandfather taught me basic animal tracking years ago, he also gave me pearls of wisdom like grandparents do. One of those pearls was \\"Go to the source\\". After research, most of the other Instructors out there (though I'm sure some of them are excellent) were students of David Scott-Donelan. So grandpa's wisdom applied was an obvious, go to the Scott-Donelan Tracking School. So I started writing up the request for my Agency and in no time started bumping into budget obstacles. I was told I had to wait for the next SWAT budget to role in before I could apply again. What the heck!? But it wasn't a no, I just had to sit it out for a while. No worries, I kept my head up and kept using the tracking skills in the field I had thus far.Then one day out of the blue (literally), I got a call from Mike Vaught. After cleaning my ears to make sure I heard right, Vaught gave me an early Christmas present with the offer of a lifetime! Vaught was going out to west Oklahoma to assist David Scott-Donelan in a Tactical Mantracker Level I Course that was being provided to a district Drug Task Force and the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics. As he was telling me this, I was thinking to myself, \\"What?! David Scott-Donelan is going to be in Oklahoma AND you work with him?!\\" Of course I didn't say that and tried to act tacti-cool. It just so happened that an ATF Agent had to drop from the Course and to my surprise they offered me the slot. Naturally I did what any SWAT operator who was hard as woodpecker lips would do...first I dropped on my knees and thanked God (always priority #1), and second, I jumped up multiple times and then ran around the house in a non-tactical manner.After completing the Tactical Mantracker Level I, I returned to my Agency and IMMEDIATELY had success after success in the field tracking suspects. And the key was I did it SAFELY - a key component to DSD's method. The very first auto theft suspect I tracked down in the woods, using DSD's training, was so amazed when I tracked him that he thought I used his cell phone's GPS signal to ping him. He could not comprehend that I actually followed his spoor. I mean, who does that anymore right? The rest of the patrol officers were so amazed that they requested the training and we were able to get them a tracking orientation class. I started having so many successes using DSD's training that my peers, who formerly didn't agree with my pursuit of this skill set for the Team, began brainstorming ways to get the budget together to bring DSD to our Agency. The following year, I was able to attend Tactical Mantracker Level II, which added even more tools to my tactical tool box to benefit my Team, my patrol shift, and the citizens that we serve.DSD's tracking training encompasses both rural and urban areas of operations, with the urban tracking being provided in Tactical Mantracker Level II. It didn't take long after attending TTII that I was able to use urban tracking techniques in the field. In fact, I ended up saving a life using DSD's urban tracking techniques and made the local news. The news reporter wanted to interview me about the modern application of tracking for law enforcement because they were so impressed we (LE) use tracking in this day and age. They now know it's alive and well thanks to the Scott-Donelan Tracking School. My urban tracking successes also ended up catching the attention of local city police departments who realized you could actually track in urban environments. We just finished a 3 day Basic Mantracker Course for them. Vaught came down and provided the training for the Officers since he was local. Since completing the Basic Course, my phone has been exploding with these Officers wanting to know how to go further down the rabbit hole like I did. I had only one answer for them, I directed them to the man - David Scott-Donelan. My Teammates and I can vet DSD and the Scott-Donelan Tracking School. His training works! And a lot of the techniques, tactics, and procedures that we learn are contained in this book.Within the past two weeks I have already been contacted by a new, recently formed, multi-jurisdictional SWAT Team here in Oklahoma. Due to word of mouth, a big thing in the Oklahoma LE community, the tactical tracking skill set has become increasingly popular due to its success rate in our State. They wanted to know what my thoughts were on schools available since I have become a mascot of sorts for tracking in my area. Once again, I had only one answer to give the - go to the Scott-Donelan Tracking School for your training. DSD's program is the GOLD STANDARD in tactical tracking. I have had the privilege of attending several highspeed programs of instruction, from Police Sniper School with Dallas PD SWAT, Hostage Rescue School with LAPD SWAT, and Advanced Hostage Rescue with FBI HRT. But by far, the Scott-Donelan Tracking School was the best school I have ever had the honor to attend. David Scott-Donelan has an incredible knowledge base in the science and art of mantracking, as well as in RUTOPS (rural tactical operations). Along with his vast operational experience and background, his program cannot be matched. In my professional opinion, there is no other option. If you want to be the best, train with the best.Despite negative comments I have read, DSD is without a doubt a subject matter expert in this field, and this book is a GREAT place to start your study of it. That's why MARSOC, NSW SEALs, 75th RRC, Army EOD, NPS, BORTAC, the Texas Rangers, and Special Operation and Tactical Teams abroad have sought the Scott-Donelan's Tracking School for training in combat/tactical tracking and tactical acuity. I have brothers currently serving in the 75th Ranger Regiment and they tell me the RRC guys wear their SDTS shirts with pride! I realize that there will be supporters and haters in every group, and some of you may be wondering, \\"What the heck does this have to do with this book?!\\" Well, I'm vetting the author and the techniques contained therein. These TTPs work and my Team and I use them. What sets the techniques within this book apart from other tracking resources out there, is it illustrates and teaches how a tracker can do \\"his work\\" safely in a hazardous environment. That's also why the stories are shared, to reinforce the applications. The tactical tracking TTPs contained in this book are ESSENTIAL and they have brought me safely home to my family on more than one follow-up that could have went real bad if we didn't practice the doctrine we were taught (which is covered in this book). For that I am thankful to DSD.In closing, let me add a comment for the tracking enthusiasts who want to read every tracking book he or she can get their hands on (that's how I am). I own just about every tracking book out there, and I will be one of the first to add that this book is not a single source \\"tracking\\" book (heck, we'd all love a book that has ALL the answers right?). David told me himself to always be open minded and study every tracking book you can get your hands on. That's what I practice. This book is dedicated to an integrated field of tactics and tracking, and as such its mission and audience focused. But if you fall within the target audience of tactical trackers and deploy as such, or you're an avid student of the tracking arts as I am, then this book is highly recommended. It's designed as a training resource, it's not the Holy Bible of \\"tracking\\". But I firmly believe that no tactical library should be without it. As for \\"urban tracking\\", it's not detailed in this book since it's fairly new (and effective), but thankfully DSD is working on an updated version of this great training aid for the future which will cover lessons learned from his years in training US law enforcement and military, as well as our Allies (within OPSEC). I look forward to his update, but until then grab this book while you can. Be open minded, and an ever-learning student of the science and art of tracking. Track On!"},{"Title":"Tactical Tracking Operations","review":"REVIEW UPDATED 7 July 2012:Donelan... Tracks in the \\"REAL WORLD\\" not the \\"SPIRIT WORLD\\"I originally wrote my Amazon review for \\"Tactical Tracking Operations: The Essential Guide for Military and Police Trackers\\" by David Scott-Donelan (DSD) over 11-years ago and felt I needed to update it. Why you might ask; well because with the current slew of tracking books on the market today (including my own) this book is still my go-to book for tactical tracking reference and has stood the test of time.Appropriately DSD with his extensive battle-hardened military background in Special Warfare and specifically his knowledge of combat/tactical tracking (C/TT) re-introduced this forgotten and misunderstood subject back into the American mainstream. This revitalization was the first time C/TT has been emphasized since the end of Vietnam with the deactivation of the U.S. Army visual tracker and tracker dog teams and without DSD C/TT would have remained a lost art and science in the American military psyche. Since the mid-1980's DSD has not stopped promoting C/TT as a viable military tactic to find, fix, and finish enemy combatants and has trained thousands in this skill-set. C/TT methods, tactics, techniques, and procedures have proven successful in low-intensity conflicts and counter-insurgency operations over and over historically around the globe from Malaya, Kenya, Vietnam and Israel to Rhodesia, South Africa and now proven highly effective again in Iraq and Afghanistan.What does this have to do with the book, well DSD was not only the first to re-introduce this skill to Americans, but also to teach and publish these tracking methods in America that have been employed in every conflict since being re-introduced. These methods taught were originally adaptations of the Rhodesian methods modified into what is now considered the Modern Combat Tracking method pioneered by DSD.The book itself is meant to be a \\"guide\\" and not complete treatise on the subject. It would take numerous volumes to cover every possible tracking scenario for every terrain, climate and associated season for just aging and/or micro/macro tracking information. This would be true for the publishing of any tracking book. However, this book lays down the \\"essential\\" fundamentals very accurately and concisely. That once read a few times and dedicating yourself to some \\"dirt time\\" you could become competent in the methods in short period of time. The Lost Spoor Procedures (LSP) detailed are one of the highlights of the book; due to the aggressive pursuit techniques of bounding and cutting-off trails the trackers have to be apt at rapidly requiring the spoor to continue the pursuit and close that time and distance gap. This is one of the major subjects that make C/TT so different from other methods of tracking like the step-by-step method. Also the sections/chapters on Team Tracking, Command & Control (C2) and Counter Tracking cover information currently not available in other books with the detail presented here. This is the information that separates the \\"tracker\\" from C/TT. Now it would not be fair without disclosing some faults with the book. This book was originally published in 1998 and the chapters on \\"High Tech Help for Tracking Teams\\" and \\"Weapons and Equipment\\" are both today very outdated. Both chapters need to revised and/or deleted in future editions. However, I feel that the limited page count devoted to both of these chapters do not distract for the overall quality of this book.Today DSD is the founder/father of the Modern Combat Tracking method that has been adopted by the USMC and the U.S Army, and has been being used by Special Forces since the late 1980's, this has only added to the creditability and validity of the methods discussed and taught in his book. Today there is only one place to learn this form of tracking from the DSD himself and that is at the \\"David Scott-Donelan Tracking School\\" in Tombstone Arizona. I am very passionate about what DSD has done for military tracking in America because as Special Operations Forces operator with 23-years of active service and multiple trips overseas were I personally employed the methods taught to me by DSD in combat tracking have proved operationally invaluable. I can say without question that his training has saved my life on a couple occasions and has accounted for scores of dead and captured insurgents on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.Finally, this book is not for everyone, it is not about tracking animals or trailing lost children but is about hunting armed and deadly humans. C/TT is a holistic subject of various military/police topics that fills a large portion of the book that maybe irrelevant to other trackers. However, with that said there is still relevant information for all trackers to be found in this book. Just understand what you are purchasing.ORIGINAL REVIEW: 15 April 2001David Scott-Donelan with this fascinating book brings his hard learned lessons of aggressive mantracking as he used in the counter-insurgency bush wars of Rhodesia and South Africa. His techniques were gleaned from the elite units (Rhodesian SAS, Selous Scouts, and South African Recces) he served with and instructed in the craft of combat tracking. He does not conjure up spirits from the spirit world to interpret spoor but uses techniques of observation and reduction, with a little common sense. His book covers all fundamentals of mantracking on up to equipment selection, multiple team operations, and follow-up methods to list but a few. Donelan has also taken these tried and proven techniques and has slightly modified them for use in law enforcement employment; using tracking as a tool to apprehend fleeing suspects or escapees, to its use and employment in a search and rescue role. All I can say is if you are to own one book on tactical/combat mantracking this is the book, with its 30 years plus of experience between the covers. Donelan is currently working on a follow up book (working title unknown) so keep your eyes open for it. Also if his book is just not enough and you need or want hands on experience or training; Check out his courses on tactical tracking at his website \\"Scott-Donelan Tracking School\\"."},{"Title":"Tactical Tracking Operations","review":"To those of you that are interesting in tracking. this book will be another source to learn about pressure releases except of Tom Brown Jr."},{"Title":"Tactical Tracking Operations","review":"This book is intriguing and most essential for all trackers who sought for the truth about tracking. It is profoundly written backed by photographs and illustrations on elements that relates to tracking. It is clear and concisely written on the art of tracking. The author's sincere and thoroughness in capturing a skill that is crucial in many of key professions, serving to protect and safeguard in current world against global war on terrorism, was most remarkable. This book is paramount due to author's diversity in tracking and tactical skills as well as his passion in training others in wide range of professions. It is flawlessly written and most helpful for soldiers of today."},{"Title":"Tactical Tracking Operations","review":"The author drips elitism and has a clear dislike for the private ownership of firearms in the United States. That's what put me off initially, but the real problem is that the book contains very little actual tracking knowledge.Boiled down: One guy tracks, two other guys cover his ass. Try to catch up with and shoot whomever it is you are tracking. (like one of those \\"rogue American gun owners\\")The book was way overpriced for what it contains. The cover is very exciting."},{"Title":"Tactical Tracking Operations","review":"Not only has David Scott Donelan set tracking back probably twenty years, he has managed to write what is absolutely the worst and most misleading book available on the subject. There is a cultish following around this author which is totally undeserved for two reasons and this book is one of them: useless marketing piece for his classes. Second reason: it is no mystery nor secret that the real architect behind the whole Rhodesian tracking phenomena was Allan Savory. Savory was the actual operator--the tracking master who developed and translated the regional techniques into a successful military application. Savory did all the legwork, worked out all the kinks and constructed--through actual combat experience-- a detailed system for getting the job done.The sad thing for the tracking community with respect to this book is that all the little details---the bits of advice that will actually keep you alive if you have to track down an armed enemy---are not to be found at all. I wonder why that is? They just aren't in this book, period. Simple fieldcraft solutions to problems like silencing your gear, keeping human scent down, what gear to pack/what to leave, etc.---none of the field-born, time tested stuff you would expect from an actual, hardened combat tracker is present. Hmmmmm. Think about that a bit.What is worse though, and what should have been plainly obvious to every soldier who was subjected to this book is that there is NO OPERATIONAL INFORMATION AT ALL. Where is the nitty-gritty with respect to follow up forces, seamlessly switching out trackers, training commanders to understand and utilize tracker teams? Where is the useful information on debriefs, communication, incorporating technology into operations? It is not to be found in this book, period.Soldiers, I put the question to you: is being an admin guy in a Ranger unit the same as being a grenadier in a Ranger unit? NO. Would you want to be trained to run M.O.U.T. operations by someone who pushes paper all day or works logistics? NO. You want to be trained by someone who ran M.O.U.T. operations all day because he is going to know how to keep you alive.So the question becomes why in the name of all that is holy is David Scott Donelan (who was absolutely an admin guy) training US soldiers and Marines to perform one of the most dangerous possible combat activities? I have no idea, but I suspect the answer lies in the fact that people don't do their homework.Do your homework. You want to read some good books on tracking? Read David Diaz's Signs of Man, Signs of Hope. Read the SAS Guide to Tracking. Read Louis Liebenberg's Art and Science of Tracking or Practical Tracking. But until Allan Savory or someone similar puts out a true, definitive manual on combat tracking there is really nothing in the marketplace that deserves the title that this crappy book usurps for itself."},{"Title":"Tactical Tracking Operations","review":"I had read Scott-Donelan's book seven years ago and had went through his tracking class with a friend from my police department back in 1999. So I got to be trained and met David and two of his instructors. I absolutely loved Scott-Donelan's booked and recommend it to anyone going to do tactical tracking. It was well put together with good stories of Scott-Donelan's time in combat in Rhodesia. I have read several other tracking books and this is probably the best in tactical tracking. I am a member of the tracking team for the Washoe County Search and Rescue team in Nevada and had to purchase this book because I had lent my other book out and never got it back. Great book as far as I'm concerned."},{"Title":"Tactical Tracking Operations","review":"REVIEW UPDATED 7 July 2012:Donelan... Tracks in the \\"REAL WORLD\\" not the \\"SPIRIT WORLD\\"I originally wrote my Amazon review for \\"Tactical Tracking Operations: The Essential Guide for Military and Police Trackers\\" by David Scott-Donelan (DSD) over 11-years ago and felt I needed to update it. Why you might ask; well because with the current slew of tracking books on the market today (including my own) this book is still my go-to book for tactical tracking reference and has stood the test of time.Appropriately DSD with his extensive battle-hardened military background in Special Warfare and specifically his knowledge of combat/tactical tracking (C/TT) re-introduced this forgotten and misunderstood subject back into the American mainstream. This revitalization was the first time C/TT has been emphasized since the end of Vietnam with the deactivation of the U.S. Army visual tracker and tracker dog teams and without DSD C/TT would have remained a lost art and science in the American military psyche. Since the mid-1980's DSD has not stopped promoting C/TT as a viable military tactic to find, fix, and finish enemy combatants and has trained thousands in this skill-set. C/TT methods, tactics, techniques, and procedures have proven successful in low-intensity conflicts and counter-insurgency operations over and over historically around the globe from Malaya, Kenya, Vietnam and Israel to Rhodesia, South Africa and now proven highly effective again in Iraq and Afghanistan.What does this have to do with the book, well DSD was not only the first to re-introduce this skill to Americans, but also to teach and publish these tracking methods in America that have been employed in every conflict since being re-introduced. These methods taught were originally adaptations of the Rhodesian methods modified into what is now considered the Modern Combat Tracking method pioneered by DSD.The book itself is meant to be a \\"guide\\" and not complete treatise on the subject. It would take numerous volumes to cover every possible tracking scenario for every terrain, climate and associated season for just aging and/or micro/macro tracking information. This would be true for the publishing of any tracking book. However, this book lays down the \\"essential\\" fundamentals very accurately and concisely. That once read a few times and dedicating yourself to some \\"dirt time\\" you could become competent in the methods in short period of time. The Lost Spoor Procedures (LSP) detailed are one of the highlights of the book; due to the aggressive pursuit techniques of bounding and cutting-off trails the trackers have to be apt at rapidly requiring the spoor to continue the pursuit and close that time and distance gap. This is one of the major subjects that make C/TT so different from other methods of tracking like the step-by-step method. Also the sections/chapters on Team Tracking, Command & Control (C2) and Counter Tracking cover information currently not available in other books with the detail presented here. This is the information that separates the \\"tracker\\" from C/TT. Now it would not be fair without disclosing some faults with the book. This book was originally published in 1998 and the chapters on \\"High Tech Help for Tracking Teams\\" and \\"Weapons and Equipment\\" are both today very outdated. Both chapters need to revised and/or deleted in future editions. However, I feel that the limited page count devoted to both of these chapters do not distract for the overall quality of this book.Today DSD is the founder/father of the Modern Combat Tracking method that has been adopted by the USMC and the U.S Army, and has been being used by Special Forces since the late 1980's, this has only added to the creditability and validity of the methods discussed and taught in his book. Today there is only one place to learn this form of tracking from the DSD himself and that is at the \\"David Scott-Donelan Tracking School\\" in Tombstone Arizona. I am very passionate about what DSD has done for military tracking in America because as Special Operations Forces operator with 23-years of active service and multiple trips overseas were I personally employed the methods taught to me by DSD in combat tracking have proved operationally invaluable. I can say without question that his training has saved my life on a couple occasions and has accounted for scores of dead and captured insurgents on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.Finally, this book is not for everyone, it is not about tracking animals or trailing lost children but is about hunting armed and deadly humans. C/TT is a holistic subject of various military/police topics that fills a large portion of the book that maybe irrelevant to other trackers. However, with that said there is still relevant information for all trackers to be found in this book. Just understand what you are purchasing.ORIGINAL REVIEW: 15 April 2001David Scott-Donelan with this fascinating book brings his hard learned lessons of aggressive mantracking as he used in the counter-insurgency bush wars of Rhodesia and South Africa. His techniques were gleaned from the elite units (Rhodesian SAS, Selous Scouts, and South African Recces) he served with and instructed in the craft of combat tracking. He does not conjure up spirits from the spirit world to interpret spoor but uses techniques of observation and reduction, with a little common sense. His book covers all fundamentals of mantracking on up to equipment selection, multiple team operations, and follow-up methods to list but a few. Donelan has also taken these tried and proven techniques and has slightly modified them for use in law enforcement employment; using tracking as a tool to apprehend fleeing suspects or escapees, to its use and employment in a search and rescue role. All I can say is if you are to own one book on tactical/combat mantracking this is the book, with its 30 years plus of experience between the covers. Donelan is currently working on a follow up book (working title unknown) so keep your eyes open for it. Also if his book is just not enough and you need or want hands on experience or training; Check out his courses on tactical tracking at his website \\"Scott-Donelan Tracking School\\"."},{"Title":"Tactical Tracking Operations","review":"Scott-Donelan writes a good book on tracking. He points out at the beginning that other books (such as Jack Kearney's) are a fine supplement and details HOW and WHY his book is written. The chapters are concise, accurate when it comes to the subject matter and VERY instructive. The one detractor in these Reviews indicates a collection of 'self-congratulating' war stories. Didn't see it, read it, find it. There are discussions of requirements, techniques, cautions and equipment. Methodology, outlook or attitude and results are discussed. Good book. Won't replace actual training but that is stated at the beginning. Worth the read."},{"Title":"Tactical Tracking Operations","review":"This book is about tracking men-armed and violent men. I know David Scott-Donelan well and graduated from the TTOS he now operates full time. His training is the best in the world. When our military figured out they needed tactical tracking training after we got into Afghanistan they found the best in world. They found David Scott-Donelan a 30-year guerrilla warfare veteran in both Rhodesian and South Afrikan military commando units. You see, properly identifying, tracking and then apprehending or eliminating armed and dangerous subject(s) is serious business. David is the best in this business and this book reflects the pride and professionalism you rarely see anymore. If you want the best tactical tracking operations information buy this book. If you're interested mystics, myth, or malarkey there are other books on tracking to buy. This one is for keeps!"},{"Title":"Tactical Tracking Operations","review":"I'm prejudiced. I have served in combat as a pointman/tracker and was taught the step-by-step approach, had some minor success with it and was wounded several times as a result. You simply cannot serve as a pointman and a tracker at the same time without serious consequence. You can't have your eyes on the ground and your eyes on the bush at the same time. The Tactical Tracking Operations School method offers proven and reliable tactical tracking techniques honed from decades of combat experience in a number of conflict zones. What you get with David Scott-Donelan and this book is a remarkable introduction into the world of tactical tracking from someone with impressive credentials. This isn't esoteric hype or 'Hey! Let's go search for grandma' tracking. With Tactical Tracking Operations you're getting decades of hard fought and earned experienced confined in just several hundred pages. You won't learn to become a tactical tracker with one reading nor will you earn a badge or beret. That comes from hands-on, boots on the ground missions against armed enemies who are determined to do you harm. Then, if you're oh so fortunate-to survive you learn to refine those techniques, learn in spite of your ego, and realize the value of those like Scott-Donelan and what they bring to the table.Perhaps that is why elite Special Operations units today employ his Tactical Tracking techniques and why it is even part of the Marines Combat Hunter program.I have high respect for Search and Rescue teams who go out to bring back those who are injured or lost just as I do for those trackers who introduce something of real value into the mix. However, Tactical Tracking is for combat or special operations missions where the need to know which weapons work best, which cammo pattern assists the team members in the bush, and which tactics and strategies can save lives out weigh the nonsense of puffed up personalities vying for time in the limelight.If you're looking for a book that delves into what tactical tracking is all about without the hoopla, hype or gloss then you need to add David Scott-Donelan's book to your library. It is battle born and battle bled and all you're risking here is a papercut.Now, let me hear a loud Hoo-ah and Semper Fi for all of those honorably serving in uniform. And while we're at it, let's hear one for Scott-Donelan as well."},{"Title":"Tactical Tracking Operations","review":"I found this book to be very helpful. We use this as a text book for advanced tracking in our Search and Rescue team.I have enjoyed the opportunity to take several classes with the author of this book. I suggest that this is a must read book for any tracking operation. I find myself reviewing this book frequently."},{"Title":"Tactical Tracking Operations","review":"I bought this after a Search and Rescue mission, hoping to get an insight on tracking subjects that may be avoiding the search teams.The author spends over half the already short text on either self-congratulatory war stories or &quot;my favorite gun&quot; weapon reviews. The latter in fact are so totally subjective as to be essentially useless. (As a side note, it was the only time in my life I've EVER heard the Mini-14 referred to as having &quot;excellent accuracy&quot;)This book is a definite pass.

Aside from a quick section on the Boston Terrier's history and great pictures, this book is not at all breed specific.

I find the detail both good yet distracting and whilst it starts out looking as if it will ignore the Europeans that is more than remedied by the 2nd chapter, however one can't help feeling that the Wright Brothers get a generous serve - there is a viewpoint out there, originally shared by the Smithsonian, until mercilessly lobbied by the \\"Brothers\\", that Santos Dumont was the first to fly heavier than air and not the Wrights, Schwartz dodges this issue but it is an American view afterall. Whether I will have to revise this review will depend on how the Europeans are handled in subsequent chapters, for although Hollywood was no doubt a major factor in USA aviation development the Europeans especially the British (though not exclusiviely) do have a major claim to airmail driven development as well as rapid despatch of its Empire Administrators, none of which has anything whatsoever to do with entertainment and although the Europeans and Americans were not the good friends they are today, they both eyed each others activities if not with friendship then at least with competitive eyes (Short Brothers versus Sikorsky, Martin, Boeing or Boeing versus Airbus if you want a current example).As you can tell a book to set the mind thinking, but in the end perhaps its the military aspects that really drove aviation until the jet age and economies of scale really set the final flare path alight."},{"Title":"A Place to Stand (Florida College Annual Lectures (Feb. 1-4, 1999))","review":"Be Ready Always: The Biblical Ground for Appologetics by C.

For the guys, there's plenty of swordplay, action and intrigue. For the girls, there's romance and uncertainty. I never knew what a key role the collection and preservation of relics played in the history of the Catholic religion. It's also great to get into the mind of someone who might have lived in that time period and see how similar their dreams and struggles were to our own.

A young knight, Jean-Michel is devoted to the church, and when his local cathedral catches fire, he risks his life attempting to save the building's only holy relic.

Along the way, he meets and is mesmerized by a young noblewoman who becomes his patron, as well as a host of other intriguing characters--good, evil, and amusing.This book reminds me so much of Voltaire's \\"Candide\\" with the innocent hero on a quest; the beguiling, yet more clever, heroine; and various other priests, servants, and noblemen who appear to guide or mislead the young man. Like Voltaire, whose tale was designed more to satirize his contemporaries, Desjarlais too has much to say about the world today in the guise of an epic. His observations on religious disputes are particularly apt.Patricia RockwellAuthor--\\"Sounds of Murder\\""},{"Title":"Ages in Chaos: A Reconstruction of Ancient History from the Exodus to King Akhnaton","review":"This was the first published volume of Velikovsky's reconstruction of ancient Egyptian history, and it is thoroughly documented and footnoted, and beautifully written. In fact, English being Velikovsky's fifth language, it's amazing that he was such a beautiful and spell-binding writer.This was a revolutionary book which launched the revisionist work of such men as Courville, Bimson, Rohl and James in rewriting ancient Egyptian history.Velikovsky's work was condemned for several reasons: 1) he was the first since Isaac Newton to do it (Really!); 2) he dared to use the Old Testament Scriptures as historical texts (If you can imagine!); 3) after publication of his catastrophist theory in Worlds in Collision, everyone \\"knew\\" he was a crank; and 4) he was obviously wrong.Well, as his appendix to Peoples of the Sea adequately demonstrates, the conventional dating scheme has no basis whatsoever; the Old Testament has been amazing verified and vindicated by archaeology back to the middle chapters of Genesis; in some ways he may have been a crank, but so was Newton (who believed in alchemy); and he has as much chance of being right as anybody else, and more than most. The only point I quibbled with was his identification of the Papyrus Ipuwer as an Egyptian version of the Exodus story written by Moses in the Book of Exodus. This was critical because it was the pivotal point of his entire reconstruction. In that, he was correct, but my analysis of the Papyrus Ipuwer (read it on my website at [...]) showed that it was not exactly an Egyptian version of Moses' story. Ipuwer wrote Act II of the drama about which Moses wrote Act I and skipped town across the Red Sea.So Velikovsky's identification of the papyrus was wrong, but his use of it was correct. He makes an excellent case for the Hyksos being the biblical Amalekites, for Hatshepsut being the Queen of Sheba, and for Thutmose III being the pharaoh of sacked the Temple in Jerusalem after Solomon's death. He also did an amazing analysis of the el Amarna letters and connected them to the Egypt of the pharaoh Akhnaton.Highly compelling reading, as are all of his books."},{"Title":"Ages in Chaos: A Reconstruction of Ancient History from the Exodus to King Akhnaton","review":"I have been looking for this book for awhile.

The story provides the usual action, excitement, and intrigue that are Silva?s trademark.

He is sent to Vienna to investigate the bombing of the Wartime Claims and Inquiries Bureau run by Eli Lavon. Gabriel learns that Eli was trying to prove that wealthy businessman Ludwig Vogel was an SS officer at Auschwitz. Vogel is spending millions to get the Austrian National Party candidate elected as chancellor.When Gabriel is kicked out of Austria, he travels to Israel and with the information he accumulated. People working on the Holocaust believe that Vogel is actually Erich Radek, a monster responsible for the killings of thousands of Jews. Gabriel recognizes a picture of Radek because he is in one of his mother's paintings. He did something terrible to her as they were evacuating Auschwitz in 1945 and for Gabriel this case has become very personal. An organization that has international tentacles wants Gabriel to stop investigating and they hire the infamous hitman the Clockmaker to kill him before he exposes secrets that the group wants to stay buried.A DEATH TO VIENNA is an exciting espionage thriller that will appeal to fans of John de Carre, Tom Clancy and Clive Cussler. The action is non-stop but the author does not neglect his characters that have a depth rarely seen in a work of this type. Drawing on facts, Daniel Silva portrays a world that would rather forget about the Holocaust or just as bad, believe it never happened. Readers will adore the troubled and vulnerable protagonist who fights in an invisible war against his country's enemies.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Let me start and say this is the only Silva book I've read. I've been seeing Silva put out a Gabriel Allon book every year or so and decided that if the character has warranted so many books, it must be worth something. How wrong was I!Let me start with the good. The book has a good flow and pace and is, in general, a quick fun read (hence an airport book). The Holocaust research is also interesting and well adapted into the story. Unfortunately, my praise ends about there. The plot is simplistic (zero twists), the characters are very shallow (one was involved in kidnapping Eichmann and the other in hunting the '72 Olympics murderers - WOW!!!) and underdeveloped and the story leaves much to be desired.I said this was my first Silva book and I must say (unless I'm at the airport again) it will probably be my last. Whoever in the Chicago Sun-Times rated Silva as the new John Le Carre, should reread any Le Carre."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Cruised through this book over the last two days while I was home from work with the flu. As with its predecessors in the Gabriel Allon series &quot;A Death in Vienna&quot; is a sleekly paced, well-written thriller centered around the resonance of the Holocaust in today's international climate. Silva's writing owes more to the style of Frederick Forsyth than Robert Ludlum (who, incidentally, happens to be my all time favorite) with deeper characterization and less overt action. There are no superfluous storylines a la some of Clive Cussler's (another personal favorite) recent works. In fact, I have to admit that of all the books I have read in the last six months &quot;Vienna&quot; and Forsyth's &quot;Avenger&quot; would have to rank higher as far as enjoyability than the more anticipated &quot;Tristan Betrayal&quot; and &quot;Trojan Odyssey&quot;.For those of you out there looking for a new author; give Daniel Silva a try. I cannot imagine that you would find yourself disappointed.As for my fellow Silva fans, we can only wonder what his next novel will hold: more adventures of Allon, the return of Michael Osbourne, or something totally new??? It's going to be a long year....."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Of the six books that I have read by Silva, this is the first three stars; the others were either four or five. This book was the third in the Gabriel Allon series and it became tiresome to read many details over for the third time. It is okay to keep some of the main characters from book to book, but to keep repeating so many details is robbing a reader's time and is boring to say the least. In addition to this it was a slow moving story and in many places was unbelievable.Everywhere Gabriel went some person picked up the phone after he left and told the bad guys where he was, what he was doing and in some cases where he was going. This is the first book that I have read where the bad guys had an informer that just happened to work in every hotel, restaurant, etc. where Gabriel showed his face; this occurred in multiple cities in different countries. In some cases it was true in reverse; when Gabriel is in trouble suddenly an associate pops up from nowhere just when he about to be eliminated. In one case an assassin has targeted Allon in a cemetery but does he try a shot from cover? No he is out in the open walking towards Allon. Why was this? Was it so that Allon's friend that he didn't even know was in the country would have time to suddenly appear on a motorcycle in a graveyard and shoot the assassin.I love surprises in a novel but they have to be based on a reasonable sequence that is in character for what you have been let to believe. Of the many thriller books that I have read the most consistent writer is John J, Nance which has many five stars for my reviews."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Art restorer and occasional Israeli spy Gabriel Allon is back. He was introduced in The Kill Artist and it is one of the most interesting characters in recent literature.A Death in Vienna brings him back in a new; better story and we continue to discover new layers in this complex character. Also, many of the secondaries introduced in Kill Artist are back. The book can be read on it's own, but be advised that it is the last on a trilogy dealing with Nazis and the Holocaust. The other two books of the trilogy are \\"The English Assassin\\" and \\"The Confessor\\". It is advisable; but not necessary to read them in order for better enjoyment and the sake of continuity.If you are looking for a thriller, not too heavy in the action scenes and with a better character development and plot than the average this should be your choice. You will be back to visit with Gabriel Allon."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"I have read several other Daniel Silva books. I did not enjoy this as much although I do not think it was intended we enjoyed it. It is an emotional story about the evils of the holocaust. At that level it was moving. The spy portion of the book was really weak. There was no suspense and little action. I will continue to read Silva but I hope we get back to suspense."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"A Death in Vienna was my first Dan Silva book and it won't be my last. Silva weaves together a spy story of danger, excitement, secrets, intrigue and revenge that few authors can match.A Death in Vienna opens in Austria when the office of Wartime Claims and Inquiries is bombed. The office is run by a former Israeli intelligence officer, and he is severely injured and two of his office assistants are killed. The Austrian's write it off as the work of Islamic extremists, but the Israeli's are convinced the crime was done to protect former Nazi officials. Gabriel Allon is a world class restorer of art and is working in Venice under the assumed name of Mario DelVecchio. In actuality, he is also an Israeli agent called in when needed on important cases. In A Death in Vienna, he discovers that the Austrian's are indeed protecting a former Nazi, and Allon needs to discover how and why. His search takes him through many countries including Austria, Israel, Italy, Argentina and the United States. Through it all, Allon discovers that things are sometimes even more complicated than they appear--especially when the CIA becomes involved. In the process, he also learns dark secrets about life in the German concentration camps during World War II, as well as secrets his mother couldn't tell him about her time in a camp.I like mysteries that use real facts and historical backdrops, and A Death in Vienna is such a book. Silva wrote two previous books using the same characters that touch on related subjects, and I'm sorry that I didn't read them first. They include The English Assassin (about Nazi art looting and Swiss banks) and The Confessor (the role of the Roman Catholic Church and the Holocaust). You can be sure that I've added these books to my list."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Very captivating and exciting.

IT'S RIGHT OFF THE FRONT PAGES, RICH WITH STORY, MEANINGFUL.MOVING & MEMORABLE. DANIEL SILVA IS A STELLAR WORDSMITH."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"I have been reading the Gabriel Allon series of Daniel Silva's books. This book in particular reflects a time in history during the II World War in Germany that was not pleasant to remember, and makes us pause to think about what took place and how it affected so many prisoners in the various camps. Silva builds the character Allon based on his family history, as well as his Israeli background. His interaction with his \\"team\\" in Israel and how he develops his professional and personal relationships is written in a realistic manner. Looking forward to the rest of the series."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"The book's hero is a former Israeli assassin presented by the author (pp. 269-70) as having led the Mossad operation to murder the Palestinian leader Khalil al-Wazir (nom de guerre Abu Jihad), which transpired in the country of Tunisia on April 16, 1988, in the presence of his wife and children. I wonder how many people reading the book assume this was a fictional event, part of the background story of the obviously fictional protagonist. Gabriel, our hero, seems to have completed that assignment with the usual Israeli efficiency - except for one thing. He stopped for a few seconds to \\"console\\" the wife and children of the man he had just murdered. I doubt the average reader will trouble his imagination by questioning how such a murder of a Palestinian could be justified. For Gabriel is seen as a \\"good\\" assassin. He condescended to console the wife and children. I was reminded for some reason of Golda Meir's statement \\"\\"I can forgive you [i.e. Arabs] for killing my boys, but I can never forgive you for making our boys kill yours.\\" What a terrible tragedy for the Israelis, that despite all their natural goodness, they are forced, just forced, to murder Palestinians. Look, their assassin stopped to console the Palestinian's wife and children!I read \`A Death in Vienna' because a friend had recommended the author Daniel Silva. I chose this particular title randomly from several sitting on the shelf. My friend told me the hero's name is Gabriel Allon, and that he is an art restorer. Rather early in the book, I was tempted to stop reading. After a bombing in Vienna, the hero's Mossad superior refers to statements claiming responsibility as \\"the usual drivel about the plight of the Palestinians and the destruction of the Zionist entity\\" (p.22). But I didn't stop reading; I soldiered on to the end.Is this book for you, or not for you? If you are among those willing to regard the plight of the Palestinians at the hands of the Israelis' as so much \\"drivel\\", then this book may be right up your alley. There's plenty of good times to be had, watching as the former Nazi is captured and brought back to Israel for punishment. It's true that the action is plodding and the suspense non-existent, but as one gentile reviewer said here on Amazon, \\"So sad, so sad. While reading this book, I cried and prayed for the Jewish people - 5 stars\\". Precisely one of the author's goals, I am quite sure.If on the other hand, you are one who is aware of and disturbed by the plight of the Palestinians at the hands of the Israelis, then you may find the novel's glorification of the Mossad hit man to be, well, not something you can easily warm up to."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"This is not a complete loss, there are some well written scenes, there is a thrill and there is an intrigue.But, practically everybody acts stupid and there is a feeling that the most of the figures are simply cut out from the cardboard. And the biggest problem is that I found some parts of Holocaust-related line very offensive to the memory of my great grandfather and others who were killed."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"I like all of Silva's stuff, but he is sliding downhill a bit. Is he bored with Gabriel Allon?"},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Good idea....bad story development, bad character development. I was disappointed."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"My First Silva novel and I guess I expected more. I guess I was looking more of the writing and plot style of Grisham or Clancy. But all in all, I enjoyed the read and will read his other works.If you're looking for a different and exciting novel, read LUST OF THE FLESH by Beverly Rolyat. A story about district attorney, Nick Allapapalaus, who finds himself caught up in a web of lust, deceit, mystery, suspense, betrayal, murder and sex galore. Is he really the biological father of his ex-wife's promiscuous teenage daughter's infant son? Or has he been set up? A compelling, riveting, engaging, pageturning novel. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Well researched and written like McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD (though a totally different subject!) and well plotted and paced like Baldacci's SPLIT SECOND, A DEATH IN VIENNA is a superb read on so many levels. My first reaction to this book was, \\"The Holocaust and the Nazi thing has been done to death,\\" but once into the book I realized that I was reading something fresh and new, and above all, exciting. Riveting and complex, this is not a tale for the faint-of-heart.Also recommended: McCrae's Bark of the Dogwood and The Devil in the White City"},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Well, I thought this was such a great book, that after reading it, started getting all of Silva's other ones and am presently on his 3rd book. I can't wait to read them all. This is an incredible research effort on his part and so far I don't have a favorite, they've all been great."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"See storyline above.The last in a trilogy of novels, dealing with the unfinished business of the Holocaust, does not disappoint.This well researched novel delivers plenty of action and is written in a gripping and compelling fashion (normal for Silva).International locales include Vienna, Venice, Argentina, and of course, Israel. As you read through all the action be prepared to live through some of the atrocities of the Holocaust.A well rounded thriller sure to please everyone.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"As Silva himself puts it, this book and it's two predecessors in the series, deal with \\"the unfinished business of the Holocost.\\"The trilogy starts with \\"The English Assassin\\" as he tells of the Nazi art looting and the collaberation of the Swiss banks in that endeavor. He then moved on to the involvement of the Roman Catholic Church and the silence of Pope Pius XII during that time in \\"The Confessor.\\" This book deals with those who were directly involved, what they did, how they tried to cover it up and how they tried to live among us.It starts in Vienna when an organization known as \\"Wartime Claims and Inquiries\\" is bombed, resulting in two deaths and life threatening injuries to Eli Lavon, the person who has singlehandedly run the operation in search of those responsible for the Holocost.Gabriel Allon, an art restorer and a covert operative for Israel is tasked to go to Vienna in determine who is responsible. Vienna holds many memories for Allon, most of them bad and this trip only adds to them.Daniel Silva is a master at this type of story which is like eating an artichoke as one peels off the leaves and savors them in order to get to the center. Along the way the reader learns more about the horrors of the Holocost and the elaborate efforts by many to conceal thei involvement and become a force in society again.Daniel Siva is a serious writer and the subject matter he has chosen lends itself to his abilities. It is not necessary to have read the first two books in the series, but you will appreciate this one more if you do. As individual stories they are remarkable. Taken together they are a masterpiece."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Daniel Silva has again capably demonstrated not only his talent, but also the development of his writing from his first novel to his latest. A Death in Vienna cannot be judged, or anticipated, by simply reading the book's inside cover (those critical of the book would probably not have enjoyed Gone With The Wind judging from the movie posters). Instead, it should be read from beginning to end, but only after one has read all of Mr. Silva's prior works in chronological order. For those negative reviewers who were searching for the new Da Vinci Code, welcome to the world of Daniel Silva's writing, which is, to say the least, art in and of itself. By his latest creation, Daniel Silva demonstrates that he has only one best selling novelist to top - himself. And the proof is in the reading."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"I started reading Daniel Silva's books in sequence beginning with The Unlikely Spy and presently reading A Death in Vienna. He is truly a gifted writer. Each novel is different yet the characters are continued from book to book. I look forward to each new novel. I have eight more to left to go. I hope that Gabriel Allon will retire peacefully.I'll be 80 next month, and when I finish The Fallen Angel I'll write another all inclusive review.Peter Paul"},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Daniel Silva delivers an intriguing novel that ties in contemporary \\"Realpolitik\\" with WWII era dynamics that deal with Nazi and American ties that have been covered up for decades. At the threat of the Austrian election being influenced by Israeli revelations, bombs go off and assassins get busy preventing disclosure of a candidate's family secrets. This is a page-turner that shines the light on world history and current anti-semitism."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"I have been reading spy type thrillers for years. Have read all of Ludlum's works, most of Le Carre, almost all of Vince Flynn, not to mention several other authors. That being said, I find Daniel Silva's stories to be equal to or above a lot of the others I have read. I do love a main character and Gabriel Allon fulfills that. I also find it refreshing that he bleeds, he gets wounded, he makes mistakes, he loves, he loses, he cries. Add to that the fact he has a regular job and you have a combination made in heaven. Or Israel. Or Vienna. Or Moscow.I say, \\"Continue on, Daniel. We are loving it!\\"My only wish would be for Daniel to allow loaning the The Kill Artist on the Kindle to encourage others to want to read his works much as it did me!"},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"There were 3 books in this trilogy concerning the theft by the Nazis during WW 11 of art seized from the Jews and hidden in Switzerland. Although these books are fiction, parts of them are based on true facts. This particular book completed the theme and was very exciting and absorbing as were the other two. For anyone interested in Israel's struggle with parts of Europe and most of the Arab world, these books are a real find.Gabriel Allon is the fascinating hero of these books. He is really an fine art restorer but is often called upon to get involved in evil events that occur within the Jewish and sometimes Catholic communities outside of Israel.In spite of all odds, Gabriel survives but sometimes part of his family and friends are not so fortunate."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"In my reading, the Confessor began this particular revelation about the Vatican and its complicity in the Holocaust. A Death in Vienna shows, through a brilliant novel with facts based upon truth, how easily we might forget what happened in the world, ending only 66 years ago. The horrors of the Holocaust were not forgotten by the \\"greatest generation,\\" my parents and those raised in their time, who lived through the Great Depression, and fought against the Nazi war machine.The plot of \\"A Death in Vienna\\" is to revive our awareness of the potential for unspeakable atrocities, all the while reminding us of the struggle of a people to survive extermination, while some of the greatest powers on earth either stood by and watched, or helped the war criminals escape, only to have one resurface as the promoter of his own son as the leader of a country conquered by, then allied with the Nazi Reich.However, today I wonder whether this proof that satan lived upon the earth, and walked among the people has been given less than front row status in our teaching of history. One of the lines from one of the Gabriel Allon novels reads, to the effect, that there will never be peace. Can there ever be when the lines have been blurred by a carefully orchestrated propaganda about the state of affairs in the world? Is anyone without innocent blood on their hands?"},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"I don't know much about Mr. Daniel Silva but it feels as he lived through the events or at least was exposed to stories told by people, who lived through the events described in the book.This is a case, somewhat familiar, of a hunt for an old Nazi, who was able to escape the prosecution. Yes, this approach was used on a number of times by many good writers in order to tell the story of the war, pain, terror, suffering, survival and escape of the criminal, who played the system and the system protected him. All these books end up with some kind of a punishment but neither writer nor the reader are ever satisfied. Even the worst punishment cannot restore the wrong done to so many innocent people and it never returns the dead. But, nevertheless, the punishment is important and it has to be public in order for people to realize what happened and to what degree. Also we hope that it would never happen again but it happens on a smaller scale as local genocides and as the terror spread out by the militant Muslims. So, this book, as many others, is very important.But what makes it different, standing out, personal? When I was reading this book I had the feeling that Mr. Silva was very personal. It was not just another thriller with the Israeli secret service and running around the world. There was a painful story in the foundation of the book. This story is so familiar to so many Jews around the world. Every Jewish family had members, who perished during the war and not fighting the enemy but being starved and beaten to death, by being killed in so many ways, by being gassed and burnt and by being violated even after death through the denial of what the Nazis did.I believe Mr. Silva reached the \\"best so far\\" with this book. Keep writing, Mr. Silva. You are on the right way."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Daniel Silva is the author of six prior espionage thrillers; his newest is the third in a trilogy that explorse various phases of the aftermath of the Holocaust. His centerpiece, art restorer Mario Delvecchio, is, in reality, an agent of the Israeli government named Gabriel Allon. In the prior two novels, \\"The English Assassin\\" and \\"The Confessor\\", the collaboration of the Swiss bankers and the Vatican, in the aftermath of the world's worst act of genocide, are explored in modern-day settings.Allon is the instrument of atonement that brings the past to light in each of the first two books, and his role is similar in \\"A Death in Vienna\\". A fierce and violent act, the bombing of The Wartime Claims and Inquiries office in Vienna, opens the novel. With two young girls dead and the head of the Claims office, Eli Levon, in a coma, Allon has no choice but to travel back to a city he would prefer to forget -- the city where his own wife and child were victims of a bomb some years before.Allon's meeting with a Holocaust survivor, Max Klein, leads him to suspect an Austrian business mogul, Erich Radek. Lavon has been investigating Radek's ties to the Nazis based on Klein's account of a cold-blooded killing he witnessed. Radek has a new name, and his credentials have been washed through the CIA, and a red herring escape to Argentina.The depth of this novel, compared to its predecessors, is in the personal tie in that Allon finds of Radek to his own mother, who barely survived two years in Auschwitz-Birkenau. Through her artwork, and the record of her testimony kept at Yad Vishem, the Israeli memorial center for Holocaust research, Allon learns the startling truth, that Radek, acting as the director of Aktion 1005, had an altercation with his mother on what has come to be known as the Death March from Birkenau.In his mother's testimony:\\"It has been twelve years. Not a day passes that I don't see the faces of Rachel and Sarah -- and the face of the man who murdered them. Their death's weigh heavily on me....on the anniversary of their murders, I say mourner's kaddish for them. I do this out of habit but not faith. I lost my faith in God in Birkenau.\\"The difficulty, and the importance, of Radek to modern-day Austria is in his blood ties to the strongest candidate for the chancellorship of the Austrian nation. Given his position, and the anti-Semitism that still flares in modern-day Austria, it is tempting for Allon's handlers to simply expose Radek; but in the end, Allon's plan to kidnap him and return him to Israel is the path that is chosen.Daniel Silva has exactly the right spirit for his material. A consummate journalist, he ties his fictional account into true events - his research is impeccable. In spare and tense prose, he moves a large group of characters around an obstacle, developing subplots that are as complex as Allon's travel schedule. He is unafraid to tie in the Swiss banking complex, the Vatican and the CIA into the intended/unintended passage of Nazi war criminals into modern society, without the punishment they deserved, and without making reparations to the families of those they slaughtered.The Aktion 1005 effort, under which the Nazis unearthed poorly disguised graves of Holocaust victims and destroyed the evidence in a systematic effort, was tied to famous Austrian criminal Paul Blobel, who was convicted and hanged at Nuremburg. Blobel went to his grave without ever revealing the details of Aktion 1005. It is not a stretch for Silva to set his stage with a fictional character who played a pivotal role in the coverup, much of which remains a mystery today.Silva deserves his following; his plotting resonates with the readers, his action scenes and dialogue are compelling. He exposes the hidden Vienna and the haven that war criminals found in Argentina in the same way he has pointed it out in Munich, and in the Vatican. He accomplishes his goal of a well-paced and intricate thriller, interspersed with just enough history to make sure that we never forget.Superb."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"A concentration camp survivor spots a war criminal in Vienna 60 years later. People do not forget. The criminal went into hiding after World War II, and has n new identity. He also has powerful friends and a network of informants, and will kill to protect his secret. Revealing his past will be a major embarrassment to governments and some highly placed people.Art restorer Mario Delvecchio, in reality the Israeli agent Gabriel, is drawn into the case after people in Vienna are killed. His job is to verify the identity of the war criminal and to bring him to justice. Gabriel finds his own life in danger, but also finds a personal motive.This is the third novel in a trilogy relating to The Holocaust. The story is well researched, and contains material not for the squeamish. It describes the details of the atrocities of the war criminal, the reasons for hunting him down, and the motives of the various people involved. It also goes into details of how war criminals escaped justice, and how various people, agencies, or governments would prefer to leave events in the past buried."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"I remember my first read by Daniel Silva, and it was my first encounter with Gabriel Allon when I took in \\"The Confessor\\". So needless to say, I'm probably not really reading these in the correct order, but I'm sure enjoying it nevertheless! My last read by Silva was his debut, \\"The Unlikely Spy\\", and after that I was more than anxious to get back to Allon. This guy is really good! I'm dying to read more by the man.So, we once again cross paths with Gabriel Allon, art restorer, spy expert, master of many trades. He is called upon once again, this time to investigate a bombing at Vienna Office of Wartime Claims and Inquiries. Oh yeah, Allon shows his stuff, and he digs deep enough to get some dirt on Nazi death camps. Vienna is one of the many settings in this masterpiece. So prepare yourself for some great coffee, maybe a pastry to go along with this. Yet through all mayhem, you just might experience Bach's Brandenburg No. 4 in G in possibly some of the darkest points in this! If you feel the need to make up for lost time, check out The Clockmaker.This starts out with simple directions, and then with a loud bang! Then you really can't put it down. I'll be sure to keep up with Gabriel in the future, whether I go forward or backward is another story, but I'm enjoying it so far! Nazi pigs should beware, Gabriel doesn't like you! Hey, but I love the work of Daniel Silva, and I'll come back to this man anytime for another adventure, wherever it might take me!!"},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"I have now read three Silva novels (\\"The Marching Season,\\" \\"The English Assasin\\" and now \\"A Death in Vienna\\"). I enjoyed all three, but this is easily the best. The story is well written and fast paced as were the other two. What really sets this apart, however, is that Silva provides much greater depth in his historical references and to the psychology of the players--the survivors, the SS and the Israeli Nazi hunters. In addition, he provides an interesting look at the politics of espionage. More than just a great read, this novel sends the reader away with an enhanced perspective on the Holocaust and its impact on lives even today.Although the subject is a difficult one, I totally enjoyed this novel and recommend it highly. It is one of the best of its genre."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"I love Daniel Silva's little assassin, Gabriel Allon. Long before \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", Silva has been writing thrillers that may not have the same initial impact, but his characters remain with me just as long. I usually roll from one book to another, but after a Silva book, I usually need a little time to pause and absorb a little more of the experience. I think my favorite in this series is \\"The Confessor\\", but this \\"A Death in Vienna\\" is a worthy companion. I always learn so much when I read Silva; not things that are required for Life, but things that are required for quality of life like the transience of some relationships and the durability of others and what makes the difference, the fine and gentle skill of art restoration, the politics of Europe and the Middle East (where the good guys and bad guys are startlingly interchangeable), and the long fingers of the Holocaust - to name a few. I understood that this was the last in a trilogy and I was a little panicked to think that Silva would be moving on (as rightfully he could) and leaving Gabriel behind. I'm delighted to discover that Silva's newly published \\"Prince of Fire\\" returns Gabriel to us. Perhaps Silva has become a prisoner of Gabriel like the rest of us. So be it."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Daniel Silva is fast becoming one of my favorite authors. Without giving the story away, Mr. Silva writes in a prose that is so clear that you feel like you have been transported to Italy, and have become a witness to the story. In short this is a must read suspense novel that the reader will find is well-plotted and well-written story."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Daniel Silva may not be welcome in certain circles of the European elite, thanks to his series of novels featuring Israeli assassin/world-class art restorer Gabriel Allon. Using Allon as a very capable protagonist, Silva has explored the unsavory present-day connections with the Holocaust that Switzerland and the Vatican would prefer the rest of us forget. With \\"A Death in Vienna,\\" Silva turns his remorseless pen to the birthplace of Adolph Hitler, Austria.As one character remarks, only the Austrians could convince the world that Beethoven was an Austrian and Hitler a German. While most of us think of Austria in terms of alpine vistas and Mozart, Silva reminds us that Austria has largely avoided the condemnation that history foisted on its deserving neighbor, Germany. \\"A Death in Vienna\\" is not set in a specific year, but it's clear that in the latter half of the twentieth century, Austria still had some unresolved issues.In a gripping opening chapter, an Israeli who makes his living tracking down Nazi war criminals is nearly killed when a bomb destroys his office. The Viennese police are only too willing to blame Islamic extremists, but Ari Shamron, former head of Israeli intelligence, knows better. He enlists Allon to do some investigating, intuiting that Allon's lethal skills will be required in this endeavor.What follows is a pell-mell investigation that tracks from Europe to Israel to Argentina and back, as Allon discovers connections between the Holocaust and the current right-wing candidate for Austrian Prime Minister. Naturally, these are the kind of secrets that get people bumped off, and Silva keeps the pulse pounding as Allon digs deeper and deeper into the mysteries.Allon is also forced to confront his own past as he learns of the connection between the Austrian PM candidate and his own mother, a survivor of Auschwitz. Indeed, the most riveting section of the book is the narrative history of his own mother Allon uncovers in the Israeli Holocaust archives. While perhaps the contents of this memoir aren't completely original for those of us who have seen \\"Schindler's List\\" or done even a modicum of research into the topic, but Silva writes with such a moving sense of place and person that the pages tear by.Ultimately, \\"A Death in Vienna\\" is a thriller - complete with short chapters, action-packed scenes, and lethal and exotic characters all around. But it succeeds as both a thriller and as an exploration of one of Austria's dirty little secrets. By virtue of being \\"about something,\\" \\"A Death in Vienna\\" gets a higher ranking than your standard airplane-thriller fare."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"This is a fascinating work about the capture of an important SS officer who's job was to conceal the death of many prisoners in the concentration camps. Erich Radek managed to survive the War and become an important businessman in Austria. He served US intelligence by being part of the Gehlen network. To add another twist to the story, his secret son, was the leading candidate of a rightist political party running for Chancellor. Lot's of excitement and quick page turning."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"When an explosion rocks the office of Wartime Claims and Inquiry, an organization in Vienna that looks into atrocities against Jews during World War II, Israeli agent Gabriel Allon is sent to make inquiries. This office bombing evokes memories for Allon because it was in Vienna years before that his wife and child had been blown up in a car bombing. Back in Vienna now, Allon meets an elderly Holocaust survivor who relates a horrific story of his time in a concentration camp. Soon the old man is murdered, and Allon begins looking into the man's claim that he had recently seen one of the army officers who committed murders in the camps so long ago.So begins Daniel Silva\`s third novel about Gabriel Allon, spy, assassin, and when not working for the Israeli secret service, a top restorer of art in the churches of Venice. This latest story has the agent on a manhunt that takes him from Vienna to Rome, on to Argentina, the United States and Israel, and back to Europe. The plot involves the possible election of a far right candidate as chancellor of Austria; plans to revive Fascism in Europe; stories of high Catholic Church officials helping to smuggle Nazis to safety after World War II; a hired assassin; and the CIA. During the course of the story we get dollops of World War II and Cold War history, much of it sounding true to life. In one very moving section Allon reads his mother's testimony about her concentration camp experiences, a story so terrible she had not done more than give her son hints about it. There are a couple of incredible coincidences that the author brings in, but one hardly notices them because Silva is such an accomplished storyteller. \\"Death in Vienna\\" is a top notch thriller from beginning to end."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Nice HDTV had Kim uses grid Niue nigh.

Thats it ."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Death in Vienna deals with the question of justice for victims of the Holocaust. When the crimes were so monstrous how can the perpetrators be brought to full account? The Allies wrestled with this at Nuremburg and with the passage of time the answers have not become any easier. So it was with some anticipation that I awaited Daniel Silva's handling of the issues. Perhaps I have been spoilt by reading the later Gabriel Allon books first because this, the fourth in the series, seemed a lot less compelling than his other offerings. This may be because Silva was still developing his \\"team\\" and deciding how the relationships between his key characters would develop.Silva exposes the activities of Aktion 1005 units in 1943 eliminating the emerging evidence of earlier mass murder by Einsatzgruppen squads behind the frontline in the Soviet Union. He also gives Allon some moving insight into his own mother's experience as a concentration camp survivor. But it is only really in the last third of the book that this account comes alight. Then it is non stop action of the kind he handles so well and the avenging anger of the Israeli spy team takes over in a clinical operation that brings justice in its wake."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"While Sherlock Holmes rejected all supernatural explanations for the problems brought to him: \\"The world is wide enough, no ghosts need apply,\\" Frank Tallis' hero, Max Lieberman, is also a man dedicated to the art of science. His deductions come from his expert knowledge of psychology. A follower of Freud at turn of the century Vienna, he too eschews the ghostly solutions, even when his best friend, Inspector Oskar Kleinhardt of the Vienna police is tempted to dismiss logic in the case of the murdered medium, found in a locked room, shot through the heart, with no apparent possible entrance or exit for a mortal killer. The sensuous and alluring victim has even left an apparent suicide note. Case closed? Not when there's no gun in the sealed room!Complications abound both in the case as well as in Lieberman's private and professional life. All of which is set against a backdrop of a swirling Vienna that Tallis brings to vivid life with extreme virtuosity. Lieberman's father wants his son to come into the family textile business--a safe reliable choice. Meanwhile Max has asked his long time girlfriend, the lovely Clara Weiss to be his wife, a choice that makes everyone happy, except possibly himself. And most troublesome is the petty tyrannical dictator who heads up the clinic where Max works and studies. Jealous of Freud's success, and an anti-Semite to boot, he will not brook any of his underlings using Freud's new methods, adhering instead to the barbaric practice of electro-shock therapy, which Max abominates.Tallis uses all of these themes to lend depth and richness to the tapestry of his novel without ever forgetting that the murder mystery is central.The suspects primarily come from the victim's coterie of adherents. Among them are a count with a murky background, a magician, a locksmith, an industrialist and his wife, and the medium's pretty, but nosy maid. All of these characters interact and react in pleasantly suspicious manners.To the disapproval of the Inspector's chief, Kleinhardt asks Lieberman to look into the case. When he reads the suicide note, he is able to psychologically discover a key to the case. Because of what we might call a \\"Freudian slip\\" Max deduces that the slain medium was pregnant. When Kleinhardt trusts his friend enough to put his reputation on the line to order a full autopsy, it is discovered that not only was Lieberman correct, but she was pregnant with twins. This wins Lieberman a grudging approval to continue investigating.Tallis takes us through the beauty and the shadows of Vienna. Mysticism, magic, and superstition abound, but science wins the day--but not without a glorious denouement filled with thrills and danger. Reason may rule supreme but this is no armchair detective story. It is a delightful blend of adventure, deduction, and historical fiction. Even Sigmund Freud makes a cameo appearance, but he doesn't slip and neither does Tallis.I received a free copy of this book from the publisher for review purposes.Laurence Coven had been a professional freelance reviewer for many years publishing in The Washington Post among many others."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"I love series, but at first I did not think that I would.

The story starts in Venice and includes stops in Argentina, Israel and Munich but as the title suggests it mostly revolves around characters and events in Vienna. The plot concerns a former SS member who has changed his identity and now seeks to bring his hard right-wing brand of politics to Austria. It deals with Austria's lingering anti-Semitism and its tendency to sweep its Nazi past under the rug. The novel also explains all the various ways Nazi war criminals used to escape Europe in the last days of the war. In particular, it describes how the Catholic church was instrumental in providing them with new identities and arranging for them to emigrate to various South American countries, especially Peron's Argentina.This series has gotten progressively better and I heartily recommend it to any fan of the espionage genre, or to anyone who isn't but who would like to sample it. I found it a quick, fun read. I finished it in two days. There are some fairly graphic descriptions of concentration camp atrocities that may upset sensitive readers.It is not necessary to read the books in order, although that's what I've done. The first novel in the series, \\"The Kill Artist,\\" is the weakest of the series in my opinion. But subsequent novels in the series are much stronger.

It is extremely well done and informative as well as entertaining. It also explores the internal motivations of Gabriel Allon more than any of his other books. Daniel Silva's talent with the written word is at the same level as Allon's talent is for restoration of old masterpiece paintings. A really great read!"},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"No practicing Catholic will want to read this anti-Catholic book. Silva may be a terrific writer, but in \\"A Death in Vienna\\" he reveals a clear bias against the Catholic church. For example, one character is a Catholic bishop only interested in hiding converted Jews from the Nazis.\\"And those who weren't baptized?\\" (p 175) being the obvious question. Apparently they can be shipped off to the gas chambers.And this is only one small example of Silva's slant. It's one slam against Catholicism after another throughout the book. Silva portrays the Vatican as being eager to help Nazis flee Europe after the war, and, in general, of siding with the Nazis.This is a complete falsehood. Here are the facts:Three years before Hitler was elected chancellor, Catholics were told that anyone who became a Nazi or who wore the Nazi uniform or flew the swastika would not be given the Eucharist. That's right. They were forbidden the sacraments, just as today politicians who promote abortion are denied the Eucharist. Documents in the Vatican show that the Nazis later pleaded for this excommunication to be removed.The request was denied.In the election that swept Hitler to power, the two Catholic areas of the country, Bavaria and the Rhineland, voted against, not for, Hitler. Which should surely not surprise anyone. Christianity, especially Catholicism, was being branded by the Nazis as the inheritor of the 'slave' religion Judaism.The Nazis not only hated Catholicism, they actively promoted the occult and paganism. Nazis proclaimed the triumph of the strong, the Nietzschean superman, over the weak--the exact opposite of Christianity. They proclaimed the morality of eugenics. They legalized abortion and sterilized the mentally impaired. And yes, of course the church protested these clear evils vigorously then as she does today.On Palm Sunday, 1937, a secret encyclical by the pope was smuggled to everyCatholic church in Germany, an encyclical to be read aloud that Sunday at Mass. It was a thunderous denunciation of the Nazis. \\"There is but one alternative left, that of heroism\\" ended the pope sadly.And heroism it would require. Dachau had a entire cell block of Catholicpriests, most of whom would not survive. (A good book on this subject is 'Priestblock 25487, A Memoir of Dachau'.) Indeed, the Nazis murdered nearly every priest in Poland. The future Pope John Paul, then secretly, and illegally, in a seminary, would only escape by what some would call a miracle.And as for the much maligned Pope Pius XII, the German historian Hesemannrecently released documents showing Pope Pius XII arranged for the escape of200,000 Jews from Germany in the weeks after Kristallnacht alone. During the war convents, monasteries, and the Vatican itself were filled the brim with Jews being hidden from the Nazis. The New York Times actually thanked the pope for his treatment of the Jews.Here are two good books on the subject: 'The Myth of Hitler's Pope', written by Orthodox Jewish Rabbi David Dalin and 'Before the Dawn' written by Eugenio Zolli, who was head of the Hebrew College of Rome. Zolli was the chief rabbi in Rome during the Nazi occupation of Rome. Obviously, he was in a position to know how the Vatican treated the Jews in Rome during the war. 'Before the Dawn' is the autobiography of his life during the war. It will utterly demolish any lingering doubts as to how the Catholic church, and the pope himself in particular, treated the Jews during the war.And here is a quote Albert Einstein: \\"Being a lover of freedom, when the revolution came in Germany, I looked to the universities to defend it, knowing that they had always boasted of their devotion to the cause of truth; but, no, the universities immediately were silenced. Then I looked to the great editors of the newspapers whose flaming editorials in days gone by had proclaimed their love of freedom; but they, like the universities, were silenced in a few short weeks. Only the Church stood squarely across the path of Hitler's campaign for suppressing truth. I never had any special interest in the Church before, but now I feel a great affection and admiration because the Church alone has had the courage and persistence to stand for intellectual truth and moral freedom. I am forced thus to confess that what I once despised I now praise unreservedly.\\"Silva appears to know little, if anything, about Catholic theology regarding the church and Judaism. He doesn't know that Catholics consider themselves the fulfillment of Judaism. According to Catholic theology God did not end his sacred covenant to the Jews, he expanded it to include all the Gentiles, thus completing his promise that all the ten lost Jewish tribes--now too intermarried to be separated out--would be brought back together.Silva doesn't know Catholics regard Jews as the best possible people that God, who is love itself, could have chosen as the firstborn among the children of God. The very best. Silva doesn't appear to understand Catholics believe the pope is the new high priest, that the entire sacrificial system and Levitical priesthood, which vanished from Judaism with the fall of the temple in Jerusalem in 70 AD, is believed by Catholics to continue in the Catholic church.There is no doubt that there have been Catholics who, at times during the last two thousand years, have have treated our brothers in God, the Jews, with a horrifying lack of love, even with outright cruelty. This was a very great sin. There can be no excuse for such behavior, only remorse and repentance.But Silva is simply wrong in his accusations at the church during World War II."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"love when an author carries the main characters throughout a series.

And this completes the author's series of novels dealing with the unfinished business of the Holocaust.In Vienna, the head of the Wartimes Claims and Inquires office (an Israeli operation) is critically injured in an explosion meant to kill him. Once again, Gabriel is taken off an art restoration project in Venice, given false ID by the Israeli Mossad, and sent to investigate the attempted murder.While in Vienna, he sees a face he recognizes from the past. He'd seen the face in his mother's artwork from many years ago. He somehow knows Ludwig Vogel is not who he says he is and starts to pursue his real identification. Gabriel is soon on a road filled with hatred and deception, possibly headed for revenge. In the tangled web of intrigue, Gabriel learns the depth of the atrocities of WWII and how this one man in particular who is still alive will go to any length to keep his secrets buried. Ludwig, of course, has many people in high places in his pocket, and threats meet Gabriel everywhere he goes.This is an involved plot with many characters, but it reads easily and well. You won't be disappointed. And finally...a book with an appropriate ending."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"The security system at the Wartime Claims and Inquiries office in Vienna was formidable, and seemingly impossible to breach. The technology, including a finely tuned magnetometer, had been installed by a firm in Tel Aviv. Since many Austrians vehemently wished the organization did not exist, a letter of introduction was necessary in order to enter the offices, and thorough searches were conducted after appointments were granted. The elderly Eli Lavon worked there and was responsible for interviewing Holocaust survivors, and their descendents, who sought restitution for property and valuables stolen by the Nazis. When a bomb blew up inside the front office, killing two young women and severely wounding Lavon, Ari Shamron, the \\"Memuneh,\\" and former head of Israel's Mossad, knew he had to call in master spy, Gabriel Allon, to work the case.Allon, who goes by the name of Mario Delvecchio, is one of the world's most brilliant art restorers. He is working on a Bellini altarpiece in Venice when Shamron notifies him of the explosion which critically injured his old friend, Eli. Although personally adverse to returning to the city where another act of violence claimed his wife and son years before, Allon travels to Vienna immediately to investigate the crime. A former Auschwitz inmate, Max Klein, contacts Gabriel right after his arrival, and tells him a bizarre story about his unintentional involvement in the explosion. Klein, who had been forced to play the violin in Auschwitz's infamous death orchestra, is murdered, but not before he imparts critically important clues.Klein's information takes Allon to a Viennese cafe where he sees a man whose face he vaguely recalls. Then he discovers a photograph which triggers nightmarish memories. Unknowingly, Gabriel Allon become involved in events which are to take a tremendous emotional toll, and will lead him across Europe, to South America, and back in time to WWII. He will learn details of his deceased mother's internment in Birkenau Concentration Camp, events she had never been able to discuss with him, and also about the infamous Death March she barely survived. For the first time he will read Irene Allon's testimony at Yad Vashem, the Israeli center for Holocaust research and documentation. His mother's past, billions of stolen dollars in a Swiss bank account, and multiple conspiracies which still protect a sadistic mass murderer are linked. At the center of all the clandestine activity is the future chancellor of Austria and a plan to revive Fascism.I think \\"A Death In Venice\\" is Daniel Silva's best book in his trilogy about the Holocaust. Although the last of the series, this novel stands well on its own, and the reader does not need any prior background to become thoroughly immersed in this historical thriller. The story takes on more chilling relevance when it is coupled with current Austrian politics. Gabriel Allon is a wonderful character. He has the soul and sensitivity of an artist, yet has had to repress so much of his self in order to serve his country. And he has made supreme sacrifices, including the lives of those he loved most. Now, when it appears he might finally have another shot at a meaningful life, he is called out of retirement, yet again, because of a scheme with consequences too politically devastating to contemplate, and because of a compelling need to seek justice.

Perhaps it has been my period of adjustment over the deluge of these stories in the past twenty years. Having decided that the ultimate experience for me was \\"Sophie's Choice\\" I shunned everything after that, but \\"A Death in Vienna\\" changed all that, for it was not only well written, well paced, and well thought out, but actually took me someplace I had not been in the cannon of Jewish/Nazi experiences. I greatly applaud Silva's effort and would recommend this book to anyone whether or not you're interested in the subject materialWould also recommend two other books, totally unrelated: Life of Pi by Martel, and The Bark of the Dogwood by J.T.McCrae. Both are great reads, and again, not related in subject matter to \\"A Death.\\" Enjoy."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"A death in Vienna starts the action in this seventh thriller by Daniel Silva. The Wartime Claims and Inquiries Office is destroyed by a bomb. The reason for the killing is that apparently an old man contacted the office after claiming to have seen an old SS officer now going by the name Ludwig Vogel. As Sturmbannfuhrer Erich Radek, Vogel is responsible for the deaths of thousands of Jews in W.W.II. Vogel is now a very wealthy industrialist in Austria. The Israeli government calls into action Gabriel Allon, their assassin who also works as an art restorer, to look into the accusation. Hampering their investigation are Vogel's henchmen who have no hesitation in killing Allon to save Vogel. However, Allon's true motivation to bring Vogel to justice lies in his own past.Daniel Silva is one of the finest thriller writers currently working. His books are all compulsive reads filled with high octane thrills. However, one cannot get over the feeling that this book is his first stumble. According the author's note, \\"A DEATH IN VIENNA is actually the third book in a cycle dealing with the unfinished business of the Holocaust. Nazi art looting and the collaboration of Swiss banks served as the backdrop for THE ENGLISH ASSASSIN. The role of the Catholic Church in the Holocaust and the silence of Pope Pius XII inspired THE CONFESSOR.\\" The current book is also based loosely on real events. However, in the previous books the historical events flowed from the action. This gave the books a greater sense of spontaneity. In this book, the real events dictate the progression of the book. This tends to make the plot and pacing appear too artificial and predictable. It is a much more contrived work. There really is no true character development and all of this has been covered before in both popular and 'serious' fiction."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Learned historians have argued for years about the cause, loss, destruction and Armageddon-like aspects of the Second World War. Insanity, greed, myopia, good versus evil. One of the more compelling arguments that the storm that gathered which would turn Europe into a giant necropolis was that it was intrinsically evil. More so than in other conflicts dating back to Alexander. And at the heart of that is the death camps.Hard to explain. It is so horrific as to make the brightest of women and men shudder in attempts to comprehend. Just to understand takes monumental discipline.Simon Weisenthal, the most known of the Nazi hunters, was once asked if ever we come to the point that we have hunted these monsters of the Reichstag long enough. Weisenthal responded, \\"never.\\" We must remember. We must have something to remind us. We must never forget.I'm not sure that the novel is the best forum for that monument. But at times it may be the only forum. Mr. Silva presents a magnetic, riveting novel on the search for a death camp officer who, through a series of believable ironies and misguided assitance escaped detection.It is a terrifying journey. Not having read the first two parts of the Gabriel Allon saga, I can at least report that \\"A Death in Vienna\\" stands on it's own two legs.Lengthy and haunting, even for an Irish kid from New York born after WWII, it brings tears to your eyes.Not your usual mystery/adventure.

In creating this mystery/thriller, Silva has crafted a tight, fast-moving, well-grounded spy novel. (Knowledgeable circles consider this American author's work to be accurate on its spy craft, and to be informed on the procedures of Israel's spy agency, Mossad; and America's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).)This novel centers on Gabriel Allon, Israeli son of a holocaust survivor, raised on a kibbutz, widely considered an excellent art restorer, secretly an Israeli spy/hitman. There's been a fatal bombing in Vienna, at an office similar to that of famed holocaust survivor/Nazi investigator Elie Wiesel. Allon speaks a native Berliner's German, learned at the knee of his mother, a holocaust survivor, and he knows Vienna, from previous operations there, so the Israeli secret service sends him back. He's not welcome back, as a result of those previous operations -- despite the fact that spies have traditionally been thick on the ground in that city for most of the 20th century. But there he is, looking into the office's last case. This brings him to Rome, where he investigates the Vatican's checkered role in the holocaust, and the aftermath of World War II; and to Latin America, where many fugitive Nazis settled. He soon realizes this case will reach out to touch him personally, through his late mother.The author's characters are individuated and well-drawn, and his writing is resonant. He's witty and terse, too. At one point he writes, discussing a CIA safe house:\\" the safe house is located in a corner of the Virginia horse country where wealth and privilege meet the hard reality of rural southern life.\\" It's no wonder he's considered one of the more competent spy novelists working today. He has been called his generation's finest writer of international intrigue and one of the greatest American spy novelists ever. Compelling, passionate, haunting, brilliant: these are some of the words that have been used to describe his work.Silva burst onto the scene in 1997 with his electrifying bestselling debut,The Unlikely Spy, a novel of love and deception set around the Allied invasion of France in World War II. His second and third novels,The Mark of the AssassinandThe Marching Season, were also instant New York Times bestsellers that starred two of Silva's most memorable characters: CIA officer Michael Osbourne and international hit man Jean-Paul Delaroche. But it was Silva's fourth novel,The Kill Artist, which would alter the course of his career. The novel featured a character described as one of the most memorable and compelling in contemporary fiction, the art restorer and sometime Israeli secret agent Gabriel Allon, and though Silva did not realize it at the time, Gabriel's adventures had only just begun. Gabriel Allon appears in Silva's next nine novels, each one more successful than the last.Silva knew from a very early age that he wanted to become a writer, but his first profession would be journalism. Born in Michigan, raised and educated in California, he was pursuing a master's degree in international relations when he received a temporary job offer from United Press International to help cover the 1984 San Francisco Democratic National Convention. Later that year Silva abandoned his studies and joined UPI fulltime, working first in San Francisco, then on the foreign desk in Washington, and finally as Middle East correspondent in Cairo and the Persian Gulf. In 1987, while covering the Iran-Iraq war, he met NBC Today National Correspondent Jamie Gangel. They were married later that year. Silva returned to Washington, went to work for CNN, became executive producer of its talk show unit including shows like Crossfire, Capital Gang and Reliable Sources.In 1995 the writer confessed to his wife Jamie that his true ambition was to be a novelist. With her support and encouragement he secretly began work on the manuscript that would eventually become the instant bestseller THE UNLIKELY SPY. He left CNN in 1997 after the book's successful publication,. began writing full time. Since then all of Silva's books have been New York Times and international bestsellers. His books have been translated in to more than 30 languages and are published around the world. You really can't go too wrong with him."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"This was my first Silva book, (I know \\"A Death in Vienna\\" is the final book in a trilogy). My misstep in no-way took away from my enjoyment of the book. The leading figures were complex, realistic, and flawed. The heroes were not the typical James Bond or Clint Eastwood types that populate too many espionage novels. The author obviously has first hand experience of living in Vienna, since the descriptions of Vienna and the rest of Europe are ultra-realistic. The significant background information on the Holocaust made the book even more enjoyable since it added to the credibility of the plot line.The author's journalistic background gives his writing a tight, but rich feel. My only complaint was the evil characters lacked the depth that Silva gave the heroes. The bad guys were cold, unforgiving, and entirely evil. Despite this minor point, I look forward reading the first two books in the series."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Another awesome book written by Daniel Silva. I have always enjoyed Mr. Silva's books, but this book is great. After reading this book, I got addicted to reading more about Adolf Hitler, Adolf Eichman and the Mossad.

I recommend this book and the series to anyone who enjoys this genre."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"This was a well written mystery/thriller with a European setting for the primary action. It was a good yarn with lots of twists and turns and Silva does a good job building the characters. However, much of the book was framed in Jewish customs including Jewish holidays, events, etc. Not being Jewish, I was unfamiliar with any of these references to Judaism so I found it confusing. In fact, I had to skip over these references and it made following the plotline quite awkward. I understand that Silva is Jewish, but he uses these references to he detriment of non-jewish readers and spoils an otherwise good story."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"I have always been a fan of espionage novels, and this one really had me from the get-go. I will be reading more of his novels."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"\\"A Death in Vienna\\", the last of the Gabriel Allon trilogy regarding the Holocaust, sheds light on what makes Gabriel tick. It reveals details regarding Gabriel's mother, a Holocaust survivor, that paints a picture of the childhood that made him who is - a gifted art restorer and world weary spy. The plot revolves around the suspected Nazi, Erich Radek, whose unmasking is essential in Gabriel's journey."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"I have read much about the holocaust. Some information is very good and other information less so. Most information is so overwhelming that you want to stop reading before you become numb to this human suffering. However, I really like the way Daniel Silva developes these three mysteries in the \\"here and now\\" and works his way back to that hellish past and exposes how it may still influence today's events. Something that can be done to correct what is still wrong, maybe. I really enjoyed the story and information."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Daniel Silva's \\"A Death in Vienna\\" is a deeply poignant and powerful tale - that rare combination that at once delivers thrills and intrigue while illuminating an important historical event. That event is The Holocaust, more specifically the Nazi efforts during the War to conceal their unthinkable atrocities. In Vienna, a mysterious blast, attributed by Austrian officials to Islamic terrorists, destroys the Wartime Claims and Inquiries office, killing at least two of the three inhabitants. Called back from Venice to investigate is Silva-regular Gabriel Allon, Israeli secret agent and assassin and sometimes-famed restorer of priceless Renaissance paintings. An unlikely combination perhaps, but few fictional characters can match the depth and power of Silva's Allon. The author spins a masterful web of time and place, of horrific scenes inside Nazi death camps, the monsters who ran them, to those who survived that Hell only to suffer the guilt of one less obvious but nonetheless tortuous. The face of true evil is seen in Erich Radek, once an SS officer responsible for the death and disintegration of hundreds of thousands of European Jews, currently enjoying life as a prosperous businessman in modern day Vienna. Silva deserves much credit for refusing to let the unfinished business of The Holocaust to die in a time where there are those who would rewrite history and expect us to believe it never really happened. Despite a predictable fate for Allon's prey, little solace can be taken when justice is finally served, when even vengeance offers no relief in the wake of cruelty of this scale. This is fiction at its best: a lean, no-nonsense page-turner with a moral and a message, another masterpiece from today's most important spymaster."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"This is the first book of Daniel Silva's that I have read and I will read more. It was very interesting and I read it in a weekend (no small feat with two young children). However, I didn't have any real interest in any of the characters. Perhaps this is because the main character originated several books ago and I don't know his history. Still a great read.If you liked this book you will also enjoy Greg Iles \\"Black Cross\\" and \\"Spandau Pheonix\\"."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"This is the 4th Silva book I have read, all with Allon.All good, exciting, educational and with a purpose. As a recent spy novelist, I rank Silva at the top.....A good read...."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Silva represents all that I love about the old-school suspense masters, while threading in the wonderful aspects of the new. Once again, in this installment of his Gabriel Allon novels, Silva uses the terse prose and historic settings of Jack Higgins, the conspiracy theory plotting of Robert Ludlum, and--in a nod to the new regime--a dose of emotion and pathos that make his characters memorable.Although deeper and more convoluted than one might think initially, Silva's plot is delivered with clarity and nice pacing. The characters and settings are drawn with credible detail. The themes of Nazi war criminals, family honor, revenge, and the quest for truth are brought to bear as Allon once again finds himself pitted against a formidable foe.Racing from Vienna, to Jerusalem, to Argentina, and Poland, this story is a masterpiece of character and conflict. The roots of Allon's own family tree are dug up, and he must choose between burying his enemies or burying his desire for vengeance. Although the issue of a rogue bodyguard is left dangling at the end, the climax is breathless and satisfying.This is what great suspense tales are all about. Silva deals with national strife and injustice, making his point within the story, while staying away from the pulpit-pounding that LeCarre resorts to in his own latest novel. (I'm a LeCarre fan, but \\"Absolute Friends\\" left me absolutely worn out.) Silva may have detailed \\"A Death in Vienna,\\" but he proves that there is plenty of life left in the Gabriel Allon series."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Daniel Silva is a wonderful author. His books are hard to put down once you start reading one. His characters are full and extremely human-showing the best and the worst of humanity. Many of his books have the same characters but he makes it very easy to understand how they all fit together-in the past and in the time of the book. His assassins are even somewhat likeable because he gives the background showing why they became assassins. His books would make terrific movies. He better write another one fast because I only have a couple of his older ones to read before I will need more."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"I enjoyed the book as a novel, well worth the read. I enjoyed it even more for the background that it provides about the Holocaust. The presentation of this research material (historical material worked into the fabric of the story) provided an insight into this horrible series of atrocities that I never was able to appreciate prior to this reading. I have found this to be typical of Silva's work. His research is worked into the narrative in a manner that makes the historical aspect of the novel fascinating reading.I grew up in an era in which I should have been well advised of the horrors of this part of our collective history (I was in my early teens during WW II), and although as a kid I was fully on board with the hatred of Hitler, Mussolini, and Hirohito, I never was told of these atrocities on the part of the Nazis except in the most sanitized manner. Silva makes it personal.I have noted in his other works that he is careful to present the Palestinian side as well as the Jewish side of the MidEast conflict, and that is informative as well. But, in the case of the Nazi effort to eliminate the Jews, there is no rational \\"other side of the discussion\\", I am convinced."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"I have read all of Silva's books so far - and I love each one. He is an excellent writer. He makes it difficult to read other authors after reading one of his books!"},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Daniel Silva is quite a good writer, and perhaps in 2004 when \\"A Death in Vienna\\" was published, the story line may have still been relevant. I don't think it has much relevance today and maybe not then. Some may find reminiscing about the holocaust interesting and even compelling. I do not. Nonetheless, the story is well-conceived, and it moves - for the most part - at a satisfying pace, even if it is about 75 to 100 pages too long. At least Silva does not make the same over-writing mistakes that Vince Floyd makes, smothering the reader with way too much background detail.The primary problem with the book is its predictability. Too much of the motivation and rationale of key players' actions are provided by \\"telling\\" us about it. There isn't enough action, no real surprises. You absolutely know how it will end, even though some of the twists and turns are unexpected. And, sure enough, it ends as any reader would surmise.Gabriel Allon, the main character and sort of \\"hero,\\" is an assassin employed by Israel. His cover is that of a world-renowned restorer of art, an actual talent he has with a well-deserved reputation. He is more-or-less driven to avenge -- for Israel's secret service -- the atrocities of one of the demons who oversaw the Nazi concentration camps during World War II, but also personally for the horrors experienced by his long-suffering mother, a holocaust survivor, now deceased. There's a lot of rather unpleasant stereotyping of Austria and Austrians. There is a lot of hate to go around here.The motorbike \\"chase\\" scene in Rome is good, as are also the eventual capture of the bad guy, Radek in Vienna, and the escape of the good guys with Radek across the Czech Republic border. In between there are much weaker episodes, such as the futile and quite boring adventure in Argentina, where Gabriel's mistakes and uncharacteristic naivet&eacute; get him in deep trouble, only to be rescued by the CIA. It was moments like that in this story that strained the tale's credibility, even for this highly-overblown genre of fictional high speed chases and high-risk adventure espionage. Coincidental events (the storm in Zurich, for example) occur all too often, weakening the story greatly, no matter how clever the plot line.One of the best things about the story is its unflinching condemnation of the leadership and actions of the Catholic Church. That alone makes the book a worthy read and those episodes provide some of the more engaging parts of the book.In all books like this - except those by Alan Furst and a very few other superb World War II espionage fiction writers - everything is black or white, good or bad, done or not done. There is little moral reasoning by any of the primary characters and even less well-considered action by anyone involved -- from the former Nazis, to the Nazi protectors in current day realities, to the Israeli secret service or its prime minister, to the hideously duplicitous Catholic Church hierarchy, to the CIA, to the main actors in the story. No one seem even to want to reflect somberly over their OWN actions, and all are quick to blame the \\"other side\\" for existing. All actions are expedient, whether or not for a good or evil. Even Gabriel from time to time seems merely to be just \\"doing my job,\\" despite what we would all conside an honorable rationaleAt least the evil Radek never gains a conscience, never apologizes, and never shows a weakness, except for his paternal yearning for his secret son's success in becoming Austrian chancellor. The ending 3 pages --- depending on your own personal predilections - are either a sad sell-out to TV-land or predictable just desserts for the evil-doers. Take your pick. At least all the threads of the story are tied up neatly at the end.While the entire cast of characters is irredeemably heterosexual, Silva does spare us from overindulgence in straight people sex, and for that I was grateful. The one player with real emotions, it seemed to me, was in fact, Gabriel's side-kick and erstwhile lover, Chiara. I liked her.Finally, I really wonder if relatives of holocaust survivors would or would not \\"like\\" or \\"appreciate\\" this book. Probably an open question.All in all it's probably a 3.25 to 3.5, but the rating must be downgraded to a 3.0 for the story's glaring weaknesses."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Who knew working for an agency seeking reparations for victims of the Nazi era was so dangerous? It sounds like a job for lawyers and accountants. Not in Daniel Silva's Vienna, where the fortress-like Wartime Claims and Inquiries office is blown up by an agent known as the Clockmaker. Art restorer Gabriel Allon, a former Mossad assassin, is asked by his legendary ex-boss to investigate. The fast-paced plot leads Gabriel from Vienna, to the Austrian Alps, Israel, Rome, Argentina, Zurich, Munich and back again. In the process Silva gives his readers a short course on the mechanics of Hitler's Final Solution.Gabriel discovers that the mastermind is an octogenarian Sturmbannfuhrer who played a key role in the Holocaust. He is sitting on a 2.3 billion dollar hoard of Nazi loot with which he hopes to re-establish fascist governments across Europe.Silva's spy thriller, the final book of a trilogy featuring Allon, is a throwback. While LeCarre and other practitioner's of the genre have found new evil empires with which to frighten us, Silva still mines the Nazi motherlode very effectively. In 2004, it is reassuringly quaint to read about a CIA that can locate and compromise terrorist assets held in secret Swiss bank accounts and a Mossad that can pull off bloodless kidnappings against its murderous enemies."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"I have just started reading Daniel Silva's novels and found his storyline to be very strong and believable. At the beginning of the book I had to go back and pick up on some of the characters as they all seem to be introduced at the same time. That is my only minor complaint of the book. Usually authors will introduce characters in a well timed sequence but not in this book.Once a found out who was who, it was great reading! Plenty of action, suspense and thrills to keep you reading well in to the night."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Not great literature, and not a page turner either, it is an OK read. The Austrians are efficient, protective, and resemble the authoritarian picture of them from World War II. The Swiss character is a banker. The Americans are pragmatic, looking at a greater world view. The main woman in the story (who has a small part to play) is beautiful, cunning, and as effective as any assassin. And the Israelis are efficient, determined, intelligent, and get their man. Obviously, lots of stereotypes.It would probably make a better movie than a book."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Although a scion of Hollywood's famed Goldwyn family, Tony Goldwyn has very much made it on his own as producer, director, and actor.

Purposely or unknowlingly???I need to point out and correct a grave error that is repeated in his novels. For instance, again in \\"A Death in Vienna\\" twice he wrote that the slaughter of 6 millions Jews \\"Is the greatest case of mass murder in history.\\" It is not!!

A Death In Vienna completes the Holocaust trilogy that started with The English Assassin and was followed by The Confessor, and it is every bit as good as its predecessors. Each of these books are novels of slow-building, yet non-stop tension and suspense that will keep you glued the edge of your seat. If you haven't read a Daniel Silva book before, do yourself a favor and add this book -- and all of his books -- to your Must Read list. Money and/or time spent on a Silva book is as good as gold. You will be more than satisfied. While the subject matter of A Death In Vienna is filled with the inhumanity that occurred during the Holocaust and with contempt for those who enabled this tragedy to occur, Silva describes these events with tremendous feeling.

The Kill Artist2. The English Assassin3. The Confessor4. Death in Venice5. Prince of Fire6. The MessengerIn this book, Gabriel, a former assassin for Israel's foreign intelligence service, the Mossad (which translates into English as \\"The Institution\\") retired after the murders of his wife and son to lead a quiet life as an art restorer, one who fixes the wounded past. Gabriel's ex-boss, Ari Shamron, an Israeli spymaster a la George Smiley but far more treacherous, again draws Gabriel into the world of espionage and revenge by convincing him to investigate a bombing that left his friend Eli Lavon in a coma and two women dead. Gabriel sifts through the rubble of the past and finds not only the bomber, but his mother's story that he never knew.While many books have dealt with the suffering of survivors of the Holocaust, few books have ventured to discuss the pain inflicted on the next generation, raised by people too badly scarred emotionally to normally parent children, but who tried their best nevertheless. The act of bringing a child into this vale of tears is an act of hope and optimism, a physical confirmation that the world is worth another human life, but many Holocaust survivors weren't able to fully participate in loving their children as much as they would have, given other circumstances. When one sees such devastation of humanity, it is impossible to cling too closely to one particular soul that might be snuffed out by the machinations of world powers. By exploring the aftermath of the Holocaust on a familial level, we gain new understanding of Gabriel, and we begin to understand how such a talented artist has the soul of killer.TK KenyonAuthor ofRabid: A NovelandCallous: A Novel"},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Gabriel Allon, art restorer/Israeli spy-assassin is back in the third installment dealing with the sins of the past.

A very interesting book that you will enjoy reading."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"The death camps of the Reich provide the underpinnings of this intense and fast-paced novel in which the author draws new attention to the collusion of governments and institutions in protecting Nazi war criminals into the present day. Gabriel Allon, the main character, is working peacefully as a fine art restorer in Venice when he is suddenly summoned by his mentor in the Israeli secret service to investigate the bombing of the Vienna Office of Wartime Claims and Inquiries. Although the Austrian government has declared the bombing to be the work of an Islamist terrorist group, Allon believes it is more likely the result of current anti-Semitism within Austria. An extremely conservative candidate for Chancellor is given a high likelihood of winning the coming election and, the author points out, bringing the philosophy of the Reich into the twenty-first century.As Allon searches for the perpetrators, the action careens from Vienna to Israel, Italy, Argentina, the US, and back to Vienna, and involves complex political, financial, and national security issues affecting a number of countries. Always, the present is tied to the history of the Reich. Erich Radek, a former Nazi, is still alive and active in Vienna, his war-time obliteration of the graves and bodies at Polish death camps so total that a new generation of Austrians is now asking, \\"Where is the evidence that the Holocaust ever happened?\\" Konrad Becker, a Zurich banker, has a mysterious client with over two billion dollars in assets; a Catholic bishop who helped war criminals escape is still connected to governments and police; successive governments in Argentina have provided aid to war criminals since the time of Peron; and American CIA agents have protected some war criminals during the Cold War. As Allon narrows the search to one well-protected man, the violence reaches a crescendo.Silva's journalistic style is perfectly suited to his subject matter. He presents information efficiently and without preamble, in short sentences which move the action along quickly. Incorporating historical facts within his fictional framework, he provides testimonies from the Holocaust library at Yad Vashem, evidence from Auschwitz and Treblinka, and an account of Adolf Eichmann's capture to elevate the fiction, give it credence, and pack an emotional wallop. Within this exciting chase to apprehend the murderer, Silva develops his thematic goal of bringing continuing injustice to light, and few readers will fail to be moved by his zeal and the power of his historical details. This is a strong novel which transcends the usual \\"thriller\\" designation because of its reliance on verifiable evidence. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"I'm truly sorry that I can't join in with crowd that has given this book high praise. \\"A Death in Vienna\\" left me strangely disappointed. Mr. Silva claims the book completes a trilogy on the unfinished business of the Holocaust. I finished the book feeling that Mr. Silva left the book itself unfinished - well, if not unfinished, then certainly unpolished [sic].I have nothing against authors using their novels to bring home a point or issue important to them. But when the point/issue becomes bigger than the book itself, the book suffers. That is what happened in this novel.Mr. Silva is certainly entitled to remind his readers that the Holocaust should never be forgotten, nor ever allowed to happen again (to any people). However, in his desire to bring that point home, the book lost the rich quality of his other works. I would have been much happier had Mr. Silva written an op-ed piece on the occasion of this book's publishing. Unlike Mr. Silva's previous works, I never got the feeling in \\"A Death in Vienna\\" that it was the characters who were tormented. Instead, it seemed all too clear that Mr. Silva was the tormented one. Not good, not even acceptable, for a novelist of Mr. Silva's caliber and capabilities.Having served in Vienna, the book was somewhat of a trip down Nostalgia Lane for me. However, in painting the right-wing political party of Austria (Freedom Party) as two-dimensional bad guys reduces this book to nothing more than a paperback Western in the tradition of \\"Shootout At the OK Corral\\" (et al). \\"A Death in Vienna\\" is really nothing more (stylistically and structurally) than a revenge tale (seen \\"Open Range,\\" anyone?). I don't disagree that Anti-Semitism was/is a problem in Austria, but to single out Austria when anti-Semitism continues to be a pan-European problem is a simplistic \\"pin the tail on the bad guy\\" approach to a much more complex issue. To imply that the \\"right\\" in Austria are the harbingers of a new Nazi movement is just as simplistic and impunes the majority of \\"rightists\\" in Austria who see their party (along with the right-center People's Party) as a solution to the ills of 50 years of failed \\"left\\" (Social Democrats) politics.While I, in no way, am trying to excuse the fact that Austria was the birthplace of Hitler or that a majority of the Austrian population voted for the Anschluss, Mr. Silva displays either a naive understanding of the European (and specifically Austrian & German) political situation of the 1930s (as well as the situation confronting the U.S. in the immediate aftermath of WWII) or has purposely avoided a more balanced presentation in order to cynically highjack his readership for his own ideological purposes. I would remind Mr. Silva that much of the \\"anti-\\" sentiment in Austria today is not anti-Semitic, it is \\"anti-foreigner\\" (as a result of continuing problems in the Balkans). The \\"anti-\\" sentiment seen in Austria today mimics the \\"anti-\\" sentiment seen in the southern U.S. as a result of illegal immigration from South and Central America. Speaking of the U.S., I would also remind Mr. Silva that while it is indisputable that the U.S. set up and used the Gehlen Org, it was also the U.S. that pushed for the establishment of a Jewish State and continues to be Israel's staunchest ally.This review is not meant to be a defense of Austria or of U.S. policies (past and present). Nor was it written to diminish in any way the significance of the Holocaust. Instead, it was intended to let Mr. Silva know that we (his devoted readership) have come to expect better from him. I fully agree, the Holocaust (or any systematic action against any people on any scale, however small) should never be allowed to even gather the slightest bit of momentum. However, if making such a passionate, personal point is crucial to Mr. Silva's telling of a story, please do a better job of it.Finally, I hope \\"A Death in Vienna\\" is not the last appearance of Gabriel Allon. There is much left to explore in Mr. Allon's world and I would like to participate in the discovery."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"\\"A Death in Vienna\\" is Daniel Silva's third novel about how the horrors of the Holocaust reach into the present. Gabriel Allon is a former Israeli spy who now works as an art restoration expert in Venice.

Gabriel is not anxious to go back to the city where his wife and son had been victims of a car bomb in 1991. However, Shamron persuades him to return to this \\"forbidden city\\" to investigate the bombing of the Wartime Claims and Inquiries Office, which left two young women dead and an old friend, Eli Lavon, in a coma.Gabriel soon learns that a man named Max Klein had set the events in motion that may have led to the bombing. Klein had once been a violinist in the Auschwitz camp orchestra and he had a particularly vivid memory of a Nazi named Erich Radek. In front of Klein, Radek once killed fifteen concentration camp prisoners in cold blood when they could not correctly identify a musical piece by Brahms. Many years later, Klein spots this same war criminal placidly having coffee in a Viennese caf&eacute;, and he reports what he has seen to Eli Lavon, who then begins to make the inquiries that almost cost him his life. Gabriel's investigation leads him to make some horrifying discoveries, the most painful one being the heart-rending story of his mother's two years of hell as an inmate of Auschwitz-Birkenau.Silva writes with great feeling about the harrowing events of the Holocaust and the culpability of those who helped the Nazis escape punishment after the war ended. In addition, Silva convincingly makes the point that radical right-wing political parties still pose a serious threat around the world, and that we must do everything in our power to protect our civil liberties in the face of these extremists. \\"A Death in Vienna\\" is fast-paced, compelling, and filled with intriguing twists and turns. It is a worthy, well-researched, and thought-provoking conclusion to Silva's excellent trilogy."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"The synopsis of A Death in Vienna has been laid out beautifully in most of the reviews presented here. Just the sum it up again: Gabriel Allon an Israeli sometime spy is sent to Vienna in order to investigate the recent bombing of the Wartime Claims and Inquiries. In the course of events he discovers that a notorious SS man responsible for the death of millions of Jews during WWII is now living peacefully under a new name in Vienna. As to make things even worse he also seems to be meddling with current political affairs notably the election of the new chancellor.Silva's language is brisk and precise. The characters portray a seldomly seen depth. And the storyline is vivid, intense and fast paced. In short an excellent book that will keep you hooked. As I am an Austrian I was further amazed by the accuracy with which Silva describes the city. His book referring often to wartime history is most definitely well researched. Nevertheless many parts are fictional which I would like to put into perspective.First of all Austria or Vienna is not the dark somber place harboring Anti-Semitists as it may seem judging from the book. It has come a long way and is trying to deal with its past. True there is and there has been a right-winged party (as in most countries) however it has been discredited due to a recent scandal. Support for it has hit an all time low. Further Austria was never even close in getting a \\"Nazi\\" chancellor. In fact the chancellor is not even voted directly by the people, which is not made clear in the book. The party with the most votes usually nominates the chancellor and that has never been a right-winged party since the war. And last just to mention a minor mistake when ordering a \\"Schlagobers\\" in a Viennese caf&eacute; you are most likely to receive a bowl of whipped cream. A black coffee with whipped cream is referred to as an \\"Einspaenner\\".Nevertheless I would recommend the book to anyone without hesitation. I hope to read more from Silva whom I regard as being an excellent writer. Not many authors can write about a topic as sensitive as the holocaust with such a grace."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"\\"A Death in Vienna\\" is the kind of book Frederick Forsythe used to write. This tightly written thriller recalls the best elements of Forsythe's 'Oddessa File.' in which the sins of the Holocaust are recalled in the framework of hunting down a suspected Nazi war criminal. Silva manages to convey the horror of the Holocaust without being preachy, and has come up with a page-turning globe-trotting novel with a strong heart, plenty of action, and a compelling cast.Silva's writing keeps getting better and better."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"I truly enjoy novels that are more than just good writing, though Silva's work clearly meets this standard. This book is intelligent, thoughtful and well researched. Silva calls upon historical references to WW2 and the holocaust, making the novel both an excellent read and emotionally charged.Beyond these points, Silva's writes a darn good spy/assassin/intrigue novel."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"I'm a big fan of the entire Allon/Shamron series. Silva is one of the few authors today who makes sure he gets the historical aspects of his story right before putting it on paper. In the Allon series he touches on a very sensitive subject with the Catholic Church and Nazi Germany. I loved it!Not his best in the 'Art Restorer's' series as far as action and suspense goes, but the historical flashbacks with his mother and the death march made it well worth it.Very similar to The ODESSA File by Forsyth."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Deep dark secrets from Nazi Germany, the Catholic Church and the Israelis always attract me, but this one fell disappointingly flat. Silva has really done his research, although it seems at times that he is just throwing out detail about villages, smells etc for the sake of it, to show that he HAD done his research.There were quite a few instances where he over-explained actions to the reader: X, because he had done this, did that, because Y wanted him to do it. I suppose I'm used to writers like Le Carre, who was a craftsman, and who forced the readers to think carefully, who doled out enough info to tantalise, but not so much that the climax was spelled out. Silva, while he has some nice turns of phrase and scene, is competent at this genre, but is by no means in Le Carre's class. The climax was obvious by the halfway point (and was well and truly signposted at regular intervals thereafter), and although a few minor twists intervened, the only time my interest was stirred was the border crossing with Radek anaesthetised in the back of the car. The rest of the pacing was at a plod.The characters were stereotyped, the providential events (having coffee with the Pope's private secretary was one) strained my credulity and were it not for the cleanness of the prose, I would have put the book down midway through.I won't be reading any other of Silva's books, which is a shame, as the content of his novels sounds interesting. It's just the delivery that lets it down."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Eli Lavon, an old friend of Gabriel Allon, Israeli master spy, lies near death, the victim of an explosion in the Wartime Claims and Inquiries office in Vienna. When Israeli spymaster, Ari Shamron, asks Allon to track down who was behind the bombing and bring them to justice, a twisted international trail of clues and history leads Allon to tales of his own mother's death march to Auschwitz and traces of Sturmbannf&uuml;hrer Erich Radek, now living as Ludwig Vogel, a prominent high profile, wealthy and very influential businessman in Vienna. During the latter stages of WWII, when Hitler and all of his senior staff knew that Germany was losing the war to the squeeze between advancing western Allied and Russian forces, it was a sadistic, psychotic Radek's overwhelming and horrifying job to literally eradicate the existence of the Holocaust from history, to erase the evidence that it ever existed, to bury the camps and to destroy the bodies and mass burial sites.Like many other spy vs spy espionage thrillers set either in the 1940s or set in the present but related to the context of the events of WWII, the plot of A DEATH IN VIENNA is not a simple one - a complex trail of clues and events, intermingling of historical events with current day happenings, a seemingly endless cast of characters, the mystifying motives of political, racial and military imperatives and a literal maze of globetrotting travel and communication. Who's on whose side, why somebody is doing what they're doing, who's gunning for who, who's telling the truth and who's twisting the facts for their own unstated purposes is never obvious and a reader, if they hope to take anything away from the story, will have to pay close attention from first page to last.In fact, I would go so far as to say that Silva's Nazi thriller stories are acceptable but not great in comparison with the likes of Jack Higgins or even Ken Follett, for example. But (and I believe this is much more important) this remarkable thriller also allows Silva to continue his story of the Eastern European death camps, the brutal genocide that was the Holocaust and the heartbreaking tale of one woman's courageous story. The way in which Silva tells the story of the plight of the Jewish people during the war, far from being a distracting side story or merely a side bar essay, lifts A DEATH IN VIENNA from a routine and probably unremarkable thriller to a moving and entirely outstanding tale of both mystery, passion and heartbreak.Even if you are not a particularly big fan of the thriller genre, A DEATH IN VIENNA, as the culmination of the series that includes THE CONFESSOR and THE ENGLISH ASSASSIN, is well worth reading for the history and the back story alone. Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"This is the seventh book from Daniel Silva, and his fourth dealing with the escapades of part-time art-restorer part-time Israeli spy/assassin Gabriel Allon. As always, Silva does not dissapoint. A colleague of Allon's is killed in his office in Vienna, an office that specialises in investigating aspects of the holocaust. Allon's handler, Ari Shamron, directs Allon to investigate, and so the story starts. A story that takes us to Austria, Italy, the Argentinian highlands, the United States, and of course to Israel. The story also touches on two themes that Allon has visitied before: the holocaust, and the relations between the Vatican and the Third Reich. The story is a thriller in every sense, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, as I have all of Silva's books. Silva usually takes his readers on an enchanting journey through many interesting countries and cities, and he is a master at accurate descriptions of these places. His descriptions in other novels of Rome, Venice and Jerusalem, amongst other places, were simply outsanding, and highly accurate. At least, in my experience of these places. But he and I clearly had very different experiences of Vienna. I was surprised by his \\"missing the mark\\" with Austria in general and Vienna in particular. It is a wonderful country and a wonderful city: gay, lively, tolerant. It is hardly this dark and foreboding hotbed of antisemitism and fascism like he has chosen to portray it. I suspect that Silva did spend some time Vienna, and it is not too accurately portrayed, when compared with my own experiences. And, while I do concede that Austrian coffee terminology can be a little tricky for a non-German speaker, I suspect that few Viennese order a cup of whipped cream in a cafe. However, that is not to say that this book is a most enjoyable read, and I have no hesitation in recommending it. If this is your first \\"Gabriel Allon\\" novel, I would recommend to read the previous three first, to put it in perspective. Vienna has a special place in Allon's history, and I think it is important to understand that when reading this book. From me: three and a half stars!"},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"This book was excellent too, I must say. If you read \\"The Confessor\\" it leads right into this book so you don't miss anything. So I do suggest you read the 2 other books the precede this book so that you don't miss anything and understand all the events that have lead to this book."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"This is a superior spy thriller concerning the pursuit of a Nazi war criminal responsible for the cover-up of over a million Jewish exterminations, known as Aktion 1005. Gabriel Allon is one of the best art restorers in the world, and also an assassin for the Israeli Intelligence Service. A Nazi war criminal investigator is bombed in his office in Vienna, and Gabriel is called on to investigate the crime, leading him on a trek across Europe and Israel.What is interesting is how Silva brings the reader along, uncovering the mysteries one step at a time, pulling us into the tale. The characters are finely drawn and his prose direct and tightly descriptive, painting a vivid story of death and deception. There is a distinct air of realism in this writing as nothing is exaggerated, giving the story a believable edge.Silva's descriptions of Israel, for example, are done so well that I could actually visualize Jerusalem, the burning sunsets, pollution and exotic scents. His descriptions of Rome and the Vatican are also right on the mark as Allon pursues the identity of an alleged Nazi, possibly helped by the Catholic Church to escape justice.Before reading this novel, I had no idea of how many Nazi war criminals are out there living under aliases in South America, Europe and the United States. It would certainly be a full time job to track these men down, expose their true identities and put them on trial. Unfortunately, the more time passes, the less chance there is to find them and bring them to justice. And I believe they should be tried for their terrible crimes against humanity.This is a masterful thriller in the hands of a writer who knows his art form. Gabriel Allon is an interesting character and I look forward to reading his other books, namely The Confessor, The English Assassin and his latest, Prince of Fire.A Death in Vienna is simply a brilliant book."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Well researched and written like McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD (though a totally different subject!) and well plotted and paced like Baldacci's SPLIT SECOND, A DEATH IN VIENNA is a superb read on so many levels. My first reaction to this book was, \\"The Holocaust and the Nazi thing has been done to death,\\" but once into the book I realized that I was reading something fresh and new, and above all, exciting. As always, Silva has constructed a story that is gripping, compelling his readers to turn every page with bated breath. In the course of solving the murder, the protagonist has to delve deep into the history of the Nazis and the way that they treated their victims. Riveting and complex, this is not a tale for the faint-of-heart.Also recommended: McCrae's Bark of the Dogwood and The Devil in the White City"},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Typical of the writing of author Daniel Silva, A DEATH IN VIENNA is a work of fact-based fiction based on his brilliant and thorough research.This third book of a trilogy again features an Italian art restorer who actually is an undercover Israeli intelligence agent.The agent is brought in to solve the mystery of, yes, A DEATH IN VIENNA. Although the death occurs contemporaneously, the seeds of this murder were planted during World War II, in the Auschwitz concentration camp.As always, Silva has constructed a story that is gripping, compelling his readers to turn every page with bated breath.In the course of solving the murder, the protagonist has to delve deep into the history of the Nazis and the way that they treated their victims. The dead man and the person who ordered his assassination turn out to have crossed paths during the War; it is up to the Israeli agent to determine the answers as to how, where and why.The journey that these questions take him on reveal, layer by layer, many facts still largely unknown about the Nazi extermination machinery.Author Silva has said that this will be the last book in the series. I am sorry that this is his plan as, based on his own extensive research, I suspect that he has other important tales to share."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Excellent!!!! and the best part is the author informs you at the end of the story of what is real and what is not!!!!!"},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"The book was so good.Every think WAS moving.learn a lot about that time in history ,I was very interested in the hole think.THANK you:The"},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"I enjoy this author very much.

As a student of the Holocaust, I appreciated the depth of research he used for this work. I highly recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a great mystery with enough reality to be believable. Thank you."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"A deadly bomb goes off in the Wartime Claims and Inquiries office in Vienna. Two people end up in the morgue, one man in Intensive Care. The incident brings art restorer Mario Delvecchio away from his work in Venice to investigate who is behind it. There, he resumes his activities as Gabriel Allon, master Israeli spy (first introduced in THE KILL ARTIST). He wants to find whoever is responsible for the attack as much as his mentor/master, Shamron, and the rest of his Mossad colleagues, especially when he realizes that the man in the hospital is an old and dear friend.Gabriel begins a careful scrutiny of the past, which sends ripples throughout central Europe --- indeed, across several continents. In the course of working to solve who is behind the bombing, he encounters an old man whose picture (at least) he knows he has seen before --- an old man who evokes terrible memories and whose past is linked to the Nazi death camps. It becomes Gabriel's mission to bring this man to justice, as much for personal reasons as to balance the scales for the murdered and maimed of the camps.Despite Gabriel's near-impossible travel schedule and his encounters with a seemingly bottomless cast of characters, Daniel Silva's latest work reads quickly. The sheer number of characters (several with at least one alias) seemed cumbersome at times, but the pace remained lively. Even the flashback to the Nazi roundup of hundreds of thousands of Jews --- recounted through the testimony of one courageous woman who miraculously survived --- at first seemed to be a distracting side trip, but actually stepped up the story's flow.Silva does not sugarcoat these horrible times in our world's history. The agony and inhumanity pulse on every page. It's a story that needs to be told so they are not forgotten. And now, with A DEATH IN VIENNA, the last in the Holocaust series, Silva has done just that, completing the circle he began in THE CONFESSOR and THE ENGLISH ASSASSIN. Taken together or as stand-alone novels, they are worthy additions to the libraries of thriller fans everywhere.--- Reviewed by Kate Ayers"},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Up front, I admit that I like the books of Daniel Silva. They are interesting, well written and very well plotted. Many of the characters are original and well formed as well. While this book replows the old ground of the Holocaust one more time, chasing after an eighty year old mass murderer this time, it does it well. Art restorer and sometime assassin Gabriel Allon is once more forced into the dark business of espionage and confronts both his own and his Mother's nemesis in this tale.Like the other books by Mr. Silva this one strains credulity from time to time, but good writing in this genre often needs a suspension of disbelief, sometimes a substantial one. That Mr. Silva's book, A Death In Vienna, requires more than one was neither important nor off putting for me. It is just a fact. The plot other than this is tightly constructed, and you do get caught up in its twists and turns.While I was reading this book I also read a very provocative review of the new Mel Gibson movie, the Passion of Christ, and several of the points the author of that review made could also be said with profit about this book. As a non-Christian that reviewer had difficulty getting past the extreme violence of the Passion of Christ and embracing it as a story of love and redemption. Simply stated the gore of the Passion got in the way of the message and he did not have the cultural heritage to see it as anything other than gore. The Lamb of God is horrifically killed and the Resurrection did not compensate for that fact for him, nor did it make it any easier to digest what he had seen.Similarly, the massive, institutionalized and individual cruelty of the Holocaust is something that cannot be sipped a little at a time. It is a deluge of bestiality of man to man that is hard to swallow the first time you read about it, and it does not get any easier to take with repetition. If anything each telling becomes more and more unnerving as real people, people just like your and my neighbor do things to people that are as disgusting as they are true. There is no answer here of how a civilized people could have done such a thing. I do not think that there ever will be such an answer. But I think that the story resonates differently if you are a Jew. The telling of the story of the Holocaust has become, not an act of contrition, but an act of solemn witness. It is not redemption that is desired, but simple recognition of the horror that lies within civilized man, a remembrance of the people that endured that horror, and a warning to everyone - Since we do not understand the Holocaust we cannot ever be certain that we can prevent it from coming again.In this book at least, a civilized man can confront and fight evil without descending into that evil himself. Even though Gabriel Allon is, and probably will be again an assassin, a killer of men. He is not a murderer. That is a vital difference between Allon and the Nazi in the book. It is not the act that makes the man, it is the choice and the reason for that choice that either gives or withholds meaning for the act. Thus, though there is a profound difference between hunting down and killing the murderers of the Israeli Olympic athletes and the trial of Adolph Eichman, both are moral acts for reasons explained in the fiction of this book. On the other hand, there is no explanation possible for the Holocaust, no explanation for the original participation in it nor for the current climate of denial of it. Silva does a service to us all, by standing witness.A small point perhaps, a cartridge is a bullet and a propellant in a single package that can be loaded into a gun and fired. Silva uses this word once when he means a magazine that holds multiple cartridges. It is a small point, but one an expert assassin should know.Read the book, you will like it and it will make you think."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Daniel Silva disappoints in this fairly formulaic story. Characters are subordinated to another fairly standard recap of the Nazi era. Not his best work."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"A bomb explodes in the Vienna office of a hunter of German war criminals.Thus is &quot;art restorer and sometime spy Gabriel Allon&quot; drawn into a search for a repulsive former German officer, sadist, torturer and killer.If the story weren't based on an actual human disaster of massive magnitude, it would be more enjoyable. Instead, to be reminded of the millions cold-bloodedly murdered by the German nation and its allies is depressing.But Silva writes a suspense filled novel of Allon's search. The characters are richly human. They are not supermen; they are humans seeking justice in an unjust world. Even for crimes that happened a half-century, their passion to seek justice for the dead drives them to put their own lives at risk.Silva's plot never stops or falters. The action keeps pushing ahead, though the reader might find a need to take a break from the recounting of the gruesome deeds being avenged.The knowledge that the background events Silva weaves into his story are, as noted, not the kind of things most people want to think about. But Silva tells a story of long-delayed justice that we can all hope - or wish - takes place in venues outside of fiction.Jerry"},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"This is the first time that I have read this author, and I think that it will be the last...this book for the most part was very boring and I could not wait to finish the thing..most of the words that he uses in this book are very hard to pronounce, and he does not give a lot of feedback to his characters, this is something that would be very helpful to someone, such as myself that has never read his books. I did not feel compelled to care about these characters in this book in the least....some action, but very little....I do not care to read another of this authors books.....if you must read, I suggest you look for earlier works, so that you are not left out in the cold as to who these ppl are in the book!!!!"},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"I have been a hardcore fan of Silva since I discovered his novel &quot;The English Assassin&quot; in the spring of 2002. I was going through a difficult time in my life and his book helped me through it. Since I've re-read all his novels at least twice and must say I was dissapointed this time. Don't get me wrong, this is a well-crafted, intelligent spy yarn that nicely ties up Silva's trilogy, but this one seemed to move slower than usual and the plotting just wasn't very interesting. There is more interesting backstory &amp; drama involving Gabriel's personal life, including things with his mother and the woman in his life, but like I said the actual mystery/spy story in the novel is his weakest yet. I feel that &quot;The English Assassin&quot; is still the best of the three, and they've gone downhill since. Now that Silva has gotten these Holocaust novels out of his system, hopefully he can go back and write something with more thrilling suspense like &quot;The English Assassin&quot; or &quot;The Kill Artist&quot;, which in my opinion is his best Gabriel Allon novel."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Who knew working for an agency seeking reparations for victims of the Nazi era was so dangerous? It sounds like a job for lawyers and accountants. Not in Daniel Silva's Vienna, where the fotress-like Wartime Claims and Inquiries office is blown up by an agent known as the Clockmaker. Art restorer, Gabriel Allon, a former Mossad assassin, is asked by his legendary ex-boss to investigate. The fast-paced plot takes Gabriel from Vienna, through the Austrian Alps, to Israel, Rome, Argentina, Zurich, Munich, and back again. Along the way Silva gives his readers a short course in the mechanics of Hitler's Final Solution...Silva's spy thriller, the final part of a trilogy featuring Allon, is a throwback. While LeCarre and other practitioner's of the genre have found new evil empires with which to frighten us, Silva still mines the Nazi motherlode very effectively. It is reassuringly quaint, in 2004, to read about a CIA that can locate and compromise terrorist bank accounts in Switzerland and a Mossad that can defang its enemies bloodlessly."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Daniel Silva in his excellent and compelling novel \\"A Death in Vienna\\" resurrects his fascinating character, world renowned art restorer and sometimes Israeli secret agent Gabriel Allon.At the behest of his former boss, legendary Israeli spymaster Ari Shamron, Allon travels to Vienna to investigate an explosion in the Office of Wartime Claims. A former colleague Eli Lavon was seriously injured and two young office girls were killed in the blast. Foul play is suspected. Vienna holds only unpleasant memories for Allon as that is precisely where his young son was killed and wife maimed in a car bomb meant for him.Visiting his comatose friend Lavon in the hospital Allon meets an old man and Holocaust survivor Max Klein there. Klein had accidently encountered a wealthy, distinguished Austrian man in a cafe and recognized him as a notorious high ranking Nazi officer in Auschwitz. He reported this to Lavon who assured him that he'd investigate. The man named Ludwig Vogel, a wealthy indusrialist is presently financing the campaign for chancellor of Austria of Peter Metzler.Allon soon learns that Vogel is actually Erich Radek, a Nazi war criminal responsible for numerous atrocities during Hitler's Final Solution. He surprisingly discovers that Radek, is part of the recollections of his mother Irene, also a mentally tortured Holocaust survivor. Allon has all the motivation he needs to bring Radek's involvement to the surface and sets out to accomplish exactly that. Along the way. unforeseen stumbling blocks impede his progress.Silva is his continuing passionate saga of Gabriel Allon using the Holocaust as a backdrop, again proves his undeniably superior writing talent. He again fashioned a piece that was impossible to put down."},{"Title":"The Best of Animals: Stories","review":"I'm not some kind of idiot who sits alone laughing to himself over a book, or disturbing others in the library by chortling at my reading. But Lauren Grodstein's stories are laugh-out-loud funny. Their biting and often cynical wit proved irresistible - I couldn't keep from provoking a few sidelong glances over lattes and, later, bitter 'shush's from the studious denizens of the 24-hour reading room. The story 'Gazelles', a case in point, is told from the perspective of a girl alienated by the cruelty of her athletic, attractive and hopelessly shallow high school peers. Grodstein brilliantly captures her heroine's deliciously edgy humor, her only defense in a world where, as she puts it, she falls prey to her tormenters as easily as the animals of the story's title fall to the lions of a nature video. This witty style keeps the tales moving and fresh, but what makes them memorable is their ability to touch an emotional chord. 'How the Stars Live' slowly and convincingly reveals a deep seriousness beneath its witty surface as it explores the emotions of its male protagonist and eventually removes the cool, 'tough-girl' mask of the woman with whom he has made his emotional mess. 'Family Vacation', another story narrated by an adolescent too smart for her environment, probes the interrelations of a family whose tensions and traumas approach their breaking point when they are trapped on a monorail at Disney World. rodstein's voice is as powerful as it is funny in this story that balances humor with a truly moving depiction of emotion.

She went after Steve Tyler with a vengence, knowing that he was a drug addict, a conceited maniac, knowing his past history with women (some not even old enough to truly qualify as \\"women\\" yet). And then she stayed with him even though he terrorized her? Doesn't make a lot of sense. She doesn't even mention her own drug addiction. She paints herself as an innocent who found herself helplessly victimized but she was too savvy, too experienced (she was of the Warhol crowd) going into the marriage to fit that role. Basically, I found myself thinking that this was a woman who wasted her time feeling sorry for herself instead of learning how to do something that would get her a job. Ok, being married to Steve Tyler couldn't have provided her with the safe haven she was looking for but a little more insight into herself, a little more honesty would have made this book a whole lot more credible."},{"Title":"Dream on: Livin' on the Edge With Steven Tyler and Aerosmith","review":"For those of you that are &quot;Aerosmith&quot; fans, just go ahead and buy this book. I could not put it down until I completely finished reading it---fun, bold and exciting. You will love it. Whether it is completely true or not, we don't know.

I recommend this book to any Aerosmith fan."},{"Title":"Dream on: Livin' on the Edge With Steven Tyler and Aerosmith","review":"As a seeker of all that is Aerosmith, I have a certain thirst for knowledge of Steven Tyler. Cyrinda Foxe-Tyler's book refreshed my thirst and brought up some new areas for deliberation. Foxe-Tyler fills in some blanks left by WALK THIS WAY. At times she sounds bitter and although she makes some unbelievable claims, many are consistent with Steven Tyler's accounts. She confirms some of our suspicions, breaks our hearts with others, and lets of those intimate tidbits flow that all of us Steven Tyler fans have been dying to know.This book is about Steven Tyler, Cyrinda's life gives us insight as to the type of person Steven Tyler is, by his choices made in women, wine (or Tuinals) &amp; song. Whether the book is a cock-and bull story or exactitude, it doesn't change the most important thing-the music. If you are a female fan of Steven Tyler's, buy this book, if nothing else, for the prologue.My rating for Foxe-Tyler's book is - 7 !!! (But JFP gets a larger number.)"},{"Title":"Dream on: Livin' on the Edge With Steven Tyler and Aerosmith","review":"It's said that one should not speak ill of the dead. But \\"Dream On: Livin' On the Edge With Steven Tyler and Aerosmith\\" might leave you wanting to do just that for Cyrinda Foxe-Tyler, the late ex-wife of Steven Tyler and (by her own admission) a huge pain in the backside. Foxe-Tyler's autobiography is a slow embittered grind that seems less like a recounting of her own life than an endless stream of seedy recountings about just what a jerk her ex is.Born to a moody abusive mother with a penchant for marrying various moody abusive men, Cyrinda (then Kathleen Victoria Hetzekian -- although she refuses to reveal the last, because \\"I want to leave my father out of this\\") was a miserable military brat lugged around the globe.Her refuges: rock'n'roll (Elvis, the Beatles, the Stones), light drug use, and sexual experimentation with the boys on base... and pretty soon, her life was all about those three things. Before long, she had left Oklahoma and Texas behind for the bright lights of the big city, namely New York -- courtesy of Lou Reed and a pair of Danish black boots. And despite being \\"the most naive, cotton-candy-headed being in the world,\\" Cyrinda quickly established herself in Max's Kansas City, NYC's gay underworld, and Andy Warhol.And then after a brief first marriage (her first husband is a faceless footnote), she met, got pregnant by and married Steven Tyler, the volatile and popular singer for the band Aerosmith. But of course passion doesn't last forever, and despite having a beautiful daughter between them, their acrimonious marriage was doomed from the start.There are two kinds of rock wives/paramours: the classy and genuinely intelligent ones like Marianne Faithfull and Bebe Buell, and then there are the Angela Bowie ones who want to shovel dirt on their exes. Cyrinda is solidly in the latter grouping -- \\"Dream On: Livin' On the Edge With Steven Tyler and Aerosmith\\" seems to exist solely to smack her ex-husband in the head as frequently as possible, and often as tastelessly as possible (the \\"dive for it\\" anecdote is revolting).When she isn't heaping dirt on Tyler's head, Cyrinda devotes most of the book to ranting randomly about various topics -- she raves about gays, her hatred of religion, her aversion to getting a job (to the point of sleeping with people for room and board) and how she is cooler and more in tune with young people and sex than her contemporaries. She also seems a bit fixated on her own sexual exploits, ranging from unofficial prostitution to a threesome with David and Angela Bowie to voyeuristic peeking at others having sex.And her embitterment spreads to everything in this book, including other members of Steven Tyler's family --she gets in some digs at his ex-lover Buell and daughter Liv, barely acknowledges his second wife Teresa, and utterly ignores his third and fourth kids.And it's undeniable that Tyler was a drug-addled mess for countless years... and that's just what his friends say. But despite her seedy anecdotes about Tyler, the person who is most degraded in \\"Dream On\\" is Cyrinda herself -- she comes across as lazy (how dare her ex not hire a full-time nanny for someone who refuses to get a job!), hypocritical (she demonizes Tyler for abuse, while proudly talking about the gouges she left in his face -- by her own admission not the only ones) and generally deluded about how others see her (\\"You're too intellectual!\\"). Not to mention deluded about her own place in life (seeing herself as an \\"aristocrat\\" compared to Aerosmith).\\"Dream On: Livin' On the Edge With Steven Tyler and Aerosmith\\" is a sad memoir of a sad woman, whose bitterness wasn't exorcised until the very end of her life. And that bitterness coats every page of her autobiography, leaving you feeling vaguely unclean."},{"Title":"Dream on: Livin' on the Edge With Steven Tyler and Aerosmith","review":"I loved it.

I felt Cyn was telling us a tale of time when she fell apart and couldn't help the man she loved. The guilt of not being there for him when he needed her. The guilt of someone else taking her place.

This book is full of ridiculous exaggerations and fabrications. It's not even entertaining, but it does manage to be both whiny and a great instant headache.Poor Ms. Foxe, who only receives some $300 weekly in alimony never stops complaining.

Cyrinda Foxe emerged from a very trendy and creative Warhol crowd and with true intentions of deep love and happines, plunged into a marriage of HELL. Being from Europe, her explanation of the daily life of rock and roll was fascintating for me. I know that people would like to think that stars are perfect but we are all mortal and full of aberations. The most fascinating and touching point was how Cyrinda was able with out any help to extract herself and her daughter Mia from that living inferno.

Sorry for my English but I am not from your country."},{"Title":"Dream on: Livin' on the Edge With Steven Tyler and Aerosmith","review":"Honestly I could not put this book down. It was short and very easy to read. I felt Cyrinda loved her life in the spotlight prior to her marriage to Steven. I think her marriage was a huge disappointment which turned her into a very bitter woman. I think she blamed Steven for her unhappiness. She seemed to live for her \\"starlet days\\" and could not accept the fact they were over and basically blamed Steven. Cyrinda was very mean and arrogant throughout the whole book.

Each contains plot, five-star movie ratings, cast, credits and ratings for sexuality. Also there are multiple indexes and a hard-to-find video locator. Many of our finest actors got their start in coming-of-age films. Tom Cruise, James Dean, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Dillon, Edward Furlong, Ethan Hawke, Chris O'Donnell, River Phoenix, Jason Priestly, Keanu Reeves, Brad Renfro, Mark Wahlberg, Scott Wolf and Elijah Wood are just a few. What is a coming-of-age film? In simplest terms, a coming-of-age story is one in which a child or a teenager reaches a critical turning point or event that results in a loss of childhood innocence. Not surprisingly, most often this turning point revolves around adolescent sexuality. Recommended!"},{"Title":"Coming of Age: Movie & Video Guide","review":"My compliments to this book. It's better organized than most dictionaries and encyclopedias. It's full of copious and well-chosen pictures (which admittedly display the author's nudist sensibilities!) It embraces a large number of films from silly comedies to angst-filled dramas. What they all have in common is that they deal with young people confronting sexual awakening (For a Lost Soldier) or awareness of mortality (A Separate Peace), in short, some catalytic, transformative event of their adolescence.Everything you could want to know about these movies is in this book somewhere. Everyone involved in their making is mentioned, as are any awards the film earned and a clear synopsis of its plot. Lort's gay nudist perspective insures that nothing is censored, and pictures containing rape, cross-dressing, prostitution, and intergenerational eroticism are dealt with openly.When Lort gives 5-star reviews to some of my favorite coming-of-age films, like \\"Stand by Me,\\" \\"Second Best,\\" or \\"Rebel Without a Cause,\\" I really enjoy the read. I hope and pray that Lort updates this valuable book (written in 1997) since some important pictures have come along since then like \\"L.I.E.,\\" \\"Y Tu Mama Tambien,\\" and \\"Hearts in Atlantis.\\""},{"Title":"Lost and Found (Madison Finn #6)","review":"The sixth book in the series, Lost and Found, was one of my two favorite books out of the first six.

After having sifted all the fundementals and vital information that made up this fascinating field, I found that what I intially thought to be simple was, indeed, the result of meticulas and crucial technical planning. Rocketry is fun, however the complexity and engineering of a rocket lies hidden. This book enveils that complexity and helps the reader comprehend it in a relatively easy manner. This is an extremely good aspect of the book because it spares the reader of the frequent hair-pulling frustration due to confusion.The preliminary chapters allow the reader to become more deaply familiar to the general aspects of the hobby. Things like basic model rocket components and construction as well as how to get started in order to eventually become deaply involved in the hobby are covered in these sections. You'll find that much of the information in this section is, most likely, stuff you may already be familiar with if you're a more experienced novice.The book then procedes to more detailed and more technical aspects of rocketry. From chapters 5 and on, more technical information is presented, however, in a format that makes understanding easy. Rocket motors, ingnition systems, stabilty, rocket aerodynamics and altitude determination are some of the many aspects covered.Another great feature of this book is that BASIC type computer programs that simulate and caculate crucial values and overall rocket performance can be found in the books's appendix already written. All you have to do is re-write the code in a BASIC computer program compiler and you're ready to make complex mathematical calculations for your rocket design in a matter of seconds.All in all, a great reference that any model rocket enthusiast will want to cherish forever. I also find that this book is great in terms of further inspiring young rocketeers, like myself, to persue a career in the field of rocketry and aerospace. It sure has for me!Thankyou Mr. Stine!"},{"Title":"The handbook of model rocketry","review":"The late Harry Stine is owed by all of us model rocket enthusiasts, active and (like myself) inactive, a debt of gratitude for the work he did to make model rocketry safe, and, more importantly, legal.While in the end Mr. Stine was not in synch with the average model rocket enthusiast (which were going into high powered rocketry) he was still admired by all for his contributions.If you want to find out the basics of model rocketry, up to a discussion of the then emerging (big time) high powered rocketry, this book is your bible. Carry it with you if you want to know about engine sizes, stability, recovery devices, everything you need to know to shoot your rocket into the sky and bring it back in one piece (I should add as a side note that rockets that go bad are kind of fun to watch, but really hard on the makers nerves)."},{"Title":"The handbook of model rocketry","review":"The late G.

Harry Stine's handbook is the first book that any novice wishing to learn the fundamentals should pick up. Stine's magical ability to explain difficult ideas clearly and thoroughly is one of the things I loved about the book. The other reason, in my opinion why this book was so good is because it covers both breadth and depth about the sport of model rocketry. It did not just explain the basics and stop right there. Stine took it further by talking about the aerodynamics of rocketry, how to build large models, boost gliders, how to form clubs and oversee ranges, scale modeling.. and on and on...In fact, there are many tables in the book that even a veteran rocketeer would have to refer to almost daily to retrieve important information.

A must have for all model rocket enthusists."},{"Title":"The handbook of model rocketry","review":"This book is probably the definitive work covering the \\"model rocket\\" hobby and the industry that surrounds it. The book will tell you everything you need to know to design, build, and fly \\"model\\" rockets. It will also tell you very specifically what model rocketry is and isn't. Very recommended.However, the book didn't quite meet my expectations--I do have a complaint:First, an explanation is in order. In hobby rocketry, there are two very different concepts: \\"Model\\" rocketry and \\"Amateur\\" rocketry. Now, I'm going to over-simplify: In Model rocketry, hobbyists use commercially-manufactured rocket motors (they don't build their own) and build flying models; while in Amateur rocketry, the rocketeers often build their own motors (and often much larger rockets that wouldn't be considered \\"models\\").OK, so what? The author(s) completely, and without exception, condemns home-built rocket motors (and by extension Amateur rocketry), saying there is no such thing as a safely constructed and flown home-built motor--and one way or another, this point is emphasized many times over. In my opinion as an engineer, this is somewhat ridiculous, but the author is entitled to his own opinion too (and at least one of the authors is (was) a bona fide rocket scientist). Home-built motors may not be for the grade-schooler, but neither is auto racing.If you're interested in propellants, burn rates, nozzle geometry, and saving a lot of money on rocket motors (especially meaningful if you're building larger rockets) you won't find it here, nor will you find a sympathetic ear.Buy this book first. Then if you really want more, don't be dissuaded--try \\"How to Make Amateur Rockets\\" by John Wickman (he's a rocket scientist too), \\"Modern High Power Rocketry\\" by Mark Canepa, and \\"Amateur Rocket Motor Construction\\" by David Sleeter."},{"Title":"The handbook of model rocketry","review":"G.

They will learn about aero dynamics to boot. It's not a 'math' book, it's just that you have to learn a few formulas to be able to do the more entertaining projects. Harry does a great job of explaining the how's and why's of Rocket science in an entertaining way. He also throws a little history in there. This print is older but it hasn't changed much. If you find a cheap copy, snatch it up."},{"Title":"The handbook of model rocketry","review":"It goes into so much detail from glues to auerodynamics to calculations of height and stability. I would reccomend it to a beginner and an experienced model rocketeer."},{"Title":"The handbook of model rocketry","review":"As an adult Model Rocketeer for the past 16 years, I can say that every Rocketeer should have this in their library. It is indeed \\"the Bible\\" of Model Rocketry. It is a goldmine of information and technical know-how, and will lead a beginning Rocketeer on the right path. Even someone who's just curious about Model Rocketry will learn a lot from it."},{"Title":"The handbook of model rocketry","review":"This is without a doubt the best book on model rocketry I've ever seen, and I read it from cover to cover. It deals with every aspect of rocketry in a very accessible manner (for example, presenting formulas for various calculations, but not requiring their use). It is organized so that the reader can focus on single aspects of a rocketry program (for example, separate chapters on aerodynamics, rocket propulsion, recovery systems, altitude measurement). I am a science teacher and coach to two Team America Rocketry Challenge teams, and I keep copies of this book available for my teams as reference. I wish it had more information on electronic payloads, but that is a more advanced topic, so it is very forgivable. If you own only one book on rocketry, this is the one to buy."},{"Title":"The handbook of model rocketry","review":"Very detailed, easy to understand, its rocketry 101 and much more."},{"Title":"The handbook of model rocketry","review":"This book has a lot of background information, but doesn't tell you how to build a rocket. Scratch building is deprecated. Turns out the author owns a rocket model kit company. My teenage son was very disappointed."},{"Title":"The handbook of model rocketry","review":"The late G. Harry Stine's 6th edition of his &quot;handbook&quot;-1993 is a MUST read; includes how to get started in model rocketry, safety, construction, flight, recovery &amp; special projects from the man who paved the way for all model rocketeers. Young &amp; old alike will enjoy this book loaded with awesome photos, drawings and illustrations!"},{"Title":"The handbook of model rocketry","review":"This book was very interesting, It is very helpful for anyone who wants to learn about modelrocketry. It talks about everything related to model rocketry. If you need to know anything about model rocketry you should buy this book."},{"Title":"The handbook of model rocketry","review":"I'm interested in a lot of different things, and good books is a way to educate yourself on the basics of almost anything. I picked up this book to satisfy my curiousity on model rockets, and boy was it satisfied. This book covers the subject better than anything I have read on model rockets. If after reading and understanding this volume, you still have questions, you should probably not get involved in model rocketry. Highly recommended for beginners and experience rocketeers alike."},{"Title":"The handbook of model rocketry","review":"The 7th edition of this great handbook is getting a little \\"long in the tooth\\" now, but it is still essential reading for anyone who wants to get into model rocketry, regardless of whether you're main interest is low, mid or high power rockets. Of all the books about model rocketry that I own, G. Harry Stine's handbook is the best value for money."},{"Title":"The handbook of model rocketry","review":"Model rocketry has come a long way since this book's first edition was published and the book does a great job of covering the basics of \\"How to get started\\" while addressing the ever expanding set of topics being introduced 40+ years later. The book provides some of the hobby's history and the 'hows and whys' of model rocketry. The book balances detail such as mathematics to compute aeronautical computations with rules of thumb one can use if science and math are not as interesting as building and safely launching a cool model rocket. While the book does not comprehensively cover mid and high power model rocketry topics, it does address some of the basics for those 'moving up'. Photos and illustrations are great."},{"Title":"The handbook of model rocketry","review":"The Handbook provides you with just about everything you would need or want to know about building and flying model rockets. It covers from how to prepare a motor for flight and how to attach fins, to more complicated things such as boost gliders and clusters. Through the whole thing, descriptions are detailed. Mr. Stine's humour keeps what could be some boring but important items fun, guiding you from your first rocket to scale masterpieces. Join the fun!"},{"Title":"The handbook of model rocketry","review":"I've been reading this book since I was a kid. An absolute great introduction to model rocketry. So instead of restating/echoing what others have said, I'll just go to my minor complaint.The picture quality is pretty bad. I do desktop publishing for a living so I sort of look for these things out of habit more than most. Every picture is low resolution and has WAY too much compression applied (low-quality setting). This is very easily seen by tapping to magnify any picture. You'll see a lot of \\"crunchiness\\" and compression artifacts. For example, the basic rocket flight illustration graphic early in the book. All the lines and words have light gray dots all around them - these are from too much compression. There's really no reason they should be there. The pictures could and should be nice and sharp - and you should able to magnify/zoom a reasonable amount (at least _some_) and still have the picture be sharp.Again, i consider this is a minor annoyance as the pictures are there and you can see what they are. They should just be a bit better.This is an excellent book and worth getting for a lot of great, rounded info on the hobby."},{"Title":"The handbook of model rocketry","review":"This is a very good introductory text for someone not familiar with the world of model recketry, and gives a thorough overview of the hobby. It is a bit too simplified for readers experienced in the applied sciences, and is focused more on your typical high school reader. Also the use of the American pound and inches system is a bit of a nuisance to readers familiar with the International metric system.Still it is a very good product and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The handbook of model rocketry","review":"As a boy, I checked this book out of the library so often, that when I turned 12 my parents bought me my own, brand new forth edition, hardbound copy. Over the years I have read it cover to cover too often to count.The section on aerodynamics and drag was especially engrossing to me. By the time I was fifteen, I hit a stumbling block in my understanding. I couldn't figure out how to determine the coefficient of drag. Many years later as an undergrad engineering student, I finally realized that the coefficient of drag can only be determined experimentally (Unless you're an aeronautical engineer trained in using some very sophisticated fluid dynamic modeling software).I probably only flew my rockets once or twice a summer. But I dreamed about them all year long. The Handbook continued to captivate and inform me from the time I was a boy, until I was educated as an engineer. Moreover, it introduced and prepared me for many subjects. From physics to materials, to construction, to history, and much more.If you know a boy or girl (young in age or young at heart) interested in model rockets, I highly recommend this book. It will be valuable from the first day, and for the days that turn into months and years after that."},{"Title":"The handbook of model rocketry","review":"Great reference for all levels. Perfect for schools or curriculums that have a model rocketry club."},{"Title":"The handbook of model rocketry","review":"The book covers the basics of the model rocket hobby. There is emphasis on the safety aspect of model rocketry. It covers basic operation, construction, contests,and different types of models."},{"Title":"The handbook of model rocketry","review":"The late Harry Stine is owed by all of us model rocket enthusiasts, active and (like myself) inactive, a debt of gratitude for the work he did to make model rocketry safe, and, more importantly, legal.While in the end Mr. Stine was not in synch with the average model rocket enthusiast (which were going into high powered rocketry) he was still admired by all for his contributions.If you want to find out the basics of model rocketry, up to a discussion of the then emerging (big time) high powered rocketry, this book is your bible. Carry it with you if you want to know about engine sizes, stability, recovery devices, everything you need to know to shoot your rocket into the sky and bring it back in one piece (I should add as a side note that rockets that go bad are kind of fun to watch, but really hard on the makers nerves)."},{"Title":"The handbook of model rocketry","review":"This book has some good things to know in it and it is more about the sport of model rocketry than anything else. Note of caution, there is very little in this book on designing model rockets from scratch beyond the basics. I was designing a rather advanced rocket and this book didn't help me very much.But when taken for what it's intended for it's a rather good book. It gives a lot of advice that you might not have come up with on your own and in fact is a pretty good guide for anyone who is a light hobbyist model rocketeer and is looking at getting into clubs and more frequent and serious model rocketry. He keeps the book interesting and amusing with some comments that I found absolutely hilarious. For example he always refers to trees as &quot;Rocket Eating Trees&quot; and in one illustration he has a rocket saying &quot;Bye Bye&quot; as it is carried off with the breeze. I found those kept the book readable. While I liked the anecdotes to his own rocketry experience and found them enlightening those after pure facts may find them excessive."},{"Title":"The handbook of model rocketry","review":"This is probably the only handbook I've ever read cover to cover and enjoyed every page. The book takes you through some of the history of model rocketry as well as provides a LOT of design advice for people who are interested in building their own rockets from scratch. It covers a wide breadth of topics and has enough information to pique your interest in trying new things with rocketry. The best part of the book is the common sense approach to safety and doing something that is dangerous but a lot of fun. If you have any interest in model rocketry at all, this book can help you get started and is a great resource for anyone who is interested in rocketry from young children to adults who are looking to beat their co-workers at a rocket competition sponsored by work (especially if you can beat the actual rocket scientists!). The handbook is constantly encouraging the reader to try things out, to not be afraid to go out of their comfort zone, but at the same time provides practical experience based tips to keep you from doing something that might be classified as blatant stupidity."},{"Title":"The handbook of model rocketry","review":"Since me and my grandson are getting into rocketry (me getting back into) I wanted to brush up on the basics. This book gave everything I needed and more. I have gone back and reread several chapters and continue to use it for reference.

This book is great for bloodthirsty wanna-be's and other miscreants. It is valuable only as an example of what ninja arts are not. From a martial art perspective, it contains no orginal material. Some people might like it. I think Ashida (funny name for a white guy) is a fraudulent sham."},{"Title":"Forbidden Fighting Techniques of the Ninja","review":"Just Kidding! This book discusses the FORBIDDEN FIGHTING TECHNIQUES of the NINJA. And when you see these models performing their...techniques on paper, you too will be ~privileged~ to know why certain fighting techniques have been relegated to the realm of the FORBIDDEN. Namely in this case, because the techniques simply cannot work and will either cause you to injure yourself, or some hapless bystander.One would be better advised to don cardboard armor and Nerf(TM) weapons than to heed the sallow call of this slender volume. Yes, I know playing ninja Ashida Kim style can be fun. You get to dress up in a black karate outfit and put on a black knit ski-mask and go traipsing about in broad daylight being...inconspicuous and all. Gets a wee bit hot in the summer though under all of that heat-absorbing black polyester fabric and the wool ski mask and such...however let me assure you that it's all fun and games until you waltz into the local 7-Eleven or Kwikee-Mart thinking \\"Gatorade\\", and the cashier takes one look at you in all your ninja stealth-finery and thinks \\"robbery\\" and pulls out ol' bessie. Not even the great Sho Kosugi has the ninja prowess to fend off the Ancient Powers of the Mystical shotgun.That aside, Ashida Kim books are great gag gifts for real martial artists! :)"},{"Title":"Forbidden Fighting Techniques of the Ninja","review":"First off this is a terrible book if you want to learn real ninjutsu. I personally own this book and a few other titles by Ashida Kim aka Radford W. Davis. I exchanged personal emails with Mr. Davis and he hates amazon. He also claims to be trained in the Koga ninja arts, which died out. If you don't believe me check out wikipedia and type in \\"Ashida Kim\\" or \\"Koga ninja\\" That being said, the fighting in this book demonstrate: Karate/Kung Fu/Gung Fu techniques not authentic ninjutsu. The weapons skills are basic and anyone wiht that kind of weapon in their hand could probably figure out.You want to possess real ninja fighting skills join the Bujinkan or the Genbukan. Picking up a book with not endow you with the awesome fighting ability. Enroll in at a dojo, practice, get instruction a real Sensei, and train. Please don't waste you money."},{"Title":"Forbidden Fighting Techniques of the Ninja","review":"Well, first off, Ashida Kim is a fake, for those who didn't know. It's not that he's unknowledgible, but he really capitalized on the \\"Ninja\\" craze of the 80's, and I think he ended up drinking some of his own kool-aid, ya know? That said, this book is not without merit. While everything concerning ninja history, culture & rituals is quite suspect (I honestly don't believe any of it that hasn't been verified by another, independent source), his basic conditioning excercises, stances, and hidden applications of basic \\"blocks\\" seems right on. He seems to draw from many different sources (Oriental & Occidental) in order to write his book, which by itself isn't so bad (actually pretty good); that he gives none of them credit, ain't so good. Most of the physical stuff is OK, at least no worse than the karate books at the time, but the super-secret, ultra-mystical \\"we are the dark warriors\\" garbage he spews in the first and last sections of the book is laughable. On the plus side, he demonstrates the use of the shoge (dagger & ring attatched by a length of cord), as well as some sword quick-draw movements; on the down side, if the Shoge wasn't exotic enough, he's got a \\"ninja walking stick\\" with a weighted chain inside and rubber stoppers on either end that looks like it comes from a bad Hong Kong flick.Would I recomend this book to anyone? Probably not. It seems for every good, insightful bit he has, it's counterballanced by information that's dubious at best. If you own it already, there's no need to be ashamed, but trying to separate useful info from make-believe is quite a headache. Anyone interested in ninja history and culture could do better."},{"Title":"Forbidden Fighting Techniques of the Ninja","review":"Ok, I will get straight to the point and say that you should NOT buy this book. Ashida Kim is not Asian, and his name comes from 2 different countires (Ashida=Japan, Kim=Korea). Now, Stephan Hayes is also not Asian, but has practiced NinjUtsu. Ashida Kim does not even say in his books how he got to be a ninja. He writes this farfetched stories that couldn't even get published in a fictional book.Save your money. You want NinjUtsu, not NinjItsu, go to Hatsumi or Hayes. Not Kim."},{"Title":"Forbidden Fighting Techniques of the Ninja","review":"In my view if someone has something to teach then let them go ahead and teach, Ashida Kims techniques that are taught in his books do work if enough time and effort are made into practising them. Those who cant offer constructive critisims are only jealous at what skills he has and what they dont have..."},{"Title":"Forbidden Fighting Techniques of the Ninja","review":"Ashida Kim has done it yet again. This is a very interesting book covering various aspects of Ninjutsu. Shown are some interesting offensive and defensive striking techniques. Also a large range of weaponry skills are covered including the walking staff. I recommend this book to any Ashida Kim fan and Ninja enthusiast alike."},{"Title":"Forbidden Fighting Techniques of the Ninja","review":"For those willing to test themselves to their limit, just try any of these techniques. They are challenging and once you learn them, you and your opponent will realize what a TRUE Ninja can do. Ashida Kim, Thank You!

This is a work that grows increasingly powerful and beautiful, especially in its final section and concluding three calls to prayer. The author transported me to Niger and enlarged my understanding of what is is to be a global citizen, a parent (and daughter), a mother, a woman, and (so searchingly) a person. I intend to survey recent issues of the Hudson and Yale Reviews where, according to the jacket, there are other works by Kathleen Hill. May she give us more writing and, soon, another book as fine as this!"},{"Title":"Still Waters in Niger","review":"I have been in Zinder for three years and in Niger for 12 years. In &quot;Still Waters in Niger&quot; the author Kathleen Hill puts me back there as it was, as it is, as it will be when I will go back there. Quite a writer... everything is so true in that &quot;novel&quot;. Zinder is more real than life. And fiction brings you to reality.It is a documentary through poetry. This is due to the great talent of the author and also to her keen sense of observation. An gode maki. Barka da aiki!"},{"Title":"Still Waters in Niger","review":"It was quite sometime ago that I read this book for our book group. We were fortunate to have the author discuss her book with us. One of our members had a very special surprise for the author that made this book group discussion absolutely magical. More about the surprise later...This is a story about a woman (a mother with children) who accompanies her husband to a small village in Africa. It's about her experiences with the people in the village. Years later, she returns to the same village because her daughter is doing humanitarian work there. A few of the local woman, who she met on her first visit, have survived as well and she reconnects with them. The book is very descriptive. It transports the reader to Niger. It has a strong sense of place which is important in a village where people's destinies are tied to the land they live on. Niger is one of the poorest places in the world. It describes the characters with dignity despite their impoverished circumstances. It's a book about mothers caring for their families and communities and the strong bond they share with other mothers even though they are from other cultures.About that surprise, one member of our book group brought along her teaching assistant who had just returned from the same village in Niger while in the Peace Corps.\\"Still Waters in Niger\\" is beautifully written and a very worthwhile read. It is also a worthwhile choice for bookgroups because it will inspire a lot of discussion."},{"Title":"Still Waters in Niger","review":"Make no mistake about it: this book has beautifully lyrical prose. The writing is quite enchanting. But simply put, there is no plot. Nothing happens. The book's foundation is essentially on the relationship between a mother and her daughter. The daughter is a health worker living in Niger, West Africa, where she'd spent some of her childhood. The narrative alternates between the present and the mother's reminiscence of her daughter's and husband's years in Niger and Nigeria. Despite the heavy interior monologue, I never felt I had much insight into any of the character's psyches. I like character driven novels, but I didn't feel Ms. Hill's characterization was particular strong. Having lived in West Africa, I did appreciate some of the description; it was very heavily sensory, but you can't make a whole novel out of that. All in all, I was impressed by the prose, but the story was not very compelling. It was a struggle to finish."},{"Title":"White House Horrors","review":"When I first saw this book I was amused, but doubted that I would find any really good horror inside. The first two stories were pretty dreadful, and not in a good way. But once I start a book, I can't put it down so I kept reading. I'm glad that I did.Once you get past the first few stories, this book is full of some very good horror stories that just happen to involve the White House or the office of President. But the stories themselves are well crafted and terrifying. Some of the best are:Night of the Vegetables by Edward Lee- this story was so funny that I was laughing out loud. Not a very scary story, but great, nonetheless.Creature Congress by Terry Beatty and Wendi Lee- Do not pass up this story! It has some great dialog and is good horrific fun.Jack Be Quick by Graham Masterson is go good and spooky that it is now one of my favorite horror stories of all time. One of the best and most original takes on the JFK assassination that I have ever read.This anthology contains 16 short stories by a wide range of authors. So if you're looking for a smart, fun horror anthology, give White House Horrors a try. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"White House Horrors","review":"This is an irresistable title that made me snap this book up at the recent Haunted America Conference in Decatur (IL). Prolific editor Martin H. Greenberg has produced 16 tales of horror that use the American Presidency as a setting. A can't miss theme and this book delivers.Not every story is a gem, but that's okay. No collection is perfect, not every story appeals to everyone, and many of the stories are outstanding. Sturgeon's Law: 90% of everything is crap, and the batting average here is considerably better than that.The authors include Graham Masterton, Brian Hodge, Max Allan Collins and Barbara Collins, Bill Crider, Robert J. Randisi, and others.The stories include real presidents like Harry Truman and the White House ghost (one specific ghost; actually, the White House reportedly has 16 different hauntings), Abraham Lincoln who becomes the target of a voodoo houngan in one tale and of a cloning experiment in another, an alternate theory on the John F. Kennedy assassination which is more sensible than some that are out there, William McKinley, Warren G. Harding, William Henry Harrison, and even Thomas Jefferson.There are plenty of fictional presidents in the other stories with plot elements that rely on Faustian deals, tragic obligations, murder, and more. Throw in a few for laughs involving offended monsters in one case and vegetable contamination in another.Definitely worth reading if you come across it. The out-of-print book is also available at Half.com and Amazon, new or used."},{"Title":"White House Horrors","review":"More historical than anything. One problem is that majority of these stories have been re-hashed in many other books, and many accounts just ramble on and on and are boring and not interesting. Author does NOT know how to grab your attention! Not worth over $1."},{"Title":"Agapanthus Tango","review":"This book is an excellent first novel by a writer who we hope writes more. Tautly written, this story is artfully told with deft flourishes of poetic prose about the otherwise unglamorous and dry Australian Outback.The story moves at a good pace, and the characters are memorable in that they are unlike any other that I have read. David Francis manages to tell a compelling love story without devolving into sachharine moments, wistful \\"I wishes\\" and sentimentality. A serious pleaser for both men, and women, I'd put this high on the list for anyone who wants to read what level a modern love story that doesn't devolve into narcissistic whines about not having a \\"shag and a pair of shoes\\" that plagues popular literature today."},{"Title":"American Inventions: A History of Curious, Extraordinary,and Just Plain Useful Patents","review":"The system of patents is so important to our nation that it is part of the Constitution, Article 1, stating, &quot;To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.&quot; Patents started being numbered in 1836, and by 1911 there were a million of them; by 1999, six million. Some have changed the world, and some have never left the drawing board, and some are downright goofy (but innovative). In a surprisingly captivating work, _American Inventions: A History of Curious, Extraordinary, and Just Plain Useful Patents_ (New York University Press), Stephen van Dulken, who works with patents at the British Library, shows some oddities and marvels that he has sifted from those millions of bright ideas. There are plenty of good and not-so-good inventions here, but every page has good stories.Like the Frisbee. Yale students could recall that in the 1920s they threw pie tins from the Frisbie Baking Company (there is one in the Smithsonian). In 1948, inventors, inspired by the nation's interest in flying saucers, made the first plastic flying disc, better than metal, but it was brittle and snapped. In 1951 Walter Morrison redesigned it with the aerodynamic rim known as the &quot;Morrison slope&quot; and called it the Pluto Platter. It was patented as a &quot;flying toy&quot; in 1957, the year Wham-o brought it out, and it had little portholes from which imaginary aliens might enjoy a rapidly spinning world going by. Wham-o was distracted by the hula hoop madness, and eventually relaunched the disc as Frisbee in 1958. It has, of course, long outlasted hula hoops, and will never go out of date. Someone invented the drive-in theater; Richard Hollingshead's mother complained that movie seats were too narrow, and he wondered if sitting in a car would be more comfortable. Remotes for televisions were originally on a wire, then via photocells, and ultrasound, before they became electronic. Joyce Hall of Hallmark Cards invented the card display rack; before that, greeting cards were kept in drawers. Recipes can be patented; KFC has a patent on its chicken recipe, but Coke does not patent its syrup, preferring to keep the ingredients simply secret rather than eventually in the public domain.This is a wonderful miscellany of cleverness. The text has reproductions of the drawings from many of the patents mentioned: the original shopping cart, the Murphy bed, Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion House, the board for &quot;The Landlord's Game&quot; (a forerunner of Monopoly), the original Barbie and Raggedy Ann, the famous Coke bottle, and many more. In a dry, amused tone, van Dulken makes the book something more than just a description of one invention after another. He has displayed the admirable human trait of inventiveness and thereby shown a social history of technological progress."},{"Title":"American Inventions: A History of Curious, Extraordinary,and Just Plain Useful Patents","review":"The process of invention is little published, and this book by van Dulken is a very welcome publication. But patents includes all products made by Man, so he naturally restricts the scope of his book first, to US patents, and second, the subject matter is really restricted to mainly mechanical patents, and those with which the ordinary person can identify very easily. Thus the first chapter examines child products like the stroller (or baby buggy) and the disposable nappy, without which most mums would be helpless (unless she resorts to the recyclable cloth version). That leads nicely into toys and games, with such products as the familiar Frisbee and the famous game of Monopoly. But strangely, computer games are absent. Sports and entertainment follow, with a good look at the start of the cinema and Muybridge's amazing work on the problem of the galloping horse (did the feet always make contact with the ground?). It led to the first movie cameras, and Edison was there to exploit a brand new market, but, rather surprisingly, failed to patent his new machine adequately. The gap was filled by the French Lumiere Bros, who competed very successfully with Edison in the USA. TV comes next and the ubiquitous remote control followed by the electric guitar and MP3 players. To continue the domestic theme of the book, the next chapter examines patents in the home, with modular housing and the modular kitchen. And what else but all those gadgets used by housewives the world over: the food blender from 1938, and the electric iron from as early as 1882. Folding beds and reclining chairs come next as we move to the bedroom, with, right next door, the bathroom. Enter the electric razor and electric toothbrush. Not forgetting the garage for the car but also for DIY activities and the first power tools, especially the Black & Decker electric drill of 1917. Food cannot be ignored although whether chewing gum is a food at all is questionable, and it dates from 1867 or so. Another \\"innovation\\" comes with Coca-Cola (1893), and the customized restaurant, the diner of the 1920s. Beauty products and cars are the subjects of subsequent chapters. The book ends with the \\"paperless office\\", an oxymoron is ever there was one. From little machines like staplers, the author ends with all the computerised machines which are now indispensable, and have graduated from the office to the home. It is an intriguing book, and one wonders: wherever next?"},{"Title":"American Inventions: A History of Curious, Extraordinary,and Just Plain Useful Patents","review":"Written by an expert curator of the Patents Information Service of The British Library, American Inventions: A History Of Curious, Extraordinary, &amp; Just Plain Useful Patents is an amazing showcase featuring dozens of original patent drawings from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, revealing unique and unforgettable American inventions from the Frisbee to bobby pins and in-line skates. An extremely well-researched and fascinating tour of American thrift and ingenuity throughout the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Milwaukee (Isis)","review":"This is a well- constructed clearly written novel.The story of a young woman who was made pregnant against her will and who lives to see her own daughter also with a child from an unknown father - the story of her abandonment by her husband after many years of happy marriage- the life in the hospice itself - provides a certain degree of insight into human life and character."},{"Title":"Juno and the Paycock","review":"This is about a family - Boyle, Mrs. Boyle, son Johnny and daughter Mary. There are a few family friends Joxer Daly, Jerry Devine and then there's Mr. BenthemBoyle's a laybout who shirks work to drink and associate with Joxer. Johnny was in the Republican Army and got wounded costing him an arm and a hurt hip. Mrs. Boyle is sensible and tries to keep things together. She spends a fair amount of dialogue complaining about Boyle's slacker ways. Mary also seems sensible but romantically unlucky and a bit naive.Act I - Towards the end Mr. Benthem shows up and explains that a cousin of Boyle's has died.Act II - Boyle starts living as if he's already received the money, buying things on credit.[SPOILER ALERT]Act III - The will turns out to be confused. The money isn't just for Boyle but is to be split between all the cousins of the deceased. The family isn't going to see much, if anything. Mary gets pregnant by Mr. Bentham, who has left for England where he is no longer in touch. The Republican army kills Johnny. Mary and Mrs. Boyle leave Mr. Boyle broke and drunk and go to live with her sister, hoping to do their best to raise Mary's upcoming child.[/SPOILER ALERT]What I liked about this - the characters were well drawn, powerful. It was interesting to read about this time and place. It's a tragedy but it has a humorous side to it as well.On the downside the dialogue is in Irish working class vernacular from 1922 and I sometimes found it tough to follow what was going on. For example:Mrs. Boyle - \\"An Irelan's takin' a leaf out o' the world's buk; when we got the makin of our own laws, I thought we'd never stop to look behind us, but instead we never stopped to look before us! If the people ud folley up their religion betther there'd be a better chance for us - what do you think, Mr Bentham?\\""},{"Title":"Juno and the Paycock","review":"Mary Boyle is a young woman whose intellect is at odds with her life circumstances. Among the books she is reading are plays by Ibsen about oppressive family life (The Wild Duck). Her mother and father represent opposing sides in the conflict of the Irish Civil War. Captain Boyle rejects compromise and the Church and prefers not to work. Juno has to work to sustain the family, and she favours reliance on the Anglo-Irish treaty. Boyle is related with liberty and with the life of the imagination, but his laziness makes his stature diminish. He is selfish. Like a peacock, he has too big an idea... of himself, of Independence. He uses his relatives, friends and acquaintances according to the circumstances and to his own needs. As it becomes clear after they earn a legacy, the Boyles are plagued by cultural and spiritual poverty.With the money comes a change of circumstances, and of attitudes and opinions. The history of Ireland is reversed, becoming the \\"story\\" of Ireland, a fictionalized, romantic account. It seems to be the opinion of the author that the interests of the working class are not adequately met by the nationalist strife. The \\"heroic\\" deaths of the nation's youth only go to increase the poverty at home. This problem becomes particularly acute at time of civil war. But, now that he is rich, Boyle (the peacock) cares very little about the troubles of the revolution. He and his wife seem to have finally come to an agreement of insensibility. But their son has already been hit by the trauma of the violent exposition to Irish history.As if her family was not - literally and figuratively - dismembered enough, Mary loses contact with Bentham and adds to the family shame. The money has been lost. In the midst of this troubles Johnny tries to rise against his father. His final death brings into relief the family's former unsensitive reactino to the death of a young neighbour, a Republican diehard. The author advises a realistic repudiation of the myth of war, and of other myths: poetry, religion, love, even friendship. In the end only a mother's compassion prevails."},{"Title":"The bootleggers and their era","review":"This book is all right, but no more than that. As an outsider, Allsop fails to put the bootleg violence into any context, and he follows the line of previous books without questioning their purported information. So he has Capone beating the Cicero mayor without any corroboration other than it appeared somewhere else. The bibliography shows that Allsop's research is only skin deep."},{"Title":"The bootleggers and their era","review":"Originally published in 1961, this is a fine study of the so-called \\"beer wars\\" which ravaged the streets of Chicago during Prohibition. While in large part a biography of the \\"Big Fellow,\\" Al Capone, it also examines the lives of the other gang leaders who carved up the Windy City into various territorial boundaries designed to avoid conflict, with negative results. The author traveled from his native England to the U.S. to research material for this project, and what emerges is a vivid depiction of the gangland scene as it actually existed, with no sensational embellishment. Detailed portraits of the North Side gang, the Genna brothers, the O'Donnells, Frank McErlane, and many other notorious mob figures are provided. Unlike similar books written during this period, \\"The Bootleggers and Their Era\\" withstood the test of time and holds up well today."},{"Title":"The bootleggers and their era","review":"Allsop's \\"The Bootleggers and their Era\\" is packed with detail about Chicago gangs' endless murdering of each other, to the point where it becomes confusing and repetitive. Names and explanations are not always clear, and the book is speckled with frequent typos. Not much information is given about the daily lives and activities of the gangsters, or how the rackets grew so large, or how Prohibition began. Most of the book deals with the tit-for-tat killings that made Chicago notorious at the time. Allsop is given to posturing prose (a gang victim isn't \\"murdered\\"; instead, the gangsters' five guns \\"ruin his suit\\") and apparently never heard of a footnote, so it's hard to tell how reliable his stories are. The one thing that really stood out to me in this book was Allsop's still-shocking picture of a big city completely given over to crime. According to Allsop, the Chicago gangs had the government, police, and courts in their pockets, and nothing could stop them taking whatever goods and lives they wanted. Whether this is accurate is hard to say (given that lack of footnotes), but the description is chilling.Also included is Allsop's mini-history of jazz, which also struck me as unreliable. But that section of the book is filled with some of the darkest and most riveting stories of the gangsters, told from the musicians' point of view.This book will give you one history of the Prohibition era, but I wouldn't take it as a primary source."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens Complete Guide to Flower Gardening","review":"I'm happy with this book and glad I bought it, despite its age (1995). Best features are the colorful photos, layout, and 395 useful pages. First half consists of different gardens, e.g., cottage-look, formal English gardens, herbs, hummingbird gardens, rock gardens, etc. Back half is separate sections listing perennials, annuals, bulbs, roses, ferns, etc., and this layout is easy to locate and read about individual species. Another positive are the many listings throughout the book, e.g., butterfly attracting flowers, blue-purple hued flowers, fragrant flowers, etc. Each of these lists segments down into perennials, annuals, bulbs, and bloom season.

There's nothing scary about this book, despite what some uptight, over protective, adults might think."},{"Title":"Andrew's Loose Tooth","review":"Robert Munsch's amusing look at a boy's trouble with a loose tooth is a big favorite at our house. While it begins with a real situation any child with a loose tooth can understand (I can't eat my apple!), the story gets more and more ridiculous. Most kids know that while a trip to the dentist might be scary, no dentist is going to tie his tooth to a car and drive away. (And even if one did, the results are just hysterical.)My kids also love Michael Martchenko's detailed and funny illustrations, from the little sister on the toy telephone calling the dentist (while both parents do so on two different phones), to the tooth fairy on the heavily chromed motorcycle.Kids enjoy funny stories, especially about growing-up issues like losing a tooth. I haven't met a kid yet who didn't enjoy this one."},{"Title":"Andrew's Loose Tooth","review":"I have not read this book to or with a child yet who did not love it.

I read \\"Love You Forever\\" by this author, and so I thought this would be a gentle, sensitive tale of teeth coming out - UGH!

At first, they were apprehensive but once I explained the humor of the story, they thought it was funny. And it is funny. It is a wild crazy sense of humor book on losing your tooth. Andrew's mom and dad just couldn't get the loose tooth out so Andrew could eat his apple. The dentist couldn't do it. The Tooth Fairy couldn't do it. But Andrew's best friend could.One of my twins is experiencing a loose tooth at the moment and he was a bit nervous and asked me if we were going to tie his loose tooth to the car and I exclaimed in mock horror, \\"Oh no! The car will fall apart.\\" He remembered the book and started giggling. He still has the loose tooth but this book helps allay his fear of what to expect, though he misses not eating an apple, just like Andrew.This book is also wonderful for budding readers as well. It is humorous and the illustrations are wonderful. This book is one that kids can relate to and it appeals to their exaggerated sense of humor that they have now.

And all the grown-ups try absurdly improbable things to get the tooth out - pliers, pulling using his nose as leverage, tying the tooth to the car and driving away... I'll stop for a second and say I don't see how any child could be scared of that scene. The car FALLS APART instead of the tooth coming out! It's clearly not intended to be a realistic scenario.Eventually, Andrew's friend calls in the tooth fairy. This is no pampered twinkletoes in a frilly dress. No, this is a fully-grown rocking biker chick with a leather jacket. Dude. How awesome is that??? But even with HER tools she can't get that tooth out. Luckily, Andrew's friend saves the day again - with pepper! Andrew sneezes that tooth all the way across town, giving us a great view of the tooth fairy catching it in a net at high speed.I adore this book. I especially like the diversity of the cast - Andrew has an interracial family, and the people in the background when the tooth fairy catches the tooth come from a variety of ethnic groups.

This book uncovers the fundamental issue of the nature ofpolitics and business.

So it's not likely to last long in the classroom.We'll see though...."},{"Title":"Sophie and Lou (Reading Rainbow)","review":"Sophie and Lou is a perfect book for any child, but especially perfect for a shy child or a child who has difficulty joining activities or trying something new.The book starts out with Sophie being swallowed up by her shyness and reluctance to try new things or speak to people that are new or different. \\"Sophie was shy- so shy she did her shopping during the lull hours, so she wouldn't have to talk to anyone.\\" This is followed by a sentence describing her reluctance to go to a book mobile because the librarian is so tall.A neighborhood renovation brings lots of strangers coming and going and shakes Sophie's comfortable and predictably safe world. The renovation of an old unoccupied building ushers in a dance studio. The dance studio becomes so irresistible to Sophie she couldn't stay away from her window. Waves of music, dance teachers instructions,intricate foot patterns capture her attention. So much so, she starts taking chances and steps out of her predictable world and routine.The audience witnesses a transformation in Sophie from a shy mouse, too afraid to try something new, into a braver mouse willing and wanting to try new things. Throughout the book, the audience is also witnessing another mouse that Sophie is unaware of. This mouse is the other half of the title, Sophie and Lou. It is Lou. Lou appears to have a little crush on Sophie and puts himself in her path frequently, but never seems to possess the courage to directly speak to her. Until one day, he rushes to open the door for her. Sophie now realizes she has seen Lou before and that she likes his face. \\"All the way home, she danced inside.\\"Sophie and Lou celebrates a blossoming friendship or love interest and a beautiful transformation in both characters. Both Sophie and Lou find their inner courage and step out into the world to take a chance. They find the love of dance and the love of another."},{"Title":"Sophie and Lou (Reading Rainbow)","review":"Another in Petra Mathers' explorations of mental illness, here we get the tale of Sophie, a mouse with a severe anxiety disorder characterized by social phobia, hypervigilance with an extreme sensitivity to rejection. When a dance studio opens across the street, Sophie is initially perturbed by the intrusion into her safe little home base. But she wants to dance. She wants to be a part of it. Aware on some levels that the phobia is really a fear of the fear, she embarks on a journey of interoceptive exposure, first reading books about dance, no doubt employing visualization techniques. She works up the continuum of exposure, fairly rapidly, to the point where she is dancing in her house, shades open, watching from a distance and listening in to the instructions from across the street. Louie, a gentlemouse, knocks on the door and asks for a dance. Depending on your level of cynicism, Louie is either a predatory type who we realize has been stalking the vulnerable Sophie since the beginning of the book, or, he can be seen as a shy, benevolent mouse with a crush, who works up the nerve to ask Sophie for a dance. The latter is the preferable interpretation given that this is a kids' book, but unfortunately experience has taught me to be more suspicious of the former. Anyway, Sophie's self CBT treatment is put the test in this moment. She will either demonstrate successful desensitization, conquer her phobic avoidance, and dance off merrily with the kind mouse, or she will be overwhelmed by the challenge, flooded emotionally by this rapid acceleration in the continuum of exposure, with bodily sensations caused by panic feeding back into the cognitive distortions that further the panic.Don't worry, it's for little kids. It's a sweet little happy ending, and a nice inspirational model for any of us who wish to conquer our fears. I think there could be an interesting sequel, where Sophie does some really good work in therapy, but her new found sense of self threatens her relationship with Louie, who has the need to maintain the role of rescuer within the relationship. Then a compassionate and wise owl will emerge in their lives and help Louie explore his repressed anger at his mother. Wait, maybe I'll write that story. Never mind. You can't have it, Petra, I said it here first, August 22, 2006, Marc Libman.Five stars for a cute little story with nice illustrations, minus one star because I honestly don't know enough of Lou's back-story to keep from worrying about his intentions with the vulnerable Sophie."},{"Title":"Sophie and Lou (Reading Rainbow)","review":"Sophie and Lou by Petra Mathers, Reading Rainbow Book. Harper Trophy (1991)This picture book is described as being for children K-3, but the story does not seem suitable for that age group.Sophie is a shy mouse or rat, can't quite tell from the pictures. She is so shy she won't go into the bookmobile because the librarian is extremely tall. Sophie keeps a neat, clean house because she has no outside activities. A dance studio opens across the street. She watches the dancing from her front window and becomes so curious about the dance steps that she musters the courage to enter the bookmobile. She checks out books on dance steps and paints diagrams on her floor. She practices diligently, starts worrying about her appearance, and buys some dancing shoes. One evening she dresses up and dances in front of her uncurtained window with the light behind her. Lou, whom she noticed in the street on the day she bought her shoes, comes to her front door and rings the bell. Sophie opens the door. Lou asks her to dance. \\"You bet,\\" she says, and \\"stepped into his arms.\\" The last panel shows them dancing outside, under the moon.I can see writing something along these lines for the shy pre-teen market, but it seems an odd plot to direct at very young children. And, in this scary day and age, should a child be encouraged to think that it's all right to open the door to a stranger and step into his arms?"},{"Title":"Sophie and Lou (Reading Rainbow)","review":"My 8 year old twins enjoyed this story.

Sophie is a mouse (we can tell from the pictures, but not from the text) and she's very introverted. She's even too scared to talk to the freaking librarian. Gosh. She sits around her house and cleans a lot, watching the sun go up and down. Probably doesn't even have a TV.One day, a dance school opens across the street. Sophie doesn't bother to shell out money for lessons and just learns how to dance by eavesdropping. I know she's too shy to actually go to the school and all, but is she allowed to listen without paying? I guess so.By the time we're down to our last three pages of the book Sophie has mastered several dances on her own. But where the heck is Lou? I have no idea.Then some stranger randomly comes up to her door asking to dance. How often does that happen? She dances with the stranger and finds out he's the Lou guy from the story's title and the book suddenly ends.I would just call this book \\"Sophie.\\""},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"C.S. Lewis is clearly one of the masters of 20th century prose. His theological ideas are very succulent in their purpose and while I may not agree with every doctrinal belief of his, the essence of his message is a very pure one - fulfilment comes only from submitting your will to the Father, through loyal service, dedication, and love (which He very happily returns to you in limitless abounds).\\"The Screwtape Letters\\" is a collection of epistles from the senior devil Screwtape to his junior 'tempter-in-training' nephew, Wormwood. The contents of Scewtape's letters are various discourses on how to spiritually influence the tempter's human \\"patient\\" into staying as far away from God as possible.Through this devil's advocate style of writing, we are given a very interesting glimpse into the workings of the evil one and how he can gradually pull people away from the Father through subtle tactical advances.Many times through reading Screwtape's letters as he discussed the behaviour of Wormwood's patient, I would have to stop myself and think, \\"Wow, I have acted exactly the same in that situation before\\" and Lewis begins to open up your perception of your own behaviour with an accurate objective commentary of our human thought processes - and the way in which they can be turned against us, e.g. how realising one's own humility can easily turn into a form of spiritual pride.Most surprisingly, was a passage where Screwtape discusses how God's only desire is for every human being to become exactly as his Son is, to the point where they realise that they are themselves sons and daughters of God. Lewis definitely understands the very core of Jesus' teachings, no matter how much Christianity has corrupted them over the years.Fiction-wise, all of the characters mentioned are given to us in brief glimpses at different times in the book, to the point where while there may not be large amounts of detail on them all, you could give a good description of each at the end of reading the entire book.Some of the more \\"story\\" focused elements are quite fun, and give us a glimpse into the 'mythos' that Lewis has obviously given some thought to before writing the \\"Letters\\". While some events are quite enjoyable, even humorous at times (such as when Screwtape's momentary anger causes him to involuntarily transform into a giant centipede) I felt slightly disappointed that there weren't more plot elements or details of this demonic \\"world\\" that Lewis' characters live in - although perhaps this was to preserve the authentic tone of the letters and the fluidity with which the book progresses.Overall, some passages touched me so deeply that I would have to ponder on them for some time before continuing on. I must admit that some of Lewis' ideas were so profound; they went over my head completely (I'm only 17 and have no qualms about admitting that I still have much more to learn, spiritually and intellectually). I hope that with future re-readings of this book (which for me, there most definitely will be!) I will pick up on things I had missed last time and, with hope, have a few more moments of inspired revelation.This is most definitely a classic which should be read by everyone, religious or not. It will open up your mind to many philosophical ideas about the nature of human beings and the psychological way in which we perceive spirituality.For those looking purely for a fictional reading experience, this one may be a little scant on details to satisfy your curiosity.I have no hesitations in recommending this book with a stellar 5/5 stars."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"Oh my, what a book this is.

Lewis literally wrote a Christian masterpiece with \\"The Screwtape Letters\\". The format is beguilingly simple, and the letters as written by Screwtape, a senior devil, to Wormwood, his junior associate, are tremendously entertaining without even considering the theology. If this were just an exercise in \\"thinking like a devil\\" then Lewis pulled that off well enough to entertain a reader of any religious faith. But the book is so much more.The thing that amazed me most was the timelessness of it. While the \\"patient\\" (the mortal being tempted) is assailed by events, the events are such universals of the human condition that it is easy to see oneself on almost ever page. Whether it is concern about \\"the war\\", what \\"educated\\" and \\"modern\\" friends might think about the patient's faith, or the desire of the patient to look around for a church he likes better than his current one, they could just as easily have been written yesterday.The book is so entertaining that it might be tempting to rush through it. I would recommend against this. Literally every page has something to say, something worth thinking about. Take your time, be both entertained and provoked to think. You will not regret this."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"I suppose this is considered a novel. It's short but masterfully written.

I regard it highly because this book forces us to see how in even this simplest of things we can be neglecting God. While it is not enjoyable to hear about how even the simplest things one does can hurt others, or play into the hands of evil, it is highly valuable. Don't expect to smile as you read this book, but expect to learn more about yourself."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"Although C.S. Lewis published &#65533;The Screwtape Letters&#65533; in 1942, its theme is every bit as appropriate today. A collection of correspondence from a veteran devil to an apprentice demon, the learned counsel for debasing virtue is all too commonplace in practice today.The corruption of language has been articulated by many social critics over the past decade to so, but Mr. Lewis referenced this nascent technique sixty years ago. The experienced devil, Screwtape, seems to be embracing modern day parlance when he brags about the word &#65533;Puritanism&#65533; taking on its pejorative status. &#65533;The value we have given to that word is one of the really solid triumphs of the last hundred years; by it we rescue annually thousands of humans from temperance, chastity and sobriety.&#65533;Today we often hear the cant that one religion is as good as another, and saying a certain religion is true will elicit terms like discrimatory or judgmental. While most churches advocate truth and righteousness, a lack of loyalty to one is not a positive development and Screwtape was knew this to be true. He waxed, &#65533;if a man can&#65533;t be cured of church, the next best thing is to send him all over the neighborhood looking for a church that suits him until he becomes a taster or connoisseur of churches.&#65533; He was especially fond of churches that change to meet current demand and praised a church where &#65533;the vicar is a man who has so long engaged in watering down the faith to make it easier for a supposedly incredulous and hard-headed congregation that it is now he who shocks his parishioners with his unbelief.&#65533;Often Mr. Lewis's healthy sense of humor is artfully displayed. An exasperated Screwtape writes desparigingly that one mortal is &#65533;not only a Christian such a Christian--a vile, sneaking, simpering, demure, monosyllabic, mouselike, watery, insignificant, virginal, bread-and-butter miss. The little brute, she makes me vomit.&#65533;Throughout the fantasy, a bounty of real advice is present. Simple tidbits such as Screwtape&#65533;s simple statement that &#65533;the safest road to hell is the gradual one&#65533; should serve as a tocsin for many readers. With wit, ingenuity, reverence, and jocularity, C.S. Lewis created a timeless classic to exhort the ages."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"In the original preface, Lewis says \\"There are two equal and opposite errors into which our race can fall about the devils. One is to disbelieve in their existence. The other is to believe, and to feel an excessive and unhealthy interest in them. They themselves are equally pleased by both errors and hail a materialist or a magician with the same delight.\\"Lewis had what I consider, a very biblically orthodox and, if I may say, HEALTHY conception of \\"devils\\". For him, the devil was NOT an equal power opposite to God, or in any way self-existent from all eternity. The devil was, and is, a created being... originally good, but fallen. An angel, who by the abuse of free will became an enemy to God, and as a corollary, to us. As such, he is the opposite not of God but of Michael (the Archangel).Anyhoo... in the summer of 1940 Lewis set out to write this book which \\"would consist of letters from an elderly retired devil who had just started work on his first 'patient'. The idea would be to give all the psychology of temptation from the other point of view.\\"The result is this collection of thirty-one intercepted letters between the senior devil (Screwtape) and his nephew Wormwood who has been assigned the damnation of one man's soul.It is brilliant.Here we see how the everyday life of the 'patient' looks from the viewpoint of Hell... how the many daily temptations are designed to chip away at the very foundation of who he is... to lead him not toward Heaven, but away from it. What is notable is the subtle nature of the temptations... ie., to be picky about what you eat, to hop from church to church, to argue, etc., rather than (for instance) to go out and shoot your neighbor. All is \\"good\\" in Screwtape's world as long as it leads ever so gradually downwards! Throughout the course of the letters, the state of this particular patient's soul undulates as he experiences a conversion, doubt, dangerous friendships, war, love, and finally, in death, oneness with God.The theology latent in this work of fiction is undeniably Christian. Those readers with even the slightest Christian sensiblilties will be further convinced that there are unseen forces presently at work in all of us, whose goal is to sap life in the here AND after! For other readers, as Anthony Burgess once said, \\"Lewis is the ideal persuader for the half-convinced, for the man who would like to be a Christian but finds his intellect getting in the way.\\"And, oh yes, \\"Readers are advised to remember that the devil is a liar. Not everything that Screwtape says should be assumed to be true even from his own angle.\\"Remember whose mail we're reading after all!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"With this book C.S. Lewis gives his version of what hell, demons, temptation, life, humans, God, look like from a demon's perspective. This book really shifts the paradigm of why things happen, to more, who or what causes these things to happen. The author does a masterful job of looking at human's and how they struggle through life, conversion experiences, change, success, failure and a wide range of human emotions.The thing that sets the Screwtape letters apart is the format of how Lewis accomplishes his task. He sets this book up as a series of letters from an mentor to a mentee, and it is all focused around one human who the mentee is trying to tempt and lead down the wrong path. The mentor does his best to show the mentee how humans can be tripped up.This book is good for a wide audience, from skeptics to believers, from Christians to Hindus. It looks at the human spirit, and how God created us to function, and how we can easily screw it up. I highly recommend this work if you want an intellectual challenge and a clever read."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"I simply love this book and it makes one think.Written as a series of letters from a senior devil to a junior tempter, this delightful book presents Hell like it was populated by cubicle-dwellers. Hell as a bureaucracy where if one does not do one's job, they are eaten by their boss.Lewis' insights into temptation and sin are priceless and thought provoking. Who would have thought that dying young was a blessing and that living to old age a curse in that it leads to a whole host of new sins? Or that the devil would encourage one to hang around with Christians so long as they are the \\"proper sort.\\"I have read this book multiple times and come away with a greater insight each time into my own actions and temptations.

When he fails and the patient converts, Screwtape is very displeased.The letters then take on a new tactic whereby since the patient is a Christian, the attempt becomes one of trying to keep from making the Christian life real and deep spiritually.Obviously the point it to make the reader Christian aware of the devious methods that satan uses to draw the Christian from Christ.Cosham's reading is stellar."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"This is a must read for anyone who seriously wants to led a better life.

This and another book of his \\"The Great Divorce\\" are the two books that I read the most often."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"When one first sits down to read Screwtape Letters, they will usually be baffled. You are sent straight into the middle of the story, as it seems. Young Wormwood, a junior tempter, has been assigned to his first patient. Patients are humans who have tempters inside their brains, so everyone is a patient of someone. Wormwood's job is to tempt people away from god. There is supposedly a tempter in everyone's brain, undetectable, who offers up suggestions and advice on actions the person is about to commit. All suggestions and advice are made so the patient will turn away from God, and all that is good, and toward Satan, and all that is bad. This is the basic premise of the story, yet it is much deeper. It delves into ones intellect and shows them ways that Satan catches us and tempts us.Wormwood is the Nephew of an honored tempter, Screwtape. His Uncle Screwtape writes him letters on how to lead his patient away from God and toward sin, hence Screwtape Letters. He gives Wormwood ways to show his patient other ways of doing actions that could have bad consequences, though the tempter tries to block the thought of the consequences away from his patients thoughts. Screwtape answers Wormwoods questions about different scenarios and scolds him when he doesn't follow directions properly and lets the patient go toward The Enemy, or God.In turn, this novel shows the reader how Satan is catching them and tempting one toward one of the seven deadly sins: anger, lust, gluttony, ect. After reading only a few chapters, one will soon come to realize their faults, which is why this book is so great. Screwtape Letters points out you wrong doings and tells of how Satan exploits them to his wishes. There really isn't a plot to this book, just a collection of letters and an underlying plot to make the understandable. It really doesn't require a huge plot though its so good. The theme Good vs. Evil is so strong it takes the plots place.One will find this book quite enjoyable and truthful about human ways. Though in the end Wormwood does lose the patient to God, not saying how, it shows that you can fight temptation if you put your mind to it.This novel deserves an 11 out of 10 and the Newberry Award in all categories, no matter if it even falls into them. This book is that good and everyone should read it. It will minimally change your life at least and help you recognize your own faults."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"This wonderfully witty work of CS Lewis brings to light many weaknesses of the human race, and especially those pertaining to Christians. In a masterful style of satire, the book consists of a series of \\"letters\\" written from a high-ranking devil to a low-ranking one. The latter, Wormwood, has just received his first \\"patient,\\" a young man, and Screwtape, his uncle, corresponds with him, giving advice and pointers as to how Wormwood can effectively conquer this man's soul.The genius in this book lies in the advice Screwtape provides. Rather than counsel Wormwood to tempt this man into large sins which would instantly destroy his soul, Screwtape takes a subtler approach. Letter after letter outlines ways in which Wormwood can turn the man's triumphs into tragedies, progress into hindrance, and virtues into vices. Instead of trying to tempt the man into quitting church, for example, he advises persuading him to visit a number of churches, thus insuring that he will become a 'comparer' of churches rather than a follower of one specific doctrine.The obvious message of this book is a warning against the old \\"frog in hot water\\" idea. If you throw him in hot water, he will jump out, but put him in cold water and gradually increase the heat, and you will soon have a cooked frog. Lewis's message, masterfully presented and so clearly thought out (as is typical of him), is that Christians need to stop looking beyond the small things, to see the error in so many of their seemingly insignificant actions. Perhaps the beauty of this book is that it shows just how easy it is to lose one's soul.CS Lewis was a master of Christian thinking. This book is a product of his genius, a masterpiece full of invaluable advice."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"There are piles of books on conversations between man and God. I even recall one aimed at Junior Highers that was structured around e-mails from Heaven. All of the books contain encouragments for work, life and love. 'The Screwtape Letters' also contains much encouragment and advice, but of a much differant kind. Screwtape is an old, wise demon who's spent many years tempting, distracting and leading humans astray. Wormwood, a much younger demon, and Screwtape's nephew, has a 'patient' that is causing him trouble. The tone of the book is what struck me first. It isn't really devious or noir at all, it's very matter-of-fact and quite often bright, almost cheery. You get more of a picture of a slightly withered old man writing to his nephew by fire light with a quill and ink rather than the more expected gargoyle scrolling gothic letters with a claw dipped in human blood. The book's purpose is to bring the ways of demons to light, and the tone helps a lot. Though it may seem like the light, friendly tone would deminish the serious subject, it does not, rather it illuminates the most base element of deception: trust. This friendly speech of familial love is disarming and shows how Screwtape was so successful. Most Christians can see the truths of what is said, we've all experienced this kind of temptation, those who \\"haven't\\" are in denial. Something that not a lot of writers when speaking of Hell and demons really plays on is the relationship between Heaven and Hell. The relationship couldn't be more plain here, or more truthful. In the introduction, Lewis sights that the Devil is the father of lies. And reading the book you come to the obviousness of the truth about him: How can he lie if doesn't know the truth?The greatest value of this book is not empathy. It is not a book designed to exhort you by saying 'everyone goes through this'. It is a guide, a warning, a class on the tactics of demons in order to prevent their working. If Demons are the terrorists of the soul, then think of 'The Screwtape Letters' as a sort of Spiritual SWAT class."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"If you didn't have the benefit of taking a general theology class in college or you want to grow in your faith, read and discuss this book with a few friends. Lewis's elder demon Screwtape can teach us a lot about ourselves, about God, and about contemporary culture. Lewis writes in an easy-to-read, quotable style which is sure to challenge our modern thinking.In one sense, it's a primer on how to sin. The book is full of \\"advice\\" on how turn a good thing into a sinful one. I remember my wife being challenged by the discussion of gluttony. According to Screwtape, it works both ways, by eating too much or too little, because the key is flattering your pride. All sin stems from our natural, self-honoring pride, and Screwtape gives many examples of how to insert that pride into everything we do.Of course, it isn't as if you are reading letters from the devil himself, every word corrupting your spirit. This book praises God's grace in a Christian's life (in a back-handed sort of way). And it's funny. I love it when Screwtape gets so mad he morphs into a worm, and his secretary has to finish the letter. I also love his description of the coup Lucifer led against God Almighty before he and the angels who supported him were kicked out of heaven (becoming the demons they are now).It's a great, little work of fiction, loaded with applicable truth."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"John Cleese was born to read The Screwtape Letters!

In modern Christian writings there is very little about the value of time, worldly vanities, and choice of friends. Nihilism, nothing, is very strong. It can steal away a man's best years. The future is the least like eternity. Men are angered by misfortune conceived as injury.C.S.

To think that one could come up with something as genius as this, it blows one's mind! We find letters from the enemy, preferably Screwtape advising Wormwood, and we find caution in how to arm ourselves against the forces of Hell.While a wonderful addition to my library, I found it interesting that Lewis showed Screwtape as a discourager, rather than an encourager, which is not unlike the devil. He gave advice, yet always found a way to put Wormwood down, rather than lift him up.He hit the nail on the head once again. A well full of wisdom! Good stuff!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"In a brief book comprising 31 hypothetical letters from a wise-old demon, Screwtape, to his nephew Wormwood, C.S. Lewis gathers a wide host of temptations common to our own lives, and portrays them as bits of advice from Screwtape to his nephew. Screwtape is advising his nephew in how best to catch his prey, by various cunning means. The young man of whom Wormwood is given charge to tempt, could easily be any one of us, and the ways that Wormwood was advised to use in numbing the man to sin are certainly recognizable to our own existence. Two of the particularly notable things I pulled from this book were the way Screwtape suggested encouraging Flippancy and the false impression of Unselfishness in the young victim. The former is taking serious matters too lightly by making jokes of them, which dulls our senses to their import; and the latter is the dishonesty we enter into when we disguise our irritations to &quot;seem&quot; agreeable and unselfish, all the while harboring personal resentments. I wouldn't call this book a masterpiece, but it is well worth reading, and certainly awakens us to the need of living prayerful and watchful lives, asking for Christ's protection in our weakness and temptation, that we might remain faithful. Also, the addition of &quot;Screwtape Proposes A Toast&quot; at the end of my edition, was not nearly as interesting as the rest of the book."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"You see, Screwtape's nephew's incompetance is rather good for us - the tempted.

What a great idea to look at temptation from the other side - and then to reveal so many brilliant insights. Perhaps it should have been longer!!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"I must say that I have mixed reactions to the Screwtape Letters of C.S. Lewis. These reactions are not unfounded and are even acknowledged by the author himself. The work presents itself as a set of imaginary correspondence between a major devil, Screwtape, and his nephew, Wormwood. The overall function of the dialogue in the text is to portray a view of morality from the eyes of Hell. The overall effect is one that is both witty and enlightening. Nonetheless, I share the reservations of Lewis himself and those reportedly held by J.R.R. Tolkien (to whom the text was dedicated) that claimed that Lewis had gone too far into the Enemy's camp. Lewis admitted that it was a difficult task to write these letters, given the spiritual dryness of the correspondents.Nonetheless, the overall work does a good job at expressing a variety of theological topics. It pursues the ongoing conversion of an individual living during the Second World War. Each chapter presents a different sin that is exploited by the minions of Hell. The action of each chapter indirectly teaches a lesson on the nature of the sin at hand as well as by delving into the nature of Hell. While I disagree on some of the notions of sin held by Lewis, he is mostly on track with standard orthodoxy. There is nothing dangerous in the text, although I feel that his view on the nature of devils' desires is a bit misdirected. The additionally included letter, \\"Screwtape Proposes a Toast,\\" is a most excellent wake-up call to the educators of the world, exposing the dangers inherent in many modern theories of education.I suggest the text with the caveat of prudence. The powers of Hell are temping in a great number of ways. It is quite possible that Lewis went too far into the camp of the Enemy in order to write this text. I know that this view may seem wimpy or fundamentalistic. It is based on the same motivating conviction which Tolkien had against such action, a motivation which influenced his own works in Middle Earth. While I must admit that his theology is mostly top-notch and that his writing is humorous, I also send you forth with a partial recommendation, given the afore-mentioned caveat."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"C.S. Lewis is a very talented person and writes on an extremely intellectual level. This level of ability was ever so evident in his fictional novel called The Screwtape Letters. Written in the form of letters, the basis of this book focuses on a tale of the pursuit of Satan trying to win over the soul of a newly reborn Christian. The letters are written by a servant of Satan named Screwtape and are addressed to Screwtape's nephew, Wormwood, a tempter of the devil. Thirty-one letters exist in total and every letter is filled with increasingly desperate advice regarding how Wormwood should attempt to corrupt this newly reborn Christian. Screwtape's philosophy focuses mainly on the dirty basis of deception. This novel truly shows that deception lies at the root of all evil and is one of Satan's primary weapons. In the end Satan looses and the Christian goes to heaven. It is wonderfully refreshing!The biblical ties and accuracy within this book greatly add an effective level of credibility. This book was obviously written to speak up and point out to Christians the devious ways in which Satan works, but also to remind them that God does prevail. This was a very good book and within it lie many important messages about life and Christ."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"I was introduced to the Screwtape Letters when I was a child. I always liked reading C. S. Lewis books. I devoured the Chronicles of Narnia in less than a month. After that I started looking for any books I could find by Lewis. That's how I found the Screwtape Letters.This book contains what are supposed to be &quot;demonic communications.&quot; A series of letters written by a greater demon, Screwtape, to his underling, Wormwood. Lewis doesn't tell us how he came into possession of these letters.Apparently, Wormwood is assigned to torment a human; which they call a &quot;patient.&quot; Screwtape gives him pointers on how to turn this human away from the cause of Christ. It's a very weighty book for a ten-year-old to read, but I have come back to the book again as an adult.The screwtape letters is a good read, I am enjoying reading it a second time. It reminds us that there really are fallen angels out there who don't want us to work for the cause of Christ."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"My Dear AmazoniansMy diabolical letters having fallen into the hands of one of the Enemy's followers named Lewis they are being abused by the Enemy's camp for their own nefarious soteriological ends so for now perhaps Amazon is the way forward. My letters were directed to my nephew Wormwood a junior devil on a tempting assignment working on a new Christian. He ultimately failed yet it wasn't a total loss as Wormwood became a nice gastronomically satisfying quiche which I immensely enjoyed eating. I narrowly escaped becoming a souffle myself by telling numerous lies to my superior blaming a whole host of junior tempters. I don't know if he really believed me but I do know he relished snacking on those junior mints as I spun my yarn to him. Still Wormwood could have had his man because men are fools and when they realize this is when they begin to approach the Enemy's camp in earnest. Our job is to make them believe they are truly fine fellows in fact maybe a little better than their neighbor a little superior than the rest and then the slide towards our fathers camp is all but assured. What the Enemy calls pride we call shrimp on the barbie. I tried to give Wormwood useful counsel on this in my letters:\\"Your patient has become humble; have you drawn his attention to the fact? All virtues are less formidable to us once the man is aware that he has them, but this is specially true of humility. Catch him at the moment when he is really poor in spirit and smuggle into his mind the gratifying reflection, \\"By jove! I'm being humble\\", and almost immediately pride--pride at his own humility--will appear. If he awakes to the danger and tries to smother this new form of pride, make him proud of his attempt--and so on, through as many stages as you please. But don't try this too long, for fear you awake his sense of humour and proportion, in which case he will merely laugh at you and go to bed. ... You must therefore conceal from the patient the true end of Humility. Let him think of it not as self-forgetfulness but as a certain kind of opinion (namely, a low opinion) of his own talents and character.\\"It is with gems such as these that I filled my letters to Wormwood yet the bumbler still lost the prize for my fathers kingdom and his patient made it safely into the Enemy camp. Legions of Devils, Thorns, and Shadies are plying our trade today and we are positively on the march winning victories for the kingdom below as people turn to self and turn away from the face of the Enemy.Ravenously yoursScrewtape"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"d recommend this be one of the first books you read as you start your spiritual journey. This is a profound piece of literature that will jolt you awake from your apathetic musings and stir you to the depths of your soul.I was a Christian for 12+ years before I discovered \\"Screwtape Letter\\" and it was of inestimable worth for me, but I regretted not having found it much sooner.It's one of those books (like E. L. Prentiss's \\"Stepping Heavenward\\") that feels like it was written JUST for you. \\"Screwtape Letters\\" has that same feel - that C. S. Lewis crawled into your consciousness and described every mental battle you've ever had - and explains that those subtle arguments which steered you away from spiritual growth, were cleverly disguised devilish whispers. As Lewis points out, the path to hell is a gentle slope.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn how to differentiate between God's thoughts and the lies of evil. \\"Screwtape Letters\\" pulls back the curtain and reveals evil's best kept secrets and oh-so subtle tricks."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"It's been a few years since I've read the Screwtape Letters, but I recently ordered a Kindle and will soon be adding it to my collection.I always read the reviews on books that I find potentially interesting. I especially enjoy reading those reviews which I expect to be extreme and/or in opposition to my own views. Before I clicked on the link to \\"1 STAR\\" reviews on The Screwtape Letters, I already knew who these reviewers were and the jest of what they had written: They are Non-Christians; they know nothing about C.S. Lewis; and they erroneously associate the Christian's relationship with the Creator with \\"religion\\". I knew that at least one of them would attack Christianity with cynicism and/or venom. I was right.The Screwtape Letters was written by a thinking, truth-seeker who is/was one of the foremost atheist-turned-Christian, philosopher of all time. His intended audience was also thinking, truth-seekers (of whom are increasingly fewer and further between).Lewis goes where few people dare to tread - and even fewer dare to dwell for any length of time: At the mirror of man's TRUE self. The Screwtape Letters is an eyes-wide-open look at himself, humanity, the Bible and our Creator. The Letters are exchanges between a \\"demon\\" and his supervisor which paint a high-definition picture of man's true condition.

In it, a senior devil gives continued advice to his prot&eacute;g&eacute; on how best to tempt his victim and keep him from salvation.Lewis does not propose any concrete doctrine on devils here, and this is not his point. Rather he focuses on highlighting the ways, both large and small, that Christians are distracted from God. Lewis explores the dangers of not being purposeful toward God and life, as well as what happens to people when they give in to temptation.The book is presented as a collection of letters, all from Screwtape to Wormwood. But Lewis does a good job of making the conversation not feel one-sided, and he does a fantastic job with the devils' personalities. In fact the book is rather deeper than this, as there are two other plots going on. First is the fate of Wormwood's man. Second is the relationship between the devils, and the fate of Wormwood.The Screwtape Letters is deeper than it appears, and is thoroughly thought-provoking. Most every reader will find elements in it to which he or she can relate. Christians of all maturity levels can benefit from this book.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"The Screwtape letters are a series of letters from the senior demon Screwtape to his nephew, Wormwood, who is a demon in training. In the letters Screwtape guides Wormwood on the finer nuances of ever so slowly leading a patient down the wrong path. He suggesting planting thoughts in the mind of his patient, such as:* When at church, focus on the funny hat the person in next the pew is wearing. No one of true faith could wear such a hat!* Next, notice the shoes on the man seated next to him. They aren't the type of shoes he would wear.* Encourage him to look for the perfect church. This congregation doesn't sing right, this sermon is too long, I don't fit in here...never let him look at the bigger picture of unifying with one goal in mind.* When his mind begins to think of anything important, when he begins to see a glimpse that there is more to life than the physical, distract him with lunch time, the bus schedule, make him focus on \\"the real world\\".This is an inspiring read. It reminded me how there are more things in life that distract us from focusing on our spiritual needs than those that help us meet them."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"\\"The Screwtape Letters\\" is perhaps my most favorite C.S. Lewis book. In it we read a series of letters from a \\"senior\\" demon to his \\"junior\\" temptor. And in it we learn all about the fine and subtle tricks that demons play on us. What makes this book so amazing (and quite honestly frightening!) is that as you read you begin to mentally check off each trick that you've encountered in your OWN life! By the time I finished this book, I was so convinced of its truthfulness that I started telling all my friends and family to read it (and read it carefully!) Read it yourself -- you'll be shocked, but you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"Mr. Lewis' great achievement here is that he manages to succeed where literally thousands of fire-and-brimstone sermons have failed -- this book forces you to analyze your life against the Christian ideal. At the same time, it is carried forward by an inherent sense of hope and optimism -- Mr. Lewis doesn't fall into Milton's trap of admiring Screwtape. It also serves as a great spiritual pep-talk: you are given the secrets, if you will, of how the Enemy works...and strategies to foil him are freely confessed.Some letters are more entertaining than others, but each finds its mark (and each found at least one mark within me, to be sure).A friend of mine (a professed agnostic) once described this book as the most compelling case for Christianity he ever came across. I would have to agree.This book does contain the essay \\"Screwtape Proposes a Toast,\\" but it lacks the wonderful introduction (by Mr. Lewis himself) that I found in another paperback (which I have since lost). Still, it is hard to argue with _any_ version of this work."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"Regardless of your religious background, this book speaks to the timeless struggle for a more moral behavior. I just re-read this book and found it even more inspiring than the first time. Even if you become a little entangled in the scholarly prose, it will still hit the heartstring in a gentle,hopeful,and powerful way. Lewis has incredible insight to the human soul and condition. Never condemning, but always aware of human frailties, he guides one to look within oneself for the light that illuminates each of us. I do not find this book \\"preachy\\" in any way. It mearly points out the moral difficulties all men face, shows one the humor and tragedy of human behavior, and the hopeful and loving God who has given all men the power to choose for themselves. I wish everyone would read this little book. It could change your life."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"What a powerful, well written book! Screwtape is a demon leader for the devil, and each chapter is a letter from him to his nephew Wormwood, another demon in Satan's horde. Screwtape gives Wormwood lots of advice on how he can turn his 'patient,' a new Christian convert, away from the Christian faith. And the suggestions that Screwtape makes are not only wickedly ingenious, but it makes you shudder when you think about how this pans out in the real world.But for me, the real highlights of the book are when Wormwood screws up and Screwtape, almost beside himself, takes him to task in moments of great humor. I have never read a writer in the 20th century who was ever the wordsmith as Lewis was, and this book is the peak of the mountain.

However, for me, C.S. Lewis' writing is a little hard to comprehend. It's written in proper 1940's English from England and I'm living in 2006 America - go figure. I thought the CD audio version was read by John Cleese, but I think that must have referred to the taped version, which is out of print. The reader is a good dramatist, just not who I expected. The book itself is illuminating to a Christian who thinks they're living a pretty good Christian life. It shines the light on little things we do and say that are not Christ-like, such as sarcasm, envy and thinking of ourselves first. It challenged me to consider all my actions and words and I think listening to the CD is a great way to digest this book. I don't know if one becomes confused while reading \\"The Screwtape Letters,\\" but even in the audio version I sometimes had to remind myself that when Screwtape refers to the \\"enemy\\", for him that is Christ. Since we're used to referring to Satan as the enemy, it takes a bit of concentration to remember who we're talking about here. Overall, a great book that really gets to the heart of daily Christian living by revealing how Satan views our little slip-ups. He relishes them and we must mind what we do and say and each day strive to live and love as Christ."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"I couldn't be more impressed with Joss Ackland's audio peformance of this book. For my money, it's the best ever audio Screwtape, and a masterpiece. Even better than the John Cleese performance, which is saying something.Ackland has a deep, resonant voice. The delivery is dryer than Cleese's, but at the same time heavier and more diabolical. And it's more pleasurable in general, the kind of voice that can be heard for hours without grating, a rarity in the audiobook world. For some, there may be too much benevolence (think of the warmth in Donald Sutherland's voice) in this Screwtape, but I think two things save that from being a real fault:1. It makes a more diabolical lie of Screwtape's \\"affection\\" for Wormwood by having him sound sometimes like a genuinley loving uncle, and 2. it is a large part of the visceral pleasure of listening to the book. In other words, it might be more realistic to hear Screwtape sound more obnoxious, but then we'd have to listen to someone being obnoxious for 4 hours!(You can get it on Amazon's audiobook branch, audible.com, and at the time of this review it costs less than $10 for the download.

Every time I do I gain deeper insight into the wiles of the evil we face in the world and especially the tricks encountered by believers in God.Lewis, who taught literature at Oxford and who wrote The Chronicles of Narnia, has a very active imagination (and this is not a negative thing) and tells the story from the point of view of letters written from one of the servants of the devil (referred to as Father) who is tutoring a young devil in how to keep a new believer from staying in The Way. The devil is subtle in many ways and really gives deep insight into the little tricks that men play.God is referred to as the Enemy and the devil, by explaining from the negative point of view, reveals how God operates and how a believe gains staying power. The bottom line is truly mysterious: grace. Lewis' writing packs a punch. There are no wasted words and each reading reveals more and more insight into the workings of evil in the world.It traces the journey of one individual and the assortment of characters who surround him and touches on aspects of culture, of family, of the church world and even of falling in love. It is written in such a style as to convict the reader without accusing as it is written not so much in generalities but in general truths that we can read ourselves into.For those who doubt the reality of evil in the world, this really opens one's eyes to its many manifestations, whether one believes in a personal (i.e. 'real') devil or the devil as abstraction or personifaction of evil.

Lewis is a wonderful writer and story teller."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"Throughout this book, The Screwtape Letters, C.S. Lewis has a vivid imagination. He depicts great images with writing from the perspective of a senior demon known as Screwtape to his nephew, Wormwood. Across the book Wormwood is being mentored by his uncle to secure the damnation of a man who lives in Britain known as \\"the patient\\".This book provides great examples on how the Christian life is distracted and taken away from God's glory to our own. The patient goes through the constant battle of choosing wether to do what he knows is right, from what he knows God wants from him versus the distractions that are constantly placed in front of him by Wormwood. Lewis is a phenomenal author that with such a simple story can derive so many different thoughts and realizations."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"Good literature, story I've heard before, but wanted my own copy.

Unfortunately that version was not available when I ordered my copy. This narrator is good, but not as funny as John Cleese. That is why I give this recording a 4-star rating.The Screwtape Letters are marvelous. For those who do not know, they are a series of letters between a mid-level bureaucrat devil, Screwtape, and a junior \\"tempter\\". (Yes, even in Hell, they have bureaucracy.) The tempter's job is to get his \\"patient\\" into Hell. Screwtape reviews his progress and provides pointers on how this might be better accomplished. It is quite funny because the diabolical mindset is completely opposite of ours. Still, it is intended to provoke thought and to guide you in avoiding the traps of the tempter assigned to your life.Screwtape Proposes A Toast describes our educational system and \\"democracy\\" to a T.

This is one of those books you can read again and again over a lifetime and pull something new from it each time it is read."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"The Screwtape Letters by C.S.Lewis offers an alternate viewpoint of demons working in the life of an average Christian. The narrator is a demon writing to his nephew a lesser demon. He is coaching him on how to turn his \\"patient\\" away from God-\\"the Enemy\\" in the most effective way. It is an excellent description of the way Satan puts things into your mind or keeps things out to draw you away from God. The uncle says:\\"It is funny how mortals always picture us as putting things into their minds: in reality our best work is done by keeping things out.\\" The book is sectioned into different subjects that the demons attack. From as simple to the friends you make, to your relationship with your mother-in-law, your prayer life(or nonexistent one), to the Church. In regards to the Church the uncle says:\\" One of our greatest allies at present is the Church itself. Do not misunderstand me. I do not mean the Church as we see her spread out through all time and space rooted in eternity, terrible as an army with banners. That, I confess, is a spectacle which makes our boldest tempters uneasy. But fortunately it is quite invisible to these humans.\\"It helps you to realize that the demons try to draw you away from God in small steps over time so it doesn't seem like a big deal to you. This book reminds you to be more on guard for those seemingly little things. \\"We know that we have introduced a change of direction in his course which is already carrying him out of orbit around the Enemy (God); but he must be made to imagine that all the choices which have effected this change of course are trivial and revocable. He must not be allowed to suspect that he is now, however slowly, heading right away from the sun on a line which will carry him into the cold and dark of utmost space.\\"You will probably have to embrace your imagination and freedom of thought while reading this. Not your typical theological book but will definitely challenge your thinking and make you more aware of devices of the enemy."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"There is really not much I can add to all of the commentary on this spiritual classic by C.

The Screwtape Letters is my personal favorite of Lewis's books, even more so than the Chronicles of Narnia.I must confess though, that I find reading The Screwtape Letters a slightly frightening experience.

The book is more a theological book, than an exciting book. I would not suggest this book for a high school student. Not that it is too complicated for a teenager to read, because the story is easy to understand and follow. The book was dull, the author could not keep my attention or interest, because there was little action or excitement. Although I found it dull the book is well written, the writing style is very creative. The story makes the reader think about their one life. The \\"patient\\" represents the every day man, therefore the situations in the book parallel people's own life experiences."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"In my perspective of reading The Screwtape Letters, I found the book being very repetitive to the point where it took the excitement away from the book. Don't get me wrong the book dealt with many social issues that we as individuals undergo each and everyday of our lives.

This is going to be great! There were a few chuckles I'll admit, but I kept waiting for some revelation, some new understanding, a new light on the matter. Alas, it was not to be. I found this book mostly boring and old hat, very old hat. I feel I wasted my time."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"Try as I may, I find C.S.Lewis nearly impossible to read. Maybe that is because I have little interest in living a good Christian life -- as portrayed by a British professor of literature, writing at the time of the second world war.His basis premise seems to be that God and the Devil have some \\"interest\\" in the way human beings are living their lives. Both are trying to influence that. I just can't for the life of me understand why a God would want to do that. I mean if God is all powerful why couldn't he just create the perfect man and be done with it, why would he have to go around trying to find ways to improve on his design? And what benefit does the devil get by getting the human to do evil and collecting the odd soul? The whole subject is patently ridiculous. And to try to cast an argument, which is dubious at best, using the technique of diabolic ventriloquism or photographic negative is mind boggling. At the end what are we supposed to get out of this -- pure knowledge? an understanding of Lewis' philosophy? or just a chuckle? If it is the chuckle, then I would divide the causes of such a chuckle into Joy, Fun, the Joke Proper, and Flippancy. And I would relegate Lewis to the flippant. \\"It is a thousand miles away from joy; it deadens, instead of sharpening, the intellect; and it excites no affection between those who practice it.\\" (Page 51 Screwtape.)"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"This book was the selection for my reader's group this month and I must say, no offense to the member who picked it, that I couldn't get pass the third chapter.

However, I was disappointed with the concept. Why does Christianity continue to point fingers at the Devil and/or demons?Lewis uses an interesting format (letters written from a ficitious demon named Screwtape to his aspiring nephew Wormwood) to convey an important message, namely temptation. Christians must be very aware of temptations that confront them in everyday life, and Lewis does his usual, masterful job of inserting wit and humor into a very serious subject. He provides many useful insights into temptation and often helps the Christian see why things are not always what they seem at first glance.That being said, I'm frustrated with Christianity's repeatedly blaming Satan and his demons for our own sins. The Bible teaches us that &quot;The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked.&quot; Man is wicked enough on his own to fall head first into a horrendous life of sin. We need no assistence from the evil one. Maybe I'm reading too much into Lewis' work, but in today's church, when angels and demons seem all the rage, I think many may miss this message's true intent."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"It seems here like everybody absolutely loves this book. Whilte it does have some witty moments of insight, I found the book to be enormously overrated.The allegorical form of writing, as letters from a demon to another demon, gets old pretty quickly and it gets extremely repetetive and frankly quite boring. Way too much time is spent on how to tempt humans away from Christianity, and to a non-Christian, those long portions of texts are completely uninteresting.Lewis does make some good points about human behaviour in general that are both witty and insightful, but those are exceptions and for the most part \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" is quite boring. The novella would have been good if it was about one third as long and not be so centered on Christianity.

That kind of person almost always turns out to be the staunchest and most annoying type of True Believer. I have the same basic problem with this book that I had with Richard Dawkin's \\"The God Delusion\\". Both books were written in a way that was likely to titillate readers who share the authors beliefs and annoy people who disagree. I found it interesting that they were both products of Oxford. I wonder if that means anything. My biggest problem with this book comes from a Christian point of view, not an atheist or agnostic one. In Lewis's cosmology not only do you have to believe in Christ the Redeemer but you have to live an uncompromisingly saintly life or your going to end up as dinner for some demon, which Lewis obviously believes in literally. Lewis is just the Pharisees he condemns to Hell. He can see the speck in everybody else's eye but he can't see the log in his own. He swallows a camel and chokes on a gnat. If there is a Hell I wouldn't say he deserves to go there, but if there is a Hell there is a Purgatory and he deserves to spend at least a few decades there."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"I started my search looking for The Screwtape Letters on CD as narrated by John Cleese.

While not practising I do understand alot of christian mythology and am always interested in anything that may reveal interpretations of faith. This novel was a wonderfully incightfull glimpse into the world of a demon (christian). The messages from Screwtape to his nephew challenge the thoughts and actions we take on a daily basis. Lewis tactfully chalenges those who would call themselves atheists not to mention challenging the justifications many of us use on a daily basis to avoid following an ethical life. While reading it makes you stop and say to yourself, wow I am doing the exact thing this demon wants me to do and while it doesn't make you fear that your soul will be taken it makes you wonder, what would it hurt to go that extra mile to take the ethical, morally right alternative. This book offers me a great reminder whenever I am having trouble making a decision on a problem in my life. But be warned if you have been preached to all your life many of this will sound familiar and in too large of doses can be off putting, but overall a wonderfull read."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"The Screwtape Letters is a unique book. I can think of no other work of literature that I have read or have heard of that is even remotely similar. Lewis' writing assumes the voice of a demon, Screwtape, authoring instructional letters to his nephew, Wormwood, on how to effectively tempt the man he has been assigned to, in order to pull him away from \`the Enemy' (God). It is an unmatched work of Lewis' grasp on human psychology seen through the lens of Christianity.The plot of the book traces the practicing temptations of Wormwood upon his subject, and then follows the continuing cosmic battles of God and the demonic throughout the events of what is seemingly everydayhuman life. The ultimate aim of the book, I believe, is for Christians to understand how demons/tempters utilize the mundane occurrences of life to lure us away from God. It is a spectacularly revealing book that helped me to realize that wickedness is not the absolute aim of Satan, but to promote repeated actions and thoughts within us that keep us from approaching God.I understand that the Screwtape Letters may seem cliche to many, because it sits atop every Christian's bookshelf as one of the absolute must reads along with the books we know everyone has: \`Mere Christianity,' \`Desiring God,' \`Narnia,' etc. (I would like to note that the presence of these books doesn't mean for a second that anyone has read them) It is like the Christian book equivalent of a star on your Christmas Tree- it just isn't right until it's there. But it really is a book that is more than worth its time to read. The Screwtape Letters will not only help you in more thoroughly thinking through your own faith, but also thinking through \`the little foxes' that seem to attack your system of belief. I think what amazes me most about the Screwtape Letters, is that while Lewis is a using a fictitious demon as his mouthpiece, there are wholly reverent, and worshipful ideas that are presented to the reader, despite the devout thoughts coming from a character that completely despises God. The Screwtape Letters will undoubtedly present to you ideas and theologies that help to foster a greater love and passion for the one in the book who is referred to as the \`Great Enemy.'I remember vividly when someone very close to me was hesitant about reading \`The Screwtape Letters' because the very idea of a demon being assigned to temp an individual was scary. I agree, the idea certainly isn't one that makes you want to party like its 1999. However, it is a reality that our enemy Satan is seeking to destroy us, and having a better grasp on his battle plan is like knowing the formation and strategy of an attacking army- it's going to help.All that being said, in no way is this a scary book to read, nor will it promote thoughts about the demonic in an unhealthy way. Your child is not going to be a practicing warlock that attends Hogwarts after reading the book. At worst you will notice areas in your life that you have forfeited to temptation that you never noticed. At best (which is what occurred to me, and I think every other Tom, Dick, and Harry that has read the book) you will find yourself emotionally stirred, and have a greater love for God who readily thwarts the attacks of the demonic.Put it on the top shelf, as cliche as it seem. It belongs there. Trust me.Check out my book review site: [...]"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"I really enjoy this reading of \\"The Screwtape Letters\\". Mr. Cleese puts a lot of emotion and life into his reading. I felt that in some places, the pausing/emotion got a bit too much, and I detest the musical interludes, but otherwise, this adaptation is lovely. One of my favorites, and I recommend it highly to everyone."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"This is the second time that I have read this book. The first time was as a youth a very long time ago and it had a positive impact on me. I decided to reread it and see what additional insights it would bring into my life. It was clearly worth the few hours of my time it took to read this book. The device Lewis uses is very clever and forces one to look at sin, pride, and mediocrity from a totally different viewpoint. It becomes clear that it's not the big mistakes we make in life that really hurts us; sometimes those are the things that cause us to reevaluate our lives and repent. The things that really hurt us are the pride and the accumulation of little sins. Lewis seem to really be pushing for greatness of soul. Bottom line is this little book made me think about my life. That is what a good book should do.The book also includes the essay, \\"Screwtape Proposes a Toast\\". This was written much later and instead of Screwtape writing letters advising Wormwood, he is at an awards ceremony at the school for tempters proposing a toast to future and past successes. It is basically a vehicle to complain about how the modern education system focuses on mediocrity. It also brings out some very good points to ponder.I highly recommend this book to everyone. The principles espoused here apply to all people, religious or not."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"It's funny because most of us think we're so much smarter and more progressive than the ones from the past generations. We act as if we've grown out of certain things and 'evolved' since our grandparents' time. Yet, everytime I read books from people like C.S Lewis and Watchman Nee, who were active 50-60 years ago, I realize the true wisdom come from the Lord not our schools or the cutting edge science we boast.While reading this book, I caught myself doing exactly the same things Screwtape was instructing his newphe to get his 'patient' to do. There're so many distractions in our lives that we constantly lose our focus from the most important thing! Jesus Christ! I also loved the way Screwtape described the true prayer. It's about communicating with the Christ as who He really is not as who we want Him to be or think He should be. It's amazing to see C.S. Lewis glorify the Lord with the amazing talent that's given to him."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"C. S. Lewis takes a very interesting perspective in this book, writing letters from an affectionate and established professional devil in the field of human temptation to his beloved but inexperienced nephew, a young devil who has just recently entered the field. Told completely through these letters, the story unfolds of how the uncle constantly tries to correct the younger devil's foul-ups as the younger tries to corrupt his assigned human's soul. Through this arrangement, Lewis gives poignant comment on humanity, Christianity, and what is truly important. Written in an older English style, the grammar is at times hard to follow, but that only makes the reader concentrate more and therefore gain more from the story. A rewarding read, if not always enjoyable due to the effort."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"I would characterize this as something like Lewis's \\"modest proposal\\" for the temptation of mankind. In the epistolary tradition, but representing only one side of the conversation, the letters in question are those of a senior demon, the eponymous Screwtape, to his nephew Wormwood, a minor devil, and represent Screwtape's collected wisdom on the subject of the temptation of human beings from the straight and narrow.Like much of Lewis's writing, The Screwtape Letters is essentially an apology for Christianity, but unlike some of his other books, Screwtape is funny, sly, witty, and full of sarcastic japes and jests. Of course, it also provides plenty of Lewis's own wisdom (demonstrated \\"in reverse\\" by Screwtape, as true a \\"devil's advocate\\" as ever there has been).A very entertaining and illuminating read! Even if you've found some of Lewis's theological writings difficult or tedious, try The Screwtape Letters."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"I loved this book. It was amusing and insightful. Lewis really captured the character of a demonic bureaucrat and makes it come alive. I am buying copies for all of my friends so they can enjoy this book as well. Very insightful on human nature and the temptation to sin; gives you pause the next time you're arguing with your wife as to whether it's really you that wants to prolong the fight or someone else whispering in your ear."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"After at least a decade and several personal recommendations to read it each year, I finally got around to buying \\"The Screwtape Letters.\\" The initial emotion I experienced after reading its introduction was jealously as I could not help but wish that it was I, and not Lewis, who had such an ingenious idea. Once you discover the book's method, which is of a senior demon writing to his nephew with recommendations on how to steal souls, you'll be astounded at the wonderful complexity of the author's mind. His reverse theological technique provided ample opportunity to skewer many of the most powerful members of England's WWII society. What is most remarkable about the book is that it is even more applicable to our present day world than it was to the author's era. Moderate and touchy-feely churches are ubiquitous to our landscape and Screwtape undoubtedly would be most pleased with their constant empthasis on social issues rather than the Lord's Word. The book has tremendous meaning as it difficult to dismiss the possibility that the Devil influences our daily lives and the world around us. One cannot help but wonder if their are Screwtapes and Wormwoods in the air we breath who attempt, with subtle direction, to steer us away from productive activities and into the netherworld of souless entertainment."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"I've made a few attempts to read this book, but could never make it all the way through. When I heard that John Cleese made an audio version of it, I bought a copy immediately. Who could be a more perfect reader for this book? He read it in perfect character. One unavoidable problem is that there is so much thought provoking stuff packed into the lines of this book, that you frequently have to stop the tape to think about what you've heard, then go back and re-listen. But that's OK. I'm an atheist, but I find the book fascinating. It's a tremendous mental challenge to go through and figure out the subtle little logic twistings Lewis uses in his defense of Christianity. He actually seems to have condensed several behavioral psychology courses into the book. It actually deals mostly with origins of complacency in the face of beliefs that should strongly motivate a person. The book didn't persuade me, but I can see how it could easily fire up any nominal Christian who stumbled upon it. I would consider it one of the masterworks of the 20th century. In case you're wondering (since the Amazon.com description doesn't tell you), the unabridged tapes are a set of 3 tapes, with no written material at all. And yes, they do contain &quot;Screwtape Proposes a Toast.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"C.S. Lewis writes the ultimate Christian primer -- telling his readers how best to be faithful Christians by showing us how we should NOT behave! Screwtape, a high level denomic bureaucrat, is advising his neophyte demon nephew Wormwood on how to win over to &quot;Our Father Below&quot; his &quot;patient,&quot; a new Christian who must be wooed away from &quot;the Enemy,&quot; who is, of course, God. What makes this book so profound is that the temptations Screwtape suggests to Wormwood are not just the obvious ones, but the subtle ones that get to us everyday, sometimes under the guise of &quot;doing good.&quot; How many of us, for example, have gotten into arguments with a loved one over who was being more unselfish -- &quot;I don't want pepperoni on the pizza, but go ahead, have pepperoni, I don't mind.&quot; &quot;No, I insist. No pepperoni, even though I love it so much, because I know you hate it.&quot; &quot;No, please, have the pepperoni, darn it!&quot; And so the resentment builds. It is this sort of sin and temptation that Screwtape urges Wormwood to play upon his hapless &quot;patient.&quot;But Screwtape knows his &quot;enemy&quot; and he knows his limits. My favorite line, and one well worth hanging on to for all of us who feel we have lost hope: &quot;Do not be deceived, Wormwood. Our cause is never more in danger than when a human, no longer desiring, but still intending, to do our Enemy's will, looks round upon a universe from which every trace of Him seems to have vanished, and asks why he has been forsaken, and still obeys&quot; (p. 40). And never forget. The demons never deny the existence of either Father or Son."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"Through a creative twist of irony, C. S. Lewis illustrates the wiles of Satan's demons as they pursue the souls of human beings. Certainly versed enough to approach this subject using systematic Biblical exposition, the author rather chooses to present letters from a seasoned devil, Screwtape, to his nephew, Wormwood, an apprentice devil. This discourse is intended to raise an awareness among people of the evil influences, both purposeful and personal, that we are all exposed to. Lewis does a crafty job in a way that holds interest while at the same time allows for contemplation.One particular individual, Wormwood's \\"patient\\", is in focus as he is drawn to Christ and proceeds to grow in the grace and knowledge of Jesus as his Creator/Redeemer. Uncle Screwtape consistently hounds his nephew as he struggles with his formidable task of destroying his human assignment. Every situation described is from the perspective of evil. Lying is in vogue; guilt and fear are used extensively.It is good that this book is written as a collection of short letters. Several can be read at a sitting and then the topics can be pondered. It seemed best to read small sections at a time, because the perspective shift requires an extra measure of brainwork. Screwtape, bent on wickedness, refers to God as the enemy.Wormwood is fighting a losing battle, and it is encouraging as Lewis shows this. In his preface to the book he clarifies that Satan is not the opposite of God. God is eternal and all sufficient. Satan is a created angel, destined to serve God's purposes. Screwtape grows more frustrated as the plot progresses. When the \\"patient\\" meets a Christian girl and is also meeting more and more Christian friends, the uncle gets flat out mad and scolds Wormwood. Screwtape was patronizing Wormwood in the early letters. Towards the end he can hide his hatred no longer - \\"My dear Wormwood, you seem to be doing very little good at present.\\" (Do not forget the shift.)This book brought to mind many dumb things that I have done as a Christian. That can be a good thing, especially when followed with the reminder that God is in control and wants me to learn that He is drawing me to his side. Lewis' book has that effect, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"I enjoy a book for its combination of conciseness, clarity, and profound meaning -- \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" has this very enjoyable combination.An earlier post suggested that those under the age of 17 not read this marvelous book, and I'm supposing this certain someone says so with a good intention, just with not much thought. I am now 17, and when I first read this book I was sixteen.My suggestion, is, of course, quite different then: no one should be told not to read this book merely because of age, because wisdom has no preference of age. This wisdom that I speak of is not \\"worldy\\" wisdom, but heavenly; it comes from only the Good and Eternal Father, our Maker. Worldy wisdom is gained by experience neccesarily, yet heavenly wisdom is freely given by Him.\\"The Screwtape Letters\\" is filled with this heavenly wisdom, this profound meaning which I spoke of at the first. How? Because Lewis was (and is) a son of God; God blessed his heart, soul, and MIND. Each man --whether non-christian or \\"not of age\\" -- who reads this book will be possibly graced with this heavenly wisdom. My first tip then is: Do not feel yourself below or above this book, for it has wisdom even for the smallest and biggest of minds.Lewis accomplished in this book, a very strenuous task: he communicated heavenly wisdom through the view-point of a devil. It is astonishing to think some find this book funny, as suggested by some other reviewers; this book was written with much discipline and if that provokes some laughs, reconsider yourself. Lewis has communicated his thoughts in this book so well, he has poured out so much effort, that this book is not to be taken lightly. God and his creeds, viewed through the eyes of demons, is serious. My second tip is: Much is to be learned from this eloquent work; therefore, be an alert reader, and pray for God's guidance on this one.Ryan"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"One of this Oxford Don's best known works is this profound little book.

One is to disbelieve in their existence. The other is to believe, and to feel an excessive and unhealthy interest in them.

This is spritual classic unlike any other in the way it deals with temptation, evil, and demons. I've purchased several copies over the years, but everybody keeps borrowing them. I've learned to keep a copy or two on my self, just for loaning out. Usually they are loaned to teens who are beginning to grapple with the possibilty of personalized evil.It is not hard to recommend this book. An added bonus of interest is the dedication of the book.

Again and again the administrative devil Screwtape offers advises to his novice nephew Wormwood on how best to distract, trip-up, or out and out blind a patient (Lewis's term for the human victim of the devil's temptations). Each letter is a microscopic examination on a worldly weakness, or strength, that can be slowly twisted and, without the patient being truly aware of it, lead him off the path to salvation. Anybody on the Christian path will no doubt chuckle and relate to these temptations, easily seeing his or her self facing the problematic issues that Screwtape urges Wormwood to exploit. I find it hard to believe that this book's of examination of faith and belief and how human weakness can either undermine or strengthen both can be surpassed, either in fiction or non. An essential book."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"...except for a few minor theological points. As the reviews above discuss, this book is a compilation of hilarious letters between demons on how to lead a person, or &quot;patient,&quot; astray. Most of the letters provide good advice as to how to lead a good life.While the book is deeply routed in orthodox Christianity, anyone can enjoy most, if not all, of the lessons taught here. Some people may want to ignore the implications that evolution, the historical Jesus studies, paganism, state-controlled education, etc., are the ways of the Devil, but these are minor points, which do not get major airplay in the Letters.Finally, John Cleese's reading is absolutely inspired. His intonation and timing maximize the comedy. If you can, check out the audiobook. Enjoy"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"Although C.S. Lewis published &#65533;The Screwtape Letters&#65533; in 1942, its theme is every bit as appropriate today. A collection of correspondence from a veteran devil to an apprentice demon, the learned counsel for debasing virtue is all too commonplace in practice today.The corruption of language has been articulated by many social critics over the past decade to so, but Mr. Lewis referenced this nascent technique sixty years ago. The experienced devil, Screwtape, seems to be embracing modern day parlance when he brags about the word &#65533;Puritanism&#65533; taking on its pejorative status. &#65533;The value we have given to that word is one of the really solid triumphs of the last hundred years; by it we rescue annually thousands of humans from temperance, chastity and sobriety.&#65533;Today we often hear the cant that one religion is as good as another, and saying a certain religion is true will elicit terms like discrimatory or judgmental. While most churches advocate truth and righteousness, a lack of loyalty to one is not a positive development and Screwtape was knew this to be true. He waxed, &#65533;if a man can&#65533;t be cured of church, the next best thing is to send him all over the neighborhood looking for a church that suits him until he becomes a taster or connoisseur of churches.&#65533; He was especially fond of churches that change to meet current demand and praised a church where &#65533;the vicar is a man who has so long engaged in watering down the faith to make it easier for a supposedly incredulous and hard-headed congregation that it is now he who shocks his parishioners with his unbelief.&#65533;Often Mr. Lewis's healthy sense of humor is artfully displayed. An exasperated Screwtape writes desparigingly that one mortal is &#65533;not only a Christian such a Christian--a vile, sneaking, simpering, demure, monosyllabic, mouselike, watery, insignificant, virginal, bread-and-butter miss. The little brute, she makes me vomit.&#65533;Throughout the fantasy, a bounty of real advice is present. Simple tidbits such as Screwtape&#65533;s simple statement that &#65533;the safest road to hell is the gradual one&#65533; should serve as a tocsin for many readers. With wit, ingenuity, reverence, and jocularity, C.S. Lewis created a timeless classic to exhort the ages."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"INTRODUCTION:This was my introduction to C.S. Lewis, as the writer. I have watched the Disney [the Chronicles of] Narnia, but never made time for his famous books \\"Mere Christianity\\", \\"Surprised by Joy\\", \\"Reflections on the Psalms\\", \\"Space Trilogy\\" and \\"The Screwtape Letters.\\"I am glad this book has been my first introduction to C.S. Lewis. This book is a unique book because I have never heard of a book being written from the perspective of the bad spirits. At least not in the Christian books genre.AUTHOR:CONTENT:Basically the book is a compilation of short chapters (2-4 pages). Each chapter is a letter that Screwtape (name of the uncle) to Corkscrew (name of the nephew). Both Screwtape and Corkscrew work for the Devil (whom they call .... ) and his kingdom is called ..... Corkscrew's mission is to subvert the human who was assigned to his care. Screwtape's mission is to advise his nephew in how to better accomplish his mission, and in the end work against God's Kingdom, which they call -Here are some excerpts from this wonderfully psychological book:CONCLUSION:You will be surprised by this book, because the format and idea behind the plot is quite unique. In the 1961 edition by Collier Books there is the great introduction to the topic by C.S. Lewis, which is fascinating and informative in its own right (especially about the topic of \\"angels\\" throught western history). What I took away from this book, is that the evil one will try to subvert us at the mental level, to work at the anti-psychology of our soul. Knowing the strategies of the enemy, is half-way towards winning the battle. This earthly life is the battle field. But someone in the 1st century Palestine, had already won the battle for us, God's children. How wonderful, and what a way to thrive on this beautiful planet."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"I got this book for a friend around Christmas time and he'd read it in about a week after recieving it, despite being back in the thick of things at a busy job. So I figured it was good and borrowed it and quickly read every word, including the foreword, toast, preface all that.It's fascinating to only hear one side of a conversation, especially one that reads almost like a lecture from a parent. This parent however, would be an evil one trying to teach his child how to tempt a man away from Christ. Even if you aren't a Christian, this should give you a great insight into how Christian deals with concepts of temptation, compromise, struggles in life, etc. Because Lewis truly is an excellent writer, this is all done in a way that makes it fun to read and even funny at times, despite giving you an overwhelming sense that inevitably you'll fail in many ways...on the other hand \\"the Enemy\\" as Lewis's demon calls him is forgiving.It's a short book, but contains a lot of great social commentary on how people perceive each other, themselves, how the school system in the US is flawed, how war effects faith...all very meaty subjects all dealt with in short bursts. It gives you a lot to think about in a 4-5 page stint, but also vividly paints the picture so you can sort it out easier.Genius"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"A remarkably insightful and engaging description of the psychology of evil.

You can almost put together your own Screwtape letters in your own life after reading the letters that Screwtape writes to Wormwood.CS Lewis has an enjoyable writing style with any work that he writes... this in itself is worth the purchase of the book.

The book is really a series of letters between a senior devil and a junior devil which lends insight into how the devil deceives man. As a Christian, I found the book both a challenge to be watchful and alert and also a reassurance of the Lord's ultimate power over Satan.The book is an entertaining read as well, humorous in many part. A piece of literary genius and a great Christian devotional book. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"The atheist probably wouldn't fully appreciate this book. The target audience for this one, like the un-named man that Wormwood has been assigned, is the Christian who needs a booster shot.

This setting is used by Lewis to discuss many of the hurdles and sins that humans encounter in day-to-day life. Lewis has the rare skill of being able to effectively communicate theological ideas in an unassuming manner to the general reader. From my perspective this is one of Lewis' best pieces of religious fiction (the other being the Great Divorce).

If looks can be deceiving The Screwtape Letters packs a wallop.The Screwtape Letters is simplistic in thought with only a handful of characters. The amazing thing is the perspective in which it was written. The author poses a new concept in written form on how the devil and his demons come against a believer in Christ.

Lewis' THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS is surely one of the most brilliant and effective pieces of religio-literary propaganda which ever crawled out of a typewriter. In this thoughtful, wickedly comic, e'er so slightly horrifying story, Lewis makes the greatest negative case for becoming a Christian I've ever heard. I say \\"negative case\\" because this novel is far less an argument that you should love God as it is that you should fear the Devil - but I'm getting ahead of myself already. To the story...THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS is an epistolary novel - like DRACULA, it is written as a series of letters. What makes it different from most epistolary novels is that the guy writing the letters is in this case an arch-devil named Screwtape. Screwtape is a high mucky-muck in the bureacracy of Hell, and is counseling his neophyte nephew Wormwood on how best to corrupt a particular Englishman into the devil's dominion. Using this very clever format as his guise, Lewis makes a systematic and extremely effective attack on materialism, idolatry, moral apathy, atheism, shallow Christianity, and much of the popular political thought of the day be it Left or Right (the novel was written during World War II). Screwtape, an experienced fiend, explains to his bumbling relation the many ways a man can be turned away from God, and once turned, kept that way.The novel is written in a very highbrow style that betrays Lewis' very high level of scholarship (he was an Oxford don) as well as his theological training, but while it occasionally begins to sound too much like a lecture given to seminarians, it is riddled with brilliant little aphorisms and remarks that stick with the reader long after the book is finished, such as: \\"To get a man's soul and give him nothing in return - that is the devil's greatest pleasure.\\" Or, in explaining the philosophy of Hell (and of Nazism): \\"\`To be' means \`to be in competition.'\\" In addition, it is laced with a kind of wicked humor, such as when Screwtape becomes so agitated at his nephew's treachery that he turns into a gigantic centipede and has to have the rest of his letter written by a secretary. But what it mainly gets you to do is admire the way in which Lewis, a very devout and sincere Christian, managed to play a literal devil's advocate with such skill and daring. Taken literally, the book is actually a furious and well-reasoned attack on religious faith, and Lewis, like most theologians (or political idealogues) clearly knew every page of the \\"other side's\\" playbook. Indeed, Lewis admits in the afterward that it was so easy to write from the Satanic point of view that he became depressed. But he also manages to inflict depression on those who don't agree with him - his brief sketch about the dismay, surprise and horror that souls feel when they realize they have been duped by ideology, lust, greed, or just plain laziness into turning away from God, and are now doomed to end up as cows in the devil's slaughterhouse, is enough to make even the hardest-core atheist a bit uncomfortable.The book has its issues, not the least which is Lewis' deft but nevertheless noticable tap-dancing around some of more problematic aspects of his religion - for example, the idea that a loving God sees no difference between, say, a good-hearted and kindly unbeliever and a man like Stalin or Hitler. Indeed, Lewis seems as determined to frighten the reader with the wily power of \\"Our Father Down Below\\" (as Screwtape calls Satan) as he does to come up with reasons why people should love a God whose mantra seems to be, \\"Love me and obey me or I'll torture you forever.\\"I should close here by stating the obvious, i.e. that I am not a Christian. Nor was Orwell, who noted that THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS was \\"a flanking movement in the great counter-attack by religion against atheism.\\" As a rule I dislike religious tracts, but I also feel that it does a brain, body and soul good to hear things which run against one's own dearly-held beliefs. One of the most pernicious failings of our own era is the refusal to accept that someone who disagrees with you might nevertheless have something worthwhile to hear, and so I would especially recommend this novel to those of little (Christian) faith."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"Very well read and I am enjoying it over and over. So glad I bought this version.Couldn't imagine it being better. Great audio book!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"\\"The Bible\\" is by far my favorite book. \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\" is #2. Everything else is much farther down the totem pole. \\"Was\\" that is! Why I never read \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" beats me (maybe the name threw me?). Anyway, on a whim, I ordered a copy thru Amazon, and I have been entranced ever since. \\"The Screwtape letters\\" is now my #3 favorite book. Gives you an idea about Satan's tactics ... and also how WE ourselves are often our own worst enemy. A superb book in my opinion. And, by the way, Amazon can really save you some big money with their price comparisons AND their shipping charge comparisons too. Wish I had tried Amazon a long time ago!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"Whenever I review a book on a topic having to do with religion or politics, I always like to read the good and bad reviews. The bad reviews on this book are just amusing. This book is condemned as everything from sophmoric to \\"Christian brainwashing.\\" Anti-Christians exist just like anti-Semites and anti-Muslims and anti-Black and so forth.Anyway, the book is a pleasure to read. I suppose if you are hostile to open thought like many anti-Christians claim not to be, then you shouldn't read this if you aren't a Christian. C.S. Lewis never tried to hide his religion or his faith so how it comes as a surprise to some people that all of his books have a similar theme is beyond me.So the book is a series of letters written by the elder of two demons, Screwtape. In his letters he is writing to his nephew, Wormwood is out for the first time to bring about the spiritual ruin of his target, a young man.Through the letters, it is revealed the favorite tactics of the demon, such as creating a feeling of malaise and apathy in an individual so that they waste away time or fostering a resentment against family members.There is a continuing sense of humor in the letters as Screwtape becomes more and more annoyed by Wormwood's growing number of mistakes, such as allowing the man to remember to pray to God.The book delivers many messages, all of which are relevant today. One of the messages delivered is that spiritual ruin does not occur in one fell swoop but over time. The demons are patient and persistant. The fall from grace is gradual, much like any other form of corruption. I suppose these messages might not be accepted by some but what about the other messages, such as not giving in to apathy and by forgiving others, both of which are seen as counter-productive to the demons.For Christians, this is a wonderful book. Like much of his work, there is alot of allusion here. Does C.S. Lewis really believe that there is a department somewhere in Hell where demons do paperwork like some office building here on Earth? Or are the demons symbolic of our own internal struggle? Is it a demon that makes you lie or is it your own self giving in to your selfish desires? The book shows through the letters, how our internal struggles can turn us away from God over time.For non-Christians, well for those who aren't outright hostile towards this faith, this is a book that you can enjoy as well. So you may not believe in the Christian God or any god but that doesn't stop you from enjoying the Star Wars movies, now does it? There are still positive messages to be found in this book. Messages which can make all of us better people."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"Lewis' famed series of letters from high-ranking demon Screwtape to his novice nephew Wormwood might seem to be his most accessible Christian work, yet it is strangely off-putting initially. I think it may be that because Lewis writes so well on bright, joyful subjects, managing to be pious without seeming self-righteous or stuffy, it's somehow a disappointment to read him playing a diabolical and uncharitable character--however cleverly he may do it. In the short preface included for \\"Screwtape Proposes a Toast,\\" Lewis confirms this impression by noting that the writing was easy but not enjoyable: \\"Though I had never written anything more easily, I never wrote with less enjoyment. . . . [Although] it was easy to twist one's mind into the diabolical attitude, it was not fun, or not for long. The strain produced a sort of spiritual cramp\\" (183).That said, the book makes extremely good use of the device as it unfolds, providing Lewis with a platform to discuss the many chinks and weak spots in the spiritual armor of the new Christian without sounding paranoid or harassing. The story revolves around the efforts of an inexperienced tempter to assail the soul of a newly converted young man; in this enterprise he is advised by his uncle, who knows all the demonic tricks. Pride of one sort or another is especially worth encouraging, says Screwtape, even the pride of being a good Christian, as it leads to moral complacency, haughtiness, or flippancy about spiritual matters. Such \\"advice\\" can get old really fast if the writer takes himself too seriously, but of course Lewis is disarmingly humorous: in one especially funny scene Screwtape gets so mad at Wormwood he inadvertently transforms into a centipede.A quick read and a fun one, that also happens to be quite instructive.Included in the same book as The Screwtape Letters is the short follow-up, \\"Screwtape Proposes a Toast,\\" an especially fascinating speech given by the demon at a dinner of the \\"Tempters' Training College for young Devils.\\" Working from ideas in the larger work, those in attendance at this dinner are eating souls, and Screwtape is both regretful of the lack of really tasty sinners to feast on and full of hope and encouragement at the greater number of sinners finding their way to Hell. This opens a fascinating discussion of mediocrity and education. Here Lewis' predictions about the dangers of conformity and the undervaluing of individualism seem scarily accurate. Quite different in tone to the letters, yet still of a piece with them."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"This is only the second C.S.

Every aspect discussed is 100% applicable today."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"Lewis wrote this book with the serious intention of bringing souls to Christ. As an atheist myself, I find most of Lewis' serious works, such as \\"Mere Christianity\\" and \\"The Abolition of Man\\" to be frankly absurd and illogical. \\"Screwtape Letters,\\" however, is so funny that I recommend it even to non-Christians. Screwtape's single-minded wickedness is like all the greedy, cruel, and arrogant persons you have ever met, rolled up in a single Machiavellian package. Lewis does a fiendishly clever job bringing his devils to life and making sure their every word brings hellfire to mind.Many of the ethical points Lewis makes are applicable to anyone, Christian or not. I really like Lewis' back-handed reminder that when trying to do good in the world, it's just as important to be kind to the people you meet every day, as it is to save humanity. Lewis also emphasizes the role of simple pleasures in creating happiness, as well as the natural ebb and flow of pleasure in human life. This is great advice, and I wish more attention were paid to it in our economic and political arrangements.As I said before, \\"Screwtape Letters\\" is highly amusing and contains some good advice. Before taking the Christianity Lewis puts forward as overcoming these devils too seriously, though, I would strongly recommend reading other points of view. Christianity has a sad tendency to ignore the major problems of our times, such as overpopulation and exhaustion of resources, because they aren't mentioned in the Bible. I would suggest Kunstler's book \\"The Long Emergency\\" for more on this. For a defense of the naturalistic worldview, I would suggest Carl Sagan's \\"The Demon-Haunted World\\" or Taner Edis' \\"The Ghost in the Universe.\\" As a scientist, I think it is important not to simply dismiss religion as silly, but to give Christians their chance to convince me. If you're a Christian, are you willing to do the same for the other side?"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"Lewis' demon, Screwtape, uses this book to advise his nephew in the fine art of corrupting a man's soul. The advice is clear and detailed: turning healthy pleasures into vices, prohibiting clear and rational thought, encouraging divisiveness over any issue or none at all, and lots more. It's a proven plan which, unfortunately, sometimes fails. Despite every distraction, excess, and false trail, some people still reach a higher plane.This wonderful book is written from a strongly Christian point of view. No, Lewis does not propose any literal reality for these allegorical demons, but he clearly points out the human weaknesses that so often expand and crowd out the valid and valuable parts of life. In fact, this book need not be taken from a Christian standpoint at all. Whatever morality and ideals you hold to, they are under the same kind of attack as Lewis' Christian virtues.This book is quite enjoyable in itself. It's even better as an introduction to Lewis' other work, especially his space trilogy (Perelandra, Out of the Silent Planet, That Hideous Strength). Those books play out the human strengths and weaknesses that Lewis isolates here.This really will help thinking readers take stock of themselves. I know it points out my room for improvement. I recommend this very highly.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"The Screwtape Letters stands besides &quot;Mere Christianity,&quot; &quot;The Imitation of Christ&quot;, &quot;Confessions,&quot; &quot;City of God,&quot; and &quot;Orthodoxy&quot; as one of the most crucial pieces of reading material outside of scripture itself.Without getting too mystical; if you have an open mind, reading The Screwtape Letters is an experience, rather than an education.Do not hesitate.

This view is a polar opposite of ours - what is good to us is evil to him, and vice versa. He even refers to God as The Enemy... his goal is to aid his nephew in the \\"conversion\\" of a Christian male. As the book goes on, so does the man's faith, and as it begins to mature into a fuller form, the devils try to sabotage it at every turn. The book takes a unique look at how Christians try to live their lives. It peers inside the heart of the man, and details the great conflicts that go on in his, and all of our, hearts. It does this in a clever manner that will make you laugh, and even more importantly, think.

Lewis' wit is ever present in this volume too, and it's always a pleasure to read this excellent author. I truly believe he is a massive monument in intellectual history because of his theological writings.The Screwtape Letters are basically letters written by a demon named Screwtape - he is an old senior demon - writing to his nephew Wormwood, a young demon sent to earth to tempt a human (the \\"patient\\"). He gives him advice on how to tempt humans. That may sound simple, but you have no idea of how intricate the tempting is. Along the way, Screwtape makes some very fine points about our modern world and its current ideology.Much more than merely theological or Christian, this book possesses some really excellent psychological insights in human behaviour in groups and inner behaviour.It's a relatively short read and is a really good one; it happens to be quite some fun as well.

S. Lewis, the Screwtape Letters would be it. It's vibrant, exciting, colorful and very precise and clever in the points it makes.The book centers around two demons; the young, inexperienced Wormwood, and the elder demon named Screwtape, who writes him letters of advice and encouragement. These letters are much needed, as poor Wormwood keeps screwing up, and letting his human do things like become a Christian, make some new friends when his old ones become a bad influence, take a relaxing walk to clear his head so that he can think straight, etc... Why, there's a very real danger that Wormwood might even let this particular human make it to Heaven, if he's not careful.Every perspective in this book is cleverly inverted. Screwtape praises the ability to sew confusion in the mind of a human being, the use of tiny slogans instead of rational explanations, to convince people of a point, the use of the word \\"democracy\\" to discourage people from excelling and so forth. His advice to his young demon friend reveals, very cleverly, the things that we must avoid, and the kinds of traps we can easily fall into if we're not careful, as well as precisely how to stay on the right track for our lives, and all in a sort of backwards, underworld style of writing which, to be honest, I found very humorous; even largely tongue-in-cheek.Of course, we know that demons don't really come in \\"older\\" and \\"younger,\\" nor do they learn anything, and they don't really -devour- humans or one another. Their motives are pure spite. Still, those slight deviations from actual theology make the story more fun and easier to tell, and perhaps even better.The mini-sequel, also included in most editions, entitled \\"Screwtape Proposes a Toast\\" is just as good as the original book, though it does, of course, have a slightly different premise. The particularly excellent quotes and points made would simply take too long to outline. If you haven't read this book yet, check it out.

I have to admit that it took a little bit for me to get into the book but once I was about a quarter of the way through the book it defiantly kept my attention. Each letter is about three pages long which makes it easy to grab and read a letter if you only have a few minutes.There were many insights I found and some things that made me pause and think long and hard about, things that hit a little too close to home.The book is not too hard to read but remember it was written by Lewis and he was not an American living in 2012 so some of the words and sayings might not connect but the overall flavor of the book should have its impact on you.Well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"As in C.S.

Lewis conveys guidance on moral and spiritual improvement, engagingly and creatively packaged in the form of a series of letters from an \\"uncle\\" devil, senior in the bureaucracy of Hell, to his \\"nephew,\\" a junior devil charged with tempting a certain individual mortal soul. Uncle Screwtape offers nephew Wormwood fiendishly avuncular advice on how to lead the young man in question astray. Each letter discusses some human vice or flaw from the Devil's point of view (e.g. intellectual vanity, pride, hypocrisy and selfishness) in the context of the young man's daily life in England during the Blitz: living with his mother, joining a church, making new friends, falling in love, and enduring bombing raids.For me, this book was both enjoyable and uplifting. It reminded me, in a light but pointed fashion, that being good, and becoming better, demand constant vigilance, discipline and care. Lewis skewers neatly the petty vanities and cruelties that we can fall into -- using an impatient or unkind tone with one's mother; snickering at the dowdy outfit on the person in the next pew; feeling a little too self-satisfied about having the coolest laptop on the plane. If you are one of the many who strive for virtue, yet sometimes fall into sin, you can learn from this book, whether or not you have the faith that Christian doctrine generally posits as necessary for salvation.The device of having a devil explain morality in reverse creates amusing ironies, though eventually it gets tiring -- like trying to make out a photographic image by looking at the negative. Also tiring is that the main speaker is inhumanly unattractive (of course), and no appealing characters appear in the foreground at all. As a result, there is not enough dramatic tension or human warmth to carry the reader for very long, but that is not too much of a fault because the book is quite short. Substantively, I was disappointed in Lewis's dismissive attitude toward the question of an individual's responsibility with respect to larger social issues (was there an irony that I missed?). He handles this better in other works such as That Hideous Strength. In closing I would note a metaphysical question that stumped my book group: if humans go to heaven or hell when they die, and angels enjoy eternal life, where do dead devils go?For those who want to try more C.S. Lewis, I would recommend the Perelandra Trilogy, especially That Hideous Strength. Another unconventional and charming interpretation of Christian notions of right conduct that may interest those who enjoyed this book is Franny and Zooey by J.D.

Lewis's overt literary argument for Christianity. I thought I might find a Christian counterpoint to Twain's Letters from the Earth. I'm afraid I was somewhat disappointed.The Screwtape Letters is an epistolary novel with the central conceit being that C.S. Lewis has recovered letters of advice that a Demon from the depths -- Screwtape -- had written to one of his foot soldiers -- Wormwood -- whose job it was to stick by a mortal and suggest certain lines of thought to him and exaggerate certain emotions in key moments, leading him astray. We are only privy to Screwtape's letters, and it is through his criticism of his apprentice's efforts, and his advice, that the reader is to divine the mortal's story, the efforts of Wormwood, and the nature and methods of Evil and Good.But Screwtape is Evil, and thus his advice may not necessarily be intended to help his charge, and I think we are to take The Screwtape Letters as an investigation into the psychology of Evil as it reveals itself in the mischievous advice. The difficulty in knowing which advice is straightforward is illustrative of Lewis's epistemology, \\"A great human philosopher nearly let our secret out when he said that where Virtue is concerned \`Experience is the mother of illusion' ....\\" -- which is also a dig at the modernist concept of the untrustworthy author. In the final analysis there's not much you can do with liars outside of laugh at them. Hence, \\"A more modern writer -- someone with a name like Pshaw -- has, however, grasped the truth.\\"And Lewis obviously had a lot of Dickensian fun with his demons' names, \\"Toadpipe\\", \\"Triptweeze\\", \\"Glubose\\", \\"Slubgob\\" and \\"Slumtrimpet\\", and there are some pretty funny lines like \\"Only the learned read old books and we have now so dealt with the learned that they are of all men the least likely to acquire wisdom by doing so.\\" And \\"Do not let us be infected by our own propaganda.\\"There are also compelling lines like \\"Humans are amphibians -- half spirit and half animal.\\" and \\"For the present is the point at which time touches eternity.\\" But in my opinion, to be honest, the book is really not all that funny. It is interesting, very well written, and even describes a profound vision of human psychology. But it is not particularly funny. It is humorous, but not Catch 22, At Swim Two Birds or The Magic Christian belly laugh funny. You end up finding yourself quietly amused.I suppose we are warned, the two epigrams at the start of the book refer to scorn and contempt, not humor: \\"The best way to drive out the devil, if he will not yield to texts of Scripture, is to jeer and flout him, for he cannot bear scorn.\\" -- Luther. And \\"The devil .. the prowde spirite .. cannot endure to be mocked.\\" -- Thomas More. It all reminds me of St. Augustine's vision of the saved gloating over the torments of the damned. (St. Augustine also had some insights into the psychology of man.)In fact, in Screwtape Lewis suggests the best method with which to corrupt man is to make him feel like he is doing good, being Christian, when in reality he is only doing so to feed his own pride, his own vanity. Unfortunately, I think more Christians will feel the sting of this critique in Twain's Letters from the Earth than they will in Screwtape. I'm afraid that Lewis inadvertently helps the \\"saved\\" feel comfortable in their self-regard, which, of course, would be terribly ironic, but not terribly funny.This edition also includes Screwtape Proposes a Toast, which was initially an Op-Ed for the Saturday Evening Post attacking the leveling psychology of democracy, which Lewis sees as dangerous because it produces a type of person who \\"resents every kind of superiority in others; denigrates it; wishes its annihilation. Presently he suspects every mere difference of being a claim to superiority.\\" He considers this phenomena to be a banal version of envy, and predicts -- in the vein of Arendt -- a new mass of sinners who aren't of the great sinners variety, but damned by their lack of humility nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"The Screwtape Letters is an extremely humorous and clever exposition of the traditional theology of temptation. The concept of a correspondance between devils is not entirely new; Mark Twain wrote a satire just as clever (though from an opposite perspective) in his &quot;Letters from the Earth.&quot; But Lewis brings a certain malevolent charm to his demonic bureaucracy, a darkness of soul that contrasts with his insistence of the importance of everyday actions in making one's way to heavenly bliss.As always with Lewis, I think, this book is really about himself as much as anything. Like Augustine, he is amazed to find both a devil and an angel within himself. Lewis admitted that writing the book placed a great cramp in his spiritual life. Then there is that strange statement in the introduction in which Lewis reveals that he developed a sort of occult technique that assisted him in writing the book. Lewis testily states that people who want to obtain this writing technique from him for nefarious purposes will be unsuccessful. One might ask who those &quot;evil people&quot; who want to &quot;use&quot; a writing technique (!) might be. I have often thought that getting in touch with his own dark side created such anxiety for Lewis that in this statement he is simply projecting dark desires onto others. (The other alternative is that Lewis really believed he was channeling demonic energies when he wrote the book. Such an act of admitted consorting with the enemy would be surprising in a Christian writer, however.)Lewis was fascinated his whole life with the figure of the magician, the manipulator of others, the evil, resentful monster that he insisted lives within each of us. More than most of us, he seems to have been aware of both the dark and light sides of himself. This is one of the best books he wrote in which to explore the personal obsessions of a deeply passionate soul."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"I am going to go out on a limb and say that listening to John Cleese read Screwtape Letters is more enjoyable than reading it yourself. His continual insertion of pauses, snorts, intonations, etc. made Screwtape come completely alive as exactly the devil that was described in C.S. Lewis' wonderful book. Normally, I view audio books as a last ditch effort to keep myself awake when driving. This audio book is worth playing in your living room."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"I'm gonna keep this review short and sweet. The Screwtape Letters is one of the most chilling books I've ever read. Anyone who enjoys reading great thought provoking literature needs to add this book to their collection. Bravo C.S. Lewis"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"Witty, brief (no chapter more than four pages, the book easily read in an afternoon), timeless Truth presented with refreshing satire aimed where it should, C.S. Lewis' legendary \\"Screwtape Letters\\" is at once soul and brain food.Lewis tells his story through the title character, an experienced devil instructing his apprentice nephew to lure a young man to condemnation. The apprentice, Wormwood, tempts with everything from family (distancing prayers for the man's mother from behavior toward her) to social circle (flippant friends stray him from his new life, a new girlfriend moves him closer to it) to work and even worship.Lewis then flips God's love and law into effective, ironic Satanic reverses. He shows temptation most effective and deadly in its smallest doses: prayer posture, creation and consideration of an Historical Point of View (including an historical Jesus as opposed to One of faith). Lewis redefines gluttony, defends Puritanism, shows the misunderstanding of romantic feelings in love and sex, and misperception of the large ever-broken promise, \\"The Future.\\" (This book must be read if only to debunk one of Henry Ford's most famous quotes and the cliched, selfish phrase \\"impose on my time.\\")Lewis shows (and Screwtape plants) the landmines of an early Christian walk: the role of a Church, of humor and the temptation inherent in its roots, Christian truth made trivial and a commodity beside social causes. He even dissects everyday, mundane pleasures (books, walks, music, wine, dated references to cigarettes) for their own sake and not as means to follow an ever more mediocre crowd.Lewis' final Screwtape letter is his most moving. Sarcasm joins sanctification as we learn target's and tempter's final fate. It ties to themes present throughout Lewis' letters and providing fodder for his conjoined, equally humorous essay, Screwtape Proposes A Toast: \\"The safest road to Hell is the gradual one...without milestones, without signposts...\\" This absolutely essential book is just such signpost; \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" is joyful, instructional, fun reading for anyone wishing to know what forces fight for the human soul."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"I remember one of the opening lines to Stephen King's &quot;The Stand&quot;: This is how the world ends, not with an explosion, but a whisper. C.S. Lewis was exploring a similar theme a generation before that.The simple plot: Screwtape, a demon, writes letters to his nephew, who is in charge of getting a man to fall from morality and trust in God. But the plot goes much, much deeper...A real lesson you should take from the book is that damnation doesn't come all at once. Screwtape even says to his nephew that the best road to hell is a gradual, gently sloping one.The book really opened my eyes on how I live my life. Even the smallest things I do in this world have consequence in the next. The book may not cause earth-shaking changes in your life, but reading this book definitely will make you think. And any book that does that is worth 1,000 times the cover price.An interesting addition to this (and several other) version is a story Lewis wrote for the New Yorker more than a decade after &quot;Screwtape&quot; was first published. It serves as a wonderful epilouge to the tale, and I can only imagine the thrill of people who devoured the book when it first came out and then had to wait literally YEARS before they could get another small taste."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"I checked out the audio cassette version from my public library. Wow! That's the simplest way to put it. I can't think of anyone who could have read this better. John Cleese has the perfect voice to play the cynical, yet comical, devil Screwtape. He puts himself full throttle into this roll and it's a joy to listen to."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"Enjoyable recording and a reasonable value. The novel presentation of spiritual warfare through this perspective allows one to reflect on life's choices and their potential consequences. It reminds me of the concept that lies do not come in colors and all sins lead in the same direction."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"My book club chose this book and while we all found it insightful we also found it difficult to read in a typical novel fashion. Whether you're religious or not C.S. Lewis has an interesting grasp of human behavior and expresses his thoughts in a series of letters from a demon (Screwtape) to his student. (Screwtape's goal is to help the student control his human and turn him away from God.) Lewis packs a lot into each letter and because there is no traditional plot, reading more than one or two letters at a time can be mind numbing. My book club agreed that a better way to read this book would have been to read it during the course of a year; absorbing one or two letters at a time and disussing them along with our book of the month. Worth reading and discussing...slowly."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"Lewis is, as any Narnia fan knows, an imaginative writer. That imagination is on display in The Screwtape Letters. The basic premise of the book is that this is a correspondence between a demon, who is a sort of \\"supervisor\\" in Hell's kingdom, and his idiot nephew Screwtape. Thus, the theological and factual perspective is backward from the intention... what Christians think of as \\"good and desirable\\" is hated by the demons, and what Christians think of as \\"abhorent\\" is lauded. So, it's a bit of a challenging read as one has to \\"translate\\" the storyline \\"right-side-up\\". In addition, as Lewis is British and the book reflects WWII realities, the present-day references in the book are a bit odd for today's American. But within the text is the anatomy of temptation, a picture of the realistic struggles of a new Christian, and a wide ranging commentary on the perspective of the World vs. the Believer. Not for novices, but still a stimulating and thought provoking read."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"I don't often read Christian literature, but after completing the Screwtape Letters, I may have to change that. I was entertained through the book, while also learning more about morality and life in general. The story is told through the correspondence of a veteran tempter of Hell to that of a young devil at the start of his career. For anyone who has worked in a bureaucracy before, they will have a good chuckle at Lewis' depiction of Hades as a bureaucratic organization.Beneath the surface humor of the Screwtape Letters lie the steps for a good Christian life. Since the reader presumably wants to avoid Wormwood and his kin, he learns by opposites in this book. Callousness and disabused cynicism are portrayed as friendly tools of the devil - it is not hard to guess why Lewis thought that. When people think there is no life but this one, they react in different ways. Some become Nietzsche's \`Last men' - boorish and vapid. Others become serial killers that, no longer afraid of eternal damnation, think they can beat the rap. Few people rape and murder with thoughts of their capture, after all. And then there are the Columbines of the world. When you think the world is only what you can touch and see, it tends to have a somewhat flattening effect. Believe me - I've learned that personally. Lewis' greatest accomplishment is that he reminds us of that numbness.All in all, the Screwtape Letters are pleasant mix of philosophy and literature - a rare achievement. I would highly recommend the appendix (and I don't normally read appendixes). Screwtape's toast reflects a problem of the modern world that has been commented on from Tocqueville to Nietzsche to Vonnegut. That problem can be summed up briefly: \\"You're no better than me.\\" The very words drip with indignity, no? Ironically, that attitude is useful in the destruction of democracy. If all are good as the other then all are also equally bad. Democracy becomes mob rule, and as Tocqueville said, 'There is nothing so miserable as democracy without liberty'. In 2006, the immediate threat to liberty isn't the Patriot Act, but being chained to the lowest common denominator."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"I have read this book several times over the years and each time I've been really blessed. It really opened my eyes to the constant Spiritual warfare going on in the world. As a Christian, it really gave me an insight into ways that the enemy attempts to discourage or confuse Christians and pull them away from the Lord."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"No matter how many times I read this book I get a fresh insight into human spirituality. It's one of those slim little books that one can read in a flash, over and over. However, after the first reading I found that all subsequent readings had me dwelling over single paragraphs or even sentences, thinking of my own life as a &quot;patient&quot;! A must read for people of all creeds and none. A work of outstanding insight into the human spirit."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"I first read The Screwtape Letters at the age of 15, and two years later I've read the book countless times and continue to find deeper meaning in each reading. Lewis expertly reveals the devices used to tempt the unsuspecting human; and I'm sure I'm not the only one who realizes several more of their own blunders every time they pick up the book. The traps of temptation are laid bare as Lewis ruthlessly exposes the suble art of manipulation.This book is highly philosophical, so don't pick it up when you're looking for some escape fiction. While some complain that the book lacks \\"excitment,\\" I hold that you cannot blame a philosophical book for being just that: philosophical. All the excitement needed is in the intellectual stimulation and in the wealth of knowledge provided by this book. The seriousness of this subject is artfully highlighted with Lewis's characteristic wit and humor. This is a refreshing touch to the deep and somewhat disturbing questions Lewis dares to answer. If nothing else, The Screwtape Letters will force you to truthfully examine yourself. I highly reccomend this book anyone seeking Christian literature or philosophy. It is well worth the time you take to read it."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"This was a wonderful book by C.S. Lewis giving an insight to what it must be like to work for the prince of darkness.In this masterpiece you are reading letters from a devil named Screwtape to his nephew Wormwood who is rather young and inexperienced at the whole game of tempting and leading ones sould to hell. Screwtape tries to teach Wormwood some of the most effective ways to tempt a person but it also seems that he is leading the young villan astray.These are letters of hypocricy and deciet and quite frankly letters that will make you step back and evaluate your own life. I would highly recommend this to anyone whether you are looking for a mere story to read or if you are looking for deep insight as to ways you can better yourself."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"One of the best, and most influential, Christian authors of any time, C. S. Lewis's &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; is a compelling, and chilling, fictional look at what goes on behind our back in the demonic spirit world.Screwtape, an upper level demonic spirit, often writes his subordinate, Wormwood, a demonic spirit assigned to misguide and misdirect a human on earth. The letters explain to Wormwood how he would best accomplish his mission of keeping the human our of the Enemy's (God's) hands and ensure that when he dies he goes straight to blazes.What is most chilling about &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; is that, even after all of these years, how much a person can see of themselves in them. Letter after letter seemed to be talking about me directly. Time and time again I saw one demonic trap after another I had fallen into being explained in a letter.I have to caution you, however. This book is not an easy read. C. S. Lewis did not attempt to write a book that everybody could understand. You will probably have to spend some time re-reading many letters and looking up words in your dictionary and/or concordance for a better understanding of what is being said. This can become quite frustrating, but when you are able to break through and understand a letter you will be able to see how it can apply to your own life.If you were ever interested in getting a better understanding of how the Enemy and his demonic spirits work, this is a great book to do it with. But be warned: you will learn something about yourself in the process."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"This is the BEST place to start reading Lewis. If you enjoy the philosophy, you can move to Mere Christianity or A Grief Observed. If you enjoy the presentation you may try The Great Divorce, Space Trilogy (Out of the Silent Planet, Perelandrea, That Hideous Strength) or Narnia.The book is short, innovative. When read together it forms a short story but each letter can be read on its own. I like to pick it up from time to time and read a random letter or two.I read each letter twice when I first read it. First so I could understand the letter and a second time to meditate on what was said. It is not terribly hard to understand--there is just so much to think about in each letter..."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"I have read The Screwtape Letters probably a dozen times. I was very excited to find John Cleese doing an audio tape of the book - having listened to too many Monty Python records (I said records! not CDs!!) The combination is exciting and excellent.Mr. Cleese really gets into the character of Screwtape, a senior devil, as he attempts to educate and train his &quot;nephew&quot;, a junior devil. His nuances and inflections lend a force to the writings. At times angry, surprised, and at others comtemplative, he brings a very good book further to life. Having read the book a number of times, he does my favorite passages very well."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"I admit to having bought this cassette originally only on the strength of John Cleese's reading these letters fron a Senior Devil to his less-than-successful nephew, but once I started listening I didn't want to stop! C.S. Lewis (the celebrated author of the NARNIA series) wrote a searing and scathing work, but it's taken John Cleese's inimitable vocal genuis to bring these letters to life! His marvelous vocal nuances keep a grin on the listener's face throughout the whole six cassette sides (the Unabridged edition also includes the excellently done \\"Screwtape Proposes a Toast\\" on Side 6), and the two letters in which Screwtape actually loses both his temper with his nephew and his self-control (Letter #22) and the final letter (Letter #31) in which Screwtape's own hidden despair at the thought of not only losing the patient to the Enemy but also the thought of a world where he (Screwtape) longs for deep inside but can never be a part of (even though he'd never admit it, especially not to his failure of a nephew!) can be heard are works of genuis on the part of Mr. Cleese! It doesn't matter what religion you are; these cassettes will make any denomination laugh the Devil to scorn!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"Am laughing so hard now, I wasn't planning to write a review on this book, just wanted to see if others enjoyed it as much as I did, and HA! the reactions to the newer reviews just validate the truth behind the premise of the book, Christians truly are the object of attack by a real Satan and his minions: specifically, the reviews below are right-on in explaining the book, yet I noticed they were accompanied by \\"0 of 1 found the following review helpful,\\" which indicates to me the activity not just of a nonChristian, but what I call an 'antiChristian,' one who unable to steal a Christian's secure salvation, actively tries to stop his impact, to take-out or defeat the Christian from victory in the Christian life, from influencing others for God--as if clicking \\"unhelpful\\" will discourage a Christian, when it only encourages them that they're not AWOL from the spiritual battle, that truly the praise of men matters less than sharing the good news of Christ. This stumbling stone of discouragement is just one of the tactics exposed in 'Screwtape Letters' thru the format of a one-on-one demonic discipleship correspondence. Reading 'Screwtape' is a fun way for the Christian to stay alert, if not warned for the first time, to the various schemes the devil will use to oppose his effectiveness."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"With a smart \\"reverse psychology\\" slant, C.S. Lewis crafted a true classic in this one. The book, comprised of individual essays in the forms of letters from a demon to his \\"trainee,\\" shows you very powerfully how Satan is at work among us. Though it was written decades ago, its parallels with modern daily life are indispensable."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"If I were a demon (and for all you know, I may very well be), I would give the Screwtape Letters five stars because it certainly is an excellent little guide to working on human &quot;patients.&quot; We demons should have a good working knowledge of our patients weaknesses if we are to have our way with them and get to devour them in the end. Yes, if I were a demon, I would say &quot;Thank you Screwtape for enlightening, er, I mean endarkening us all.&quot; BUT I am not a demon-- yet I still give it five stars. As a Christian, I can see some of my own weaknesses in wormwood's patient. Also, I see how I have been manipulated myself at times. By understanding a little more about the operation of the enemy, I know better how to fight against his attacks. Not only that, I enjoyed &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; because Lewis wrote them with much wit and humor. If you like the Screwtape letters be sure to read &quot;Castle of Wisdom&quot; which I highly (and I do mean HIGHLY) recommend."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"CS Lewis' masterpiece of contra-counter-Christian fiction as performed by John Cleese. A master work by any standard. The text itself is a well known work of moral philosophy, but the Cleese performance (despite a faltering effort with the very difficult ideas expressed at the beginning of side 2 on the tape) elevates this to a supreme work of both art and intellect.

For an intellectual and a visceral experience get the tape."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"Interestingly enough, this is one of Lewis's more popular books, yet it was the only one he did not enjoy composing. Constantly making wrong look right, good look bad, and turning things &quot;upside down&quot; eventually grew wearisome for the author. Fortunately, none of that weariness shows through in this penetrating and often humorous look at human nature. Short chapters (letters) make this book easy to read, too.

It pushes the envelope on what most people think about Christianity. This book seems to show both sides Christianity. On one hand it shows devilish aspects and on the other hand it shows the power of god. It also shows the role we play in the plans of the world.The book is based on a young demon recruiter named wormwood that is learning how to recruit human on earth for the devil. Throughout the whole book he communicates with his uncle Screwtape that tells him how to predict what he should do to make sure his \\"patient\\" does the right thing to go to hell.I think this book is a book that must be read because it helps you better understand everyday temptations. It explains all problems of life, from fusses with parents to relationships with the opposite sex. That alone makes it a classic hand book to christen and maybe other religions. I truly recommend this book to any person. I say any person because this book works on many levels. Every statement has purpose. The shallow parts lead into the deeper parts of the book, so you can actually understand what you are reading. The picture the author paints for you is so vivid and vibrant that you have reason to say this book is boring or to hard to read. Having that quality in a book make it a universal treasure that should be seen, touched and heard all around the world.

I've read some of the Narnia series as well as _Mere Christianity_ by Lewis and I knew the basic gist of Screwtape, but still wasn't 100% sure what was in store for me.The book is a series of letters written by the demon Screwtape to his nephew Wormwood. Both are demons of Hell and the letters are discussions of the practices used to tempt humans and lead them down to Hell rather than letting them make it to Heaven. Wormwood is a junior demon working on tempting a human man in 'contemporary' (to Lewis...~1940s) London. Screwtape is a senior demon no longer doing field work but now in a higher administrative role and full of good advice for the young Wormwood.The book is often humorous as you read about the follies of humans from the point of view of these immortal and immoral tempters. The humorous anecdotes are also subtly invasive as you realize just how true to life these comments are.Screwtape advises Wormwood to take advantage of the foibles of human nature to lead the man down the path to Hell while all the while letting him believe he's on his way to Heaven. The subversive realities these demons try to persuade the human to believe are strangely familiar to the social norms of the world in which we live.Screwtape admonishes that, unless the man is truly vile, Wormwood shouldn't try to push him away from religion but rather let him get puffed up in his religion to the point of self-exhaltation based on his own interpretations. The demons are wary of the truly penitent but are grateful for the many who go through the motions of religion for perception only.There are many good lessons to be learned through the book. Many poignant passages softly chastising humble pride, valueless bravery, hopeless nostalgic dreamers and others.It's a great satire on the state of the world.What was most sad and scary to me is that ~50-60 years later, not much has changed. The same subtle lies are being whispered through the world and countless humans (myself included at times) are believing them and gently paving our own way to Hell.Two other things I found very interesting in this book:1. This edition included a short epilogue from C. S. Lewis. In it, he discusses the difficulty of writing from the point of view of a devil. He wrote of the darkness he felt in trying to shed all semblance of goodness in order to portray such a viewpoint. Perhaps one of my favorite themes in the book was that of Screwtape trying to understand \\"God's Love.\\" He just couldn't believe that God truly loves us and that it is that Love that is at the heart of his motivations. I think Lewis truly threw himself into the role of Screwtape and did a great job embodying the demon. I don't envy him that difficult task.2. This edition also included Lewis' one follow up to the Letters. It was a short work called \\"Screwtape Proposes a Toast\\" and the setting is a graduation commencement for novice demons just out of training and ready for assignments. Screwtape is giving the commencement speech and toast. His language and themes were again very relevant and honest satires on the world we live in. A few paragraphs really caught my attention...He talked about the education system of humans and ways they (the demons) might undermine it. He talked of standardized testing and lowering the scale to the least common factor such that the most inept student could succeed (only with that bare minimum) while the average and excellent students will leave school with no educational increase. He talked about undermining the true study and learning by replacing it with rote memorization of facts and figures to the point that any ability to truly think would be diminished and thus humans would not be able to see through the flimsy temptations. Sadly, a lot of the language in this section sounded far too similar to the No Child Left Behind legislation and other similar practices in the school system today. How sadly prophetic Lewis was on this front.I'd be interested to find some analysis of it that helps break out different letters into their themes...maybe I'll work on one. Something that could be used to pull out passages about some of the different temptations: Love/Romance/Sex, Religion, Pride, Nature, etc.Overall, I really enjoyed this novel. There were a few sections that really seemed to drag on but generally it was a lot of fun to read and it left me in a state of deep thinking afterwards. Give it a try.****4 stars"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"Read this book for entertainment, great writing, its original premise, or whatever, and you won't be disappointed.

Lewis sets out to tale the story of two demons attempting to keep a man from finding and keeping faith in Christ. Such a premise could easily have turned into a silly and not particullary interesting book. However, Lewis actually does a fantastic execution of his preimse. It held my interest. Lewis tales the story through letters written between the villians and weaves in some interesting commentaries on friendship, spiritual growth, and even the Second World War (I believe the book was finished in about 1941 or so though the particular edition I read had some later material as well). The writing is good and fans of Lewis will probably enjoy this work greatly. Overall, a fine book that I was glad I took the time to read."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"I love C.S.

It touched my very soul as very few other books have done. Especially in today's society, guidance, with a touch of humor, is necessary in order to cope. For the young, Screwtape will help you to begin your live with the Lord. For those of us who are more \\"seasoned\\", it will carry you along in your journey and bring you closer to the goal we all have.Along with this there is a wonderful companion book which I can't recommend highly enough.

I would recommend reading both, in conjunction with each other, as you will benefit from hearing \\"both sides\\" of the battle for our souls.The Michael Letters: Heaven's answer to Screwtape"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"I am not a Christian or religious but I can definitely appreciate good writing and a clever way of preaching by C.S. Lewis - and no doubt whichever demons are working on damning me just did a high five knowing I enjoyed this based mainly on its entertainment value.Via a series of letters written in the voice of Screwtape, a senior demon mentoring his nephew who has been assigned as the lifelong \\"tempter\\" of a certain human, Lewis is able to convey ideas on diverse spiritual topics including the reason why God (who Screwtape calls \\"the enemy\\") allows wars and disasters to occur, the proper and false forms of humility and self-sacrifice, and - a big theme spelled out repeatedly - the idea that most people don't lose their souls by committing atrocities but through a gradual series of subtler transgressions that numb them to their sin even as they continue to see themselves as good Christians all the way down \\"the slippery slope\\".I also enjoyed the way John Cleese reads the audio book - often with overtones of patience but with increasingly frequent reminders of Screwtape's demonic nature as Wormwood stumbles in the battle for the human's soul. As that occurs, the story part of the book starts becoming as compelling as the idea part, but it's unapologetically polemical fiction all the way through. I didn't mind, though - I really enjoyed the material and Cleese's interpretation of it. Somehow I didn't get into Screwtape Proposes a Toast (the very short \\"sequel\\" also included in the audio book) the same way. I put sequel in quotes cuz it felt more like an essay critiquing the way democracy was practiced in England at the time of writing than a continuation of the previous story or even its themes.Speaking of sequels and such, I saw a link in the comments of another review about the people who made the Narnia movies having bought the movie rights for Screwtape. It definitely benefits from being acted out - I saw one or two reviewers of the print version who said they struggled with the writing style but with the way John Cleese read it I did not feel that way at all. But I'm thinking they'd need to take liberties with the story to avoid a movie version becoming too talky. I agree that the idea of a battle for a human soul seen from the demon's point of view is a great idea for a movie but it'd be interesting to see how they manage to show the beliefs Lewis was focused on conveying without Screwtape just doing a voice over throughout the movie."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"The Screwtape Letters primarily covers Lewis' theology of virtue. The dark, wry humor in Screwtape's letters to his nephew Wormwood works well as a framing device for what is largely a series of essays on temptation and virtue. There's no real plot as such and Wormwood's target is never more than a cipher, as Screwtape would hardly have cared, but doing otherwise - perhaps with letters from Wormwood as well - would have been a different book. This one works remarkably well, funny and thoughtful.It is flawed, though; Lewis dismisses some things too carelessly when they conflict with his own thoughts. A bit more ambiguity from Screwtape would have suited the work, particularly when he treads outside of the central conceits of the book. Screwtape Proposes a Toast, included at the end of the book, suffers from this particularly; showing a broader aim rather than the temptation of a single person, it veers into the political. Screwtape's musings work more effectively in other matters, though they remain entertaining to the end."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"Starting the preparation for studying abroad, I began to read \\"The CHRONICLES of NARNIA,\\" written by C. S. Lewis. It is more interesting than \\"Harry Potter\\" - the world bestseller. I was fascinated to C. S. Lewis, so I called last August the month of reading C. S. Lewis. I finished reading \\"The Screwtape Letters\\", one of his famous novels.This book is full of interest, wit, and seriousness. A magazine said, \\"The point about reading C. S. Lewis is that he makes you sure, whatever you believe, that religion accepted or rejected means something extremely serious, demanding entire energy of mind. I totally agree with this. Also, it has many witty sentences about Christianity, human being, and death.My point about reading this novel is that it makes me discover and understand the mistakes and illusion that I have. The most impressed sentence is this: \\"Despair is a greater sin than any of the sins which provoke it.\\" These day I have the trouble in preparing to go abroad. I feel l am alone and in a despair. Sometimes my feeling justified escaping my duties. Moreover, my behaviour make me sad. It was I that was in a bed while saying \\"Somebody kill me please.\\" However I know, but I don't fell as I know. After reading the evil's letters, I believe that my despair is a sin. Although studying abroad is one of the most worried issue, I have never prayed for it. From now on, I will pray for it whether I am in a despair or not.Reading this valuable book takes a month. Despite forgetting many things that I read a long ago, I memorize much in my heart. The impression keeps me going on the next book, \\"The Weight of Glory.\\""},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"This book jumped into my top 10 favourite books of all time, which shouldn't have surprised me as I had already realized that Lewis was bound to be a big influence on my thought... but artistically and intellectually, this book entertained me like few others I have read.Past the brilliance of the original idea (I call it 'reverse theology', reverse in the sense of reverse psychology), its strengths lie in C.S. Lewis' astoundingly insightful analysis of how the devil tries to trip us up. A recurrent theme is the need for a demon to keep his human target hazy - reacting to or embracing terms and ideas without carefully considering them, living on the surface. Lewis does the reader a great service - we learn from Screwtape how to be better, more thorough, thinkers. And the psychological and ethical insights go far beyond this one example.I recommend this book to all and I have a suggestion for getting the most out of it: take it letter by letter. Read a chapter and go about your daily business, letting the thoughts sparked by the chapter grow and develop. I sometimes did this, other times I was too addicted and kept reading, but I find the latter method sometimes made me stay too much on the surface - letting go of the trains of thought great sentences or phrases might have taken me on.I actually had the idea of writing a book called \\"The Screwtape Ideas: A Letter-by-Letter Look at C.S. Lewis' Classic\\"... with exploration of the theological, philosophical, socio-political, historical, and artistic issues raised by the book, in content and in form. I found out here at amazon.com there's already a study guide written, so I guess if I actually did this I would need to be very original. Anyway, at some point, I must own the John Cleese book-on-tape version The Screwtape Letters, I'm sure it's delightful."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"Though C.S. Lewis himself said he disliked writing this book, I enjoyed reading it more than almost any other book by him or anyone else. It's an incredibly funny book about a deadly serious topic. The letters are laced with moral implications and incredible humor. Even for a non-christian, this is a truly funny book. The constant references to \\"Our father down below\\" was funny, and the one letter where Screwtape gets so angry he accidently transforms himself into a millipede is alone worth the price of the book! Please, purchase this book."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"I have nothing but the highest praise for Screwtape Letters. The first time I read it, I got about a third of the way through before deciding that I needed to start over so that I could take good notes. I've probably given away 6 or 7 copies of this book in the past month or two."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"The basic principle of this book is that it is written by a senior devil, Screwtape, to his nephew, a &quot;junior tempter.&quot; Just the idea that there is a devil specially assigned to tempt each of us to hell is motivating, but there is so much to learn from this slim little book!This is one of my spiritual &quot;mainstays&quot; -- that book I keep returning to or keep quoting. Lewis addresses many of the following (most of which I have never heard mentioned elsewhere): annoying relatives, &quot;sophisticated&quot; friends who look down on Christianity, bravery, folks who may not look like much but may be people of great faith. (As Screwtape writes, &quot;They may be great warriors for the enemy, but the patient only sees the neighborhood grocer.&quot; That's a paraphrase, by the way!)The writing is very clear and not too dense, for those who are just beginning their journey with spiritual reading. At the same time, &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; has a lot to offer those who are more advanced. You'll definitely keep coming back to this one."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"The wonderful thing about C.S. Lewis was that he put an amazing amount of thought into his faith. He understood better than most that becoming a Christian meant constantly trying to understand more, to examine both one's self and one's relationship to God. His penetrating intellegence towards Christianity is something that is often lacking in religion, and every time I read Lewis I learn something new, both about myself and my faith. Lewis is a true master. Another author who I'd highly recomend to anyone who enjoys Lewis, one who explores the Christian faith as brilliantly as Lewis, is Brian Caldwell. His novel, We All Fall Down is breathtaking. I'd put him on a par with Lewis, both for writing ability and theological brilliance. His novel is one of the few Christian masterpieces. Both Lewis and Caldwell should be read by those who have discovered God and want to explore that faith as deeply as possible, and perhaps more importantly, by those who have not."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"I first read this book maybe 30 years ago. While its truths have probably helped me understand life better, it wasn't my favorite of Lewis' books. Maybe I felt some of the same ambiguity Lewis himself expressed about thinking from the perspective of the devil -- maybe I overdosed on Marx in college.A few months ago, though, I found the Screwtape tape in a local library. I don't know how much a compliment it is to say John Cleese makes a great devil, but he really does. He brings Lewis' brilliant insights to life all over again.Screwtape is not a detailed philosophical argument. As Lewis says, a non-Christian can read the book with profit if he takes premise as an entirely literary device. One reviewer complains that he does not understand why God wants us to pray if he already knows what we think. Lewis actually answers this objection in Mere Christianity. A recent reviewer claims that Lewis makes \\"intellectual inquiry\\" out to be a sin, and that no one with a college education will find this worthwhile. That's silly. Taking his ideas with me to college, graduate school, and professional study of world religions, the \\"Jesus Seminar,\\" and skepticism, I found his works the best possible preparation for understanding the most prestigious currents of modern human thought.Lewis does not \\"prove\\" Christianity in this book; that is not his purpose. But neither does he \\"take it as a matter of (blind) faith.\\" Lewis understood that Christian faith rests on reason, and gives reasons in other books; but what he does here, brilliantly, is reveal how devious not the devil, but we humans can be, giving a comic and deeply enlightening tour of the many subtle ways we rationalize, are lazy, hate, and deceive ourselves. Of Lewis' books, Great Divorce and Till We Have Faces probably come closest as docudramas of ground zero in the human soul.Those who enjoy Screwtape Letters should read J. Budziszewski's What We Can't Not Know. His arguments on natural law may even surpass Lewis in content, if not style."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"One of the greatest minds of the 20th Century exposes the greatest Evil of all time. \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" is C.

Letter by letter, point by point, as Lewis pens the imagined correspondence between these two demons, you feel as if Lewis has stepped inside your soul and listened to the secret musings of your mind.How? How did Lewis gain access to the process of spiritual seduction? The same way the great saints of old did--through knowing God, knowing self, and knowing Scripture. This trilogy of epistemological awareness is essential for understanding the schemes of Satan.

Lewis, The Screwtape Letters was both \\"easy and distasteful\\" to write. The Screwtape Letters is a collection of letters written by Screwtape (a senior demon) to his nephew Wormwood (a junior demon). The letters chronicle Screwtape's advice in how to seduce the patient (the individual that Wormwood is assigned) to \\"the Father Below\\" (the Devil) for eternal damnation. The correspondence is exclusively from Screwtape to Wormwood, and it gives the reader a \`fly on the wall' view of the tricks that are employed to eternally win the patient's soul. The story starts off with the patient giving his life to \`the Enemy' (God) and the subsequent letters deal with ensuring damnation for the patient. Through the series of letters, Screwtape uses a variety of ways to secure the patient - sex, alcohol, war, religion among others to win the patient's soul. While the author does not divulge on how he \`stumbled' onto the letters, the author C.S. Lewis makes it clear in the preface that the letters do provide insight into the Devil's workings.The Screwtape Letters is perhaps one of the most thought-provoking novels that I have ever read. The author's use of the epistolary novel (a literary technique in which a novel is composed as a series of letters, though diary entries, newspaper clippings and other documents) provides the reader with a difficult chore of trying to figure out what is going on. The letters do not have any date, and while reading there is noticeably times when letters are not in chronological order (the author does acknowledge this) which makes it difficult to follow. Nevertheless, I believe that C.S. Lewis did a wonderful job in getting the purpose of the book out, the deception of the Devil.The author extended his purpose throughout the letters with a dialogue that is very easy to read and surprisingly fresh. As one reads it is obvious that the letters took place in the early 1940's. The way Screwtape speaks to Wormwood provides the reader with a lesson in \`securing Damnation'. In every letter Screwtape responds (you assume because we never see Wormwood's letters) to Wormwood's updates about the patient. Screwtape's replies are usually very structured, a full of information to support his arguments. For example, Wormwood is dismayed by the patient's decision to join a church, but Screwtape provides instructions for using this to his advantage. Amongst the subjects that Screwtape speaks about is war, and the implications that it could have for the patients soul. Still, the books format presents itself as difficult to read, due to the format which is very different from your average book.All in all, I found The Screwtape Letters to be a delightful read. Not only does the novel provide an \`inside look' into the workings of the Devil, it gives the reader serious though provoking questions about one's on life and struggle with evil. The author's use of theology, however, is subtle enough to make it interesting while capturing the reader's imagination. The reason that I have given this book four stars, is because it is a difficult read. My guess is that the format of the book does provide some problems, but still the book is interesting.

This book is interesting because what C.S. Lewis is saying is true.The setting of this book is probably in Hell, writing to Wormwood. I think my favorite part was when Screwtape explained to him about the temptations of evil is not easy to not do because when people want to do something they want to do but its illegal, they fall into the greatest sin and that is temptation. I get these temptations too by either playing games when I'm not supposed to and other temptations. I like this phrase because I think in my life, temptation is the most sin I lack on.

In comparison to Mere Christianity, it's a much easier book to read, but seems to be directed to a smaller, already-Christian audience. Having said that, I would recommend it to anyone willing to take the time to read it and put the effort into getting something out of it, regardless of religious beliefs.

He gives his young friend all sorts of helpful advice, like, for instance, the way people act in the ways they think are helpful but actually is simply annoying (if you want details, read the book!), and other things the younger devil might have use of in his trying to make a young man a sinner. At several places in the book I thought things like &quot;That's exactly the way people act!&quot; and &quot;Wow, I do that all the time!&quot; and I can almost guarantee that you will, too.

I pray that Wormwood and Screwtape are having a &quot;hell&quot; of a time and failing at their current assignments. I have heard that Lewis took some flack in his day for publishing these letters, they were just too real, too close to home, as if some would use them as a guide in being the devils advocate. In reality Lewis does a great service by showing how this world looks to those spirits that are working against the greatest &quot;enemy&quot; ever. To anyone new to C.S. Lewis, if that be possible, this is a great place to start, a real classic and extremely creative, to any not new to Lewis but having failed thus far to pick up this work, what are you waiting for?"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"This is an excellent manual from Hell that reveals a few of the enemy's methods. Unless you are unusually self-aware or totally self-unaware, this book may/will show you some dark spots of your heart, hidden so deeply that you no longer realize their presence. Satan (along with his minions) is truly worthy of the moniker deceiver. Maybe the devil does \\"make\\" us do it, but we still may suffer the eternal consequences if we let Satan play his hand to the full.This fictional book is well-written as a series of letters from a demon in his bureaucratic office to his subordinate field worker. It tells us how a young demon may learn the craft of temptation while we learn along with him. It also tells about the hearts of his temptees (us) and how noble we often feel while we are being lured away from Jesus. After all, pride may be our greatest sin.C.S. Lewis is a master of thought, insight and plain expression in my opinion, as well as in the opinion of many others. Read this one, then read more, like Mere Christianity, etc. And don't forget his fantasy tales.

I just feel like you need to read through it more than once and study it in relationship to the New Testament to fully understand the tactics the demons used against their subject.

It had that lovely smell that old books get after being read and spending many years on a library shelf, which makes it even more of a treasure in my opinion. It was a special gift to a young girl in my boyfriend's family that I discovered is an avid reader, and I was delighted to find that she and I shared a common love for literature. I sincerely hope that she not only enjoys the book not only for the entertainment value it provides, but takes from it the moral teachings, and that it makes her think on how temptation is always just around the corner, and every decision we make affects the paths we take in life. This book helped shape the way I looked at my own spirituality, and the choices I made in my life throughout the years. I hope it does the same for her. At fourteen, it is a wonderful book to help guide a teen without being overbearing or 'preachy'. It amuses, makes you both laugh, and worry about the plight of the victim, the goals of the demon trying to tempt the Christian, the failures of both from time to time, and the fragile nature of man.I highly recommend this to readers fourteen and older. If you haven't had the opportunity to read it, pick it up. At this price, it truly was a bargain!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"With the recent success of the Chronicles of Narnia and the reintroduction of C. S. Lewis into current thought, I have not been able to recommend \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" to enough of my friends and colleagues. The book, although set with World War II as the back drop, is timeless.The idea for the series of Letters came to Lewis in July 1940 during a church service at Oxford. The idea was for a book titled \\"As One Devil to Another\\" and would be a series of letter to a new junior devil from his mature, ready to retire uncle. After further thought the main characters became \\"His Abysmal Sublimity Under-Secretary Screwtape\\" the uncle and his nephew Wormwood. The letters are the reverse of what a \\"Christian\\" would think with \\"Our Father Below\\" being the devil and \\"the Enemy\\" being God.The book consists of 31 letters. Each is a gift to the reader. They are all short and very pointed as to controlling the thoughts and actions of humans. Letter XI is one of my favorites. In it, Lewis discusses the cases of human laughter and Screwtape divides them into: Joy, Fun, the Joke Proper and Flippancy. Flippancy is wonderfully done:\\" But Flippancy is the best of all. In the first place it is very economical. Only a clever human can make a real Joke about virtue, or indeed about anything else; any of them can be trained to talk as if virtue were funny. Among flippant people the joke is always assume to have been made. No one actually makes it; but every serious subject is discussed in a manner which implies that they have already found a ridiculous side to it. If prolonged, the habit of Flippancy builds up around a man the finest armour-plating against the Enemy (God) that I know, and it is quite free from the dangers inherent ion the other sources of laughter. It is a thousand miles away from joy: it deadens, instead of sharpening, the intellect; and it excites no affection between those who practice it.\\"I'm buying more copies to give away now!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"It is difficult to describe the importance of The Screwtapes Letters in a few sentences. This captivating novel relates the dialogue between two demons who have the task of derailing their assigned person from following the Christian walk altogether or, at least, rendering their spiritual walk fruitless and joyless. It is very disturbing initially to read as they call God the enemy, but it is important to understand the true spiritual battle going on. Deep insights are coveyed. For instance, one of the demons relates discouragement that his human is going to church. The other one responds that often this is the best place for a Christian to dwell that they might be easily lulled into a complacent numbness to their spiritual condition. This is an honest and excellent book that you won't want to put down!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"Great book. Lewis has taken this difficult subject (\\"How the Devil works\\") and put it in a format that everyone can read and enjoy. Well, some people may not enjoy it, but you can't help but learn from it. This is one of the few books that I can read over and over again (partly because it is pretty short, but mostly because it is so thought-provoking). If you liked this one, I might also suggest Lewis's space trilogy (\\"Out of the Silent Planet\\", \\"Perelandra\\", \\"That Hideous Strength\\") - which are very good, but not so well known. Lewis is one of my favorite authors and this is one of my favorite books of his. You can't miss."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS is a series of letters written from an older temptor demon to a younger one. The book consists of a total of 31 letters and is one of the most profound extrapolations of how demons work in the world. Set against the backdrop of WWII Great Britain, Screwtape's \\"nephew\\" is Wormwood, a newly elevated demon that has been given his first patient. Each of Screwtape's letters provide advice to Wormwood on how best to bring his patient into his camp and then when the patient becomes a Christian, advice on how to keep the man from living his faith. We never read Wormwood's responses, but each of Screwtape's letters provide an almost uncanny insight into what is essentially demonic thinking. Much of what is written is rooted in Biblical scripture, though Lewis ties in many events of the 1942 world. The book, though full of challenging and thought-provoking ideas, is fairly easy to read. In fact, outside of THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA it is Lewis' most easy-to-read work.C.S. Lewis referred to THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS as being the most difficult work he had ever written. He said writing from the perspective of a demon was too draining and darkened his life. Lewis was a popular author throughout most of his life, but very few of his works ever reached the audience that THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS did and does (the CHRONICLES OF NARNIA series and MERE CHRISTIANITY being the only exceptions). The book vaulted Lewis from being an occassional literary personality, to a celebrated world-famous author. The book was so popular that the publishers courted Lewis for years to write a sequel. He never fully gave in because he couldn't bring himself back into the \\"diabolical ventriloquism\\" mindset. However, Lewis did acquiesce somewhat nearly a decade letter with the very short \\"essay\\" SCREWTAPE PROPOSES A TOAST. This edition of the book includes a nice introduction by Richard Gillman. Overall, THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS is a great book and one of the best that I can recommend when one is trying to understand the nature of evil.\\"In the long run either Our Father of the Enemy will say 'mine' of each thing that exists, and specially of each man....At present the Enemy says 'mine' of everything on the pedantic, legalistic ground that He made it.\\" (Letter XXI)"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"Well, I won't repeat the other 100+ plus reviewers about what a great book &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; is, other than to say it will reward you to read it. I'd just like to comment on the unabridged audio version, narrated by John Cleese. They couldn't have picked a better vocal talent to do the Letters. In the introduction, Cleese speaks the persona of the Oxford/Cambridge don C.S. Lewis, not mimicing Lewis' voice, but copying the style of speech heard on Lewis' World War II broadcasts that eventually became &quot;Mere Christianity&quot;. Then, through the rest of the tapes, Cleese becomes the ultimate fiendish (literally) bureaucrat, Screwtape. Screwtape's sputtering indignation and fury at his nephew's incompetence, which leads him to turn into a giant centipede, is captured to perfection. In the closing essay, &quot;Screwtape Proposes a Toast&quot;, his effete snobbery at the fine vintage of bottled Pharisee is delightful. All in all, the ideal audio presentation of Lewis' masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"Ok, so you are curious about apologists and Christian theological writing, but aren't quite ready to tackle Tillich's Systematic Theology? Then the Screwtape Letters is a perfect choice. Not only a classic, it deals with questions of evil influence and human foibles in a way we can digest, both recognizing its relevance in our lives and laughing at Lewis' immense wit.The elderly devil Screwtape advises his devil nephew Wormwood on the subtleties of evil and how the easiest way to access the human soul is through the subject's own hubris.In a brief 134 pages Lewis captures the essential understanding of the existence of evil."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"I'm not usually a fan of &quot;books on tape&quot; but this is a case where inspired reading (more of a one-man performance) brings out nuances which don't come across on paper. Screwtape was the first C.S. Lewis book I read as an adult (after reading the Narnia books nearly 10 times apiece as a child). Though I'm not a Christian, I found a lot of inspiration in Screwtape. Lewis is so good at capturing the little games we all play and the avoidance techniques we all use. He writes so well about the redemption of souls, and the meaning of our spiritual side. I remember finding some of the wit in the book a little obvious. Not so with Cleese's reading! He has never done anything better. His comedic talents bring out the humor of the book, including some lines which weren't funny on paper. But his performance ranges far beyond the merely funny: the menace with which he says &quot;I could show you a pretty cageful down here . . .&quot; or the quiet hypnotic way he reads Lewis's lines about the road to Hell being &quot;soft underfoot, . . . without milestones, without signposts&quot; -- these things send a chill down the spine. My only regret about these tapes is that four of the Letters are not included. But the remaining letters are read in full with no abridgement.

She seemed eager enough to borrow a copy (I have two) just as soon as I described the book's delightful premise:\\"Screwtape\\" I told her, \\"is letters from a senior devil to a junior devil - and it's the funniest thing C.S. Lewis ever wrote - Have you heard of C.S. Lewis?\\" I asked. \\"No? Well he authored \`Narnia.' (Neither of us has seen the movie yet.)I told her 'Screwtape' is funny because (like all good humor) it seems so TRUE.

Lewis at his 'finest hour.' Well here, if you can spare two minutes -- get comfortable and see if this random sampling, from page 24, \\"Chapter IV\\" -- 'speaks' to YOU:----\\"My dear Wormwood, The amateurish suggestions in your latest letter warn me that it is high time for me to write to you fully on the painful subject of prayer . . .\\"The best thing, where possible, is to keep the \`patient' (the young man who is spiritually up for grabs) from the serious intention of praying. When (someone like him) is an adult, recently re-converted to the Enemy' (Screwtape's term for Christianity's founder) - such as your man, this is best done by encouraging him to remember - or to THINK he remembers - the parrot-like nature of his prayers in childhood.\\"In reaction against that, he may be persuaded to aim at something entirely spontaneous, inward, informal, and \`un-regularized' And what this will actually mean to a beginner will be an effort to produce in himself a vaguely devotional MOOD . . . in which real concentration of will and intelligence have no part.\\"One of their poets, Coleridge, has recorded that he did not pray \`with moving lips and bended knees' but merely \`composed his spirit to love' and indulged a \`sense of supplication.' That is EXACTLY the sort of prayer we want; and since it bears a superficial resemblance to the prayer of silence, as practiced by those who are far advanced in the Enemy's service, clever and lazy \`patients' can be taken in by it for quite a long time.\\"At the very LEAST, they can be persuaded that the bodily position makes no difference to their prayers; for they constantly forget what you must always remember, that they are animals and that whatever their bodies do affects their souls.\\"It is funny how mortals always picture us as putting things into their minds: in reality our best work is done by keeping things OUT.\\"If this fails, you MUST fall back on a subtler misdirection of his intention. Whenever they are attending to the Enemy Himself we are defeated, but there are ways of preventing them from doing so. The simplest is to turn their gaze away from Him towards themselves.\\"Keep them watching their own minds and trying to produce FEELINGS there, by the action of their own wills. (So that) when they meant to ask Him for Charity, let them instead start trying to manufacture charitable feelings for themselves - and not notice that this is what they are doing.\\"When they are meant to pray for courage, let them really be trying to FEEL brave. When they say they are praying for forgiveness, let them be trying to FEEL forgiven. Teach them to estimate the value of each prayer by their success in producing the desired feelings, and NEVER let them suspect how much success or failure of that kind depends on whether they are well or ill, fresh or tired, at the moment.\\"But of course, the Enemy will not meantime be idle. Whenever there is prayer there is danger of HIS own immediate action. He is cynically indifferent to the dignity of HIS position (and to OURS as pure spirits!) and to human animals on their knees He pours out self-knowledge in quite shameless fashion.\\"But even if He defeats your first attempt at misdirection, we have a subtler weapon . . .\\"After describing that more subtle \`weapon' in detail, -- and it concerns the true nature of God as opposed to the \`composite images' that can be \\"derived from pictures of the Enemy as He appeared during (His) Incarnation\\" (20 centuries earlier) Screwtape advises his green nephew:\\"Whatever the nature of his composite (picture of the \`Enemy') you must keep your \`patient' praying to IT - to the thing that he has made - be it something in his own head or a crucifix on the wall - and NOT to the Person who has made him.\\"You may even encourage him to attach great importance to the correction and improvement of his composite object, and to keep it steadily in his imagination during the whole prayer. For if he ever comes to make the distinction, if ever he consciously directs his prayers \`Not to what I think thou art, but to what thou knowest thyself to be,' our situation is, for the moment, desperate.\\"The good news, says the \`senior devil,' is that, \\"in avoiding this situation - the real nakedness of the human soul in prayer - you will be helped by the fact that the humans themselves do not desire it as much as they suppose. There's such a thing as getting more than they bargained for!\\"That \\"more than they bargained for,\\" Screwtape explains (earlier in this same chapter) is that humans (at least the majority, who are far from saints) - \\"have never known that ghastly luminosity, that stabbing and searing glare (of true self-knowledge) which makes the background of permanent pain in our own lives (as devils).Your affectionate uncle,Screwtape.-----Late in life C.S. Lewis was asked WHY he never wrote a sequel (apart from a few pages entitled, \\"Screwtape Proposes a Toast\\"). The greatest of Christian \`apologists' replied in effect, that it \\"hurt\\" him too much -- to maintain within himself the necessary state-of-mind where he was thinking purely as a devil -- in order that Screwtape's words could pour from his pen onto paper.Living 'inside' \\"Screwtape\\" Lewis experienced an exhausting -- even terrifying -- spiritual/psychological torment that he was NEVER prepared to re-visit. Despite the fact this little book was, until \\"Narnia,\\" his most enduring source of fame - so much so, it got C.S.

Although aimed primarily at christians, it provides observations of the human condition useful to any student of moral psychology. These lessons are set in a series of fictional correspondances between Screwtape, a high ranking demon, and his young protege Wormwood, a young demon that has been sent out on his first assignment to ensnare a human. The seemingly gentle and fatherly advice to the young demon from his patron exposes the true designs of the masters of Hell, as well as the frailties of the human psyche that they seek to exploit in their attempts to gain a convert for their side. The demonic viewpoints are presented in an ironically sensitive and almost plaintive voice, expressing the motives and problems of the demons from their viewpoint. This wonderful literary mechanism adds power to this probing treatise on the common frailties and pitfalls of humans as they struggle in a morally ambiguous universe. Short, concise, and easily apprehended, this is a classic example of Mr. Lewis' great value as a christian apologist and an observer of human nature. Highly reccommended."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"Leave it to C.S. Lewis to do the undoable--write an epistolary novel from Hell's vantage that delights as much as it educates, and illuminates even as it sends cold chills up your spine. But Lewis was a genius, and The Screwtape Letters is literary proof.Written as a series of letters from old devil Screwtape to his apprentice nephew, Wormwood, Lewis's novel tells the story of Wormwood's increasingly desperate efforts to ensnare the soul of a young Englishman during World War I. Through this correspondence we follow Wormwood's \\"patient\\" through conversion, to doubt, love and his ultimate fate. The novel's suspense comes from the question of whether or not the young man will actually escape becoming a midnight snack for Wormwood, and besides being a genuinely fun read the novel is packed with ingenious observations about innumerable human fallacies: from lust to \\"falling in love,\\" to cowardice to fanatic patriotism, piety to self-righteousness. One of Lewis's great literary gifts was his ability to pinpoint the subtle flaws in human nature that most of us probably don't think twice about but which we may end up regretting for all eternity. His eye for the touch of evil in the most seemingly innocuous areas of life lets Lewis hit all the major spiritual pressure points with amazing--and sometimes painful--accuracy.Deliciously funny as only a grand parody can be, yet likewise terrifying in its implications, The Screwtape Letters is a must-read for everyone who ever even thought about religion. A magical novel of wisdom, encouragement, and dire warning, The Screwtape Letters has my wholehearted recommendation."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"The Screwtape Letters is Lewis's classic collection of diabolical correspondence. In it, a senior devil gives continued advice to his prot&eacute;g&eacute; on how best to tempt his victim and keep him from salvation.Lewis does not propose any concrete doctrine on devils here, and this is not his point. Rather he focuses on highlighting the ways, both large and small, that Christians are distracted from God. Lewis explores the dangers of not being purposeful toward God and life, as well as what happens to people when they give in to temptation.The book is presented as a collection of letters, all from Screwtape to Wormwood. But Lewis does a good job of making the conversation not feel one-sided, and he does a fantastic job with the devils' personalities. In fact the book is rather deeper than this, as there are two other plots going on. First is the fate of Wormwood's man. Second is the relationship between the devils, and the fate of Wormwood.The Screwtape Letters is deeper than it appears, and is thoroughly thought-provoking. Most every reader will find elements in it to which he or she can relate. Christians of all maturity levels can benefit from this book.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"C.S. Lewis has said that he found it painful to write this book since it required him to spend days on end thinking upside-down. But it is lucky for us that he did, since the result is a book that both delights and enlightens.THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS documents the correspondence between Screwtape, a senior devil, and his nephew Wormwood, a novice tempter. Wormwood's mission is to win a soul for the underworld, and Screwtape offers him the accumulated iwdom of Hell on how to accomplish it. The result is a well-laid out map to the pitfalls to which we humans are all-too prey. Lewis' had great insight into human weakness, especially the uncanny way ou pride pops into almost every thought we might have. He is also alert to the ways our unquestioned assumtions can lead us astray. As Socrates said, the first step towards wisdom is to \\"know thyself\\" - and the tempters in this book do all they can to prevent that from happening.Lewis, of course, is a Christian, but THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS are useful to any person who is seriously engaged on the spiritual quest. I read this book about once a year, and am always chagrined to find that Screwtape is still one step ahead of me! (And he is unfailingly eloquent to boot.)This volume includes \\"Screwtape proposes a toast\\" which employs the same technique to discuss modern education. I find this a weaker part of the volume. It seems Lewis could have done more with the concept, but his arguments about the failings of modern education are much sharper in his book, THE ABOLITION OF MAN.Still, this is an invaluable volume. It is the book that I most often give away to people - it is laugh-out-loud funny, and sadly all-too true."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"The only C.S. Lewis I had ever read up to this point was the Narnia series, when I was a kid. Those were great books that probably deserve a rereading at some point, even though I'm much older now. The Screwtape Letters find Lewis waxing on his favorite topic: Christianity. The book is a series of letters from Screwtape, a high-ranking administrator in Hell, to his nephew Wormwood, who is a tempter of man. The whole book is a wicked satire that Lewis pulls off well. Not only is this book fun to read, it has a serious message, too.I found myself laughing quite a bit with this book, although the laughter tends to be the nervous sort of chuckling that comes from discomfort. Too many times I found myself described within these pages. Especially when Screwtape discusses the types of laughter found among man and how these can be turned to good use in gaining souls for Hell. The most useful type of laughter for Satan is flippancy, when man laughs because he can always see a ridiculous side to everything. It is most useful because men who do this will never take anything as seriously as they should, especially the \\"Enemy\\" (the term Screwtape uses to describe God). Another interesting chapter deals with Jesus and the tendency of moderns to try to define and describe Jesus in terms that should be alien to him. Screwtape delights in efforts to make Jesus a Communist, a social theoretician or a magician/philosopher. All of these efforts divert man from whom and what Jesus really was. Screwtape also cackles over intellectuals, who are corrupted by the historical point of view. Intellectuals don't look for truth in what they read; they analyze writing styles, context, and historicity. By not looking for the truth, they are confused and turned away from God. Other topics are covered here as well: sex, marriage, prayer, Christianity and lots more. The best part of the book, by far, is the toast Screwtape gives at the end of the book. Lewis uses this toast to launch one of the most vigorous and thorough attacks on democracy that I've had the pleasure to read. I never knew Lewis had it in him!!A great book that should be read by a greater audience. I should make an effort to read more from this author. You should too.

Distraction from God toward anything else.The book is a series of letters from a senior devil to a junior devil on how to thwart or subvert a Christian's spiritual growth. This book shows that goal of the enemy is not necessarily overt sin, but anything that diverts focus away from God and his will, which is primarily demonstrating love to other people. By learning how the enemy tries to weaken your Christian walk, you will be better equiped to walk with God.I have read this book 4 times in the last 10 years, and will do so many more times. The lessons here are unique and penetrating, and worth reviewing regularly!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"This is a powerful little book which you can read in an evening, full of wit and wisdom regarding the cosmic warfare over the human soul. Screwtape fills his letters to young Wormwood with diabolically clever advice on how to thoroughly entangle his patient in the snares which will keep him from the Enemy, namely Jesus Christ. Screwtape advices Wormwood on how to capitalize on such things as domestic relationships, war, friendship, love, and sex, and includes many critical insights on the nature of pleasure, laughter, triviality, love, lust, humility, pride, anxiety, resignation, fear, etc.Reading over Wormwood's shoulder will do two things for you: it will make you laugh (this is an incredibly funny book) and it will make you painfully aware of the demon whispering in your own ear. Few authors understand the psychological labyrinth of the human soul as Lewis does. He has a way of uncovering the subconscious motives and thought-processes of one's soul and forcing them into the bright light of true righteousness and love.I read this book last night (it is a quick read) for the fourth time and walked away freshly challenged, convicted, and encouraged in my spiritual life. I highly, highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"I have always been a big fan of C.S.lewis,so when I saw this book at the library I thought I'd check it out.Lord,I'm glad I did!The Screwtape Letters is an excellent book.It describes the many ways demons try to lead us away from God,and also is full of advice on how to be a good Christian.In my opinion,EVERY Christian should read this book.It is wonderful,and I definitly will be reading it again.Also;even though The Screwtape Letters was intended for adults,most teenagers will understand and enjoy it as well.I myself am fourteen and I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"A novel of deception, mystery, curiosity, and horror set inside the minds of Satan's demons through a series of letters between a seasoned demon and his apprentice. The Screwtape Letters is written such that one feels as if he is reading a secret piece of correspondence. The whole novel is focused around one character, Screwtape. In every chapter, he is writing a letter back to his nephew who is always seeking to squeeze advice from him. Through this one character, Lewis reveals indirectly what he thinks is the devil's way to deceive humans into corruption. In addition, Lewis wrote it in this fashion so that people may notice and create their own strategy to counter the devil and remain faithful to God. For anyone who is deeply interested in religious matters this book is a must read.For anyone below the age of seventeen, this book would definitely be a challenge to understand. Not that the words themselves are difficult, but that Lewis's style can be tough to comprehend. Every page I read I felt my blood beginning to boil as I further understood the organized execution of such incredible evil. I want to reach into the pages and grab Screwtape by his throat. My blood boils when I realize that there is nothing I can do to stop their cruelty. For all I know, Lewis may be right and my own demons may be at this very moment plotting their next move against me. Lewis's genius is amazing to me because of how I respond to these letters. He makes me ponder continuously about whether or not I have demons in my head who are affecting me. Lewis's use of diction and imagery captivates my mind and reasoning to the point where I have become impressed with the vast knowledge and logic of this extraordinary man."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"I love it!

I am skeptical about the existence of God, but I don't rule it out entirely. I bring this up because this book is based solely upon the belief in God and (conversely) the Devil.The entire book is a one-sided view of a correspondence from an aging devil to his apprentice devil protege. The aging devil, named Screwtape, dispenses advise and wisdom gained from years as a tempter of humans.From this point of view, the reader gets a truly horrifying and entertaining view of one's own life and pursuits. I still don't profess a belief in God, but now I am beginning to believe in devils."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"This book is extremely well written and delves into the very hell of temptation and the forces fighting for souls behind the scenes.

Many of you probably have heard about Randy Alcorn's book called, &quot;L-rd Falcron's Letters.&quot; That is nothing more than a complete rip off off Lewis' &quot;The Screwtape Letters!&quot;To Randy's credit, he was honest about his book being &quot;a modern version of Lewis' book.&quot; Unfortunately, that's just one more instance of the &quot;it's old, so it must be updated and become the victim of &quot;Fahrenheit 451!&quot; I'm not attacking Randy. I just have no intention of reading his book, especially since it's utterly useless compared to &quot;The Screwtape Letters.&quot;Lewis' &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; is one of those timeless books that stands alone, just like Orwell's &quot;1984,&quot; Beecher-Stowes' &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin,&quot; Shakespeares' &quot;Hamlet,&quot; Bellamy's &quot;Looking Backward,&quot; and Harper-Lee's &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird, as a few examples.&quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; is one of those rare, timeless and redemptive classics. I recommend this book to everybody I know who likes to read, saved or lost. Lewis' book grips the reader very quickly and quite easily can be read in one day. The book is not very long. My only disappointment when I read it is that I cannot put it down until I've finished it, and then I feel a bit down because it's not longer!This book is a &quot;must read&quot; for everybody, lost and saved. Case cloed! In my opinion, a lost person with any grey matter between the ears cannot read this book and not be affected. For a Christian, I do not see how anybody can read this book and not be ecstatic that he/she has been eternally rescued from HELL!AWESOME BOOK! EVEN IN SPITE OF 1 COR 1:18, EVERYBODY SHOULD READ THIS BOOK, SAVED AND LOST.

His nephew is a beginner of doing evil things and tempting bad things. The nephew's name is Wormwood and the devil's name is Screwtape. Wormwood needs advice frome his uncle, Screwtape of what to do to temp people to do what he wants them to. Screwtape tells Wormwood about what to watch out and what to go for target. As a person reads this book, they should be careful what the devil looks for and what he hates. Screwtape tells Wormwood what to do by writing letters to him. This book is interesting because what C.S. Lewis is saying is true.The setting of this book is probably in Hell, writing to Wormwood. I think my favorite part was when Screwtape explained to him about the temptations of evil is not easy to not do because when people want to do something they want to do but its illegal, they fall into the greatest sin and that is temptation. I get these temptations too by either playing games when I'm not supposed to and other temptations. I like this phrase because I think in my life, temptation is the most sin I lack on. I think that I have to watch out for this sin because it is not good to fall into temptation.i chose to read this book because my teacher and my sister wanted me to read this. When I looked at the pages and the words, I was shocked and didn't want o read, but when I read the first few pages, the book was getting intereasting. As I read this book, I knew I was living my life wrong. This book tells me what to watch out for and what to do to get the devil out of my life.

This was, and remains, such a great way to address the problem of human sin because other-worldly treatments lose their believability so quickly.Certainly, this volume deserves to be called a classic because it continues to be quoted by theologians, clergy and ethicists alike, in this age. It is a short and good read of a very difficult part of the human predicament."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"Although written in the 1940's, C.S.

Regarding the non-fictional material here, Lewis accurately considers the general stages of, and the pitfalls of, the Christian re-birth and growth.My only negative comment is that I found that the \\"upward progess\\" of the new Christian subject came perhaps a bit too easily, simply, and predictably. In my experience and observation as a long time \\"follower of Jesus\\" . . . it's been much more complex, more difficut, and more \\"tricky\\" than Lewis portrays it here.

Excellent for a study group.Amanda Hamm, author ofDear Jane Letters"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"C. S. Lewis was, without a doubt, one of the best writers of the century, and this book is C. S. Lewis at the height of his powers. It is clever, entertaining and insightful, at points even profound. At points you're almost tempted to take notes. People tend to think of \\"informative\\" and \\"entertaining\\" as opposites, or at least mutually exclusive. Lewis proves that that isn't true by writing a book that is both at the exact same time.Some people seem think that this book is depressing or too heavy, but I don't think that's true. It's definitely not a dime novel or pulp fiction, and I suppose it does require a lot more thought than a lot of novels, but don't let that stop you. This book is wonderful satire that's not that hard to read.If you've never read this book, I definitely recommend that you do so."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"C.S. Lewis scores five stars with me with this book. The book is funny, instructive and impactful. The book is a series of letters from a senior demon to a newly assigned demon. The letters give instruction and evaluation to the junior demon on how to \\"poison\\" his assigned human or patient.Although how demons work in the spirit world has never been revealed to us, the scene that Lewis paints seems most realistic. Lewis depicts a world where the demon constantly monitors the activities of its patient and uses every opportunity to whisper lies, spin half truths and distort reality. It gave me pause when I considered the possibility that the world really is this way.By presenting the schemes of the demons, Lewis is really teaching us how to live in the way of God. I found myself taking some of these lessons to heart.God bless the soul of C. S. Lewis. I strongly recommend this book for any follower of Jesus."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"That's the initial impression of this book which is on my list of all time favorites. A series of letters between Screwtape, an undersecratary, and his nephew Wormwood, an apprenctice tempter in charge of securing the damnation of a young man. The \\"story\\" takes place during the second world war with the young man being a young englishman.The book is so well written because we're given insites to his own life, his own realistic experience, which make what Screwtape is advising that much more haunting. Everything from the man's relationship with his mother and his work to his relationship with his girl are given time.Screwtape regularly rakes his nephew over the coals for asking stupid questions he should know the answers to or just for being to naive.In the intro to the book Lewis says that nothing Screwtape says can be taken to seriously. That is most clearly seen when Screwtape talks about how when God wouldn't reveal the reason why he was making the \\"human vermin,\\" \\"Our Father Below\\" ceased his support of \\"The Enemy\\" and removed himself a great distance from him resulting in that ridiculous story that he was \\"forced\\" out of Heaven. A lot of what Screwtape talks about is how to corrupt what God has already created. Things like prayer and even going to church are attacked.My two favorite lines:\\"The truth is that whenever a man lies with a woman, there, whether they like it or not, a transcendental relation is set up between them that must be eternally enjoyed or eternally endured.\\"\\"He made the pleasures: of of our research so far has not enabled us to produce one. All we can do is to encourage the humans to take the pleasures which our enemy has produced, at times, or in ways, or in degrees, which He has forbidden.\\"After the Letters are over, there is also a prolonged speech in which Screwtape dispenses advice on how politics can be used. It shows many of things that plauge our society. How we don't encourage acheivement in a the larger sense.This is my favorite book because of the satirical nature of the book that's as relevant today as it was when it was first written."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"The Screwtape Letters are a collection of letters emanating from Screwtape, a higher-up in the Bureaucracy of Hell to his nephew, Wormwood a lower level \\"Tempter\\" whose mission is to deliver the soul on an Englishman living during World War II.C.S.

Given the fact that Screwtape refers to God as the \\"Enemy\\" one gets the impression that for Lewis, writing \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" was akin to \\"going undercover\\" or \\"spying behind enemy lines.\\" The result is an impeccable piece of reverse theology which ultimately ends in an uplifting manner.

This novel could be described as &quot;the Christian's guide to outsmarting Satan and his tactics.&quot; I found that it was a very accurate description of the ways Satan comes after believers &quot;seeking whom he may devour.&quot; In reading this novel, one can be prepared for the fiery darts Satan will send his or her way and can be aware of the more subtle deceptions that the devil may use."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"John Cleese's rendition of \\"Screwtape\\" is phenomenal.

At times, Wormwood disappoints Screwtape, and his \\"affectionate\\" uncle will lash out in anger and contempt. These letters take place during the Second World War, and it plays at least a minor role in the work.

My memory of this work was a little different than what I found recently. I was disturbed by the reading this time. I don't know what the change was, my guess is that it was because I now have a family of my own.The fact that Lewis appears to have been so prescient to my future doubts and failings on faith issues is troubling yet hopeful also.Obviously, youth and pride probably led me to ignore much of this book in my first reading. Yet, in retrospect it seems almost uncanny that I didn't feel a little bit of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu as I lived my life.Anyway, this is a very good book. I just bought the audio, narrated by John Cleese, which I've heard is very well done. If any are interested my attempt at writing in the Lewis style of Screwtape to Wormwood is on my blog.

C.S. Lewis truly reveals so many spiritual truths that we sometimes ignore or simply don't realize. After reading this book, I definitely looked at the world differently.

It's a wonderful read and humorous at times."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"The Screwtape Letters is a great piece of spiritual fiction. C. S. Lewis has created a collection of letters written between two demons about the fate of one individual. One reason this book has remained so popular over there years is there is nothing quite like it. The complexities of Uncle Screwtape's spiritual arguments are compelling. C. S. Lewis said that writing the book was a very difficult process and after reading the book I can understand why.Coming from the perspective of Demons the books goes into implicit detail about what they think about the human race, Satan, the Enemy (God). The letters themselves can be cumbersome to read, but most of the letters are short. Everyone should enjoy this book; it is a simple premise that is funny, entertaining, and thought provoking."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"What can you say about C.S.

Here is a fictional book based on both absolute truth and non-fiction ideas. There is a battle being fought by demons and angels over the lives of humans. Both God and Satan are wanting your soul for their kingdoms. Through his specific situations and diction, Lewis allows us to see the influence of demons in our own lives. Also Lewis takes a new spin on point of view from the devil's side. No one really ever thinks of God as &quot;The Enemy.&quot; Usually the sterotypes of God are good and majestic, but through &quot;The Screwtape Letters,&quot; the devil is seen as the &quot;good guy.&quot; I recommend this book to anyone searching for answers to life, or wanting to know more about spiritual warfare."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"This is a classic piece of Christian fiction.

He also wrote the Chronicles of Narnia for kids. But Screwtape Letters is for adults. It is readable. And not a dense theological writing. In fact, most of Lewis's stuff is not super hard to understand. At least on the surface. He makes you think. His writing is probably not for the average person, but if you are looking to be stretched in your understanding of practical Christianity by an intelligent writer, Lewis is a good choice.His writings are not brand new, as he died quite a few years ago. But the things he writes about are timeless.I fell into reading Lewis while I was in junior high and he was a total revelation to me. I loved him. It's been decades since that happened, but I still read his stuff and learn more all the time.The Screwtape Letters and The Weight of Glory were his most famous adult works. I think.

Better and better the older it (I?) get!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"[Throughout the years, I have written a number of reviews that have never been published online on Amazon. These writings comprise two types of reviews: unfinished reviews, abandoned during various stages of composition, and completed reviews that for life reasons were never posted. Of the later type, back in September 2001 I wrote a cache of work, a full sixteen reviews of several different C. S. Lewis books which have never been released. I am publishing these reviews now for the first time, over a decade after they were initially written. Mike London 10-3-2012]One of Lewis's most famous books, \\"The Screwtape Letters\\", written in late 1940 to early 1941, are letters \\"From One Devil to Another\\" (the original title o fthe work). The book is a fictional account of an older devil named Screwtape, giving a younger devil, Wormwood, advice on how to lead Wormwood's first \\"patient\\" astray. Both profound and psychologically astute, Lewis displays a mental virtuosity in these letters that has garnered him such acclaim. Most editions also include a second piece, \\"Screwtape Proposes a Toast\\", written in the early 1960s just before Lewis died, years after initial composition.Before I continue, be aware of newer editions of Lewis's works in regards to textual accuracy. In Letter 22, the sentence read \\"A more modern writer - someone with a name like Pshaw\\", was changed to Lewis's name himself. If you read any copy that Screwtape refers to the works of C. S. Lewis, know you are dealing with a tampered, adulterated text. Why the estate would allow such hackeyed editing to take place is beyond me.[Of interest is Lewis's decidication.] Lewis dedicated the book to J. R. R. Tolkien. Written in a draft letter to his son Michael Tolkien after Lewis's death (Letter 252 in \\"Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien)), Tolkien discussed his relationship with Jack, and how by various events (first, the appearance of Charles Williams, who died in 1945, and secondly his marriage), they drifted apart, although they remained friends with deep affection and love for one another, though not as imitate as once they were. To quote Tolkien \\"I was wrly amused to be told (D. Telegraph) that \`Lewis was never very fond of \`The Screwtape Letters' - his best seller (250,000). He dedicated it t me. I wondered why. Now I know - says they.\\" Lewis also dedicated \\"The Problem of Pain\\" to the Inklings (the same group the initial first editon of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" was dedicated too). Tolkien and Humphrey Carpenter made numerous suggestions that Lewis incorporated in \\"The Problem of Pain\\".Although the book has long proven to be one of his most popular, Lewis did not like the actual writing process. He found it quite easy to get into a \\"devilish\\" point of view, but did not think it good for his character to write for extended periods of time in this type of work. He also felt the work was out of balance - there should be a companion piece, a book of angelic wisdom. However, such a book's prose should have the very air of heaven itself, and Lewis felt quite unequaled to write such a text.After writing the letters Lewis published them in a now defunct periodical called \\"The Guardian\\", an Church of England publication. Although he did not want to harm any publication that issued his work, Lewis was found fond of telling the story that he was directly responsible for losing \\"The Guardian\\" at least one reader, due to the \\"diabolical device advice\\" present in the letters. For whatever readership these letters lost \\"The Guardian\\" were more than made up, as these letters brought in many new readers to the periodical.The manuscript of \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" actually survives, which is unusual for several Lewis books, due to his habit of destroying them after publication as he had no place to store them. After completing the letters, he sent them to Sister Penelope as he was afraid they could be destroyed in a bombing raid by Germany before the book publication appeared, and he felt it may be difficult to reassemble the text from the various issues of \\"The Guardian\\".The first two letters especially are very relevant to today's society. Lewis brings out the fact that, indeed, devils cannot produce any type of virtues, and vices are only perversions of what God has ordained as good. The only thing demons can do is take the pleasure that God has created and encourage us to use it the wrong way. In letter two, he speaks of the mental habits of thinking people are better than what they really are. One thing that especially rings true is that it is very easy for new-born Christians to think that those around them, who they know and that these people's lives are not in proper order, for, after all, they are human beings, cannot be the Christian Church because of little things.In the subsequent letters Lewis deals with a wide variety of practical, everyday matters. Letter Four deals with prayer (far more concisely and succinctly than Lewis' own \\"Letters to Malcolm\\") and has more truth about that subject than many full length books. Letter deight deals with free will. Letter Twelve shows us Lewis's thoughts on pleasure, and how one of Satan's chief tactics is to set up false pleasures and false good activities. Time is so valuable, and Lewis demonstrates that so often when people arrive in hell they find that they have neither spent their time worthilily nor did they do what they truly enjoyed doing. Letter Fourteen distinguishes true humility and false humility, and how false humility becomes a very mockery of what it claims to be. False humiility leads to pride, and gives one a falsely low view of both yourself and God's other creations. Also, denying your identity in God is not true humility - we were made wonderfully.There are several letters on vice, including those small ones that may not seem like vice at all. Lewis writes about love, marriage, and lust as well. Letter sixteen [deals] demonstrate the vigilance God must develop within you regarding preachers - so often people wander from church to church, looking either for watered down faith or controversy. One must seek the heart of God - not \\"party churches\\" that seem more about pomp and circumstances than about getting to the heart of the Father.There are ways to mythologize the church into this grand and wonderful place that leaves out all the real elements in life and what it means to be a Christian. Letter twenty nine tells us how cowardice will never be approved of, and if you make a human a coward there is the very real danger that his other faults will be evident when he goes on a real soul searching on why he ran.Lewis's wit is rampant throughout the book, and especially with Screwtape's treatment of Wormwood. They both wish to consume one another, and when Wormwood begs for mercy it is considered heresy because that is not how demons behave.After completing the work, Lewis took too regular confessions with a priest, as he felt that the habit allowed him to better understand his own temptations and how to work through them and defeat them. Just like Lewis, reading this book will sharpen your senses of right and wrong from a Biblical perspective, and give you new understanding for your Christian walk.Strangely enough there is both a stage production and a possible movie in the works. I have not seen the stage production, but as the book is primarily concerned with spiritual matters written in a largely non-fictional manner, I found it hard to understand how they could make an actual movie out of this book. While there is a definie narrative, \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" is much more about understanding the Enemy and is more akin to his apologetic works than his novels.The idea of devils writing letters to one another would prove to be an influential device in Christian publications, as various other writers have also played with the concept. I have even written such a letter years ago for a class assignmentThis is an essential text for both C. S. Lewis fans and Christians in general.(These reviews covered all seven books of \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\", the three novels of \\"The Space Trilogy\\", \\"The Abolition of Man\\", \\"The Four Loves\\", \\"A Preface to Paradise Lost\\", a revised version of my 2000 review of \\"Till We Have Faces\\", \\"Surprised By Joy\\", and \\"The Screwtape Letters\\".)"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"C.S.

He wants us to focus on feelings - not to attend to all the evidence around us that the Enemy (God) is who He claims to be, and is more than able to provide our needs, and to insure an eternity of peace and joy for those who attend to Him. Screwtape has only winning us away from the Enemy in mind; this is his sole goal, and he will put all his energy into the competition.

Probably more for the intellictual types."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"CS Lewis hit on a brilliant device for exploring Christianity by adopting the persona of a senior demon, Screwtape, writing a series of letters to a lesser one, Wormwood, providing helpful hints on undermining the burgeoning faith of a developing Christian. Hell is depicted as the ultimate bureaucracy, staffed by tempters who are motivated by the fear of punishment. Lewis frequently displays great insight when dissecting the less charitable elements of human nature. However, he also comes across as disdainful, dismissive and condescending toward non-Christians.At times, he shows himself to be in possession of prejudices that, in my eyes at least, disqualify him from being the moral authority that many believe him to be. The best example of this can be found in the epilogue, \\"Screwtape Proposes a Toast,\\" in which Lewis laments the tendency of some to interpret the political ideal of \\"equality\\" as a moral justification for dragging everyone down to the same level of mediocrity. He claims that the feeling that prompts someone to claim that they are just as good as anyone else is one of the root causes of sin and is really just \\"the itching, writhing, smarting awareness of an inferiority which the patient refuses to accept.\\" Among the examples of inferiority that he provides are some really stunning cases, whether stunningly irrelevant and frivolous (such as the claim that toy dogs are inferior to Saint Bernards) or stunningly wrong-headed and shallow (such as the claim that plain women are inferior to beauties).Whatever you may think of his content, though, Lewis always makes his case clearly and, in this case, through the conception of a brilliant metaphor."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"It is an excellent book to be kept in one's library and read many times."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"But, of course, it is out of print.

A great piece of literature with a different point of view."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"C.S. Lewis has devised a humorous, satircal novel; yet also one that sadly and painfully hits close to home. He has cleverly and novelly set up his book as a series of letters that the \\"Devil\\" writes to his nephew who is learning the trade. Many of the tactics used by the Devil become painfully clear to the reader and provokes deep thinking and questioning. Overall many letters contained strong, learning themes yet the overall presentation of ideas, although creative and unique, may have contributed to the overall lack of unity in the novel. I felt it read more like an essay than a novel. Overall though, the ideas were strong and poignant and stimulated thinking yet the setup perhaps hindered the developemnt of lasting impressions from the novel. As you read it, you gained insight, yet because the points were stated and then immdietely abandonded, it is hard to imagine this novel as leaving deep impressions in the mind."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters,","review":"After a month and a half it hasn't shown up yet. And now it says I need to write more"},{"Title":"The watersplash","review":"When Edward Random returns to the village of Greenings after a mysterious hiatus of nearly five years, he finds that his beloved Uncle James has died, and though he was the heir apparent, his uncle, believing his nephew to be deceased, had made a new will leaving everything to his brother, Edward's uncle, Arnold Random.So, things are a tad uncomfortable for Arnold and Edward. Moreover, an old acquaintance, Clarice Dean, an ill bred young woman who works as a nurse, has also returned to the village and appears hell bent on renewing her acquaintance with Edward and making it a romantic one.Amidst a backdrop of rumors of a newer, contradictory will made by Uncle James that names a different heir, blackmail attempts, and two puzzling murders that take place a the local water splash, which is nothing more than a shallow ford in a stream, Miss Silver, a retired governess turned private enquiry agent, attempts to find the truth. This is no easy task when confronted with a host of village gossip and a murderer on the loose.This is an excellent English village murder mystery in which Miss Silver saves the day. Though the discerning reader may well figure out who the murderer is, the joy of this well-written murder mystery is to be found in the journey to its final destination rather than the destination itself. Peppered with interesting quirky characters, a well-defined village setting, and an intricate plot, those who enjoy English village mysteries should really get a kick out this one."},{"Title":"The watersplash","review":"When Edward returns when his family thought he was dead, there is rampant speculation on where he has been. When Edward refuses to tell anyone where he had been, the talk is that he was in trouble, maybe even jail. His uncle Arnold has inherited a large estate bcause James Random thought Edward was dead. But Clarice, his nurse, knows that there was another will, one that benefits Edward. She knows James Random had a dream that Edward is alive. Clarice wants Edward, so she keeps the information to herself hoping to use it to snare Edward into romantic gratitude. But then one of the witnesses to the will is killed in the watersplash and Clarice is nervous. Providence brings in Miss Silver and Clarice is warned not to use any information for personal gain. She does not listen and is found dead in the watersplash.The solution to the mystery is another twist and very unexpected. The love story between the bitter Edward and Susan is a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"The watersplash","review":"A watersplash is a shallow ford in a stream.- author's noteThis case follows the Rejected Client Variation of the classical Silver format: after a few chapters of character development, an unsympathetic character - here Clarice Dean - consults private inquiry agent Maud Silver, who refuses the case. Clarice, a freelance nurse, has deliberately arranged a return to the village of Greenings, seeking some kind of opportunity, but what? Is she interested in committing matrimony with one of the Random family - or blackmail? Maud Silver at least considers the latter possibility, warning Clarice against its dangers - a warning that other characters could take to heart.Five years ago, Edward Random fell for Verona Grey, but the affair ended in an epic quarrel with Edward's uncle James, followed by Edward's stormy departure and stony silence - no visits, no communication. Eventually news came of Edward's death, although James wouldn't tell even Edward's beloved stepmother Emmeline the details. The family won't say whether James removed Edward from his will after the quarrel or only after Edward's \\"death\\". James, as the eldest of three brothers, had the family estate and a decent amount of money; Arnold, the youngest at sixty-odd, also had a comfortable slice of the family pie. Only Edward's ne'er-do-well father was penniless - there's just enough for Emmeline to live on, since James let her live rent-free in the Hall's south lodge.But the village hums with gossip now thatEdward has returned; Arnold shows no signs whatever of re-dividing the family pile, and Edward doesn't see fit to say where he was or what he was doing. Edward's long absence gives Wentworth a natural opening for introducing us to the cast - he meets Susan Wayne by chance at the train station, and since she's going to be cataloging the Hall's library, she asks him to fill her in on the situation so she won't say the wrong thing. They're friends - she had a crush on him when he left, and she's still close to Emmeline.Lord Burlingham, the next nearest big landowner, is no friend of Arnold's; he offers Edward an estate management job. Arnold reacts by threatening to evict Emmeline. Wentworth's usually skilled character development shines here. For instance, Arnold *tries* to threaten his sister-in-law with cold dignity, but he can't maintain it in the face of Emmeline's clear perception of his motives, and embarrasses himself by losing control. Lord Burlingham, far from being from old money, is self-made, and there's a distinct impression that he was granted his title because the powers-that-be in the House of Commons felt he'd better take his outspokenness elsewhere. He's sharp - when he wants to quash the gossip about where Edward was, he walks right up to Emmeline in the fish queue and congratulates her in a carrying voice on Edward's new job. :)Although Clarice gave Maud Silver a false name, she gave enough information that as an exercise, Maud writes to an old friend - Ruth Ball, the wife of Greenings' vicar - and verifies Clarice's identity. When the papers report the second suspicious drowning in Greenings in a week - that of Clarice Dean - Maud accepts Ruth's invitation to visit the vicarage on holiday. (Only much later on does Edward Random retain her in her professional capacity.)A good story, with an unusual amount of attempted blackmail, some of it obviously(?) on trumped-up grounds. William Jackson, as First Blackmailer, is an example of a recurring type in Wentworth stories, a blue-collar man - in this case, one of Random's footmen - who married an older woman for her savings, then turned out to be a very bad husband indeed. Jackson drinks enough to claim he witnessed a will that never turned up after James Random died. That same night, Jackson drowns in the watersplash. Then Mildred Blake, a cold, vindictive woman who was once engaged to Arnold, steps in as Second Blackmailer, pointing out just how bad all this looks. Annie Jackson, for her part, haunts the area of the watersplash afterward, her last remaining savings now safe from being poured down William's throat, as is the cottage bought with *her* money but in *his* name.Inspector Bury isn't a local man, but he's young, keen, and married to a local girl; his boss hands the case over to the yard because while nobody's above the law, there's no reason for the *local* police to have to paw through the dirty linen of the Randoms on one side and Lord Burlingham on the other. Maudie's old friends Abbott and Lamb take over.Wentworth recombined various ingredients of this book a few years later to create _Poison in the Pen_, but _The Watersplash_ is a stronger story, as the romantic leads are under suspicion and in danger. The love affair aspects of Edward's life are in doubt, as are his financial prospects, and he figures as prime suspect, since Clarice had let it be known he was courting her. Most unusually, Maud lays a trap with live bait, to tempt the killer into going to the well - or the watersplash - once too often."},{"Title":"The watersplash","review":"In the 21st book (of 32) of the Miss Silver series, the author not only uses her customary settings and characters (small village, lots of people with a keen interest in gossip, a pair of young lovers whose path isn't clear) but reruns some plot devices from previous novels in the series: someone returning after a long absence who was feared dead, someone asking for Miss Silver's assistance and failing to take her excellent advice, blackmail, an invalid who has nothing wrong but a desire to be catered to. This was written very competently in 1951 when the author was about 73 and had dozens of novels to her credit, so it's an engaging and assured read. I'm not giving it 5 stars only because of the retread plot devices. It's still interesting, and the young hero, Edward, is rather more romantically mysterious than her usual sort. Another aspect that is repeated (in a different manner) from the preceding novel is that Miss Silver, an elderly retired governess, is placed in danger. The earlier books kept danger mostly off-stage, with muted details reported at second or third hand. As the series progresses, though explicit violence is toned down, more action is permitted to be seen by the reader. As is often the case, the author makes the victims deserving of their fate and does not offer any positive sides to the bad guys. This is a weakness of hers, but it is in keeping with the Victorian morals of Miss Silver, a private enquiry agent who is the epitome of moral rectitude."},{"Title":"The watersplash","review":"The Miss Silver mysteries are great British reads. I'm a big fan of Georgette Heyer and the Miss Silver mysteries have that charming quality with enchanting characters and great dialog. Read them in order as several characters make reappearances!

There has been murder done, and blackmail, as well as lots of village gossip. Miss Silver follows her nose and the gossip to uncover a particularly vicious killer. Ms. Wentworth has done an admirable job here in portraying English Village life. It's gossip that makes the world go round in this setting, and Miss Silver is not above gathering up the gossip in order to discover who has committed murder most foul. This is a very good village mystery and it is a little darker than most of Miss Silver's efforts."},{"Title":"The watersplash","review":"This is the case where we encounter not only the watersplash but also a \\"yew tunnel\\" that is said to be over eight hundred years old. Can you imagine such a thing existing in the USA? When Miss Silver is shown the tunnel by Mrs. Ball, she pays it not a single thought, for her mind is elsewhere, trying to work out the complications of the terror running through the humble village of Greenings. \\"There is a lot of tea and chatter,\\" the Inspector allows. In these cases we see the social snobbery that was Wentworth's speciality, prismed through the acutely keen gaze of Miss Silver, a relic from the Victorian era even more imaginative and superstitious than Agatha Christie's Miss Marple. \\"Miss Ora fingered the pinke edge of her shawl. 'Very interesting things can happen in a village,' she said.

This study has been dear to me. I purchased Volume 1 several years ago and then Volume 2 in 2006. I have been anxiously waiting for Volume 3 as the entire story of Job builds to a climax in the final four chapters - without the finale we fail to understand the book.I read the concluding arguments with interest and was very surprised at what seemed to be an evolution in Dr. Clines' theology that occurred between the initial volume published in 1989 and the final volume of November 2011. The \\"Argument\\" section of the introduction in Volume 1 (pg xxxvii) laid out the outline of how the Book of Job dealt with the doctrine of retribution. Here Clines looks forward to the narrator's epilogue in chapter 42 such that, \\"...the issues of the moral governance of the world and the doctrine of retribution are still on the agenda. What this concluding episode does for these issues is, surprisingly, to reinstate the dogma of retribution as the principle according to which the world operates.\\" God calling Job's friends to account for their words and demanding a sacrifice under the threat of punishment is certainly retribution according to Clines in 1989. In light of this, Clines ends the \\"Argument\\" section with the claim that the Book of Job ultimately affirms the doctrine of retribution, \\"Even if in every instance it does not explain human fates, in the main it is affirmed by the Book of Job as the truth about the moral universe.\\"This changed. Clines' views expressed in Volume 3 contradict his statements of 22 years earlier. In writing the final volume Clines now rejects the doctrine of retribution, \\"What Yahweh can and does accept is that he does not govern the world according to the dictates of retributive justice.\\" He goes on to state \\"...they (Jobs friends) in defending the doctrine of retribution, were advocates of a theology hostile to the divine designs.\\" This is a huge shift in Clines' own understanding of what he claimed were the main arguments of the Book of Job in his initial volume. In fact, in the \\"Comments\\" section specifically dealing with verses 42:7-9, Clines never even mentions his initial view that God threatening Job's friends with punishment for their words as having anything to do with the arguments regarding retributive justice. It disappears. It is almost as if the conclusion being advocated is, \\"The only place for retributive justice is to punish those who affirm retributive justice.\\" I am disappointed that the reasons for this evolution were not explored or addressed. I would have found them very interesting.I am grateful to Dr. Clines for his tenacity and diligence in making all three volumes available. They have been a significant help to me in understanding the Word of God. Thank you."},{"Title":"Job 21-37 (Word Biblical Commentary)","review":"In 1989, the first volume of David Clines' commentary on the Book of Job was published, covering the first twenty chapters. In 2006, the second volume was released, covering the book through Chapter 37. This month, after some delay (on the publisher's part, according to the book's front matter) the third and final volume is released. And Job scholar's everywhere rejoiced!Having taken two courses on the Book of Job (one as an undergrad at the University of Wisconsin and another as a grad student at Fuller), I came to appreciate David Clines as a thoughtful, engaging, and provocative scholar. That last adjective is the one I like best, particularly when dealing with Job - such a puzzling piece of ancient literature perfectly suited for deconstruction and philosophizing.The commentary series' layout is not the most user-friendly, but it is thorough and readable. In each of the three volumes comprising this monster work, Clines engages deeply into the text of Job (analyzing words, phrases, language construction, etc.), the story of Job (the setting, the social and cultural norms, the plot and direction the book takes), but also the meaning of Job (historically, ethically, and philosophically).This final volume, specifically, takes up the final portion of Job's story, beginning with Chapter 38 - \\"then the LORD spoke to Job out of the storm...\\" Along with commentary on the closing chapters of Job, Clines has included emendations and additions to the previous volumes, along with a massive (almost 250 pages) bibliography, cataloguing what must be nearly all available work on the Book of Job.Clines' reading of Job challenges the conventional notion that the Book helps readers understand the problem of evil, arguing instead that all the responses Job receives to his pleas - from his wife, from his friends, and from God - do not provide answers or reasons for suffering and pain. In closing, Clines suggests that the story of Job concludes existentially and post-theologically: Job is present with his restored life to live out his years having given up on his theological pursuits, resolving that \\"there is more to life than justice - more perhaps even than theology in general\\" (1242).Disclosure of material connection in compliance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255: I received a copy of this book for review, though the opinions I have expressed are my own."},{"Title":"Job 21-37 (Word Biblical Commentary)","review":"Though I by no means want to underscore some of the values of Clines proposals on the arrangement, I do want to point out the very unlikelihood of his presupposition. Clines thinks that 27:7-23 is in fact spoken by Sophar and that 28 is spoken by Elihu (32-37). Elihu's speech is thereupon transposed between 27 and 28. Accounting for such a great transposition he believes that a major mistake was made on a great Job-scroll, in analogy to the great Isaiah scroll. Counting the number of words in Job 1-27 and Job 32-37 and 28-31 and comparing them to the seams in the Isaiah scroll, the number of word in each column, he believes by accident Elihu's part was sawn after 28-31 to which it should have preceded. This Qumran scroll was thereupon taken by the Masoretes to compose our current book. First, we hardly have evidence that Masoretes depended so strongly on text that we have now found in Qumran and we have a lot of counterevidence instead. Second if the biblical scrolls in Qumran were adopted in the community, we should not forget the rivalry with the Jerusalem priestly class with its own temple text authority with regard to the handing down of text down to the ben Asher generation. Third and most of all, Job has been poorly preserved in Qumran. Is it more than a historical conjecture to suppose that once there was no such paucity, because there was a large scroll, that we now no longer possess?I am confident that Clines' work on Job will serve pastors and exegetes, but I would be cautious to adopt some of his proposals"},{"Title":"Job 21-37 (Word Biblical Commentary)","review":"Professor David Clines, Emeritus Professor of Biblical Studies at the University of Sheffield completes his massive commentary on Job with this tome. In the volume, Clines examines Job 38-42, Yahweh's response to Job and Job's replies. He brings his expertise in Hebrew literature to bear as he illuminates this last portion of text and the format of the Word Biblical Commentary series provides him the space to explore some difficult sections and deal with them thoroughly.As with other volumes from the series, the text is divided into appropriate sections of study. Each section opens with a specific bibliography that is followed by the author's personal translation of the original language. Subsequent to the bibliography and translation, are two sections in which the author deals with specific textual notes and issues of form and structure. These can be a bit technical but it is great for experiencing the intricacies of the Hebrew text. After spending some time specifically with the language and writing style, Clines moves into the Comment section. Here is where you find the running verse-by-verse commentary on Job. Yet, to his credit, Clines does not immediately move into verse-by-verse but rather deals with the section in smaller subsections to help the reader see the movement of the passage. Finally, comes the Explanation section where Clines sums up the work he's been doing. If you find yourself pressed for time, this is a great place to start - you'll get the flow of what he's saying and it may alert you to things you'd like to go back and study further.The sections Clines identifies here (in agreement with almost every other commentator on Job) are: 1) Yahweh's first speech, 2) Job's response, 3) Yahweh's second speech, 4) Job's response, 5) Epilogue. He argues (in his previous volume, Job 21-37, and mentioned in this volume) for a rearranged order of the speeches prior to this section. He argues that Elihu's speech in chapters 32-37 should originally came before Job's final speech in 29-31 (p. 1088), so that when the LORD asks \\"Who is this...\\" it is in reference to Job's demand for answers. Reading along as Clines analyzes the speech-response pattern of the book is delightful. One almost cannot help but be filled with greater reverence for our incredibly powerful and very personal God.Fully the last half of this volume is an extensive bibliography of possibly every written work on the book of Job as well as specific items addressed within it. Clines analyzes literature from the patristic fathers all the way up to the 21st century. He also includes works on Job in music, dance and drama. It's an incredible list.WBC is a technical commentary series and Clines certainly rises to those expectations. He does a great job of mining the riches of the language and presenting the gems of his work. He cites Biblical and extra-biblical literature in defense of his linguistic work. But he also does a nice job of (as my professor says) putting some of the cookies on the bottom shelf. It wouldn't be the first choice of commentary for a lay-person, but they would not come away from it empty-handed."},{"Title":"Job 21-37 (Word Biblical Commentary)","review":"To say the least, The Word Biblical Commentary Series is an industry standard for Bible Commentaries. It has a long history of trusted scholarship and the series is a must have for the serious student of the Bible. This volume, Job 38-42 by David Clines is no exception. This volume wraps up his commentary on the book of Job and brings excellent scholarship to the final chapters in Job. What is impressive in this volume is the extensive bibliography (about 250 pages). This volume offers the author's translation of the text and verse by verse commentary with a running dialog with other voices on this subject. There are extensive critical notes on the Hebrew text for textual criticism as well as a number of helpful excurses on difficult obscure Hebrew terms.This volume covers an incredible section of Scripture where the LORD responds to Job. Here the LORD answers Job out of the whirlwind and reminds Job of the splendor and majesty of the LORD. The response of Yahweh contains some of the most incredible descriptions of the works of God in all of the Scriptures. Cline offers insight into this section of Scripture that is helpful and makes a wonderful addition to a scholar's library.Note: I received a complimentary copy of this book through the Booksneeze program for the purpose of reviewing."},{"Title":"Job 21-37 (Word Biblical Commentary)","review":"Clines concludes his comprehensive work on Job with this volume. While the volume is large (it weighs in at slightly over 500 pages) for a commentary on five chapters of the Bible, there is much more than just commentary here. The first two hundred pages of the work focus on the Biblical text itself, providing a fresh translation as Clines works within the Hebrew text. The work, like most WBC volumes, is written in a way that scholars and pastors alike will gain benefit. There are portions that a lay level reader may struggle to grasp, but this is a necessary result from working from the original languages and using technical terms in some areas. Clines' commentary is strong, and reflects a knowledgeable and capable understanding of the scriptures. The final three hundred pages are study tools, including the usual scripture and author indexes. However, Clines does something interesting in that he includes a two hundred and fifty page Bibliography in which he lists just about everything ever written on the book of Job. The Bibliography in sorted in various ways, and includes a section sorted by subjects found within the book, which is particularly interesting. The works are listed without comment, but just the amount of resources listed is impressive.I would give Clines' commentary 4.5 out of 5 stars.I received a free copy of this book from Thomas Nelson in exchange for a fair and honest review."},{"Title":"Job 21-37 (Word Biblical Commentary)","review":"This is the third volume in David J.A. Clines's monumental study of Job. The first volume came out in 1989, the second in 2006, and though the final volume was delivered to the publisher in 2008, it has finally seen the light of day here at the end of 2011. It consists of commentary on Job 38-42 (God's response to Job, and the epilogue) in the first half of the book, and an extensive bibliography takes up the second half.The great strength of this commentary is its comprehensiveness. Perhaps no reader will agree with all of Clines's interpretive decisions, but he does a good job of laying out the possibilities before he settles on a solution. While some readers might wish that Clines would \\"get to the point\\" a bit sooner (I did feel this way on occasion), the helpful aspect is that he leaves no stone unturned. Rather than offering a conclusion without justification, he interacts with other opinions. I came away with a much deeper knowledge of these five chapters, and how they have been interpreted, than I had before.Finally, a note about the format of the commentary. I've read several reviews of various volumes in the Word series that are critical of the format. For each passage (e.g, Job 38:1-40:2), there is a bibliography, the author's translation, textual notes, notes on the form/structure/setting, verse-by-verse comment, and a final summary explanation. While the format is idiosyncratic, I think it is not so bad once you get used to it. If you are uninterested, for example, in the textual notes, they are all collected together so you can feel free to skip that section. Even if you don't care for the format, this is still a commentary worth consulting.Note: Thanks to Thomas Nelson for a review copy. I was not asked to give a positive review."},{"Title":"Job 21-37 (Word Biblical Commentary)","review":"Word Biblical CommentaryBy David ClinesJob38-42Several years ago my roommate talked me into buying the New Testament Series of the Word Biblical Commentaries. I was a little hesitant at first, but finally submitted to his guidance. Since then I would have to say, that there has never been a time that I wasn't thankful for purchasing the series. At the time I only purchased the New Testament. Looking back upon it, I wish I would've purchased the Old Testament also. I look to these commentaries frequently when writing sermons, papers, and devotional purposes. I do not always agree with everything proposed within this series, but that should be accepted when there are a few hundred thousand pages written from different denominations and biblical perspectives. There are several things I appreciate about the series. First, every author attempts to offer every perspective of interpretation on different passages. In the end the author will give his perspective on the issue. The authors tend to be fair representing the differing positions and in offering critiques. Second, I love the frequency of use of the original languages. These commentaries are both scholastic and pastoral. The commentaries definitely lean toward the scholastic bend, but there is much to glean from their interpretation and application of the passages. I would highly recommend this series, including David Clines Job Commentary.

The commentary is readable, though technical. I appreciate that the work does not use transliteration for the Hebrew text. Transliteration of texts is one of my pet peeves when it comes to commentaries.What I appreciate most about this commentary is that it is a useful tool. It provides a great starting place for further study of the text. Each section is full of bibliographical data pointing the way to other resources to read for more information.

Almost 35 years later and the Word Biblical Commentary continues on strong and is nearing its completion, even as earlier volumes are updated and revised. This long-awaited conclusion to Dr. David Clines' study of Job is a great addition to the shelves of biblical scholars both amateur and professional.This conclusion to the three volume series is more bibliography than anything, which is either a turnoff or a bonus, depending on your perspective. While the book weighs in at a hefty 500 pages and covers only four chapters of the biblical text, more than half those pages are dedicated to bibliographies and indices of the three-volume set. Virtually every known resource on the book of Job is included, to the point it is almost overwhelming. This resource is invaluable for the scholar searching for more than one point of view or reference, and while I think the bibliographies could have been made clearer, space ultimately prevented the publishers from being able to do this.As regards the commentary proper, this volume is devoted entirely to the response of Yahweh from the tempest to Job, Job's responses to God, and the book's epilogue. It handles Yahweh's explanation of his purposes in creation and an unexpected answer to the problem of pain and suffering. Each portion of text is broken into three sections that run like this:Bibliography of SectionAuthor Translation of SectionIn-depth technical notations on linguistics, followed by discussion of form/structure/settingVerse-by-verse commentaryConcluding explanationThe author translation of the section is unique, as it does not force any commentator to be tied to any one particular bible translation while also not deriving commentary straight from biblical languages. This provides a nice bridge between fully technical commentaries that deal heavily in Greek and Hebrew and nontechnical commentaries that deal strictly in an English translation. The bibliography and linguistics section comprises the \\"Academics Only\\" section of the commentary. Here be technical discussions of Hebrew and other various issues as it relates to the specific passage.The verse-by-verse commentary again serves as a bridge between fully technical and layperson accessible. This section of the book is one most generally thinks of as a commentary--expositional exegesis on the text at hand. Clines' verse-by-verse thoughts, which conclude with a couple page summary of what's been said is masterful. I don't know that I agree with all his conclusions (as he seems to imply as Yahweh's dealings with Job are unjust [p. 1242]), but his exegesis have already caused me to mull over some of the more intricate matters of translation (such as the identities of Behemoth and Leviathan). One point that Clines makes well is that Job's response to Yahweh is not all sunny and cheery and Job does not receive a great answer to the problem of injustice and evil. Instead, countered with the sovereignty of God, Job can do nothing but withdraw his argument.To conclude, Job 38-42 is an excellent commentary I'm sure I'll be returning to often as reference. If you can get past the obfuscation and complexity of the bibliographic information, there is a wealth of resources there waiting to be mined. The exegesis offers a clear perspective accessible to advanced layperson and scholar alike. It's a solid addition to the Word Biblical Commentary, a great conclusion to Clines' three volumes of Job, and a perfect way to complete the Old Testament part of the commentary set.Note: I received this book as a part of the Thomas Nelson BookSneeze program.

I've also admitted that I'm more academically than practically minded, in that I love books of an academic nature, ones that delve into the nuance of a biblical passage drawn out by the ancient languages they were originally written in, hence I've much enjoyed my latest read, Job 38-42 of the Word Biblical Commentary written by David J.A. Clines.I'll admit from the onset that I know very little about the author of this work beyond the background information presented in the front flap of the book, yet by reading the book one quickly comes to the conclusion that Clines is a first rate biblical scholar and exegete. I only wish I had the first two volumes on Job to get a complete picture of this momentous work. I first came into contact with the \\"Word\\" series of commentaries while a student in Bible College, and I have always appreciated their scholarly approach to scripture, only the price tag ($40-50 per volume) kept me from adding them to my library.In this volume ( 3 of 3) Clines covers the later portion of the book of the book of Job; chapters 38-42. In the text we find God's first speech (38:1- 40:2) Job's first reply (40:3-5) God's second speech (40:6-41:34) and Job's second reply (42:1-6) followed by the Epilogue (42:7-17) in all aspects Clines does a masterful job with the text.There are several aspects of this book that lends it to my liking.(1) The Explanation Section at the end of each chapter provides a clear insight into the meaning of the text. It's not overly academic, as to appeal to the novice researcher, yet when taken with the other sections; it's of high academic standards, as to appeal to the advanced researcher... the best of both worlds.(2)This is not a translated work from another language. Though I've been blessed by many works of foreign writers, this work was done in the English language, and therefore avoids any pit-falls that may come from any \\"lost in translation\\" type issues.(3)The commentators prepare their own translation of the text. I especially like this aspect of the commentary because it allows one to see the text with new eyes on biblical Hebrew. What the text loses in continuity (one text throughout, eg. NIV or NASB) it makes up in perspective.(4)The general appearance and set-up of the book. From the onset it looks confusing, and jumbled, and for some this will be a \\"turn-off,\\" but there is a method behind the madness, and I love it. It allows for a person to find all information on a particular passage... be it references, language issues, or commentary. It's all there in one place, and there is something for everyone.(5)But beyond all that the thing that makes this book most appealing to me is the extensive, and I mean extensive bibliography (250 pg.) that is included in the book. It looks to contain everything or most everything of substance that's ever been written on the book of Job, and I would have purchased it simply for this feature!This book may not be for everyone, but for a serious student of Scripture it's a worthwhile investment, if you can afford it. As with the other books in this series, the scholarship is superb, and is what one would expect under the leadership of the late Bruce Metzger. Though one (myself included) may not agree with all the conclusions drawn, it's a work that encourages critical thinking, and promotes textual understanding. So with everything taken together I highly recommend this book to the public at large.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their \\"booksneeze program.\\" I was not required to write a positive review.

Before addressing this individual volume, it's worth considering this series as a whole.The \\"Editorial Preface\\" identifies three unique qualities (or, perhaps, goals) of these series. First, to be evangelical in the \\"historic sense of a commitment to Scripture as divine revelation and to the truth and power of the Christian gospel.\\" Second, the commentaries are written for the English language and biblical texts are given a fresh translation by the scholar (so new reliance on NIV or ESV, etc.). Finally, the series seeks to provide multiple layers of study. For example, if you're a pastor in need of some extra preaching insights, you can move straight to the \\"Comment\\" section. If you want deep textual and word analysis, then this, too, is provided.While I have found the Word Biblical Commentary series to be commendable, I think that final goal is obscured by the layout of the commentaries. Pages and pages are filled throughout the book with bibliographies and footnotes. I find this to be needlessly complex. A complete bibliography and footnotes could be relegated to the back of the book. Even when writing extensive exegetical papers in divinity school, I rarely made it through the complicated bibliographic listings. It's needless confusion that obscures fruitful insight.As for this second volume of David J. A. Cline's commentary on the Old Testament book of Job, I found it wonderful and insightful. This volume begins with Job 38, the start of Yahweh's response to Job. I don't know Hebrew, so I cannot comment on the accuracy of Cline's fresh translations into English, but they are refreshing. I was already impressed within the first few pages of his \\"Comments\\" at the depth of insight arising from his attention to detail and the overarching connection of those details. This should be a powerful tool for those studying Job.My only complaint is again the layout of the commentary set as a whole. It's frustrating to have the fresh English translation separated from the \\"Comments\\" section by pages of footnotes. Moreover, this thick (and somewhat intimidating in appearance) book is actually just over 200 pages of commentary. The rest is - you guessed it - bibliography and footnotes. A redesign could've trimmed and repackaged for a one volume (or slimmer two volume) entry.Regardless, this series and this volume is worth your time!*****This book was provided by Thomas Nelson Publishers for the sole purpose of review as part of its booksneeze program."},{"Title":"Job 21-37 (Word Biblical Commentary)","review":"Job 38-42 (Word Biblical Commentary 18B)The Word Biblical Commentary delivers the best in biblical scholarship, from the leading scholars of our day.

His numerous publications include The Theme of the Pentateuch (1978), What Does Eve Do to Help?(1990) and Interested Parties: The Ideology of Writers and Readers of the Old Testament (1995) as well as a major three-volume commentary on Job in the Word Biblical Commentary series (1989-2009). He is editor of The Dictionary of Classical Hebrew, the sixth volume of which was published in 2007.All three commentaries on the book of Job look like this:vol. 17 covers chapters 1-20 ISBN: 0849902169vol. 18A covers chapters 21-37 ISBN: 0849902177vol. 18B covers chapters 38-42 ISBN: 0785252673This newest volume is strictly focused on the end of Job, God's answers. It's wonderful to have this volume now (2011) considering the previous volume was written five years ago (2006). Even though you'd probably only expect to find these books in a pastor's library, the language is easy to read and simple enough for a non-technical reader. Clines does a wonderful job unlocking the major themes of Job and the notes, scholarship and commentary he gives to each chapter brilliantly bring together the various voices we have grown so familiar with over the years of reading this book.With the addition of this volume to the other 2 books on Job, 18B contains a 250 page bibliography of virtually everything that has been written about Job until now.With Job being an often misunderstood, or confusing book, Clines does a wonderful job unlocking these scriptures and bringing it all to life."},{"Title":"Job 21-37 (Word Biblical Commentary)","review":"David J.A. Clines is considered to be a top-notch biblical scholar and after some 20+ years his commentary set on the book of Job has been concluded in the Word Biblical Commentary18b: Job 38-42. To give a review of Clines work after considering this concluding piece would be like watching the final half hour ofThe Lord of the Ringsand offering up comments. Yet even a cursory overview can shed some light on the overall weight and direction of this work, as well as its usefulness.I would venture to say this concluding commentary speaks to the most interesting material in the book of Job, save perhaps for the first chapter which sets up the sorry state in which Job lives through most of the book. Clines shows his scholarship in his translation from the Hebrew of the chapters, along with translation notes that rival and may even surpass those of the NET Bible.Although Clines is a scholar and this work is very thorough (the bibliography for the three-volume set on Job takes up half the book), he does stray from commonly-accepted understandings of the overall meaning and purpose of the book. I would say his excellent analysis of the \\"trees\\" has caused him to miss the \\"forest\\". He summarizes the result of the discourse between God and Job this way:\\"Job is neither triumphant nor defeated. The divine speeches have in the end neither satisfied nor humiliated him. It is almost as if Yahweh had not spoken from the tempest, for Job has chosen not to hear in the divine speeches the sunny side of the world's structure and management, and he has learned nothing except to have his worst fears confirmed that he will not get justice from God. No doubt he is better off knowing where he stands and having nothing left to hope for.\\"In the end, Clines argues that Job gives up his quest for an answer to suffering and evil and instead lives his life to the fullest. His conclusions miss the point, and goes to show that a scholarly work is definitely helpful for understanding, but is not our final authority on matters of faith and practice: Sola Scriptura!I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their Booksneeze book review program. I was not obligated to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are mine."},{"Title":"Job 21-37 (Word Biblical Commentary)","review":"The above reviews refer to the first 2 vols. of the series (not Vol 3 as pictured above). Vol. 3 Job 38-42 has not been published yet! It is projected (most recently) to be published on April 20, 2010. I hope so as the other vols are great in terms of working with the Hebrew text."},{"Title":"Job 21-37 (Word Biblical Commentary)","review":"Dr. Clines' two volumes on Job* (Thomas Nelson) bring to a conclusion his monumental study of the Book of Job, a work begun more than 15 years ago (Job 1-20). With a thoroughgoing exegesis characteristic of his endeavors in volume one, Clines unpacks the numerous linguistic challenges that Job presents to the modern reader. Though indispensable to the scholar, these two volumes are not necessarily inaccessible to laymen. Included in the third volume on Job (Job 38-42 (Word Biblical Commentary); to be published next year, is a 200-page index to all three volumes."},{"Title":"Uresia: Grave Of Heaven (BESM)","review":"Five stars and deserving of everyone one, even on Ross' own scale (five being, &quot;I want to run it now&quot; to one, being &quot;sorry, no&quot;), this is a fun setting. With Uresia, Ross takes the console RPG game/Japanese fantasy anime and returns it to it's table top RPG roots. Uresia owes more to Slayers! and Record of the Lodoss Wars than to Tolkein. It's a world where deadly monsters hold an elven kingdom in thrall and where satry pirates stage panty raids on passenger ships.This book is typical of the BESM sourcebooks, relatively short, direct, and to the point (personally, I could have gone with twice the book easily, it's a fun setting to read about). This brings me to the one thing I think this setting has over a number of others I've seen over the years: fun. This world looks a blast to play in, where deadly drama can give way madcap happenings in the blink of an eye. Ross encourages that style of play, as it's right out of the source material.While epic's are possible to play, they're not manditory. A good game could be had where the players investigate the local surroundings, and defend there homes, or if epic is your favorite style, they canb go on great quests to protect the world from evil, or maybe they just sail around to ports, delivering cargo, and doing odd jobs, just travelling around... ;) (Two geek points for getting that reference, it's easy).The world is a very open ended place, and well thought out. For once, there's actual a logical reason (well, a reason anway, it involves gods, and when the gods get involved, logic is often left to the wayside) for dungeons to be there, and for dungeon crawls. The lack of gods also means that the fate of the world is in the hands of its people, for all the bad and good, they have no one but themselves to blame. This open ended nature extends to races, character types, and homelands, in the console game tradition.Physically, the book is well put together (as is to be expected of GoO), and the artwork first rate. Ross did the maps, and like the rest of the book, it shows what a labor of love this world is for him. As such, Ross will be publishing supplementary material through his in house imprint, Cumberland Games. Currently there are plans for a closer look at pirates, and you can download the fonts he used on the book, including runes, and map items so you can make your own Uresian style maps.If you want a fun world to play in, this is the best I've seen in a long, long time. BESM is an easy system to use, so the rules details won't get in the way. Even if you don't like BESM, buy this book anyway to mine it for ideas, if you're a gm, you owe it to yourself."},{"Title":"National Guide to Expert Witness Fees and Billing Procedures","review":"This book was not exactly what I expected. I expected more narrative and less statistical reporting. I wanted detailed written input as to procedures already in practice by experts , and also how to identify pricing schedules and contracting policies that will work for you. I did not gleen very much from this book."},{"Title":"National Guide to Expert Witness Fees and Billing Procedures","review":"The information in this book is available on the net in other areas and not for the high price I paid for the book. The information is not what is touted in the advertisement. I would advise anyone to be forgo purchasing this item."},{"Title":"National Guide to Expert Witness Fees and Billing Procedures","review":"This is an excellent resource for expert witnesses and those that use their services. If you are not in one of those two groups, it may not be useful to you. If you are in those groups, the detailed information is well worth the cost. In fact, if you put just a few of the ideas into action, it may save you many, many times the cost of the book. It is no wonder that so many copies of this niche book have been sold."},{"Title":"Symbols of Love","review":"This book is comprehensive, very informative, and very interesting. And, it will save you the time of surfing through dozens of Valentine websites that give inaccurate information on love symbols.The book takes a look at the obvious love symbols, like the heart, and obscure items that most people probably wouldn't even think of, like rice or shoes tied at the back of a newly married couple's car, and traces their history back to ancient times, various cultures, and traditions. It also provides information on the courtship traditions and wedding rituals of various countries.I bought this a week before Valentine's Day, and it definitely got me into the spirit of the holiday. A great gift for a significant other or loved one."},{"Title":"Symbols of Love","review":"I got this book as a wedding gift, and have since given it as a wedding gift countless times. I inserted my wedding photo in the back to personalize it which makes it that much more special. On many a rainy Sunday afternoon I can be found curled up on the sofa lazily flipping through the pages of \\"Symbols of Love,\\" getting nostalgic (and sometimes teary) over those that hit close to home."},{"Title":"Women's Voices in Experiential Education","review":"This book gives voice to and celebrates women in the field of experiential education, specifically, and education in general. It's a great resource not just for women in education, but for anyone who is interested in the fields of EE, outdoor education, adventure education, environmental ed and more. The book's editor, Karen Warren, has been a leader in the field of Experiential Eduation for more than 20 years. Her fields of study and expertise include outdoor leadership, diversity, EE methodology, and social and environmental justice. Warren, a former Association for Experiential Education Board Member, carefully selected contributors who are experts in the field to pen chapters for this book.Any women's studies, outdoor ed or environmental ed program or student would do well to reference this book."},{"Title":"Chernobyl and Other Nuclear Accidents (New Perspectives (Raintree))","review":"My father-in-law was a nuclear physicist, my father and brother engineers for the US gov't. I found this book to be excellent background for laymen. I am not an engineer-merely an author, reader and dentist. This book has become required reading for my kids and nieces."},{"Title":"Chernobyl and Other Nuclear Accidents (New Perspectives (Raintree))","review":"This book hits some good points. It has alot of good things to say and it would be great for a kid just starting to read. It talks about the shear devastation that handling accidents with nucleur power and some day how we will be able to handle nuclear energy better. So I think this is a good book to read."},{"Title":"Quick-Simmering Soups (Better Homes and Gardens(R): Fresh and Simple)","review":"My wife often buys me cookbooks that I wouldn't think of, with mixed results. THIS one became an instant favourite. Gorgeous fonts and use of color; perfect layout - mostly a photo on one page (for us visual-oriented males ;-), and the complete recipe on the facing page. Most important: very tasty, visually-appealing, and quick recipes.There is nothing in the book that isn't a photograph or recipe, yet I still think of it more as a COOKBOOK than a recipe book -- after you've made a few of the soups, you'll find yourself absorbing and adopting the common philosophy behind all these recipes. Even the photographs suggest new ways of making and serving soup.I hardly need the actual book any more -- I just head off to the produce section and grab whatever is freshest and most appealing.Favourite recipes? Out of the 60-odd here, I haven't found a dud yet."},{"Title":"Quick-Simmering Soups (Better Homes and Gardens(R): Fresh and Simple)","review":"The books in this series are wonderful. The crab chowder, Middle Eastern sausage and bean stew and curried mushroom tortolloni soup are tasty and satisfying without having to stand at the stove a long time, so you don't have to wait till a day off to make them. Tip: the first time you make them, the recipes will take just a few minutes longer than the book says."},{"Title":"Quick-Simmering Soups (Better Homes and Gardens(R): Fresh and Simple)","review":"I like this cookbook so much that I bought a dozen of them to give as gifts to best friends and family. The recipes meet two major needs. First, when I'm exhausted and hungry and want real food, these soups can be made in 30 minutes with a minimum of fuss. Second, the results are amazingly complex in flavor. There is something restorative about the combination of little effort and great results. Don't mess with the recipes the first time around. You'll be surprised how good they are. Some of the ingredients will not be regular inhabitants of your larder, so pick out a few soups you want to try every week and buy the ingredients to have on hand. Because of the short cooking time, the recipes call for fresh herbs added last thing, but if you don't have any just add dried herbs with the liquid ingredients and you will get good results."},{"Title":"Quick-Simmering Soups (Better Homes and Gardens(R): Fresh and Simple)","review":"The soups in this book are delicious, healthy and simple to make. Most of the soups here have a good mix of meat or fish and different kinds of vegetables, are light and healthy, and it's really easy to make. Of the receipes I've tried, it takes less than 30 min prep time after the 3 try (by then I'm familiar with the receipes), and thne just let it simmer. I've tried 5 soups over the past 2 years (I'm not a great cook.) and everyone loved them. My roommate who's a great cook loved my receipes so much so I bought another copy for her as a gift. Also one nice thing about this book, is that there is a color picture for most of the soups, so you can pick out what you want just by flipping through instead of having to read the receipes."},{"Title":"The National Directory of Haunted Places","review":"I love how everything is listed by States, so you can just flip to the state you live in and check out the haunted places listed there.

He then begins to explain in detail the four most common hooks that the devil uses in our teens lives, how they can identify and avoid these mistakes, and what parents need to be doing to make sure their children stay protected.This curriculum contains a lot of practical application and wisdom drawn from years of experience in the ministry, and clearly shows Schmidt's dedication to helping teens through their journey to adulthood.David Scott~This review was originally posted at [..]"},{"Title":"Hook, Line and Sinker: How the Enemy Is Dividing and Destroying the Christian Family","review":"This is a great book for teens and parents to read.

The Alaska Lands Act saved more than 100 million acres in national parks, wildlife refuges and wilderness areas. The author traces the story of this law from its roots in the 1960s to its enactment in 1980. This book amazed me with its rich and accurate details about the work done by conservation groups, ranging from Alaska grassroots groups to the national Alaska Coalition. (I was a minor player in this campaign in the early years and later was an observer from my job in the Department of the Interior.)The author has a rare understanding of how citizen groups function. He describes how people from diverse backgrounds and different generations, with diverse skills, can pool their efforts to produce a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.The author tells much about the interactions among the crucial players working to save wild Alaska: Alaskan conservation activists, national conservation leaders, the two crucial congressional leaders John Seiberling and Morris Udall, Secretary of the Interior Cecil Andrus, and President Jimmy Carter. He gives credit to the millions of people all over the country who wrote letters, spoke at public hearings, and buttonholed their congressmembers.\\"Northern Landscapes\\" is worthwhile reading for anyone who wants to help save wild places. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is constantly threatened by boomers proposing oil drilling, and the rain forest of the Tongass National Forest still needs more defenders. From Maine to California, each of us in our own part of the United States can find wild places worth saving, and we can join hands with local groups who are organizing to save them."},{"Title":"The Celts (Ancient peoples and places)","review":"This book is the standard by which I judge all others. Well written, informative and not as dry as some others of this type, &quot;The Celts&quot; is a scholarly work with none of the romanticism that is found in so many recent books about the Celts.If you are trying to understand what the Celts were really like, how they lived and what the world was like during their time, this is an excellent book to start with.If you are interested in the modern interpretations of the ancient Celtic religions, this book will give you some of the factual background that is lacking in many writings."},{"Title":"The Celts (Ancient peoples and places)","review":"For starters, this book will be celebrating its golden anniversary in three years. Originally published in 1958, it was reorganized two decades later (posthumously, from the author's standpoint) for the Ancient People, Ancient Places Series. The material has NOT been updated or revised, although more pictures were added, and Stuart Piggott graced us with a new Preface.This is NOT an ideal first book on the Celts, as it is dated and some of the ideas seem ambiguous and/or unsubstantiated; however, I would highly recommend it as supplementary reading to someone who has already been well immersed in the subject matter.The book is well-illustrated and full of photos. Powell has some fascinating viewpoints and brilliant insights, even tackling the terms 'Celt', 'German' and 'Teuton'. The book is fairly easy to read, although there is a density of ideas that sometimes requires a re-read of various paragraphs.On the down side, however, the author sometimes seems to be 'away with the fairies' in that not all of his insights are well substantiated, either within the book or outside of it. He over-generalizes in some places, not specifying which Celts or of when he is speaking. Simply put, Celts living near the Rhine in 500 BC are not identical to British Celts in 500 AD; generalizations are rarely appropriate for this long-lived and widespread 'group'.Powell does 'show his age' by abusing the comma in ways that are no longer allowed in proper writing form. He plays the 'Name Game', where all words that look or sound similar must have some causal link.Celtic mythology is not his strong suit, as he struggles to make his case for a possible triplicity link for the Dagda and Lug; earlier in the book he refers to the Morrigan as &quot;the Queen of Demons&quot;, definitely an interpretation made from a Christian standpoint, and not quite appropriate to the subject material.This book desperately needs revision. A clear chronology would work also.Before buying this one, you should probably consider Ronald Hutton's &quot;Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles&quot;, Peter Berresford Ellis' &quot;The Celtic Empire&quot; and &quot;The Druids&quot;, Barry Raftery's &quot;Pagan Celtic Ireland&quot; and even A.F. Harding's &quot;European Societies in the Bronze Age&quot;."},{"Title":"The Celts (Ancient peoples and places)","review":"I have just put down this difficult read. While Mr. Powell is clearly knowledgable,in this book he has enjoyed an orgy of complex, disjointed sentences that make his subject a frustration to follow. This book is a series of: paragraph-long sentences, interrupted by multiple commas, and the clauses they introduce. It is like reading a book poorly translated from another language. I get the impression that he is one of those revered old professorial types, in love with their own thinkingprocesses and voice, and out of touch with their audience. I strongly urge Mr. Powell to refresh his English writing skills. His style is horrible archaic and unnecessarily alienates the reader."},{"Title":"The Celts (Ancient peoples and places)","review":"Certainly not an introduction, or something you read in a day or start reading and can't put down, but it contains a powerful ammount of information of the Celts, particularly focusing on social structure and pagan religion. Lots of good photos, often depicting torques and other ancient Celtic treasures."},{"Title":"The Celts (Ancient peoples and places)","review":"This is an old book about older things but it is still relevant. The book has been updated and the photographs were extremely interesting and important. But it is not a picture book. The breath of the author's knowledge is amazing. One of the great book on ancient Europe and archeology."},{"Title":"Option Market Making: Trading and Risk Analysis for the Financial and Commodity Option Markets","review":"Baird's \\"Option Market Making\\" is the *other* essential options book that any serious practitioner should read. Whether you are buy-side or sell-side, or trading your own book, this work is fundamental and extends where Hull leaves off. In short, pricing models do not a bid-offer spread make, and Baird illuminates this dark world with the well-crafted sunshine of expertise, mathematical rigor, and experience. In addition, Baird's prose is clean, clear, readable and lean, without glossing over tough spots or ignoring extremes.Baird's 1993 \\"Option Market Making\\" while a bit dated, is becoming recognized as an enduring classic. Not because it is up-to-date with the latest smile dynamics from the research of Avellenada or Rebenato, but because it does what it does very well. Like a classic cookbook such as The Joy of Cooking, this work tells you how to make perfect pot roast, but not the latest slow braised chipolte-rubbed hand-aged hanger steak.Baird's \\"Option Market Making\\", indeed, is an economic anomaly, for it refutes an old chestnut: \\"those who can't do, teach.\\" In the financial publishing world a book that makes or saves you money should not exist, since the expected return of taking the time and work for authorship is much lower than another economic activity (probably including flipping hamburgers). What motivated Baird? Who knows? But this is pure saved gold here.Option neophytes should not be misled: this is not a book of \\"secrets of\\" that will lead you to quick easy riches in the sometimes wild swings of delta and gamma in options markets. Rather, this is a sober, careful, useful book on the actual difficulty of making a market under uncertainty and rapidly changing information sets. This is a work for practitioners and professionals who want to survive and thrive, not \\"*just*drive!*\\" Cowboys and \\"feelings\\" punters look elsewhere to scratch your itch.Standout chapters include \\"Options Risk\\" which treats delta, gamma, lambda, theta, kappa/vega, rho, skew, and time spread risks in a clear, although direct and quick, manner. \\"Position Risk Profiles\\" covers the meat and potatoes of an options market maker: what is in your book at any one time. This chapter mercifully is not in a \\"panic mode\\" tone, but rather carefully and soberly guides you through essentials of risk determination for your entire book.The chapter \\"On Strategy\\" will be helpful for punters and those who have committed some capital to being a market maker, covering delta neutrality (yawn!), but more importantly time spreading, expiration, Fences, and high volatility periods (yeah!). It also treats broker order flow and open interest analysis in a sober way (\\"saucer bottom\\" and \\"reverse hook\\" technical analysis copter beanies need not apply).The chapter \\"Market Making Tactics\\" is perhaps the most aggressive, but it also patiently spells out what option market makers do on a daily basis. The entry on \\"common mistakes\\" alone is worth the price of this volume. Baird closes with a lighter \\"Observations from the Floor,\\" which it behooves all to read nd revist upon occasion. Having worked in a pit myself, all I can say is \\"amen Brother, and again I say amen.\\""},{"Title":"Option Market Making: Trading and Risk Analysis for the Financial and Commodity Option Markets","review":"Not for the speculative trader. Baird explains neutrality and hedging scenarios in great detail. Explains some esoteric concepts rarely discussed, such as time spread risk and delta drift. Very succinct explanation on arb spreads and combos, and the tendency to trade to the pin at expiration. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Option Market Making: Trading and Risk Analysis for the Financial and Commodity Option Markets","review":"Although this book is not for beginners, it doesn't contain any formulas. Instead it focuses on all the complex aspects of making a market for options. I've read this book over and over again on a regular interval to remind me on the way market makers do their practice, and how to avoid the pitfalls in trading against specialists."},{"Title":"Option Market Making: Trading and Risk Analysis for the Financial and Commodity Option Markets","review":"I highly recommend this book for a basic, clean, non-pretentious presentation of option trading from a market maker's point of view. Baird can also write English: very clear, linear, simple prose. The man has no axes to grind or ego trips to take, and he knows what he's talking about, and gives very practical advice."},{"Title":"Option Market Making: Trading and Risk Analysis for the Financial and Commodity Option Markets","review":"Anytime anyone is willing to credibly tell you what he does to make money over the long run with well defined low-risk strategies you should listen because casinos, banks, and insurance companies certainly do. The author implies a positive expectation to option trading and those who make a living doing it would agree. The book has a conversational read and has something for the novice to the successful option trader. Highlights are: Delta neutral trading, gamma scalping, the use of spreads to enter, lay off risk and adjust, and emphasizes long volatility trading. The title of the book has probably disuaded more traders from buying the book because it is equally benefical to those who are not option market makers."},{"Title":"Option Market Making: Trading and Risk Analysis for the Financial and Commodity Option Markets","review":"Clear and to the point. Nice briefings on difficult subject.

Pabrai has hundreds of millions under management, yet works with only a single secretary / assistant, reads a lot, and takes naps a lot, resting in the conviction of his concentrated, long-term positions.In this Pabrai is a living counterpoint to one of his favorite Pascal quotes, \\"All man's miseries derive from not being able to sit in a quiet room alone.\\" That is the type of observation that either resonates deeply or not at all. For me it definitely does.I think Pabrai has much to offer by way of example, and I appreciate the nuggets of wisdom in this slim tome. However, I was disappointed by a few glaring instances of sloppy thinking here and there. For someone who vigorously highlights a commitment to latticework and the use of multidisciplinary thinking, some of the assertions in Mosaic were a bit breezy, with one or two real howlers thrown in. I do not highlight them because they indelibly mar the book, but because they were so surprising in an otherwise thoughtful text.For example: in an essay on the folly of shorting, Pabrai does not just make known his distaste for shorting, he argues that shorting stocks makes no sense under any circumstance whatsoever. This is an extreme view that is defeated by simple evidence--that evidence being the number of successful funds who have made their shorting activity a consistent profit center, with track records to prove it. Not only have numerous long / short managers navigated the short side successfully, a bonus for profit-oriented shorts is a volatility damping effect on the portfolio, as short positions help offset hurting longs in market declines.There is a strong empirical disconnect here; if shorting is a bad idea and doesn't work, then why has it worked well for a statistically significant number of practitioners over a statistically meaningful period of time? And how is it useful to say stocks return 8-10% a year \\"on average\\" without acknowledging the fact that future returns hinge greatly on present valuations, that industries or even whole sectors can go into multi-year decline as the rest of the market rises, and that stocks have seen flat to negative returns in the past, inflation adjusted, for years or even decades at a time?On a more puzzling note, an example Pabrai gives to show why shorting is dangerous makes little sense. He starts with a hypothetical overvalued company at $1 billion market cap and 100 million shares outstanding, then goes on to show how the shorts could get \\"hosed\\" (his term) if the company chose to do a secondary offering of 500 million additional shares, adding the offering cash to its books to raise intrinsic value.The reason this example is ludicrous is because it blithely assumes the successful absorption of a huge offering at the going market price, even as the total number of shares balloons by five hundred percent! If a company out there really tried to flood the market with five additional shares for each one currently outstanding--without compelling reason to do so--it would be an absolute field day for the shorts, as new supply would overwhelm existing market demand. (Not to mention the obvious question, if small overvalued companies could raise their intrinsic values simply by slinging new shares for quick cash, why don't they do it more often? Because unjustified secondaries don't fly, that's why.) This example showed a glaring lack of regard for simple supply and demand mechanics, and some other elements of the \\"don't short\\" argument were hastily put together and borderline superstitious.I also had a bone to pick with the assertion that entrepreneurs are not risk takers. It's possible that they are arbitrageurs and risk takers simultaneously... but to suggest that entrepreneurs are not risk takers at all is over the top. Pabrai says that Bill Gates \\"faced uncertainty and ambiguity, but not risk,\\" because Gates had the comfort of knowing he could go back to Harvard if Microsoft failed. Speaking later of a fictional hairdresser with plans to start a new hair salon, Pabrai says she has \\"virtually no risk\\" because \\"if the venture fails, she can simply go back to working at another salon.\\"No risk? Not quite. Starting an enterprise with your own credit on the line, and making it run on blood, sweat, and tears, is typically a high-risk proposition no matter what one's fallback options are. There is a massive time and energy cost to factor in, not to mention financial cost, emotional cost, and family cost. Yes, Bill Gates had Harvard as a fallback. But what if Microsoft had fizzled out after four grueling years of 90 hour weeks? Four years of life thrown away, and possible bankruptcy to boot, is somehow no big deal?The example of the riskless hair salon is even more detached from reality; Gates at least had an idea what he was getting into. Pabrai should read \\"The E Myth\\" by Michael Gerber: small mom and pop type businesses are notorious for tearing would be entrepreneurs apart, because the myriad challenges of running a small business are so often underestimated. Even if the fictional hairdresser can go back to another salon, she might do so with destroyed finances, destroyed relationships, and an ulcer on top. The risk of sailing out into the open seas is real.Moving on, this paragraph bowled me over, especially since it came in reference to a 'circle of competence' test: \\"Most readers use Intel and Microsoft products directly on a daily basis. Most of us use Cisco's products indirectly each time we go on the Internet or a network within the workplace. It's fair to say that most readers understand these three businesses quite well.\\"Quite well? How many people know the first thing about the logistics of the semiconductor business, just because there is an Intel chip hidden in their PC? How many understand the even more complex guts of the router / internet backbone business (I'm not even sure what the proper terminology is) just because they use Cisco's products inadvertently to surf the web? Understanding the deeper dynamics of a company like Intel, let alone Cisco, is far outside the circle of competence for most non-tech savvy investors, regardless of the ubiquity of INTC and CSCO products--which is a great example of why Warren Buffett, Pabrai's hero, doesn't mess with technology!The missteps are all the more head-scratching considering that Pabrai runs a hedge fund, so he should know about share price mechanics; he founded a successful company, so he should know about the risk-laden aspects of entrepreneurialism; and he worked in the tech industry for years, so he should know the average joe has little knowledge of what goes on under the hood.Let me close by saying I really did like this book, and Pabrai's personal success as a man doing what he loves (not to mention the excellent success of the Pabrai Funds) is both motivating and inspiring. The book gave me a sense of looking at the world through a traditional value investor's eyes, not to mention an interesting idea or two, and that made it a more than worthwhile read. My stringent criticism comes in part because I too am a mental model / latticework junkie, as Pabrai is, and I feel that us multidisciplinary guys should appreciate being held to the highest standards. Iron sharpening iron and such."},{"Title":"Mosaic: Perspectives on Investing","review":"This book is a good read for every value investor. Pabrai has done an excellent job of distilling the Warren Buffett method of investing down to a few key points. These points are made in a series of articles he authored for various newsletters and web sites between 2001 and 2003 (the book reprints these articles in reverse chronological order).The great thing about Pabrai is that, using methods learned from studying Warren Buffett, he has started his own fund that has been highly successful over a number of years. The fact he has been able to implement what he discusses gives him special credibility, IMHO, and it certainly differentiates him from many other authors who have studied Buffett.The book itself is deceivingly short, consisting of only 138 pages, each discussing a specific point of interest to the author. Some of the more interesting points I found were why not to invest in retailers, \\"Pabrai's law of large numbers,\\" discussions of how to identify good management, and a review of how to compute the intrinsic value of a company. This latter point would probably be of interest to many investors, since Wall Street analysts typically use extremely complicated formulas involving anticipated sales, costs, etc. Pabrai's method, which presumably reflect Buffett's as well, is to come up with a reasonable adjusted free cash flow, project forward for 10 years, discounted at the risk free rate, and apply a terminal value. Simple and, in its own way, elegent.I am surprised that more people have not read or commented on the author's work, particularly since he's coming out with a new book, Dhandho Investing, in April 2007. While I wish the book was longer and more detailed, I also appreciate Pabrai's point that investing does not need to be complicated. A longer book would have likely detracted from that message.In many respects, this short, simple book is one of the better books on investing that I have read."},{"Title":"Mosaic: Perspectives on Investing","review":"This is an exceptional little book. The author, Mohnish Pabrai, an Entreprenuer turned Value Investor, provides deep insights and simple truths to valuing businesses. He has the clear knack and ability to see a business well into the future (ex: HP/Compaq merger) and can relate it to his personal experience. His lucid analysis always proves that 'basic truths' of success and failures of a company are always the simplest."},{"Title":"Mosaic: Perspectives on Investing","review":"Mohnish Pabrai is still largely unknown on Wall Street, though I have a feeling from reading this book that his lack of notoriety won't last long. Pabrai is among the most promising of a new generation of value investors, following in the footsteps of Ben Graham, Warren Buffett, Walter Schloss, and Bill Ruane, and his track record, while relatively short at just 5 years, is superb. In this book, a collection of Pabrai's published writings for the Motley Fool. TheStreet.com, Silicon India, as well as a few unpublished selections, we begin to see why. Pabrai writes with insight on the difference in priority and philosophy between investors and CEOs; on the dangers of low-probability events in investing; and on decoding the DNA of a company when analyzing investments, among many other topics. These are mostly short form essays, so don't buy this book expecting a structured dissertation on &quot;The Mohnish Pabrai Way,&quot; but it's an elightening read nonetheless, and well worth the price and the time to read.Most likely, this book only scratches the surface of what Pabrai can teach other investors, and I certainly look forward to follow up efforts from him."},{"Title":"Mosaic: Perspectives on Investing","review":"I discovered Pabrai in the pages of Forbes, which reported that he bought Frontline at $ 3.00, and now FRO is around $ 40.00. The book is very deep in common sense and I discovered some interesting books mentioned inside that will help me to improve my \\"mental models\\" for analysing future investments. Pabrai dislikes to shorting stocks, I disagree, because sometimes it is possible to do a short with little risk. My approach is what I call \\"an event-driven short\\", and so far I don't have any trouble with it. Templeton applyed a similar approach when he shorted a basket of tech stocks in 2000, but all of them had a common feature: the lock up period for the insiders to sell their shares will finish in a few days. The book shows that Buffett et alli teachings could be mastered if we have discipline, patience and commitment. Pabrai offers a model for individual investors that want manage their own investments using a \\"safe and cheap\\" approach."},{"Title":"Mosaic: Perspectives on Investing","review":"I highly recommend this book for providing a simple toolset and examples of how to evaluate whether to invest. The author, a technology start-up entrepreneur and money manager, has successfully applied the teachings of the masters: Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, Peter Lynch, and John Templeton to his own investing. Over the past four years in a compilation of 26 succinct articles, the author takes the reader through various lessons of how to value a business, evaluate management, think about corporate culture, the dichotomy of risk vs. uncertainty (they are not the same), assessing the competitive advantages of businesses, and the personality traits of successful CEO's. Since his experience includes a technology background, it is enlightening to learn how he applies the value approach to investing in technology companies. Also, interesting is his critique of the difference between how analysts on Wall Street view the world in linear terms vs. how CEOs evaluate their companies--if only the world fit neatly into spread sheets when evaluating an investment!Thus, the successful investor needs a mosaic of mental models to examine potential investments. This method is contrasted to the way a typical Wall Street MBA with plenty of analytical firepower falls into the trap of extrapolating the recent past into eternity. Mr. Pabrai gives the reader a viewpoint of how a businessman applies a broad framework to evaluating a company as an investment. If investors thought hard about understanding a company as a business and determined the intrinsic value per share of that business, then many tears and heartaches could be avoided.This book may not be for the novice investor. Though the author's theory of discounting future free cash flows using an appropriate discount rate is rock solid in theory, its application is difficult to apply. Beginners may not know the definition of free cash flow or realize the danger of using terminal values in their calculations. The author does point out the risks of using assumptions and why there is a need for a large margin of safety when investing, but many of the important metrics of how to assess a business like marginal returns on invested capital and enterprise value vs. ROIC are not mentioned. Some of the articles overlap, so the reader will have to grind through several of the same examples used in the description of how to value companies.Finally, I wished the author in his introduction gave the reader more of a personal understanding of his investment journey. In the acknowledgements section of this book, the author admits to being misaligned before getting to know himself. Knowing thyself is critical before successfully applying the lessons presented in Mosaic. Perhaps the author could have provided more of an insight into this struggle or maybe that is the subject of another book.Buffett said that an investor only has to know two things: &quot;How to value a business and how to think about prices.&quot; This is simple in concept but difficult in application. Every investor must travel his own path. Mr. Pabrai's book may make it easier."},{"Title":"Mosaic: Perspectives on Investing","review":"The book has some good points, but it was way too expensive. The Price means it is not worth it, save your cash and buy four books for the price of one. The book has also not aged well."},{"Title":"Mosaic: Perspectives on Investing","review":"Mosaic is a compendium of essays written by Mohnish Pabrai from 2001-2004. The essays were originally published by TheStreet.com, The Motley Fool and Silicon India Magazine. A former technology entrepreneur, Pabrai is Managing Partner of Pabrai Investment Funds. Pabrai is a self-avowed student of the Ben Graham-Warren Buffett-Charlie Munger school of investing. That is to say, he is a value investor, searching for opportunities to buy pieces of companies selling substantially below their intrinsic value. Needless to say, this is a very accessible book, written in a style and level that the average person can easily understand. The author does a great job explaining the basic tenets of value investing. Part of Pabrai's appeal is that he was an entrepreneur before he was an investor, which gives him an unparalleled perspective on what it means to run a company. For a while I've wondered whether study of entrepreneurship is a worthy subject of study for investors, a question further answered in the affirmative by the positive dust jacket blurb by Amar Bhide, author ofThe Origin and Evolution of New Businesses.As one would expect, there are frequent references to and reprints of quotes by Warren Buffett, but I was especially pleased to see references to Buffett's better half at Berkshire Hathaway, Charlie Munger. In fact, there are two chapters devoted to Munger's approach of using a \\"latticework\\" of mental models in the investment decision process. This is distilled to its essence on page 61: \\"Investing is all about making a series of observations about a given business and developing a theory about what it's going to do in the future...Start by making a series of careful observations, analyze them, fixate on the ones that fly in the face of an emerging picture, ask lots of \\"Why\\" questions and look at the final latticework to make a decision.\\" The reader can of course learn more about Munger's wonderfully unconventional ideas inPoor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger, Expanded Third Edition.One challenge with compiling a book of essays from other sources, even ones written in such a short period of time, is that the author's views and perspectives can change with the times. This makes the book feel a little uneven and confusing to the close observer. For example, on page 50 in a chapter entitled \\"Dhando!\\" (a Gujarati word meaning \\"business\\" and title of his follow up book,The Dhandho Investor: The Low - Risk Value Method to High Returns). Pabrai contends \\"Investing is not rocket science. It is pretty simple. It should be painfully clear how a business generates cash today, how much it is likely to continue to generate into the future and how much you're paying for that future cash flow. Think about the width and depth of the moat [i.e. competitive advantage]. Think about the knight in charge of the castle.\\" Most of the chapters have a similar upbeat feel to them.In a later chapter near the end of the book entitled \\"The Investor's Dilemma-Mutual Funds or Stocks?\\", Pabrai is much less sanguine about the likelihood of success in the stock market. On page 108 he cautions \\"there are only a few of us who have the discipline, analytics and patience to follow this approach...individual stock picking is a loser's game for most investors.\\" The former chapter was originally written in August 2002; the latter was penned in September 2001, at a low point in the stock market. While the former essay was perhaps a little too optimistic, the latter is perhaps a little too pessimistic for a readership interested in learning about how to become a value investor. Nonetheless, Pabrai is being responsible in reminding the reader that successful investing is not automatic. Unless one is prepared to do the hard work to become well educated in the details of a small number of companies, use a disciplined approach to the investing decision, and be extremely patient for good opportunities to come your way, then in this reviewer's opinion passive investments in low-cost index funds are probably the best way to go."},{"Title":"Mosaic: Perspectives on Investing","review":"Mohnish Pabrai at the time of this post currently manages about $260 million in his hedge funds using a value approach.

There are two exceptions: The science fiction chiller, \\"It's a _Good_ Life\\" (_Star Science Fiction No. 2_, 1953) and the comical \\"The Holes Around Mars\\" (_Galaxy_, 1954). You may remember the first as an episode on _The Twilight Zone_. Neither of these oft-reprinted gems is included in _Space by the Tale_ (1964), to the detriment of the collection.Here are the stories that _are_ included: \\"The Draw\\" (_Amazing_, 1954),\\"The Young One\\" (_Fantastic_, 1954), \\"Laboratory\\" (_If_, 1955), \\"The Good Dog\\" (_Fantastic_, 1954), \\"One Way Street\\" (_Amazing_, 1953-4), \\"Small War\\" (_Science Fiction Quarterly_, 1954), \\"Trace\\" (_Space by the Tale_, 1961), \\"Angels in the Jets\\" (_Fantastic_, 1952), \\"The Battle of the Bells\\" (_Imagination_, 1954), \\"The Magic Typewriter\\" (_Space by the Tale_, 1963), and \\"The Bad Life\\" (_Galaxy_, 1963).The two most original-- and unpleasant-- stories in the collection are \\"Angels in the Jets\\" and \\"The Bad Life\\". Both are accounts of descents into madness-- the first on a planet with a hallucinogenic atmosphere, the second on a prison asteroid. I first read \\"The Bad Life\\" when I was in high school, and it was hard not to make comparisons between Limbo and the military school that I was attending. I could only hope that I wasn't too much like the hero of the story who retreats into the womb in a bizarre kind of way.\\"Laboratory,\\" \\"One Way Street,\\" and \\"Small War\\" are three competent but routine pieces. The first is about a couple of humans who blunder into some alien experiments. The second is about a parallel worlds snafu with an unsettling snapper at the end. The third is a story told by a disgraced spaceman that raises some hard questions about the value of conventional heroism. Would you do what this spaceman did?The rest of the stories are decidedly minor. \\"The Young One,\\" \\"The Good Dog,\\" \\"Trace,\\" \\"The Battle of the Bells,\\" and \\"The Magic Typwriter\\" are fantasy comedies. The first three are sentimental treatments of supernatural characters. The fourth is an account of a practical joke gone to hell. The fifth reminds me a bit of Charles Beaumont's \\"Printer's Devil\\". All are predictable. Also predictable but mildly entertaining is \\"The Draw,\\" a blend of psionics and western folklore.This is not one of Ballantine's better collections. But it has one quality that makes it a little appealing to me-- diversity of tone. A lot of collections nowadays are either totally comical or, more frequently, unrelievedly grim. The reader soon gets tired of the stories. Bixby mixes the grim with the whimsical. That is a point in his favor."},{"Title":"Space By The Tale","review":"Since I enjoyed the movie Man From EarthJerome Bixby's The Man from Earthas he wrote the script, I thought I'd check out his other tales.

One story is about the \\"fastest\\" gun in the West, a mean boy with telekinetic powers; an alien scientist whose experiments go crazy as he tries to prevent a \\"first contact\\" situation; and a story of interdimensional travel, where there is another dimension that has never heard of Hamlet (wild stuff!).

That is simply because few people are open-minded enough to ask the questions that Dr. Mandelker poses. These questions shake the very foundations of society's cherished beliefs about life. It is a tribute to Mandelker's courage that he dares ask them.As a wanderer, I particularly appreciated the author's personal story in the appendix. That autobiography plus the quiz that the other reviewer mentioned, convinced me of my origins. I really wasn't surprised that I'm from Elsewhere. That was probably the most stunning discovery of all. I hope sincere, open-minded people will delve into this book. It deserves the attention of all devoted seekers of truth.

Also covered are details on RS-422/RS-485, cabling, etc."},{"Title":"Serial Port Complete: Programming and Circuits for RS-232 and RS-485 with Disk","review":"This is a nice book if you want a basic introduction to the serial port from a hardware/circuits point of view. Primary coverage is on the RS232 and RS485, but there is information relevant to other serial standards as well. There is also information for serial communications using microcontrollers such as the 8052 and Basic Stamp; surprisingly NONE of the popular Motorola series (mc68hc11, hc12, hc16, etc) are covered.The glaring weakness of the book is the software coverage, which uses Visual Basic. Why use such an arcane and limited language? Very few engineers and techies use VB, so the majority of the intended audience will miss out on about half of the book. This is a shame since reading code for serial programming gives tremendous insight into what is really happening. This book would be useful to many more people had it been written in a standard language such as C or Java or even assembly."},{"Title":"Serial Port Complete: Programming and Circuits for RS-232 and RS-485 with Disk","review":"You would think that as long as the RS-232 serial port has been around that every engineer would know all about it. But that's simply not true. People are still out there interfacing all manner of equipment using a serial interface.In the Serical Port Complete you will find just about everything you need to know about interfacing to and programming for a serial port. Note that I say 'just about' everything you need to know, that's because who knows what you'll really be planning to do. Suffice to say that this is an introductory book. It assumes that you have little knowledge of PC's, a little knowledge of electronics. From there it tells you how to interface to an outside line using any of several common UARTs, and then how to program your PC to handle the resulting port.If you are looking for something more complex; current loop or selecting data out of a stream, then I recommend you start here before going on the more complex literature. The programming in this book is illustrated using Visual Basic. If you work in some other language such as C++, it will not be difficult to convert."},{"Title":"Serial Port Complete: Programming and Circuits for RS-232 and RS-485 with Disk","review":"This book can give you basic knowledge which is helpful for new VB programmer on serial port communication.

The book is very detailed (for the expert), but still easy to read (for the beginner). There is information about how to use microcontrollers and PCs, but it doesn't come at the cost of information on serial communication. In fact, I found that some of the examples using microcontrollers gave me a few ideas for my project.( )BASIC is a completely logical language to use for showing examples in this book.

In addition, it also has details on how to interface some microcontroller based designs to the serial port as well. The author does focus on Visual Basic to access the ports but gives clear pointers as to how to use other methods to access the serial port ( including C ).

Over time I have built many products from missiles to medical devices with this form of communication. In the last fifteen years, serial communications has moved from RS-232 to USB ports. This book answered my remaining questions about how to get serial to work on computer ports and provided the template for USB port communications that I have used later. Currently(2011), I'm working on a project that has both types of ports on the motherboard. Knowing how to support both types was invaluable in being an effective designer for this project. This book also gave me a better understanding of where to go to find other references on this area for my software designs. It allowed me to rapidly prepare a new software application for use in manufacturing testing.A number of the machines I've developed lately have a number firmware boards connected to a central computer both by serial and USB ports. Finding the right reference for the older serial communication processes is difficult because they haven't been on the bookshelves for over ten years.This book provides me with the information needed to help design efficient and reliable hardware communication interfaces that are suitable for both of these devices. The communication device will change with time, but the concept will be useful for decades. I am a better software developer because I have this book available on my reference shelves.There are several practical current devices and projects in the book that help to expand the scope of its educational value. The principal area that this book covers is the electronic interface of communications devices and what to expect in the way of signal information as seen on the oscilloscope when connecting to the communication interface. When I first started designing and testing these interfaces the bit speed was below 9600 bits per second and the interfaces were all discreet devices. That was 30 years ago. Now, the bit rates are over 800,000 per second and the hardware is fully integrated except for the timing and filter capacitors and the only access to the internal gates is through pins on an ASIC or FPGA. So, it's important to know what the timing delays and the waveform signatures should be. I can testify that if the hardware is working incorrectly, the software will never be able to function. This book will give you that invaluable primary information.As a software engineer I can tell you that the software files included with this book are only elementary. Furthermore, they are written in BASIC which, being an interpreted language, is to slow to test the high speed limits of the interfaces. I recommend that you rewrite them in C++ if you want to see if your interfaces act properly at the higher bit rates. Otherwise signal slope rates, line reflection, and timing delays can make a system that works well at 115,000 bps create symbol interference and lost bit recognition at 800,000 bps.I am glad that I found this book and I'm sure that when the old serial RS-232 and RS-485 are forgotten this book will still serve as a useful reference on my shelf."},{"Title":"Serial Port Complete: Programming and Circuits for RS-232 and RS-485 with Disk","review":"Another excellent book form Jan Axelson.

That said, it is somewhat disappointing to read for two reasons, one being something the authors could help- the other being something they could not.Almost everyone involved in creating the Rocky Horror Show and its picture show variant seems jaded or pissed off. Money is often the first thing on people's minds, and the reader comes away knowing that the production screwed many people involved, but could come away having learned so much more. Everyone is quick to point out what a huge part they played in creating this legend- the ego is unbelievable. That, however, the authors could not help. They simply took their information and gave it.My major problem with the book, however, comes from the authors themselves. While it is true that Rocky Horror is a phenomenon, and certainly influential, I found it awfully hard to swallow some of the ideas that they put forth. It is their belief that Rocky Horror *created* punk, which is ridiculous. No doubt it was part of the culture, but no one thing created it. Also, Rocky Horror is listed as the precursor to Meat Loaf and Jim Steinman's \\"Bat Out Of Hell\\"- bull. And by the time they're raving about how \\"Death Becomes Her\\" is just a rip-off of the RHPS, you're ready to put down your book and read something else.This is a very decent book. Lots of great information has passed hands through it, and I do recommend it. However, Rocky Horror has never meant influence or changing the world. It has meant the glorification of fun, rock and roll, and sex. It is a fun show spoofing old horror flicks. To go so far about its importance is to deny it's real power: the ability to have a good time."},{"Title":"Rocky Horror: From Concept to Cult","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and its history of a UK fringe musical smash that became a film flop, then an audience participation sensation with its own cult - and eventually a Hollywood Film Studio's cottage industry. I loved reading about the creative process - part inspiration, part kismet and lots of group collaboration. You are taken step by step, through terrific interviews, into the birth of a cultural phenomenon that only happens once in a lifetime. I have a newfound respect for the film actors especially after learning what a cold, damp slog of a shoot it was for them. It was a revelation to learn of the RHPS film set's cliques. The authors have provided a true glimpse (warts and all) at the creative stage/screen process of ordinary people who gave extraordinarily of their gifts to keep generations singing and laughing for decades. This book brilliantly sums up the cultural life of Rocky Horror and those halcyon days of pre-VHS/DVD fan fanaticism and weekend theatrics. It also gives a hint that perhaps that early reverence is retreating into a void just like those glossy red lips."},{"Title":"Rocky Horror: From Concept to Cult","review":"\\"Rocky Horror: From Cult to Concept\\", a collection of pattering interviews with nearly everyone ever remotely involved with Richard O'Brien's cult phenom, is for completeist's only.

Linnea and Mr. Bloom visit the Marmottan museum to observe the many paintings of Monet. They study his artwork and how the genius painted. They learn about other Impressionist artists--many who were great friends of Monet. Eventually the young child and elderly gentleman make the ultimate trek to Giverny, where Monet lived and painted.This book could almost be a 'fun' textbook. The artwork, both of the author's and of Monet's is absolutely exquisite. Becoming familiar with Monet's life and his paintings become a marvelous art history lesson. As an adult, I not enjoyed reading this lovely book but I learned a lot.

Linnea and Mr. Bloom share a love for paintings and for flowers, and Claude Monet is a painter they both love. Together they decide to visit Paris, and Monet's garden in Giverny, and with the help of this book we can go with them on this journey.The book is first of all a beautiful, everyday story about two friends visiting the house and garden of a beloved painter. But it is also a masterpiece in the way it is built up. The way the story, the information about the impressionist period in art, the pictures and paintings all melt together. I and my 6 years old daughter can never get tired of the book, and after reading it an uncountable number of times we both felt that we knew the garden in Giverny. It was a very special day for us then, last summer when we were able to visit Giverny, the house and the garden. We could walk around seeing the same sights as Linnea had seen, sit on the bench together with both Monet and Linnea, walk over the Japanese bridge, and take pictures of all the flowers Linnea had also photographed.Though this book is first of all a book for children it is a treasure for all ages.

This was my second visit in three years, but my first visit with Isabelle, the curator, as tour guide. While the museum is going through remodeling, the Impressionist paintings of Claude Monet and his colleagues are housed in new exhibit rooms. Of central interest to me were the Monet works, as we were taking the train, later in the week, to Giverny where Claude Monet bought property many years ago, and designed a garden to inspire all gardeners, myself, included.The thrill to see the landscape where Monet was inspired draws many questions: Did his paintings inspire his gardening, or did his gardening inspire his paintings? I believe, both! It is quite an accomplishment to allow your work to interweave with your passions and interests, and looking at his acres of flowers, says it all. Life has a way of weaving itself into a beautiful landscape.So, when it came to telling an eight year old about my visit to Monet's home and gardens, I used the wonderful book, Linnea in Monet's Garden as a prelude to our conversation. I have several books for engaging children in discussions on famous artists and their works; this one rises above many. The co-authors present the story of Monet and his garden and his paintings to an energized child, who when nurtured can relate to the first-person account of a young European child who traveled with an elderly friend, to visit Monet's home and gardens, the green bridge over the lily pond, the single-colored rooms in his house, and the sheer palette of colors in his gardens. (Coincidentally, I, too, named the rooms in my house by lighter shades of colors: rose for \\"spring's beginnings\\"; aqua for \\"summer's calm\\"; yellow sunshine for \\"golden autumn\\"; soft blush for \\"winter's sunset\\", and white of whites, to include every color of the rainbow's spectrum. Each of the rooms depicts a separate season; one represents all.)This book contains full-color reproductions of some of Monet's paintings, ink and water color illustrations, a narrative of the visit to Giverny, Monet's home and gardens by this elderly man and the young lively child who displays enough enthusiasm to bring all the flowers into bloom. So, take the hand of your child, and carefully introduce her to as much of life as possible; someday, she will probably visit Monet's Gardens and Home, and have volumes to share. Draw out the creative spirit in your child! Bring good and truth-filled literature to your child's light! That's it, bring as much light into her life as you possibly can, so she can also pass on the light of learning to others."},{"Title":"Linnea in Monet's Garden","review":"Such a great little film for kids! (My daughter is 4) Very slow paced, a good change from the fast editing nowadays. It's short, so if your kid needs a little downtime, this is a real nice length. Very highly recommended. For us, is runs over into real life, we go out to botanical gardens and look at the same flowers as are in the movie. There are also several Japanese bridges in the botanical gardens, so that's also a plus.

The book itself is nice."},{"Title":"Linnea in Monet's Garden","review":"When I was about six years old an art organization came to my school to teach kids about fine art. It was something different every day. The day we learned about Claude Monet I fell in love with art. They used Linnea as a teaching tool. I asked my mom to go to every museum we could after that. I still have a small version of one of his paintings from the first museum I ever went too. Now I go to art school and I'm surrounded my wonderful painters and drawing artists everyday. I can thank Linnea for introducing me to fine art and sparking my love for Monet."},{"Title":"Linnea in Monet's Garden","review":"This is such a beautiful way to introduce children to the Impressionists and who better to start than with than Monet. This book takes the reader on a journey through the life he and his family lived, it paints a beautiful picture of Monet's beloved garden, the lily pond, the Japanese bridge and much more.It's not a book for the very young, the story line is a bit too complex, my children start to enjoy this book from the age of 6. I highly recommend it, I'm now going to try and find the other Linnea books."},{"Title":"Linnea in Monet's Garden","review":"Book Title: \\"Linnea in Monet's Garden\\"Author: Christina Bjork & Lena AndersonPublished By: Sourcebooks/JabberwockyAge Recommended: 4+Reviewed By: Kitty BullardRaven Rating: 5Review: This is a book perfect for all children ages 4 and up. Parents will absolutely love the mix of history and art with the story of a little girls dream coming true. Linnea loves flowers, gardens and art. When she gets the chance to visit France and see Monet's home as well as his paintings up close she's ecstatic.The trip with her good friend Mr. Bloom becomes the highlight of her young life and she learns an abundance of fascinating facts about her favorite painter. This is a fantastic story, one that is sure to be a family treasure."},{"Title":"Linnea in Monet's Garden","review":"If you haven't read Linnea in Monet's Garden with your children, your family is missing out on a wonderful story about a little girl's journey to the garden of one of history's greatest artists.First written in 1985 by Christina Bjork and illustrated by Lena Anderson, it has been re-released this 25th anniversary year in printed formats, as well as e-reader formats.The story begins with Linnea dreaming of Monet's garden with her retired friend, Mr. Bloom, whom encourages Linnea in her art studies. The pair take a trip to Paris together and visit the little pink house where Monet and his family lived. She takes pictures of the famous Japanese bridge and of the variety of flowers amid the garden. She and Mr. Bloom discuss Monet's style of painting: impressionism, as well as his family's interesting dichotomy.Amid the pages, the reader discovers modern pictures, Monet's art, black and white family photos, sketches, and lively original illustrations. Bjork discusses Monet's failing sight issues and even shows readers comparison views of his drawing as his sight failed.At the end of the story, Bjork supplied the reader with a list of things to do in Paris including museums, gardens, and markets. She also left a timeline of Monet's life and his family tree, as it can be a little confusing.What I found lovely was Bjork's use of reality in her story about Linnea. She spoke with Jean-Marie Toulgouat and Philippe Piguet, Monet's step-great-grandsons, whom shared the family photos shown in the story.An all around wonderful story, but also a very informative biography; I highly recommend Linnea in Monet's Garden as part of this year's top reads.Caution: There is a section in the story regarding Monet's family history. At one point, Monet lived with his second wife before they were married and before she had officially separated from her husband. I wanted to disclose this as it might offend or catch some parents off guard.{Disclosure: This book was provided to me in digital format free of charge by the publishing company Sourcebooks.}[...]"},{"Title":"Linnea in Monet's Garden","review":"An \\"Amazing\\" children's book with beautiful illustration and stories for Monet's Garden.Another excellent book to share your love of art. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Linnea in Monet's Garden","review":"Book was slightly damaged in corner which is noticeable. I do not have the original description of the condition so I do not remember if this was disclosed."},{"Title":"Linnea in Monet's Garden","review":"I probably read Linnea in Monet's Garden more than a hundred times as a little girl. I can't quite remember if it bestowed upon me a love of Monet, or if my love of Monet cause my mom to get me this book, but either way it was a book I treasured (and still treasure). Bringing art to young children is so important, especially when we live in an era where music and art programs are being cut across the nation. Seeing not only Monet's masterpieces, but also his life, through the eyes of who was at the time a peer was an incredible introduction to his work. Beware of your little girl begging you to take her to Paris, because that is what happened with me! Be sure to get the companion DVD as well - it is well worth it!"},{"Title":"Linnea in Monet's Garden","review":"I sent this book to my granddaughter Sophie, who is in first grade. She had done a report on Monet for school, and i was correct in thinking this was the perfect follow-up gift. When i spoke to her on the phone, i told her that Grandpa & I had been to paris and to Monet's garden. she wanted to know if we had done all things Linnea had done. I told her many of them, and then she asked if we had had a picnic in the garden. I had forgotten that part, and told her no, we went to a restaurant. Now Sophie wants us to take her there! someday, I hope we will. and then maybe i'll remember to tell her i had an aunt named Linnea."},{"Title":"Linnea in Monet's Garden","review":"This is a wonderful book for children. A parent can read it to a young child, or a child from 3rd grade to 6th grade will find it of value. It helps children to appreciate art, art history, as well as possibly inspiring them to take up art themselves. I've seen this book in many classrooms from classrooms in all grades in grade school. I've also used it to teach lessons and to provide art material for children to copy from to try their efforts at master works, replicas. They really enjoyed it very much. So, I would say, this is good for the classroom and for parents for children."},{"Title":"Linnea in Monet's Garden","review":"The characters and story are perfect for young and old. It is a fun way to learn about gardening, design and the famous painter, Claude Monet."},{"Title":"Linnea in Monet's Garden","review":"Engaging story and beautiful illustrations! My third graders loved seeing photos of Monet and learning about his later years."},{"Title":"Linnea in Monet's Garden","review":"I purchased this book for my daughter and the doll a number of years ago. She loved the story. What was really amazing is that we had an opportunity to visit Paris and then to Monet's Garden. My daughter followed the trail of the book. The author used actual places. We found the small hotel with the portrait of Esmeralda dancing. It is across from Notre Dame. The old tree was there. We finally made the journey to Monet's home and Garden in the Normandy region. It was better than I could have imagined. I recommend the trip to anyone. The house, the flowers, the flowers, the flowers with the bridge and pond. I was amazed at the interweaved willow branch lining on the banks of the stream to prevent erosion. Buy the book and perhaps a dream will come true."},{"Title":"Linnea in Monet's Garden","review":"I bought this book for my granddaughter to accompany a small doll I had bought while visiting Monet's home and garden back in 2001. The book was educational in regard to how he painted as well as entertaining. It was a little long for a 7 and 1/2 year old but she still seemed to enjoy it."},{"Title":"Linnea in Monet's Garden","review":"When I was in elementary school, I used to check this book out of the library weekly. I absolutely adored it and still do...It is a great introduction to art and in addition, a look into travel and culture appreciation.Some of the pictures in this book have stuck with me for years, especially the transition of Monet's Japanese Bridge painting from 1899-1923 when he'd lost most of his eyesight due to cataracts.If you're looking for a charming book to introduce the idea of art to your children, or you specifically enjoy Monet, this is a great purchase."},{"Title":"Linnea in Monet's Garden","review":"This book is one of my little girl's favorite books and it was a great introduction to Monet for the entire family.

After looking at the wonderful paintings contained in the pages, my little girl produced a pencil and a sketch pad and proceeded to sketch the flowers in our garden outside. We homeschool and are always on the lookout for good books. This is one I'm thankful we stumbled across!

The author is not going to tell you how to raise your kids - she is going to tell you to stop letting other authors tell you how to raise them.Cassidy tells the story of her own experiences with parenting theories and advice, as a mother and as a parenting magazine author. She analyzes the trends and history that make today's parents obsess over parenting.Cassidy's thesis is that over-consumption of expert advice coupled with geographical distance from and mistrust of one's own family make today's upper middle-class parents doubt and second-guess themselves until they're incapable of taking charge and giving their children the guidance and firmness they need.The immediacy of Cassidy's narrative style made this a very enjoyable book for me to read. I read it during my baby's first summer, when it opened my eyes to the value of occasionally leaving a baby alone to discover the world on her own, rather than constantly playing with her and talking to her. I'm glad I read it when I did; it has influenced the path I have taken. It encourages parents to lighten up, to trust themselves, to take the long view, and to enjoy their children while they can, since they won't be children for very long. It cautions against the intense focus on doing everything &quot;right&quot; that leads to parental burn-out, and can blind parents to the best moments of their children's childhood. Most of all, it reminds parents that there are other things in life besides one's children, and that it's okay to pursue them.Every parent should read this book."},{"Title":"Parents Who Think Too Much: Why We Do It, How To Stop","review":"This book has some valid points about the way some parents raise their children, however, the solution it offers is not what it claims to be. It is, rather, a reaction to permissive parenting books and a return to raising kids the way Grandma used to do it. Her Grandma, I should say. It's not about doing things according to our instinct, but hers. It is nothing but the same old tired advice from the fifties- if you pick up your baby too much, the baby will become demanding. Tell your kids to leave you alone, etc. It sounds like the author was fed up with trying to be a better parent (and maybe she truly did try too hard at the expense of herself) but then has overcompensated and adopted the attitude of \\"I'm too busy to try to do a good job so I'll do whatever I want and my kids will turn out just fine.\\"In spite of what she says, it does matter what you say to your kids, how you phrase it, and how you react to their feelings. But discipline is important, too. And you shouldn't drive yourself crazy worrying about every little thing you do. Every parent needs to find their own balance.This is just another parenting book, disguised as an anti-parenting book."},{"Title":"Parents Who Think Too Much: Why We Do It, How To Stop","review":"Like the previous reviewer, I found the book highly negative. I did not like it all, but let me start with what I did like. The author does makes a couple of good points about child centered parenting, and about parenting books that make you feel inadequate. The quote: \\"read enough and you begin to think there are lots of neat pathways to deal with bedtime, tantrums, homework, you name it. You begin to think there are one-size-fits-all answers to every childrearing query. When the one-size-fits-all answer doesn't fit you and your child, which it often doesn't, it's easy to worry what's wrong with me?\\" is spot on, as far as I am concerned.She bashes books like \\"How to talk so kids will listen\\", said that they do not really work anyway. My experience is different, I have learned a lot from those books, even though they are not perfect, I am glad that I can parent much more positively than my parents did, and some books and online communities have helped a lot with that.Cassidy, on the other hand, says: \\"The truth of the matter is, most of us are happy, productive, civilized human beings, and we got that way being raised more or less as our parents and grandparents were\\". I think this is the point were I disagree most with Cassidy. Even though she detests terms like 'parenting', she still thinks around those lines. She still says things like that you should determine what you want your child to be, and actively work on that. Parenting is not about making adults, children will grow up perfectly fine by themselves. Parenting is about living with children, and I know quite a lot of perfectly well adjusted adults who do not look back so happily on their childhood.She presents the book as an anti-parenting-book-book, but it really is just another parenting book with a lot of simple criticism about other books. Cassidy promotes authoritive parenting (you may occasionally spank your children, but you must also reason with them), something she got from a book herself. Not all parenting books are evil, appearantly, only the ones she does not like.I wholeheartedly recommend \\"Hold On To Your Kids\\" by Gordon Neufeld and Gabor Mate instead of this book. It has sort of the same premise, namely: parenting is not a set of skills. It is also fairly negative about \\"today's children\\", and critical about child-centered parenting, but the authors explain the problem much better, much more eloquent, and with scientific backup."},{"Title":"Parents Who Think Too Much: Why We Do It, How To Stop","review":"Thanks to Anne Cassidy, I'm getting out of the brat race. My oldest was raised 'the old fashioned way' - my youngest had the benefit of a mother with experience , a mom who could afford to stay home and who read the latest studies, books, and every parenting magazine out there in an effort to find 'the right way' for baby dear. Guess what ? My youngest is a brat ! Ok, maybe not a BRAT, but he was well on his way. My life went from balanced, to kid-centered. My parenting techniques went from, 'you'll get over it' to 'we can't blame him for expressing his feelings, he needs to be heard'. I still wanted to be the best parent I could be, but how was it that after spending all this time paying so much attention to my kids, I couldn't leave the house ? Thanks to Anne Cassidy, I've learned to have more faith in my gut - and more appreciation for the hard -learned lessons my Granma taught."},{"Title":"Parents Who Think Too Much: Why We Do It, How To Stop","review":"Anne Cassidy offers insights that sometimes made me cringe in recognition. She offers a new way of looking at parenting and encourages us to just &quot;be parents&quot; rather than being paralyzed while we analyze the hell out of everything our child does and how we respond. I thank her for giving me more to think about (oops! did I really say that?). Seriously, I often find myself reflecting on Ms. Cassidy's words."},{"Title":"Parents Who Think Too Much: Why We Do It, How To Stop","review":"Ms. Cassidy has reassured me that I am not alone in thinking that something has gone wrong with a parenting world where children are accorded all of the negotiating rights of a labor-management sitdown. I look forward to seeing the results of this wake up call to well-meaning and ill-directed parents."},{"Title":"Parents Who Think Too Much: Why We Do It, How To Stop","review":"Being a former high-school teacher, I can easily say that most of Anne Cassidy's observations are true! The majority of kids I taught were disprespectful and unruly, and seemingly didn't know appropriate behavior for the classroom. Evidently, I set very high expectations for these children of the 90's, i.e. to sit quietly, to pay attention to the lesson, and to practice what they learned after the lesson. Believe it or don't, this was too much for most of my students to handle. Cassidy hits-the-nail-on-the-head on how parenting of late has gone awry. Every parent should read this book."},{"Title":"Parents Who Think Too Much: Why We Do It, How To Stop","review":"Before I read this book, I really couldn\`t understand why my daughter was so snappy, to me and everyone around; now I know, it\`s been 3 days I started reading the book, and started to act firmly, I can see the change in her behaviour. Thank you so much Anne Cassidy!"},{"Title":"Parents Who Think Too Much: Why We Do It, How To Stop","review":"Ms. Cassidy has produced a book that most parents I know need to read. Common sense and our own intuition are underutilized in today's world. Many of the children I know would benefit from parents who spend less time over-examining everything their children do or do not do at a certain age and more time enjoying their children. A must read for all modern parents - and then they do not need to read anything else!"},{"Title":"Parents Who Think Too Much: Why We Do It, How To Stop","review":"I had a love-hate relationship with this book! I could not put it down, yet I hated it! Although the author made some good points about our activity-packed, consumerism culture, her view of parents and children of today is highly negative. This is the book to read if you want to be totally discouraged about your parenting skills. She presents such a negative view of our child-centered culture that anyone who reads this without kids will probably decide not to have any! Parents Who Think Too Much will definitely make you think about your role as a parent in today's world, but I doubt that the majority of the well-intentioned parents out there could be possibly as bad as she says we are. Encouraging self-esteem, being kid-centered, and spending more time with your chihldren are all habits that I think more families should do, not less, as Anne Cassidy so tactlessly encourages. This author is a burnt out parent and magazine writer that took her career burnout and turned it into a very negative book."},{"Title":"Parents Who Think Too Much: Why We Do It, How To Stop","review":"I wish this book could be handed out to all parents when they leave the hospital or birthing center with their new baby. Or maybe you should be obligued to get a copy with every order of other parenting books! I learned a lot about myself by reading this book. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Parents Who Think Too Much: Why We Do It, How To Stop","review":"I think this is a must read and says everything I, as a grandmother, have observed without reading all the experts' advise.

Although I'm pretty happy with my parenting style, I'm always thrown into paranoia and fear when an &quot;expert&quot; says something I'm doing is dreadfully, drastically wrong--when I know it's no big deal or even a good thing.

A. Riots- What Really Happened","review":"General Delk's Fires & Furies is a labor of love written by a senior Army National Guard officer who was probably more than a little chagrined by the mixed opinion some had of the California Army National Guard's deployment to L.A. in 1992.The reason for General Delk's concern is hinted at in the book's preface, \\"Police officers are carefully trained with a focus on restraint. Armed soldiers, on the other hand, are trained to respond to threats using deadly force. As a consequence, there was considerable concern when thousands of National Guardsmen were sent into the streets to restore order. As might be expected, there were dozens of assaults on the military forces. These assaults are recorded, as well as the extraordinary restraint exercised in responding to those assaults.\\"General Delk interviewed police and politicians, soldiers and gang members on his way towards writing a very comprehensive history of the 1992 L.A. Riots.And, while this reviewer is not mentioned by name, his unit and a specific incident involving a suspected sniper is. Page 105 describes an incident that happened about 30 feet from this reviewer on 1 MAY 92 at 0800, \\"This battalion (the 2-185th Armor) from the San Diego area was accompanied by Jim Michaels, a Marine Corps Reserve lieutenant colonel, who was a reporter for the San Diego Tribune. He had parked his small Ford Escort next to the Guardsmen in the parking area early Friday morning. Sergeant Robert A. Matey was leaning against the left side of the sedan in front of the driver's window. Sergeant Duane Neyens was leaning against the left rear talking to Master Sergeant Jim Sexton (the latter two soldiers worked for this reviewer at the time in the S-2 section). Suddenly a shot whacked into the vehicle between Matey and Neyens...\\"The book is filled with such first hand detail while at the same time providing the bigger picture. Fires & Furies is a must read for anyone who really wants to know what happened in L.A. in 1992.As a captain who served as the battalion intelligence officer and who led foot patrols in the Crenshaw-Baldwin Hills Mall Plaza area in 1992, this reviewer greatly appreciates General Delk's history.Reviewer: Chuck DeVore is a candidate for U.S. Senate in 2010, a California State Assemblyman, he served as a Special Assistant for Foreign Affairs in the Department of Defense from 1986 to 1988, retired from the Army National Guard as a lieutenant colonel, and is the co-author of \\"China Attacks.\\""},{"Title":"Fires & Furies: The L.

It does take a while to get use to everything, but once you do your scholastic life will never be the same."},{"Title":"Studying Smart Rev","review":"Heyla and well met!There are three things that will make a successful student: Solid life goals, excellent time management skills, and good studying skills, which includes knowing how to read a textbook (and understanding that reading a textbook is a much different skill than reading a novel for enjoyment). Studying Smart teaches the aspiring student to develop the first two aspects of a successful student, and it does so quite well, as the book emphasizes the fact that, in order for the student to become successful, the student must first know what she wants from her education, then work from that point. The book helps the student think about what she wants from her education by helping her learn how to identify and develop short-term, mid-term, and long-term goals, then developing time-management techniques that will aid the student in bringing those goals to fruition. From there, the rest is simply up to the student, as the student must understand that this book is NOT a magical tome that will miraculously give the student top grades in the class: rather, it's a book that teaches the student valuable skills that the student must be willing to put into use for life, if she truly expects to gain anything from it.I was fortunate enough that my father gave me this book when I was a teenager, advising me, then, to develop and practice these skills long before I entered college. After a long period of practice, these skills became so simple that I simply couldn't understand why everyone didn't use it. And, in fact, I attribute my success in community college to these vital life skills. I can say this because, when I transferred over to the university, I became quite over-confident, thinking that I no longer needed to use these skills directly, as I can keep it all in my head. Unfortunately, the sad truth was that this simply wasn't so. Indeed, I needed these skills even more so, because the university operates on the quarter system, rather than the semester system, and with my learning disability, this meant that time was so precious that I really COULD NOT afford to not manage my time correctly. So, of course, my grades managed to slip, lower and lower, and only during those quarters in which I went back to using my time management skills did I manage to return to somewhere close to my performance in community college. So, from my own life experience, the one thing I would like to impart to anyone attempting to learn goal/life planning and/or time management skills, either from this book or another source, is that these are life skills you are meant to utilize for life, not just for a short while, which makes sense: if using the system that works best for you has brought you success, why discontinue it?"},{"Title":"Island Bush Pilot: Founder of san Juan Airlines","review":"This book is 300+ pages of true stories from an aviation pioneer who started and ran the oldest surviving commuter airline in the US. Beginning shortly after WWII, Franklin went to work for a small flying outfit in the San Juan Islands of Washington State, ferrying passengers and freight from these small islands to the mainland and back again. Eventually, he bought the company and ran it until the late 70s, establishing the local airport which now bears his name in the process. You'll read stories of the unique people Franklin encountered along the way, together with tales of near misses, business troubles and the captivating beauty of these formerly isolated islands. The author's warmth and humor come through on every page, making the book seem like a conversation with a favorite uncle. It's a great read, and I heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"Island Bush Pilot: Founder of san Juan Airlines","review":"This is a wonderful book of aviation adventures in a remote area.

As for the stories themselves, they describe the terrible, often chilling, near-helplessness of women and outcastes in Bengal.

This transformation is brought about by virtue of seeing that, in samsara-in whatever form it may appear-there is no personal self and no essential component comprising phenomena.

I say \\"low-key\\" because the professor never really sets out to solve the murder of a colleague's husband; he simply happens to notice conflicting stories told by the characters. It helps that he has quite an ear for hallway and academic party gossip. And it happens that the detective investigating the case is in his class, writing about the crime in one of her course papers. A second plot going on is that the professor and his wife emigrated from Czechoslovakia and recently she has been erroneously slandered as an informer on her former colleagues during their previous life under Communism. The immigrant Czechoslovakian press in Canada has picked up on this story from the press back in the homeland. The book is also about academic life in general. We learn that our main character is, let's face it, a crotchety old man who enjoys calling the young women \\"girls\\" when the political correctness police let their guard down. He also times the lengths of visits of female students to offices of his male colleagues.

However, this out-of-print curio from 1973 is not a good example of Malzberg's talents. There is a rather interesting premise here, as the story is told from the point of view of an alien who has been imprisoned by humans and is being mercilessly grilled for technical information. But Malzberg doesn't deliver on the inherent potential of that motif, instead offering tiresome political shenanigans, an implausible escape, mostly thin and poorly constructed characters (especially the humans), and very coarse and ugly sex scenes. This short novel is also written in the economical style of golden age sci-fi, in which underdeveloped thematic ideas zoom by but don't result in any real enlightenment for the reader. Malzberg is worth exploring for historically minded science fiction fans, but start elsewhere. [~doomsdayer520~]"},{"Title":"In the enclosure (Avon science fiction/15073)","review":"Fresh off Malzberg's underwhelming but intriguing young adult novel, Conversations (1975), I picked up a copy of the altogether more disturbing, transfixing, unnervingly prescient, and at moments, brilliant In The Enclosure (1972). As with many of Malzberg's oeuvre, the work is infused with a steady dose of metafiction -- our hero laments (and we writhe along with him in a malaise of unease), \\"I will never really know\\" (189). Just as Quir is unsure of his own reality, his diaristic words -- which the reader is desperate to hold on to -- are admittedly, \\"an impression, a conception, nothing more\\" (190).Combining the science fiction trope of implanted memories with the literary narrative mode of the unreliable narrator creates an overwhelming uncomfortable gulf between reality and constructed reality. The result, the overpowering desire to pick up a piece of pulp science fiction where the future is rosy, technology = happiness, the kids smart, where rockets sprout up in backyards, and villains are of an altogether different shape.Brief Plot Summary (some spoilers)Here we are: in the enclosure. It has been some two years and four months since we were placed here (I have fully assimilated a sense of their chronology) and now, past the initial riots and educative tortures, things are comfortable\\" (5).Quir is a humanoid alien who could pass for a human - In The Enclosure is his diary of his imprisonment, along with a few hundred of his kind, on Earth. Humans imprisoned his people when they landed, tortured them, and dangled promises of eventual freedom. The aliens have no memory of their homeworld and why they were sent out to Earth. They've also discovered that they have no ability to prevent their immense technological secrets from falling into the hands of the humans. They conclude that they've been conditioned to divulge their knowledge. But no one knows the reason.The paradox is brutal -- mankind's problems (overpopulation, disease, the inability to develop space travel, etc) are solved while their saviors, the aliens, remain imprisoned, tortured, and subjected to continuous questions from their \\"therapists.\\"Quir and his people do remember the journey to Earth. They adhered to rigorous hierarchy, they had a master of rituals which reinforced the hierarchy, but even that feels arbitrary, constructed, artificial.... That skeletal framework of a system crumbles entirely in the enclosure. Quir, scared from the experience and the inability to remember his own pre-voyage past retreats into himself, preying on female aliens in the hallways, ruminating on the reasons for the imprisonment.The therapist's questions are relentless. The life tedious -- blank hallways, scraps of outside newspapers proclaiming great technological breakthroughs. The sex momentarily meaningful but ultimately meaningless.The plot thickens when Quir admits to is therapist that there's been an escape plan. It's never really certain that there was an actually escaped planned, or an elaborate trap. However, Quir is so torn that he resolves to escape with his people. But their knowledge of the world is limited to the enclosure, the spaceship, nothing more. And for many, unusual memories are slowly returning.Final ThoughtsI found myself unable to write about In The Enclosure for a few weeks after I had finished. I was somewhat disillusioned by the end (it couldn't really end any other way). And, as I mentioned in the beginning, the gulf Malzberg excavates between what is real and what is constructed is so vast will cause frustration in many readers. That said, the prescient undercurrents of the work (unjust imprisonment without end/Guantanamo bay) makes it even more unsettling.Malzberg's prose is impeccable (he started off as a playwright). Malzberg definitely prefers dialogue over detailed descriptions. For example, the exchanges between Quir and his succession of therapists are spine-chilling.\\"Do you find the meals adequate, the staff satisfactory, the circumstances comfortable? Do you have any illnesses?\\"\\"We never have any illnesses.\\"\\"Yes. I know that.\\"\\"But you might,\\" the menacing alien [human] says, nodding at the others. The others who have been standing against the wall, fondling their armaments nod. \\"You might indeed.\\"All science fiction fans who can tolerate a profoundly dark vision should pick up a copy. I cannot wait to track down another of Malzberg's lesser known novels."},{"Title":"Muay Thai: The Most Distinguished Art of Fighting","review":"Anyone who is interested in martial arts is amazed by the reputation of the Muay Thai fighters(Muay Thai is the Thai word for Thai Boxing) . This book is not only an attempt to highlight the most common used techniques of Muay Thai which most books do but gives a very good all round understanding of the history, spirituals, mistiques, training aspects and rules and regulation of Muay Thai. Of course almost all common fighting techniques are well explained and illustrated with numerous pictures. Well set-up are the chapters of the use of arms, legs, elbows and knees (including different attacks and parry's on these attacks). Furthermore real fighting stories of Thai fighters are connected with the techniques which make this book a must for the real fan."},{"Title":"Muay Thai: The Most Distinguished Art of Fighting","review":"This book is one of the best I've ever seen on the subject of Muay Thai (Thai Boxing). It is well written and illustrated throughout. This book covers not only the basic Muay Thai strategies, but also history, cultural significance, pre-fight rituals, training and the author's own personal experience in Muay Thai and in writing this book. I've seen only one Muay Thai book that rivals this one and that is &quot;Muay Thai: A Living Legacy&quot;. Although I recommend that book very highly, I must also recommend this one equally as it is just as good. Anybody in any martial art would do themselves a favor by reading this book and for anybody who trains in Muay Thai, this book is one you cannot afford to go without. Muay Thai is becomming very popular worldwide due to its effectiveness in fighting and self defense as well as its simple techniques. It is a fighting style that anyone can learn, regardless of age, gender, physical status, etc. The Thai police and military all learn Muay Thai as part of their training and it is this art that helped Thailand resist the Burmese during many battles. Should one ever decide to take up Muay Thai, he/she will clearly see why it is often called one of the &quot;kings of martial arts&quot;. Muay Thai is definitely one of the better fighting/self defense systems out there.

Although the writing was grammatically and structurally poor, it contained tons of content, and included lots of photos. The photos were of &quot;techniques&quot; done with a partner, similar to what you'd find in other martial arts-type books. Also detailed were the less-frequent moves (flying elbows, etc).

It's written in a not perfect english, but it is understandable. The author is a serious person who travelled almost all over the world, bringing his deep knowledge to every foreign thai boxer. The book itself doesn't have many more fighting drills than other ones written by foreign or Thai authors have. However it gives you the idea of what the art means for Thai people and should spiritualy mean for everybody practicing it, even though nothing will replace a SERIOUS training in the homeland, for those who want to become a real thai boxer and not just a hybrid kickboxer. In my opinion this book is very good for beginners, amateur fighters and ex-pros that have no connections with Thai teachers, and want to teach \\"the art\\" instead of teaching the two or three winning strikes that make their athletes champions with no deep knowledge of many unused yet extremely efficient techniques in any field.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Muay Thai: The Most Distinguished Art of Fighting","review":"This book is basic at best and over rated. How it became as popular as it is and considered a Bible of Muay Thai is beyond me. Then again theres a lot of cowboys and suckers in the scene.\\"The most distinguished art of fighting\\" is written in incomprehensible english complete with bad spelling (the \\"MASSAE\\" chapter is a favourite spelling error of mine), poor grammar and more than a little embellishment and exaggeration. No big deal when you get past it but the advice is amateur at best and blatantly wrong in some cases. Read the chapter on Diet if you don't believe me. Any decent nutritionist would put that chapter through the paper shredder. Any decent fighter would put the rest of the book in a furnace.Some of what Panya writes is damned hard to understand and I found myself wondering \\"what the f**k is this guy on about?!\\" I believe he lacked the clarity of proper understanding of what he was writing about rather than limited english skills.Much of the techniques Panya writes about are very traditional and outdated and probably will end up in Kickboxer Part 12 starring Don Wilson. Try doing some of them in the ring and see what happens:)To his credit he did describe some of the basic strikes correctly such a straight knees and sapping knees even if he did the rest of it wrong. If you look hard you'll find one or two decent useful bits of information but nothing more.Sadly Panya's understanding of boxing is shallow at best and you need good punching skills to get anywhere in this game.I doubt the author's integrity also. How he could fight full time and became a doctor is beyond me. If he is a real doctor as I refer to his Diet chapter once again. Then again you never know.... Good for him if he did make it through but in my personal experience every thai I've met in a boxing camp was from Isaan or a Hill Tribe, born into poverty and illiterate.I think \\"Dr\\" Panya was more an observer of Muay Thai than a serious particpant. That's not a crime but pretending youre a specialist and writing a book is.In summary it is a book that appeals to the nave who don't know any better and impressionable idiots who believe that because a Thai writes a book about Muay Thai it must be right-WRONG!\\"Truth is what it is, not what you want it to be.

If you take it home and read it, you're bound to feel cheated out of time that you could have spent reading something of merit. There are passages that made me think the novel would ultimately redeem itself. In reality, I should have stopped when the main character goes to her sister's school where she teaches, and nobody knows she's absent. I have news for you--if a teacher were absent, she would not be able to cover up a daily absence by asking a colleague to cover for her. The novel only gets worse after that: The dialogue comes straight out of a bad television script; the third person narrator breaks in with endless questions that reminded me of a Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew style of creating suspense.

I agree with the comment about the book contract. There are way better K-A authors out there. Mostly men."},{"Title":"The Interpreter","review":"As other reviewers have noted, The Interpreter offers a third-person view of one Suzy Park whose life up to now can best be described as dysfunctional. She's survived two affairs with married men (although she's remarkably comfortable in her \\"mistress\\" role), dropped out a first-rate college, drifted from job to job, and kept only one friend.Her present job, as a contract interpreter working for an agency, has held her longer than others. On one of her jobs, she translates for a witness who happens to know something about her parents, who died of gunshot wounds in 1995. She decides to investigate their death, her own past and the mysterious disappearance of her older sister Grace, who has always been distant.Although the heroine is not especially appealing (you want to shake her and send her to a therapist, pronto), her life makes sense in terms of her background. A dysfunctional life comes from a supremely dysfunctional family -- with layers of mystery.I had trouble putting the book down, although it had qualities of literary fiction and \\"girl books\\" as well as murder mystery. The author manages to give us a fresh view of New York, which has been the scene of so many novels. As I read I fondly remembered the Long Island Railroad and the stops on the Number 7 Queens line -- and the way they're counted out by riders. She also gives us a gritty but entertaining view of the Korean immigrant lifestyle as well as the realities of the legal proceedings where she translates. She reads between the lines and occasionally oversteps her boundaries, knowing immigrants have their own code and their own realities.The sense of setting and the pacing make this novel succeed, despite the unsympathetic main character and the even less sympathetic romantic entanglements. Along with Suzy, we are exposed to one mystery after another. Why did the family move so often? Where did they get money to buy a store? Where are the family's citizenship papers? Why is the sister so aloof? Who murdered the parents and why?Amazingly, Suki Kim ties up all these loose ends in the last two short chapters. The story behind the murder makes everything fit together, even the reason for her sister's aloofness (if we read between the lines).The ending is satisfying but not happy. I am reminded of the oft-quoted psychological truth: People need meaning to be happy, but meaning doesn't necessarily bring happiness.Heroine Suzy Park can now make a patterned quilt out of the scraps of her life. We're satisfied. She may never be."},{"Title":"The Interpreter","review":"This is an satisfying, entertaining first novel and mystery which explores New York City's Korean American immigrant and merchant community and their 1.5 Generation children. Told in the third person, we meet Suzy Park, on the cusp of turning 30, an ivy-educated, unfinished daughter of immigrant, Korean greengrocers in the Bronx. Estranged from her family, Suzy has aimlessly tripped from one adulterous relationship and temporary job to another. It is a life of unscented impermanence, with dull colored cars and a forever incomplete cathedral. She shuns her fellow 1.5 Generation members who strive in school. Her latest job is as an interpreter for the city court system. As an interpreter, she cannot take sides in court cases, but she is a keen observer and picks up the nuances and subtleties of languages, tones, and expressions. As the story unfolds, the reader will hope that Suzy not only interprets and transfers these depositions, but learns to interpret her own life choices and place in America. Although her parents were killed in a robbery of their store nearly five years ago, she never discusses the tragedy, not even with her friends or prying roommate. But when one client hints at some knowledge of a prior murder of greengrocers, Suzy picks up the trail of the mystery. Like the layers of a greengrocer's onion, the story unfolds as clues are unpeeled in each chapter. Was the robbery a murder? Why did the family move so often? Along the way, the author mixes in Korean culture, Nabokov, the INS, Japanese cinema, news radio-WINS, botany, van Gogh, and King Lear to create an absorbing, expeditious mystery."},{"Title":"The Interpreter","review":"First, the good points: Kim has talent as a writer; some of her descriptions shine, and you can see that there is clear potential somewhere in there. But not with this bummer of a book.First of all, the character: Are we supposed to care about her? Brooding and morose, it's hard for the reader to sympathize with Suzy Park, the nondescript Korean American female protagonist who has all the emotions of a jellyfish. She seems to be an automaton, who, by her own admission, has an affair with a married man at the age of 20 followed by a whole string of affairs for the next decade as she seems to float through life in a comatose state. Why? What compels her? Kim goes into excessive descriptions into how emotionally catatonic, frozen and traumatized Suzy is without explaining why (she is often depicted feeling detached and spaced out--in the rain, in a feverish swoon, throwing up, during a deposition) that I wanted to shake her to her senses! And yet, we are asked to believe that her lover Michael, a disconnected character who calls her \\"babe\\" and uses glib \\"love talk\\" (with a laughably clumsy use of profanity) is madly in love with this dazed and confused woman. Yeah, right.Secondly, the plot: it hints at being a quasi-murder mystery, but rather than follow any aspects of the crime genre, Kim merely uses it as a device to delve into narcissistic angst and excessive self-moping. The clues, hints, and encounters lead nowhere, like a bad David Lynch film. It functions instead as a meditation on detached, empty existence of an ethnic minority. Anyone expecting to get a satisfactory resolution to this \\"mystery\\" will be disappointed.Meanwhile, the promising theme about being an \\"interpreter\\" between two worlds is lost.Other Korean American writers like Chang-rae Lee and Leonard Chang have used the ethnic minority as a \\"spy within the body\\" motif quite well. There could have been a good opportunity here for employing themes of trauma, mystery and immigration/ethnic identity, but Kim doesn't quite have an adequate plot or narrative structure to pull it off. At times, Kim also makes reference to American pop culture references as an example of Suzy's longing to assimilate, how she wants to have the ideal American TV family home and how her reality jars with that. But when she goes into needless descriptions of Manhattan and dialogues about Van Gogh, Nabokov, and Kurosawa's \\"Ran\\", it just comes off as pretentious and self-serving dribble.\\"The Interpreter\\" delves into an unpleasant block of depression that goes nowhere. I guess the worst thing I could say about this book is that it's boring--imagine the movie \\"Memento\\" without the plot structure. But it's a debut novel. With a tighter, more cohesive plot and less heavy handed bleakness and pretentiousness, Kim may be able to pull off a better novel in the future."},{"Title":"The Interpreter","review":"The Interpreter is a psychological novel of stunning prose. The heroine is a 29 year old Korean woman who works as an interpreter in the court system. While the reader travels through her mind, overhearing her reflections on her murdered parents, her estranged sister and her many loves, the reader is also traveling into a dark terrain: the Korean underworld as it exists today in New York. Suki Kim's language is poetic: a stream of consciousness -- fearless and without sentiment -- that bores into the mind of the heroine. The Interpreter is a very impressive literary debut."},{"Title":"The Interpreter","review":"This is an interesting and suspenseful novel in the 'noir' tradition.A young Korean woman is estranged from her parents.

I recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Interpreter","review":"I enjoyed Kim's novel because it mixed genres -- the \\"immigrant\\" novel and the detective novel. The character of Suzy is paradoxicallly intense and detached, full of her own unsolved mysteries, and is our compelling guide to worlds not often explored in recent literature. The blending of genres also allows for both exploring and exploding stereotypes of Asians in America -- Suzy's search for the reasons for her parents' deaths is simultaneously a search for how she fits into this new world they have brought her to, for how she can move beyond the \\"inscrutable\\" \\"Suzy Wong\\" stereotype into being a fully functional citizen of that world."},{"Title":"The Interpreter","review":"I loved this book. Normally, I do not prefer mystery novels but 'The Interpreter' caught me right from the first page. The problem with many mystery novels is that although they are interesting, they lack style. Such is not the dilemma with this book. Suki Kim's intertwining plot coupled with her poetic writing style makes this reviewer recommend this book highly to all readers. The only drawback is that it kept me up for most of the night; consequently, I was late to work."},{"Title":"The Interpreter","review":"This book is amazing. I easily fell in love with the main character, Suzy, a Korean born immigrant living in the United States. I'm not good with reviews, but this book is absolutely captivating! If you are into Asian American literature or Korean culture, please consider this book!"},{"Title":"The Interpreter","review":"I bought this book after reading Kim's piece in the NY Review of Books, which is incredible. This book is cross-genre so it is going to bother folks who want it to be one way or the other. The author tackles complex issues in an accessible, page-turning manner. Nonetheless, Kim shirks a happy ending at the risk of alienating a mainstream following. It is a pretty move gutsy for her, so, in addition to being well written, this boldness earns her high marks."},{"Title":"The Interpreter","review":"The language in this novel haunted me, and keeps haunting me weeks after reading it. It is as interior and quiet and stark as something by Jose Saramago. Really, a beautiful and thrilling book."},{"Title":"The Interpreter","review":"I really wanted to like this book, as I am a Korean-American who aspires to write. But I completely agree with the reviewer of \\"Some promise, but ultimately boring...\\" The plot is sloppy and repetitive--I don't need to be told multiple times about how many times Suzy moved in her life. And I realize the author is trying to show how Suzy is damaged from all the pain she's gone through in her life, but her impulsive actions just make her seem pretentious. And when the \\"mystery\\" was revealed, I thought it was borderline silly! The aspects of Korean-American immigrant life were insightful, but to the point that I left like I was reading a textbook--a little too educational. Maybe to a non-Korean, these descriptions might seem interesting--but I felt the author was trying too hard to be tourguide of Korean immigrant life in the US.Incidentally, I know this writer is talented because I read an angaging, non-fiction account of her trip to North Korea in the NY Times. This leads me to believe that she just needs to work out some of her first author glitches. I'd be willing to give her a second chance."},{"Title":"The Interpreter","review":"Probably the best book I've read in quite some time. I can't believe Suki Kim is a first-time author. She writes with the grace of a 20-year veteran. You will definitely hear/read more from her for many years to come."},{"Title":"The Interpreter","review":"Suki Kim's analysis of the 1.5 generation Asian-Americans is right on the ball. She delves into what we have always felt as the unaccepted populace. The Interpreter is more than just a mystery novel; it cries our loneliness in a land where we are, at least for now, outsiders."},{"Title":"The Interpreter","review":"Suki Kim does some superb writing in this book when she is not so concerned with making all &quot;the pieces&quot; fit. All the sub-plots fit nicely to make a decent conclusion but with one problem. It just does not ring true. Her writing works better when she seems to be writing about her &quot;own experiences&quot; instead of trying to come up with an implausible story line. As a Korean American, I found the book easy to relate to and enjoyable, therefore I would recommend the book but more for Korean American girls than boys."},{"Title":"The Interpreter","review":"I found this book to be a very perceptive and thoughtful novel about the modern immigrant experience, girded over an effective storyline. I would recommend it to anyone looking for that next good read."},{"Title":"The Interpreter","review":"I had been searching for quite a while for a good book to read, and came across this. I had remembered a few praiseworthy reviews, so I picked it up.Could not put it down if my life depended on it. I'm recommending it to just about everyone I know."},{"Title":"The Interpreter","review":"The novel could have been somethign quite wonderful but as it is, it suffers from a far-fetched and rather implausible plot. Kim should have left out what sounds like Hollywood-inspired twists in Suzy's investigation of her parents's murder. The book left me dissatisfied and unmoved. It seems to me a poor imitation at best of Chang-rae Lee's Native Speaker."},{"Title":"The Interpreter","review":"Although not without its flaws, it is an engrossing story told with style and vision. As most serious, educated reviewers will agree, 'The Interpreter' shows the promise of a talented and developing young writer.Who wants to guess that the previous &quot;reviewer&quot; has a chip on his shoulder the size of his mediocre and unfinished manuscript?Whining as a resentful, over-privileged male must be what &quot;A reader from NY, NY&quot; had in mind."},{"Title":"The Interpreter","review":"This has been done before and much, much more deftly. Try Chang's Over the Shoulder or Lee's Native Speaker."},{"Title":"The Interpreter","review":"Suggest checking the NY Times book archives for a fair review. This is a first attempt for the author, and should be accepted and appreciated for the 50th percentile effort that it is. There are really two Korean-American stories here, one of depression and one a detective mystery, and they don't fit together very well. Speaking to the first, the reader has to decide roughly 70-80 pages in, when the novelty of the author's descriptions is starting to wear thin and become boring, whether to proceed. Kim is no Phillip Roth. I did continue, on hope that ethnic/cultural insights might make up for it. Can't say I felt sufficiently rewarded. As for the second, the mystery, it's not well constructed or particularly plausibly handled, i.e., it's more implanted than integrated with the first. To make matters worse, the last page of the book, the ultimate act of the mystery, makes no sense whatsoever relative to everything that's come before. In fact, I would call having the main character turn and solidarize with her parents, in spite of their long-term heinous social behavior toward other Koreans, an act of gross moral cowardice on the author's part (me-generation stuff?). A truly insightful and heroic effort would have had the daughter facing and living with, or being torn apart by, the ambiguity of these two poles. As it is, I wonder, had the daughter been Jewish and her parents pulled acted against other Jews in collaboration with the Nazi authorities, whether the JewishBooks and other reviewers here on amazon would have written so glowingly of this book.There's a character in the book, a mostly absent gay roommate named Caleb, who's a throwaway, i.e., without useful purpose to the story. Ironically enough, however, he's the one given the two best lines by the author (284,286): \\"I'm so bored with blasphemy,\\" and \\"You can only drive yourself crazy if you have no distance from the world.\\" Not earth shattering insights either, but ones the author might do well to contemplate, especially if she wants to become more than a teller of morally empty depressed women's tales."},{"Title":"The Interpreter","review":"I could not put down Ms. Kim's novel. Absorbing in terms of the main character, Suzy Park and the geography she travels through. Beginning with the early scene in the fast food restaurant. I felt the tension and loneliness of Suzy and the potential darkness of her journey. This novel that is both noir in terms of mysterious events but also regarding Suzy's position as a young Korean woman who has painful and complex relationships with lovers and family. The darkness and depth of this first novel is extraordinary."},{"Title":"The Interpreter","review":"The book arrived in a short amount of time and in good shape. I look forward to reading the book soon. Thanks!"},{"Title":"The Interpreter","review":"There are several fictional accounts of interpreters, but \\"The Interpreter,\\" a novel by Suki Kim is a particularly great suspense read -- and an interesting view into what can happen when an interpreter is presented with a conflict of interests.The book tells the story of Suzy Park, a Korean-American court interpreter in New York City. On one of her assignments, she interprets for a witness who, she realizes, knows something about the death of her own parents many years earlier. As a result, she begins looking into her own past in order to unravel the mystery of her parents' homicide.An entertaining book!"},{"Title":"The Interpreter","review":"I can't more highly recommend this book. It is an incredible mix of genres- both a coming of age story and an intriguing mystery. The writing is poetic and it also moves. Really an achievement. It would make an INCREDIBLE movie!! I recommended this to my sister and she loves it too."},{"Title":"The Interpreter","review":"Some people have compared it with Native Speaker but in my humble opinion, Kim is a better writer. Her descriptions are on the money. I really liked the fact that this was an Asian American book but at the same time, it didn't whine about growing up AA as much as other books in the genre. The plot was original.The book was about identity just like all other AA books but it added elements that are found in mainstream non-Asian American works and that is something that has to be applauded. Why do Asian Americans only publish books about the Asian American identity? Why not a mystery or a science fiction novel?"},{"Title":"The Interpreter","review":"The first few sentences of any book is always a deciding factor for me on whether or not to continue reading it. &quot;The Interpreter&quot; passed my inititial test and kept my interest throughout. The protagonist's complexity, strength and vulnerability make her intriguing and likable, and I found myself drawn into her search for the missing pieces of her tormented past. Great story with lots of layers. I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Interpreter","review":"I find it rare to find a book that entwines a highly compelling storyline with insightful social commentary. The author achieves such a double-feat here in a gripping tale of murderous intrigue refracted through the fascinating perspective of her protagonist, Suzy, a member of the '1.5' generation of Asian immigrants. From start to finish I found it impossible to put this book down, driven on by its addictive plot and seductive characters."},{"Title":"The Interpreter","review":"The Interpreter has superficial similarities to post-college women's stories likeThe Devil Wears PradaandGood in Bed. Suzy Park, a Korean-American, is aimless in Manhattan, and goes out for coffee and cigarettes with her loyal college pal. But The Interpreter is much more ambitious and interesting than those bestsellers. The outward story is about Suzy coming to terms with the murder of her hard-working immigrant parents and her estrangement from her sister. Haunted by the past, she plays detective to unravel the mystery of who killed her parents and why. The more universal story is the challenge of seeing her parents as people, and reconstructing her childhood from an adult's point of view. The Interpreter is a fantastically promising first novel that accomplishes much. Suzy's pain and isolation comes through loud and clear. The window into her head when she's performing her job as court interpreter is clear and fascinating.If you are looking for a different tale of a young woman finding her way in New York, you'll love The Interpreter. I look forward to more work from Suki Kim."},{"Title":"The Interpreter","review":"I found this book powerful. It's rare to find a narrator who understands two cultures with such a knowing voice. The language is unique and poetic. I also thought that crossing genres, the immigrant story, the literary mystery was an idea whose time had come."},{"Title":"The Interpreter","review":"Don't read this book expecting a thriller to end all thrillers. But don't expect it to be the same old junk either. Kim is out for much bigger game. She is exploring the search for identity, through a Korean-American's experience no doubt, but allowing some universal themes to shine through. And the issues of immigration are so timely, I can only wonder why this book isn't more popular.Kim has a wonderful voice. She can be both hilarious and thought-provoking at the same time. I can't wait for her next book and I thank her a hundred times over for this one. Suzy is one unforgettable character."},{"Title":"Thompson Chain Reference Bible (Style 514black) - Large Print KJV - Genuine Leather with Capri Grain","review":"I purchased my first Thompson Chain Reference Bible as a new believer back in the 70's. It was and continues to be the best study Bible for those who desire to search out the Word for themselves and compare scripture with scripture. And, the extensive Bible study helps in the back of the Bible do add a rich dimension in addition to the topical chain references.I was a little concerned about the &quot;new&quot; TCR's as several reviewers mentioned degradations in quality and I certainly didn't like the thin glossy paper I saw in the hardbacks in the bookstore. I was delighted today when I received my large print deluxe leather edition Bible.The Bible I received has excellent flat, opaque Bible paper perfect for note-taking. And, the binding appears to have stitching in addition to the glue, so I'd say the quality of the binding is fine and should serve one well for years.One caveat in regard to the large print edition--It is LARGE! Not the print (it's 9 point instead of the regular 8), but the Bible itself. It's not so unwieldy that I would think twice about using it, but if size is an issue for you, check the dimensions and choose accordingly.I can't say enough good things about this Bible. It has my highest recommendation; you won't be sorry in choosing this Bible."},{"Title":"Thompson Chain Reference Bible (Style 514black) - Large Print KJV - Genuine Leather with Capri Grain","review":"The large print is a great friend to your eyes. The side-column references to the Scriptures point to key other passages for your perusal, allowing you to find for yourself what the Bible teaches on any given topic. I especially appreciate the lack of &quot;author&quot; notes that are found in many reference Bibles--they may clarify the meaning, but they may also obscure the true meaning. Awesome topical references, excellent quality! I have read the Bible through over 15 times now, and I highly recommend the Thompson Chain reference for beginners as well as for the experienced. -A Bible that gives you the help you need to find access to other passages, but you can make up your own mind what it means without forced agendas inserted by the publisher. After all, that is what the Bible was written for...if you study it openly, you will find the life-changing truth in it! Five stars!"},{"Title":"Thompson Chain Reference Bible (Style 514black) - Large Print KJV - Genuine Leather with Capri Grain","review":"I expected much better quality. Some of pages have words dimmed and even hard to distinguish, especially in the red letters."},{"Title":"Thompson Chain Reference Bible (Style 514black) - Large Print KJV - Genuine Leather with Capri Grain","review":"This truly is the best study Bible ever published because it has the most wonderful system of chain references. I also like that there's no &quot;study notes&quot; written by someone who could lead you away from what God might be trying to say to you. Many Bibles with same page study notes are very helpful, but they can be distracting as well. The Thompson Chain simply guides you through the chain of scriptures and you come to your own understanding. This purchase will be my 2nd for myself - going to the large print - and I also purchased the large print NIV for my husband. He loves it, too. One other thing - the binding on Kirkbride Thompson Chains is the best - very strong and really hold up. Of course, it goes without saying that God's Word is the best book that was ever published or ever will be published."},{"Title":"Thompson Chain Reference Bible (Style 514black) - Large Print KJV - Genuine Leather with Capri Grain","review":"Bought this for my husband, who is a preacher. He wanted the large text for better readability while preaching. He loves it! I like it too and plan to buy one for myself later. I've always loved Thompson's Chain Reference Bibles. The large print makes it easier to read. It is a large book, but for home use, it's very nice. Thank you!"},{"Title":"Thompson Chain Reference Bible (Style 514black) - Large Print KJV - Genuine Leather with Capri Grain","review":"I love the New King James Version, put out by Thomas Nelson, but I loath Thomas Nelson Bibles. This is how I happened upon the Thompson a few years ago as I was relieved to find a NKJV not made by T.N. I first bought an NKJV in bonded leather. After 2 years of very heavy use, I bought an NKJV in genuine leather, and later a handy size KJV in genuine. All three of these Bibles are wonderful in every way.The Thompson Study system is very helpful and they've graciously spared us from a myriad of religious cliche and personal opinion. The page layout is smart. The Bible text actually fills the page and all study helps and references are relegated to the side margins. There are so many ways to use the studies and references, I am unable to number them here. The concordance is as extensive as any I've seen. The 14 maps are colorful and very well done. Simply put, it's a complete, Jesus-exalting study Bible designed with excellence.The construction of these Bibles is equally impressive. The paper is just right--not too thick, not too thin. The print is dark and sharp. Their font is subtil and very appropriate for the Bible, if you ask me. The red words of Jesus are RED. They're not muddy brown; they're not pink; they're bright, deep, beautiful red. They are printed consistantly page to page, not some pages lighter or misprinted, as the Thomas Nelson folks are plagued by.Now that I own three Thompsons, I feel about them the way a good ol' boy down in the South feels about shotguns. &quot;I have more than I need, but not as many as I want!&quot;"},{"Title":"Thompson Chain Reference Bible (Style 514black) - Large Print KJV - Genuine Leather with Capri Grain","review":"I own over 30 Bibles and this is by far the best Bible I have ever used. It is a complete study Bible with a large number of charts, graphs, tables, outlines, character studies, etc. Instead of having to look up outside references while you're studying, you have all the references you will need in one book. The paper and binding are excellent quality. The large print Bible is a bit large to carry around, but manageable.Tony Cross"},{"Title":"Thompson Chain Reference Bible (Style 514black) - Large Print KJV - Genuine Leather with Capri Grain","review":"After reading all the reviews on this Bible, and now having mine in hand, I feel this is the best and most comprehensive study Bible available. I see people complaining about general poor quality, binding, hard leather, small point large print, thin see-through pages, dull red lettering, etc, I just had to wonder if they were talking about the same Thompson Chain Reference Bible (mine is King James Version) that I have come to know and love. Prior to ordering I was having doubts and looked at many other Bibles, thinking to myself how could Kirkbride's quality slide so far since I bought my first TCRB in NIV in 1985. Well in my case at least I was not disappointed once I got my 16th printing, April 2012 edition.I always wanted a genuine leather King James study bible and the price was right during the extended days of the Black Friday madness. So glad I did. I did not take any stars away from the product because my only complaints were how the vendor failed to clarify the vague description of the Bible by Kirkbride. So the review is just about the Bible itself.The not so good...I expected my Bible to have thumb indexes like the pictures of the box for the style 514 black (it's not shown on Amazon's site but at other vendors for twice the price), but it did not have thumb indexes. Once I received the Bible I checked back on Amazon's site and the description does not mention thumb index. The image on Amazon only shows the Bible with the spine at the front so you cannot see the page edges. Looking at Kirkbride's site it is a $10 option, but they sell TCRB at twice the price of Amazon. Still, I really did want thumb index for very good reason: Thompson chain reference system has so many sections and so you are constantly flicking around all those sections. Now I have to stick those ugly protruding plastic tabs on these thin pages. I am sure I cannot get the correct section tab titles for it. And when you you use adhesive on thin paper it dries and stains the pages rather badly over time. Also the tabs will be sticking out so it is easy to hooks the tabs on things and even rip the pages. If it had the original tabs sculptured into the pages I would never have to deface my beautiful Bible. I would have returned it except I had already opened the Bible.I also agree with other reviewers that 9 points could hardly be considered Large Print. My wife has smaller Bible and it has larger (10.5) point print than this one. In their defense, if would have been task to produce a larger font with all those sections, so you probably could not carry it around.The gilt embossing on the spine is not clear because the letters bleed. The capri is much more grainy leather finish and it is hard to emboss, so a larger kerning font would be easier to read. It is definitely not the same quality as my 1985 TCRB, but how times change.The Good comments...The genuine leather - black Capri grain is soft to the touch and not flimsy at all to hold. Still firm but falls nicely from the spine. The leather edging on the inner cover is well secured to last and does not appear to be hardened with board as many do.Smyth Sewn is something I look for in any quality bound books. It is a centuries old technique of taking folded flat sheets known as signatures and stitching them together with very fine, strong thread. This is quality stitching and will handle wear and tear for years to come.The gold foil page edging is beautiful and is as good a quality as my Cambridge Bible.The red letters of the words of Christ on my Bible are deep red and uniform throughout (not brown or orange, or pink as other Bibles). I checked many of its 1921 pages and the black and red print is uniform throughout.The registration of the full color plates of the maps section are clean, but some of the maps appear pale, while one map has vibrant color. The text is still quite legible on the color backgroundsThe paper is very thin. How thin? I have no idea, but I think it is India paper, but Kirkbride don't publish that information. The pages have good opacity so as to minimize 'show-through' of printing on the reverse side. The paper has sufficient strength to sustain the usage it will receive over the years. It is thin, but not so thin that it will tear, and yet the pages turn easily and quickly. Good job Kirkbride.A reviewer said their TCRB was printed in Korea and this almost put me off. I am pleased to say that everything is printed and manufactured in the U.S.A. and pray it stays that way.There is no room for margin notes alongside those 100,000 margin entries, but then this is a study Bible after all. The text is spread out well over the page with the margin notes.The content, structure and study system is what we have come to expect from a TCRB and this is no exception.It has already been such a blessing to our family, and I pray this review helps someone.May God bless you richly in your choice of His eternal Word."},{"Title":"Thompson Chain Reference Bible (Style 514black) - Large Print KJV - Genuine Leather with Capri Grain","review":"The Thompson Chain in the KJV is my preferred Bible.

What I liked most about it was that Claudia Nice takes you through the basic line styles you use in pen and ink drawings: line drawings, contour lines, parallel lines, crosshatching, strippling, scribble lines, wavy lines, and crisscross lines. She gives examples of how to use each one of them. The examples are really good and you will want to move to your own subject matter in a hurry.As good as this book is, I thought it could have been more useful in discussing sizing and layout of the subject matter. One of her other books discusses using the gridvu system; this would have been an good addition to this book. I also thought that she could have provided more insight on how and when you should combine line techniques. She has plenty of examples using one type of line technique and a few using a combination. When using one kind of line technique in a drawing, you can easily see the type of effect it has. That was beneficial. However, there is little guidance on how and when to combine them. The combined techniques make the drawing more interesting and appealing.My critique above should not take away from the other strengths of this book.

Don't pay full price!"},{"Title":"First Steps Drawing in Pen & Ink (First Step Series)","review":"for overall pen and ink learning from beginning to mastery. I've been drawing a lot lately, using various instruction books, and this is the best general pen and ink art book I've found. It is a substantial, well-written book and worth the price.I like pen-and-ink because of the look of the definite lines, and interesting textures that can be achieved, and the wonderful way it combines with color washes (this topic is covered in other books). I also like drawing with ink because it avoids the draw, erase-redo, repeat habits that I was getting, and forces one to think and look carefully before starting to draw. Claudia Nice demonstrates seven basic pen strokes and then expands on them, and gives some projects utilizing these strokes, and, eventually, demonstrates several very detailed finished compositions, using a variety of subjects. She does a great job teaching how to make textures using the seven stroking techniques--crosshatch, stippling, wavy lines, etc.By way of introduction to this medium she discusses materials needed, including the \\"technical pen\\". I am currently drawing with Pitt artist pens in three widths, but am looking forward to getting a some of technical pens--most likely a set of seven Rapidograph ones, which you can get here on Amazon--for even better results.With this book in hand, as well as pens and paper, one can learn a lot and have success. Also, I would like to suggest a couple of other books to round out the experience, if you wish. For a more thorough background and understanding, \\"Drawing for the Absolute and Utter Beginner\\" is best. The author, Clair Watson Garcia, is a great teacher for someone starting out, or going back--she spends a lot of time teaching you how to \\"see as an artist\\" and do line drawings in ink of things around you, rather than copying everything from a book, and before going into values, techniques, etc. Lastly, I have ordered \\"Keys to Drawing with Imagination...\\" by Bert Dodson, after looking through it in a bookstore. He does a lot with pen-and-ink, too, and I'm looking at this book as a way to expand my originality after learning techniques and practicing examples in books.Happy Drawing!"},{"Title":"First Steps Drawing in Pen & Ink (First Step Series)","review":"I wish I had had this book years ago.

The remainder of the book describes and illustrates techniques and methods using many, many examples.

Very broad variety of subjects drawn as well and not just landscapes and buildings. I also bought Claudia's 'Sketching Your Favourite Subjects in Pen and Ink' and that is just as good and although I've not read it properly yet, it doesn't appear that any (or many) of the examples are duplicated between the 2 books and it has almost an entirely different range of worked examples."},{"Title":"First Steps Drawing in Pen & Ink (First Step Series)","review":"I really like Claudia Nice...she is a very talented artist who explains well in her illustrations.

I have purchased other claudia nice books and this is probably her best book for beginners in pen and ink. Unlike Guptill's book on pen and ink, this book offers less written instructions and more examples of pen and ink artwork, with short comments and instructions. For example, I like Claudia's comments on a basic stroke technique, crosshatching, she suggests are are great for \\"adding roughened texture, deepening shadows\\", along with an illustration of how crosshatching is used to that effect. That said, for a First Steps, I would have liked it if she had shown additional steps, instead of the 2-4 which goes from: sketch, to detailed sketch, to completed ink and pen work (beautiful as it is). I would have liked more steps between detailed sketch and completed ink and pen, how did she build up tone and highlights, etc.? BTW, you will find the same illustrations and instructions repeat in her other books. I would still recommend this book and would also suggest if you can't afford the entire wonderful set of Rapidograph pen, you can start with the .25 which is the one I use most often (for smaller size artwork). I wish there was a comprehensive pen and ink book out there. Hope this helps."},{"Title":"Automation","review":"John Diebold wrote widely for the computer trade press and on industrial management in the 1950s, 60s and 70s. He established one of the first technology consultancies (The Diebold Group) to publish regular reports on then-current computing technology.At the time this book was written, Diebold was still employed as a management consultant for Griffenhagen and Associates of Chicago. Initially, he was known primarily for \\"Making the automatic factory a reality\\", a well-received and widely serialized paper authored when he was a graduate student in Professor Georges Doriot's course on manufacturing at the Harvard Business School. Diebold received his MBA from Harvard in 1951 and \\"Automation\\" was published a year later, dedicated to Doriot. It pre-dates any widespread use of computers by industry and offers a blueprint for how and where they might be useful. It was reprinted by the American Management Association in 1983 and then again ten afterwards (see http://www.hbs.edu/entrepreneurship/newbusiness/2002spring_2.html and Diebold's 1965 biography by Wilbur Cross).In a prefatory note to the book, Diebold explains that he had adopted the coinage \\"automation\\" as a shortened version of \\"automatization\\", noting that it is both less awkward and less prone to spelling errors.Unlike several of his later books which were essentially collections of Diebold's speechs and shorter papers, this book is a relatively unified monograph. Diebold concentrates on the business uses of automation rather than the technical details and there are some howlers, such as the claim that Babbage's difference engine would have been an analogue computer. However, his chapters on possible factory and office operations that might be ripe for automation still look quite reasonable after fifty years. These chapters constitute a preliminary attempt at systems analysis, conducted before anyone had a formal name for it, much less the needed methodology. In the final two chapters, Diebold speculates on automation's effect on business and its larger social and economic impact, a harder task to perform well."},{"Title":"Morning Sky (Freedoms Path Series #2)","review":"Morning Sky is the second book in Judith Millers Freedom's Path Series about the Harban and Boyle families.

Then Lily Verdue, his sister-in-law, arrives from New Orleans. Exekiel suspects Lily is running from someone, which doesn't surprise him one bit. A free spirited woman who makes her own rules, Lily is not the kind of person he wants living in the same house with his daughters.Before long, Lily starts to cause just the kind of trouble Exekiel feared. She tries to break up Truth's engagement to Moses Wyman, because she feels he would be better suited to Jarena. Nevermind that Jarena is in love with Thomas, who is serving in the army, fighting Indians. Lily is a woman of the world and knows what is best for her sheltered nieces.Dr. Boyle asks Truth to travel to New York to see about his daughter Macia, who is enrolled in an exclusive finishing school. Macia has been sick ever since reaching the city.

More than a social visit, she's fleeing a promiscuous lifestyle in New Orleans and turns to her only relatives in Kansas. Ezekiel, her brother-in-law and head of the family, isn't happy to see Lilly because he knows her arrival signals some sort of trouble. An expert at manipulation, Lilly takes a position as housekeeper and cook for the family of George Nelson, a banker in nearby Hill City. This is a challenge for Lilly because she has to care for their three children (she doesn't like youngsters), and as a lady of leisure she isn't much into cooking or cleaning.Dr. Samuel Boyle moved his family out west from Kentucky and is the only physician for either town. His daughter Macia, who has fallen in love with the local blacksmith, is sent to New York City by her mother for a summer of education at the Ruthledge Academy of Arts and Languages, a school of distinction for young ladies. Each new student is forced to sign some extra \\"papers,\\" which turn out to be a life insurance policy. Mr. Marvin Laird, a distant cousin of the Ruthledges, slips into their food or drink a drug that makes them sleep constantly.When the Boyles receive a letter that Macia is sick, they send Truth Harban, their housekeeper and cook, to accompany their daughter home. Eventually, Truth uncovers this sinister plot to keep Macia captive. In coordination with Silas, the African American stable hand at the school, Truth devises a means for the three of them to escape and return to Kansas.While Truth travels to New York, her older sister, Jarena, takes up Truth's duties at the Boyle home. Truth is engaged to newspaperman Moses Wyman, but Lilly decides that her niece is too young for this marriage and plots to put Jarena and Moses together. The scheming backfires and reveals the long-held family secret of an unexpected relationship between Lilly and Jarena. The theme of forgiveness is a strong aspect of this story. As Moses says about some of his past, \\"Now here's the most important part, Jarena: I wouldn't change one thing in my life. There's been pain and sorrow, but I know that God was always in control.\\"From my standpoint the litmus test for this second title in the Freedom's Path series is to see how quickly I fall back in love with the characters from the first book, despite months of not reading anything about them. It transpired in an instant, and I immediately plunged back into the world of the 1880s; the experience was seamless and rich with drama. With MORNING SKY Judith Miller has created a remarkable story worthy of your reading attention.--- Reviewed by W. Terry Whalin"},{"Title":"Morning Sky (Freedoms Path Series #2)","review":"In 1880 Nicodemus, Kansas, two generations of Harbans live a quiet lifestyle when unwelcome Lilly Verdue arrives from New Orleans. Ezekiel, the Family patriarch, is unhappy to see his sister-in-law and demands she explain why she came to the quiet plains; Lilly refuses to say much about her past and her reason to hastily depart from the big city for a farming community.Though she plans to avoid scandal, Lilly thinks her niece Jarena is engaged to the wrong man, a soldier Thomas Grayson whom she loyally waits for his return while caring for her dad and her sister Grace. When Lilly meets Moses Wyman, she believes that though he is engaged to Truth, he is going to marry the wrong Harban, as she feels he and Jarena belong together. She decides to matchmake, which forces her to reveal the truth to her nieces. Needing escape, Truth travels to New York to bring home her ailing friend Macia Boyle from the academy she attends there only to find something more lethally sinister than illness there.Three years have passed since the events of FIRST DAWN, which enable the audience to see what has happened to the Harban family since then. They remain likable and for the most part admirable while along with a solid support cast bring the late Reconstruction Era Plains to life especially for Christian historical readers. Though the secret and the Truth trip to New York come late, these add suspense by \\"testing\\" the Harbans' Christian values including their core belief in God. Judith Miller in her second Freedom's Path tale provides a pleasurable Americana saga.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Morning Sky (Freedoms Path Series #2)","review":"The all Colored town has finally gotten started.

It's also the one that is more widely played than almost any other game on the planet, with the possible exception of football (or soccer, if you wish to be all-inclusive). Cricket is a very old, very beautiful, and very exciting game, and, having the long history that it does, there is a vast, rich legacy of terms, expressions, and phrases associated with it. These can be quite confusing to the uninitiated, especially in non-cricketing countries.Enter the 'Dictionary of Cricket'. Mr. Rundell, who is noted simply as a 'lexicographer' - and cricket afficianado - on the jacket, has assembled a clear, effective, concise collection of terms both archaic and modern, highlighting them with extracts from a wide variety of cricket literature, most of which - particularly in the United States - would be otherwise unavailable. This book is a guide for everyone, from the interested amateur to the keenest follower of anything from Test matches to local county cricket.My sole quibble with the guide, and one which certainly is not enough to diminish the book's value as a whole, is the illustration, which is confined to simple line drawings and diagrams - one generally expects better from Oxford. However, there are many other books out there if you want pictures. If you want simply the facts and explanations of everything every said about cricket, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Dictionary of Cricket","review":"I didn't like the book, I wish I had bought a different book but this book was totally boring for me.

Besides being incredibly well researched, Shuster's ability to lay out the religious quest in the modern age gets right to the heart of the matter. We can not escape our angst about who we are because it is what makes us seek our redemption. To believe you've got the answer is you're downfall. By incorporating scripture, literature, philosophical, theological arguments and fathers of the church, a picture of humanity arises that gives us back the dignity of being here in the first place. I haven't enjoyed such lucid christian arguments in a book since C.S.Lewis. I hadn't read any existential theology since my seventies graduate years of Camus and Dostoyevsky. Marguerite Shuster's timely work for me, renewed my faith and love of that old time religious question. Who are we? And sent me to her mentor Paul King Jewett to find out who we are."},{"Title":"The Fall and Sin: What We Have Become as Sinners","review":"There are many redeeming qualities to this book. Some of these include that it has a fairly thorough academic background, making it useful for reviewing several positions in one place. This also means the bibliography is useful for finding sources on particular points of view. Finally, most of the positional critiques are fair in their presentation and not overly polemic or biased. However, to call this work conservative or Calvinist is being generous.In fact the work is quite really against some basic biblical principles. First of these is that The Scripture plainly teaches that women are not to be putting themselves or to be put into positions of authority over men in the church (1 Timothy 2:12 and following). Contrary to this, Marguerite Shuster is teaching at a Seminary, both men and women, about preaching and teaching and theology. That makes this work first and foremost a product of sinful behavior. This does not mean the work is inherently sinful but does certainly mean that it is the fruit of sin and as such is a tremendously ironic work. Along this same line there are several areas where Dr. Shuster takes the feminist position (see pages 56-57 for an example).That this work is against palagianism and for the most part arminianism cannot be disputed. She makes strong attempts to relate a Total Depravity view of the Fall and for the most part does so successfully.Long story short, I originally bought this book to be use as a source for a paper in support for the calvinistic position on the Doctrine of the fall and ended up using as a source representing the feminist view in my paper."},{"Title":"Hanged at Auschwitz","review":"Like many, I've read my share of books on the individual experience of the Holocaust. This one shook my senses so profoundly that I've had trouble sleeping and woke recently in the wee hours after bad dreams!Kessel was a member of the French Resistance who endured incredibly sadistic beatings, physical labor designed to slowly sap a person's lifeforce and two condemnations of death. He personally witnessed so many incidents of murder and unspeakable behavior by his captors and fellow inmates that they become, as he relates, almost normal in light of their daily occurence. He recounts his story at times with detachment but always the reader is struck by the overall unrelenting anguish of the time -- from January 1943 until liberation -- that he endured. The horror is real and, as he points out, the possibility of ANY human being succumbing to such animalistic, base behavior is utterly and completely real. One needs only to recall a couple of recent events such as \\"ethnic cleansing\\" in Eastern Europe, or the systematic murder of the Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994 to know that Kessel speaks a universal truth.Elie Wiesel expounded on the importance of never forgetting man's inhumanity to man.

Paging through this volume shows the ambitiously crafty ends toward which the paper used their 4-color miracle machine. Of course there are photographs and line drawings, crazy cartoons and ads; but there's also waterpaint-boxes (enabling readers to wet the page and paint for a contest), easter egg patterns that transfer from the vinegared newsprint page, cut out dolls, boxing puppets whose clobbering fists deploy the fingers of the hand that holds them, and even a tachistoscopic thread that encouraged readers to cut out the image on a tape and make a movie at home. Brentano and Baker deserve the applause of all future generations; this book demonstrates a slice of the feast they saved from the chop shops. These rainbow images contrast starkly with the wallpaper at Subway sandwich shops, which use the bleary black and white microfiche reproductions of the same newsprint. The authors raised $150K to buy the British Library's last extant volumes archiving the golden age of America's yellow journalism, and they eventually found a hospitable archive at Duke. Nicholson Baker has written a book that describes their fight to save this trove. If you are a fan of his noodling, endlessly discursive writing, that's the one item that's not included here: the captions for each page are written by his wife and partner, Margaret Brentano, in clear descriptive terms that let the astounding pages do all the dazzling."},{"Title":"The World on Sunday : Graphic Art in Joseph Pulitzer's Newspaper (1898 - 1911)","review":"This book celebrates one of the high points in American popular culture. In the late 1800's, Joseph Pulitzer, publisher of the New York World, purchased the first great high quality color printer for newspapers. He then used it to publish beautiful color graphics every Sunday. This is both great art and great entertainment. But the story of how the author Nicholson Baker and his wife, Margaret Brentano, tracked down the last surviving complete collection of this work just before it was to be lost forever is just as thrilling. This is an exquisite book that is the product of great work by great people. Get ready to enjoy a true treasure."},{"Title":"The World on Sunday : Graphic Art in Joseph Pulitzer's Newspaper (1898 - 1911)","review":"Amazingly, there almost no collections of Pulitzer's ground-breaking newspaper in existence. At considerable personal expense, authors Baker and Brentano rescued a trove of New York World papers from a library in Britain. Here they reproduce a selection of the Sunday pages, mostly covers. Included are covers by comic artists like Outcault, Herriman, and McManus, but also by \\"fine\\" artists like George Luks -- and a fabulous graphic artist named Biedermann, among many others.Words just cannot do justice to this wonderful volume. The use of color separation here is just incredible, and is something that anyone who loves printmaking or beautiful graphics will treasure. Comics afficianados who love Winsor McCay and Lionel Fenninger will find much to appreciate here, as will those who love Chris Ware.

Aside from the short-life expectancy and lack of modern conveniences like, uh, cars, ATMs, antibiotics, radio, microwave ovens, television, computers, etc., this book makes you wish you lived back then- when science, technology, and journalism were in their infancy and every day held some new, authentic wonder- not just a smaller cell phone. It's also quite amazing to see how advertisements, typefaces, layouts, and prose have radically changed in a century, and not necessarily for the better- unless you're one of those \\"Form Follows Function\\" kooks. A must for all you Luddites out there."},{"Title":"The World on Sunday : Graphic Art in Joseph Pulitzer's Newspaper (1898 - 1911)","review":"Leafing through this special book brought home two things.One: How grand the Sunday edition of \\"The World\\" was a century ago. \\"The World\\" was Joseph Pulitzer's newspaper in New York City. In 1898 Pulitzer bought a new high-speed color printing press, and he employed first-class artists and graphic designers to make the most of the press's four-color printing capabilities. Today there are no newspapers and few magazines as sumptuously illustrated as was the Sunday \\"World\\" from 1898 to 1911, the span covered by this book.Two: How phenomenally negligent we are about preserving the intellectual and artistic heritage from our recent past. This book exists only because of the efforts of Nicholson Baker and his wife Margaret Brentano to save the last known run of the New York World from de-acquisition by an institutional library and sale for pulp or cannibalization by dealers. They purchased the bound volumes containing the original newspapers from The British Library, after even the Library of Congress and the New York Public Library had disposed of their sets. (In 2003, those bound volumes were transferred to Duke University.) As a society we devote considerable resources to excavating and preserving the midden piles of Anasazi Indians and Sumerians, but we cavalierly consign some of the richest (in terms of informational and aesthetic content) artifacts of our own century-old civilization to the scrap dealers.THE WORLD ON SUNDAY contains 64 full-color two-page spreads from the bound volumes that once were in the British Library and now reside at Duke. Some of the illustrations and graphics are nigh breath-taking. The texts include news, contemporary commentary, humor, and advertisements. Collectively they are a unique window on life in the United States - and especially New York City - at the turn of the last century. Nicholson Baker contributes a short informative introduction and Margaret Brentano adds similarly brief but informative remarks to each page of newspaper reproductions. The book is large-format (though only one-third the size of the original newspaper sheets) and intelligently and handsomely put together. It too is worthy of a library."},{"Title":"The World on Sunday : Graphic Art in Joseph Pulitzer's Newspaper (1898 - 1911)","review":"I am a fan of the \\"Golden Age\\" of American Comics which ran from the late 1930's through the 1940's. \\"The World on Sunday\\" is a compilation of some of the best graphic art that appeared in Joseph Pulitzer's \\"The World\\" from 1898 to 1911. Most fans of American comic book history know about the history of the early American comic strips of this period. The creators of the Golden Age undoubtedly were influenced by these early comic strips. However, they always were profoundly influed by the rich visual art work that came out in the newspapers of the era. \\"The World on Sunday\\" is beautifully produced and is a must purchase for all those interested in American popular culture.

THE WORLD ON SUNDAY gathers over a hundred of the best from WORLD and places them in an oversized presentation to display their color on single and double-page spreads. A chronological arrangement lends to a fine sequence of reproductions tracing editorial and news highlights of the times, while colorful commentary accompanies the pieces and provides the necessary background for appreciation by all audiences. THE WORLD ON SUNDAY: GRAPHIC ART IN JOSEPH PULITZER'S NEWSPAPER (1898-1911) is a top pick not just for art or newspaper library holdings, but for general-interest collections as well: it captures the art, craft and style of a bygone era and is a lush example of newspaper history at its finest.Diane C.

Forth grade, if you go to school in Oregon, is spent totally studying the trail. You visit the nearest trail sites (which are everywhere), learn to make candles, and write fake trail diaries. It's a lot of fun, and ever since then I've been fascinated with the trail. Living across the river from Oregon city and going there everyday fuels that.But I've only been able to find historical fiction about the trial written for kids and young adults. This always bothered me, because while those books written for kids may be great, they're not of an adult perspective on the great migration west. So I was thrilled when I found this book.This is the story of Abbey, who I think is a fictional person. She endured tragedy while homesteading in Ohio and heads to Indepdence on her own to fulfill her dead husbands dream of going to Oregon. While I think the idea of a woman alone on the trail, even with hired help like Abbey has, is not historical accurate, this book is great. The descriptions are trail life is very alive and emotional, and I could really feel the emotions of the travelers as the first saw the great northwest. It is called great for a reason.This book is very good and obviously well researched. I recommend it for anyone who loves historical fiction. I do wish I knew though if there ever was a woman who traveled without a husband or male family all the way to Oregon City, or if Abbey is a made up person entirely. I was always taught that any woman on the trail had to get immediately re married if her husband died, or if her father died and she was of marriageable age. The journey was too just much for people on their own, and woman, by the social conventions of the day, where not permitted to band together with other woman and go with friends as men were.So I may never know if Abbey's situation was possible or not. The author obviously knows his stuff, so I'll defer to his expertness. The only thing I didn't like about this book is it really shows that the hope that Oregon City represented to travelers has just been hopelessly wasted by the economic depressing the city (well, town really) is currently in. Its not the authors fault in any way, but Oregon City is a pretty depressing place now.Five stars for this wonderful book, that I've spent years searching for.I also recommend along with this \\"Across the Wide and Lonesome Prairie: The Oregon Trail Diary of Hattie Campbell, 1847 (Dear America)\\" by Kristiana Gregory, which, even though it's a young adult book, is a great historical look at the Oregon Trail."},{"Title":"Western Passage","review":"I enjoyed the book emensly. Very interesting perspective of day to day log and viewing it from the eye's of the heroine who has never seen such things before. Exposing the new country through her eyes and not filling in with geographical information made it seem as though you were along on the journey with her. For those who have been to some of the places like the Dalles, Farwell Bend and the three island crossing Idaho it makes it all the more colorful. I thought the biographical info in the appendix was great, but was a little dissappointed that the two main characters were left out. I hope another book is written to continue the heroines story. The book fairly defines what the term \\"pioneer spirit\\" was."},{"Title":"Western Passage","review":"One of my favorite authors as a child was Laura Ingalls Wilder and the Little House books. I loved reading her books which often gave great and exacting how to's (how to make maple syrup, how to use a pig bladder as a balloon, how to twist hay into sticks when you run out of wood, etc.). I loved the idea of heading out west with nothing but some good horses and a covered wagon with just the essentials. In fact, while many had Barbies that were getting dressed for their prom date with Ken, mine was hitching up the horses and riding along with Jane West to the great unknown.My brother sent me a copy of Western Passage by T.J. Hanson. I'm still trying to figure out if the fact that it is a large print edition was intentional or not since it was for my birthday.If you liked reading Laura Ingalls Wilder and her descriptions, then this is also a book you will enjoy. In this book, you follow the heroine, Abby, every step of the way from Independence to Oregon City. And I mean every step of the way, from learning what kind of supplies would be bought, to taking a wagon across a stream, this book follows along with the first wagon train along the Oregon Trail. You are really right there. Even though this is fiction, it reads like a really good journal."},{"Title":"Western Passage","review":"My wife was the first in our family to read this novel. She was enthralled with it, identifying well with the emphasis on a woman's perspective on this most difficult of journeys. When she finished it was my turn. What a treat. This novel is very enjoyable, and an easy read. While I admit to being particularly interested in the details of such a journey and the landscape as described by the author, I think most anyone would find it interesting. The scholar in the author is also evident by the research done to gather the material for the book. A day-by-day \\"log\\" was an interesting approach. It provided both the details of what was seen and what happened, it also gave the reader a sense of the length of the journey. About the time we got to the Snake River Plains, I tired of reading about yet one more day on the trail - then I realized how tired the travelers must have become, making the story of the journey more real for me. Additionally, it was easy to identify with the people, both Abbey and Jacob. Hope we get to learn more about their fate in the new land in a future book."},{"Title":"Western Passage","review":"To begin with, the very comfortable spacing of print, and 12-point font, makes for easy reading. The story opens with interest, and holds one's attention page after page, until the unwanted end (I wanted the book to continue). Even the Appendices were interesting, especially Appendix A which I consulted regularly and with gratification. The story is just terrific, both as fiction, and I believe a great deal of non-fiction. The book gives the sense of utilizing episodes from many diaries and other sources. The characters, both fictitious and otherwise, are likeable as well as \\"human\\", and virtually all the development of scenes so credible. It's a nice, \\"clean\\" book-good for grandchildren in almost all respects.I appreciate that the author did not try to fill in with information about the Oregon Trail that was learned after 1843; it made the story much more realistic. I read Western Passage with a road atlas, an Oregon topographic map, and a plastic, raised contour map. To my surprise, I learned a lot about our geography. The tale of their remarkable achievements is so vivid and yet so \\"daily\\" that it brings both the achievements and the natural humdrum of travel alive. This latter quality is rare in fiction, at least in interesting fiction. The writing is so clear and straight forward, and just plain readable, pleasant, and lively.The details about all the supplies and equipment acquisitions, and organizational problems was fascinating, as well as that of the trail-breaking for wagons all the way along. It's hard to take in how numerous the people, wagons, and livestock were. One of the especially interesting features was the efforts emigrants made at organizing a trail government, and the vagaries through which it went. It had enough detail to make it real to the reader, but not so much that it took away from the momentum of the story and journey.My husband and I are looking forward to getting copies for each of our descendant families.

Newton"},{"Title":"Western Passage","review":"This is the story of Abby, who is recently widowed and determined to finish her husband's dream of starting a new life in the Wallamet (now spelled Willamette) valley. The story follows her through her journey to Independence, getting her wagon purchased and stocked, hiring the fur trapping mountain man Jacob to man her rig and off on the trail to Oregon. This is not a page turning, racy sit on the edge of your seat type of book. This follows every bit of day to day business, from how they made their food, hunted, crossed the rivers, and kept not only themselves but their livestock alive.The trail follows the western plains, over the Rockies, through Idaho into Oregon's Blue Mountains and finally through the Columbia River Gorge on the way to the end of the trail at Oregon City. Although I mentioned some might not find this a racy page turner, I was thoroughly fascinated and had a hard time putting the book down. The historical detail, even of the day to day part of living on the trail was fascinating -- the buffalo stampede was just heart stopping.All in all a very good tale of a courageous woman with \\"sand\\" as Jacob called her, able to live up to and exceed the challenges of the Oregon Trail to reach her destination and achieve her dreams of a new life in Oregon City. I especially enjoyed the last of the tale, as Abby sees the Columbia River for the first time and her reaction to the beauty of that river. I am fortunate to live in the Pacific Northwest and have traveled many times along that glorious river, and the author brought all of it magically to life -- the rapids (which are long gone due to dams), the basalt cliffs, the waterfalls, Beacon Rock are all there for the reader to experience along with Abby.This was a first rate book and I highly recommend for any lover of historical fiction or for one interested in the Oregon Trail."},{"Title":"Western Passage","review":"I was very disappointed with this book as it was presented to me as a book of historical facts. Well, maybe if you have never known anything about anything.This book is strickly a novel. It is to be read just for pleasure. It is a great book if you want to follow a woman who traveled by herself in a wagon train, which was NOT allowed.The author sold it as the frist wagon train to leave MO, that was done in 1841 not 1843 as this man wants you to believe. He talked about not having a trail to follow yet on the other side of a river crossing, the wagon train would have to back track to pick up the trail again?And I love this one, in the back of the book, the writer has a member of the wagon train beginning the city of Sacramento, wasn't that Sutter?And at times the book was redundant. At times I was thinking okay, let's go already.As I said, this book is strickly fictional with not much historical value.

The majority of serious crimes are committed by career criminals who are often identified by \\"lines of information\\". The majority of homicides are not committed by professional criminals. Scientific training is needed to distinguish homicides from suicides. This book was written to improve police investigations by preserving evidence so it is neither contaminated or destroyed, and to tell how to get scientific assistance to prepare a case for court. August Vollmer said it should be required reading for all policemen (p.vii). [Readers of true crime and mysteries could also benefit.] In the \`Preface' LeMoyne Snyder said there were few organizations in the US or Canada like the medicolegal institutes in Europe and Latin America to investigate violent deaths [as of the 1940s]. The purpose of this book is to provide practical plans of procedure to adequately investigate deaths for those without scientific training. Each chapter contains a brief section on the medical aspects to aid a coroner prior to an autopsy and avoid serious errors of omission or commission. The \`Acknowledgments' thank the many who contributed to this book, especially the group from Harvard Medical School. Erle Stanley Gardner also contributed (his novels often used little-known medical facts). Chapter 20 explains why this book was written. A dead body was found in a kitchen. No notes were made, no photographs taken, no search for fingerprints or other evidence. The autopsy was perfunctory. The crime scene was cleaned up. When a suspect was arrested the lack of evidence set him free. If only they knew what to do!Chapter 5 discusses the identification of dead bodies, and tells of one case where Snyder recognized a dead friend after an apartment fire. The next day he found his friend was in fact alive (p.51)! A lip print can identify a person (\\"The Case of the Crimson Kiss\\"). A pelvis identifies the sex of an skeleton (p.62), and can indicate the age (p.63). Chapter 7 discusses gunshot wounds. Typically wounds of entrance are neat round holes. Wounds of exit are larger, ragged, torn, and bloodier (pp.106-107). Pages 113-116 note the effects of \\"tattooing\\". Chapter 13 deals with poisoning. It is very important to have an accurate history of the events preceding death to provide a clue to the type of poisoning. If a poison does not work other means may be used. Chapter 19 tells of the popular fallacies about murder. \\"Murder will out\\"? The number of unsolved homicides is enormous. The murderer rarely returns to the scene of the crime. A gunshot wound through the heart does not always cause instant death. Photographs can lie depending on the lens, the height of the camera, the type of film, or the distance from the object. Can a fortune teller give valuable information? Snyder knows of no such cases. A dead man can tell a tale if there was care and diligence in the investigation and the laboratory tests.[This is from the 1950 edition.]"},{"Title":"Homicide investigation;: Practical information for coroners, police officers, and other investigators,","review":"very easy to understand for the least experienced investigator. well worth the time."},{"Title":"The Midnight Dancers","review":"Anne Maybury's &quot;The Midnight Dancers&quot; is a romantic suspense story that takes place in the exotic lushness of Bou Hammagan, North Africa.

He even put copies of pro formas for some of the incoterms!Considering the fact that this book is more than half the price of the ICC book and tailored to Americans, I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Incoterms for Americans: Simplifies and answers questions about incoterms for U.S. foreign traders","review":"Frank Reynolds has produced a comprehensive interpretation of the global language of international trade in a format that is easily understandable by Americans involved in international commerce. First published in 1936 by the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), Incoterms 2000 are the latest revised set of 13 international commercial terms recognized as the standard trade terms of international business.Used by importers/exporters, they define the roles, responsibilities and obligations of buyers/sellers in transactions involving the international movements of goods and help to eliminate misunderstandings as to the term of trade by which a particular transaction is being conducted. They help define the point at which the responsibilities, risks and obligations of the seller end and begin for the buyer and the required documents that must be generated for official and commercial purposes.As some of the Incoterms, when defined, may be in conflict with similar terms of sale (such as EX Works, FOB) as used for domestic business and found in the official United States legal code - the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), the author thoroughly explains the difference and highlights the adjustments needed when considering similar Incoterms for international transactions.The book clearly describes the meaning of each Incoterm, explains the buyer-seller responsibilities under each term and illustrates what a typical pro-forma invoice would reflect on a proposed export transaction. With each Incoterm described, it also offers an American perspective on best practices and recommendations from the author's numerous years of trade experience and his enviable position as the US delegate on the ICC drafting committee that revised the terms that resulted in Incoterms 2000.Of particular interest especially to inexperienced American exporters, the author offers some very important caveats covering such areas as port customs, insurance considerations, potential confusions in regards to the difference between shipment and delivery terms, the use of appropriate terms that best fit particular transactions, compliance with US Export Control and Incoterm limitations. Although published in 1999, this edition is still up-to-date as the subject matter it addresses is still current as of the date of this review in 2007. Readers may, however, be mindful that the reference made in the publication to the Uniform Customs and Practices for Documentary Credit (UCP500) - the rules that govern letters of credit transactions - will be replaced by a revised set of rules (UCP600) on July 1, 2007.Since the new UCP600 rules no longer provide for 'revocable' credits, it will no longer be necessary to stipulate in the payment term section of the pro-forma invoice that the letter of credit should be 'irrevocable' as reflected in those relevant sections in Incoterms for Americans. A minor editorial detail of omitting the currency in which costs are reflected in pro-forma invoices on pages 103, 104 and 110 should be French Francs, US Dollars and US Dollars respectively. The author would agree that such seemingly insignificant details of omission would create a discrepancy, delaying payment, in an invoice presented to a nominated bank for a letter of credit transaction.As one with over 25 years of foreign trade experience, I would highly recommend this well written volume as a desk reference guide for any American foreign trader who desires a working knowledge, understanding and application of Incoterms 2000."},{"Title":"Incoterms for Americans: Simplifies and answers questions about incoterms for U.S. foreign traders","review":"Mr Reynolds provides basic information in an overrated book.

The reader grasps, \\"These authors were people who wrote for people...and are not some twisted combination of cave man/Victorian Era make believe people those in the year of 2005 have them up to be.\\" The Novellino readers and Canterbury Tale readers will do fantastic with \\"Facets Of A Princess\\" because they've already caught on that the people of the past were real people as we know people to be.What a fine book!
